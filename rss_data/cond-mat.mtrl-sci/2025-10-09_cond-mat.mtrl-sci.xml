      <title>A Wigner Matrix Based Convolution Algorithm For Matrix Elements in the LCAO Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method uses a small basis set in exchange for expensive matrix element calculations. The most efficient approximation for the matrix element calculations is the two-center approximation (2CA) in tight binding (TB). In the 2CA, a variety of matrix elements are neglected with only "two-center integrals" (2CI) remaining. The 2CI are calculated efficiently by rotating to symmetrical coordinates where the integral is parameterized. This makes TB fast in exchange for diminished transferability. An ideal electronic structure method has both the efficiency of TB and the transferability of ab-initio methods. In this work, I expand the full crystal potential into multipoles where the resulting matrix elements are transformed into the form of 2CI between high angular momentum functions. The usual Slater-Koster formulae for TB are limited to $l\leq3$; to enable efficient evaluation of the full crystal potential 2CI, I derive a Wigner matrix based convolution algorithm (WMCA) that works for arbitrary angular momentum. Given a suitable method for generating a local ab-initio Kohn-Sham potential, the algorithm for calculating matrix elements is applicable to fully ab-initio LCAO methods (this is the subject of forthcoming work). In this paper, I apply the WMCA to silicon using a model crystal potential.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Direct Air Capture through Potassium Carbonate Doping of Activated Carbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct air capture of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) is one of the most promising strategies to mitigate rising atmospheric CO$_2$ levels. Among various techniques, adsorption using porous materials is a viable method for extracting CO$_2$ from air, even under humid conditions. However, identifying optimal adsorbent materials remains a significant challenge. Moreover, the performance of existing materials can be improved by doping with active species that boost gas capture, a relatively unexplored field. In this study, we perform atomistic simulations to investigate the adsorption, structural, and energetic properties of CO$_2$ and water in realistic models of activated carbons. We first analyze the impact of explicitly considering surfaces containing functional groups, which aims to imitate the chemical environment of experimental samples. Additionally, we introduce potassium carbonate within the pores of the adsorbent to evaluate its effect on CO$_2$ and water adsorption. Our results demonstrate that both functional groups and potassium carbonate enhance adsorption, primarily by shifting the adsorption onset pressures to lower values. Specifically, potassium carbonate clusters act as extra adsorption sites for CO$_2$ and water, facilitating the nucleation of water molecules and promoting the formation of a hydrogen bond network within the activated carbon pores.</description>

      <title>Multihyperuniform Particle Composites Inspired by Avian Photoreceptor Patterns for Optical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperuniform materials, characterized by anomalously suppressed long-wavelength density fluctuations, exhibit unique optical and photonic properties distinct from both crystalline and random media. While most prior studies have focused on single-species systems, we investigate the broader class of \textit{multihyperuniform} systems inspired by biological photoreceptor mosaics. Using particle-based models with varying species number, size ratios, and interaction competition, we demonstrate that multispecies mixtures can achieve robust and stealthy hyperuniform configurations, even in highly disordered states. We further show how these configurations can be mapped to multifunctional composites with tailored optical responses, including isotropic structural coloration, enhanced absorption, and engineered dielectric properties that facilitate transmission while suppressing scattering. Our results highlight multihyperuniformity as a generalizable design principle for multifunctional disordered photonic materials, opening avenues for robust, tunable, and scalable optical applications.</description>

      <title>Emergence of multiple relaxation processes during low to high density transition in Au49Cu26.9Si16.3Ag5.5Pd2.3 metallic glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of multiple amorphous states, or polyamorphism, remains one of the most debated phenomena in disordered matter, particularly regarding its microscopic origin and impact on glassy dynamics. Profiting of the enhanced data quality provided by brilliant synchrotrons, we combined high pressure X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction to investigate the atomic dynamics-structure relationship in a Au49Cu26.9Si16.3Ag5.5Pd2.3 metallic glass at room temperature. We identify a structural and dynamical crossover near 3 GPa, marked by avalanches-like massive atomic rearrangements that promote the system toward increasingly compact atomic cluster connections. This crossover superimposes to a pressure-induced acceleration of the atomic motion recently reported, and signals the onset of a transitional state, potentially linked to the nucleation of a new phase within the glass, characterized by the coexistence of two amorphous states with distinct relaxation processes. These results provide evidence for a sluggish, continuous polyamorphic transformation, even in absence of marked structural discontinuities.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Ultrasonically Atomized Al-Based Alloy Powders for Tunable Thermal Reactivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reactive aluminum (Al) alloy powders are promising for advanced manufacturing, joining, and energetic applications, yet scalable routes that couple controlled reactivity with safe handling remain limited. While nanoscale Al powders ignite readily, their agglomeration, handling, and safety limit broad deployment. Here, we manufacture micron-sized Al-based powders produced by ultrasonic atomization (UA), targeting a balance of enhanced reactivity and process robustness. Binary systems (AlCu, AlSi, AlMg) and pure Al were synthesized, and their morphology, phases present, thermal stability, and oxidation behavior were characterized using XRD, SEM, and DTA/TGA in an Ar/O2 environment. We show that alloy selection and UA-controlled microstructure can modify the native Al2O3 passivation, alter oxidation pathways, and shift thermal onsets/exotherms. The results establish a manufacturing-forward framework for designing micron-sized powders with tunable ignition/oxidation behavior.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic insights into hydrogen reduction of multicomponent oxides via in-situ high-energy X-ray diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-reduction of multicomponent oxides with hydrogen provides a carbon-neutral approach toward sustainable alloy design. Herein, we investigate the hydrogen-based direct reduction, using in-situ high-energy X-ray diffraction of two precursor variants: mechanically mixed powders and pre-sintered oxide mixtures, targeting an equiatomic CoFeMnNi alloy. We find distinct reduction pathways and microstructure evolution depending on initial precursors. Mixed powders at 700 {\deg}C are reduced to body-centered-cubic, face-centered-cubic, and MnO phases via halite, spinel, and Mn3O4 intermediates, whereas the pre-sintered material directly transforms into a mixture of metallic and oxide phases. The post-reduction microstructures are also different: mixed oxides show loosely packed morphology, whereas pre-sintered material reveals metallic nanoparticles supported on nanoporous MnO. The formation of nanoporous metallic networks is strongly governed by the precursor state, highlighting the role of initial precursors on the final microstructure. This precursor design strategy offers a single-step route to nanoporous alloys with potential applications in catalysis and energy technologies.</description>

      <title>Local Order Average-Atom Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extension to the effective average-atom (AA) interatomic potential (IP) that accounts for local ordering effects is derived. While the AA approach is only valid for random alloys, the new local-order average-atom (LOAA) IP accounts for short-range order within a material by utilizing information from partial radial distribution functions. Simulations with a LOAA potential require smaller system sizes to achieve statistically converged results and therefore can be used to model complex materials where short-range order effects are important, such as high-entropy alloys, at a fraction of the computational cost of standard IPs. The method is validated for a two-dimensional (2D) binary hexagonal crystal with Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions, and for three-dimensional (3D) Fe$_{(1-x)/2}$Ni$_{(1-x)/2}$Cr$_x$ and Ni$_{0.67}$Al$_{0.33}$ alloys modeled via embedded-atom method (EAM) potentials. For the 2D crystal we obtain a local ordering phase diagram in terms of the LJ parameters and demonstrate that in all cases the LOAA formulation obtains elastic properties that match the true-species case using standard IPs. The 3D alloy examples further demonstrate the ability of this method to accurately capture other material properties and phase transformations.</description>

      <title>Tunable magnon-phonon cavity via structural phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong coupling between two quantized excitations in a cavity has the potential to lead to hybridized states that bestow novel quantum phenomena as required for emerging applications. In particular, tunable hybrid magnon-phonon cavities with precise control knobs are in pressing demand for developing quantum functionalities in solid-state platforms. Here, using a combination of synthesis and characterization tools, we present an epitaxial La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrTiO3 (LSMO/STO) heterostructure that manifests strong couplings between the Kittel magnon and the transverse acoustic phonon. Remarkably, leveraging the magnetoelastic interaction at the epitaxial interface, we demonstrate that when the STO substrate undergoes a cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition at ~105 K, the Kittel magnon of the LSMO thin film splits into three bands due to anisotropic structural strains along the [100], [010], and [001] crystalline axes, hence, resulting in an array of non-degenerate, hybridized magnon-phonon modes. Moreover, we develop an analytical model that can reproduce the interfacial strain-induced magnon splitting and the strength of magnon-phonon coupling. Our work highlights structural phase transitions as a sensitive trigger for generating multistate magnon-phonon hybridization in high-quality magnetoelastic oxide heterostructures - a new route for implementing strain-mediated hybrid magnonics in phononic systems with potential applications in coherent energy and signal transduction.</description>

      <title>High temperature Neel skyrmions in simple ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide variety of chiral non-collinear spin textures have been discovered and have unique properties that make them highly interesting for technological applications. However, many of these are found in complex materials and only in a narrow window of temperature. Here, we show the formation of Neel-type skyrmions in thin layers of simple ferromagnetic alloys, namely Co-Al and Co-Ni-Al, over a wide range of temperature up to 770 K, by imposing a vertical strain gradient via epitaxy with an Ir-Al underlayer. The Neel skyrmions are directly observed using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy in freestanding membranes at high temperatures and the strain gradient is directly measured from x-ray diffraction anomalous peak profiles. Our concept allows simple centrosymmetric ferromagnets with high magnetic ordering temperatures to exhibit hot skyrmions, thereby, bringing closer skyrmionic electronics.</description>

      <title>Real-Space Quantification of Exciton Localization in Acene Crystals Using Wannier Function Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Wannier function decomposition of excitons (WFDX) method to quantify exciton localization in solids within the ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation framework. By decomposing each Bloch exciton wavefunction into products of single-particle electron and hole maximally localized Wannier functions, this real-space approach provides well-defined orbital- and spatial- resolved measures of both Frenkel and charge-transfer excitons at low computational cost. We apply WFDX to excitons in acene crystals, quantifying how the number of rings, the exciton spin state, and the center-of-mass momntum affect spatial localization. Additionally, we show how this real-space representation reflects structural nonsymmorphic symmetries that are hidden in standard reciprocal-space descriptions. We demonstrate how the WFDX framework can be used to efficiently interpolate exciton expansion coefficients in reciprocal-space and outline how it may facilitate evaluation of observables involving position operators, highlighting its potential as a general tool for both analyzing and computing excitonic properties in solids.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Total of twelve samples in the U-La-O system with the compositions U1-yLayO2+x (y=0.025, 0.05, 0.1, up to 0.3) were synthesized by gel combustion synthesis method followed by appropriate heat treatment in air atmosphere. Comprehensive experimental analysis using various techniques like X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry and oxygen to uranium ratio (O/U) are used to establish the phase relation in U1-yLayO2+x system at 1173 K and 1523 K heated in air. A novel meta-stable phase with stoichiometry La3U11O36 having mixed-valent uranium is reported for the first time in U-La-O system. The thermal property of this new phase is reported along with the updated phase relations at and above 1173 K temperature for the compositions U1-yLayO2+x (y &lt; 0.3). Further, formation and stability of this new Ln3U11O36 phase was also investigated with smaller cations like Nd3+, Sm3+, Gd3+ and the smallest Y3+ cation.</description>

      <title>Modular Reactor for In Situ X-ray Scattering, Spectroscopy, and ATR-IR Studies of Solvothermal Nanoparticle Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the chemical processes that occur during the solvothermal synthesis of functional nanomaterials is essential for their rational design and optimization for specific applications. However, these processes remain poorly understood, primarily due to the limitations of conventional ex situ characterization techniques and the technical challenges associated with in situ studies, particularly the design and implementation of suitable reactors. Here, we present a versatile cell suitable for in situ X-ray scattering, X-ray spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy studies performed during solvothermal synthesis under autoclave-like, inert conditions. The reactor enables precise control of the temperature between -20 C and 200 C, pressures up to 8 bar, magnetic stirring, and injection of gas or liquids. The reactor's capabilities are demonstrated by comprehensively studying the solvothermal synthesis of magnetite nanoparticles from iron acetylacetonate in benzyl alcohol through in situ X-ray scattering and spectroscopy, and ATR-IR spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Ground state magnetic structure of Mn3Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use spherical neutron polarimetry to determine the ground state magnetic structure of Mn3Sn. We find that Mn3Sn adopts an inverse triangular structure with spins parallel to &lt;100&gt; (Type III) rather than spins parallel to &lt;110&gt; (Type IV). Density functional theory calculations reveal no energy difference between these two structures, suggesting that the selection is caused by subtle effects such as sixth-order anisotropy. Partial control of the magnetic domain population through a moderate magnetic field is key to distinguish between the two models. We find that three of the six domains are approximately equally populated, while the others have negligible population. Upon entering the low temperature incommensurate phase, the domain structure is lost. The domains decouple from the magnetic field, and can therefore not be controlled by any known method.</description>

      <title>Computational Study on the Physical Properties and Hydrogen Storage Capability of Insulating LaMg2H7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LaMg2H7 is a ternary wide band gap semiconductor that is a member of the hydride family. The bulk physical characteristics of the LaMg2H7 compound, including its structural, electronic band structure, elastic, thermal, and optical characteristics, have been examined in this work utilizing density functional theory (DFT). The elastic constants indicate that {\rm LaMg}_2H_7 is mechanically stable, brittle in nature, and anisotropic. This studied compound possesses a moderate level of hardness. The band structure and density of states have been examined to have a better understanding of its electronic behavior. The intrinsic carrier concentrations and effective masses have been determined using the band structure. The gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity (Cwt%) has been calculated, indicating that this compound is suitable for hydrogen storage applications. This compound is dynamically stable, as confirmed by its phonon dispersion. Here, the details of this wide-band-gap semiconductor's reflectivity, absorption coefficient, refractive index, dielectric function, optical conductivity, and loss function are investigated. The substance is a moderate reflector of ultraviolet (UV) light. The absorption and conductivity support the gap in the band structure. The thermodynamic properties, such as bulk modulus, internal energy, specific heat capacity, entropy, thermal expansion coefficient, and Debye temperature, have been explored at varying temperatures and pressures. {\rm LaMg}_2H_7 has a moderate level of melting temperature with higher lattice thermal conductivity. The value of the thermal expansion coefficient and minimum thermal conductivity is highly recommended for use as a thermal barrier coating (TBC).</description>

      <title>Uncovering domain morphology in an unconventional magnet with scanning diamond quantum magnetometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconventional magnetic materials including non-collinear antiferromagnets, p-wave magnets and altermagnets, are an emerging frontier for quantum spintronics and hybrid quantum devices. Critical to the application of these materials is control over the magnetic domain state, as their unique, symmetry-driven properties vanish in a multi-domain limit. However, the mechanisms governing domain formation in materials with compensated local moments remain poorly understood. In this work, we examine the ferrimagnetic to non-collinear antiferromagnetic phase transition of Mn3NiN using scanning nitrogen-vacancy centre magnetometry. We provide nanoscale mapping of the magnetic domain evolution on cooling and correlate the local stray fields with global magnetometry and anomalous Hall effect measurements. We observe the formation of a disordered, dendritic domain structure whose roughness is quantified using its fractal dimension. The fractal dimension steadily increases on cooling through the transition, saturating at a value of ~ 1.55 in the non-collinear phase, but the domain area distribution does not show any significant changes. We show this behaviour cannot be explained by the balance of demagnetisation energy and domain wall energy, and conclude elastic contributions and defects are a critical factor to explain the domain size.</description>

      <title>Microstructure sensitive recurrent neural network surrogate model of crystal plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of next-generation structural materials for harsh environments requires rapid assessment of mechanical performance and its dependence on microstructure. While full-field crystal plasticity (CP) models provide detailed insights, the high computational cost limits their use with uncertainty quantification workflows and in component-scale simulation. Surrogate models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have shown promise in reproducing history-dependent mechanical behaviour but are applied to models with either fixed microstructure or representative volume elements. Here, we develop a microstructure sensitive RNN surrogate that predicts homogenised stress responses directly from three-dimensional grain structures and arbitrary deformation histories. The architecture employs a gated recurrent unit (GRU) with mappings from microstructure to both the initial hidden state and sequence inputs, allowing the model to capture path dependence and microstructure variability. Training data comprised of over 300,000 CP simulations generated using combinations of randomly generated microstructures and loading paths. The model was found to reproduce CP predictions for both in-distribution validation data and unseen deformation modes, with errors of 2 MPa to 3 MPa. Out-of-distribution microstructures were more difficult to predict, emphasising the need for representative training data with, for example, heavily textured microstructures. Embedding the model into a multiscale framework demonstrates its ability to replace conventional constitutive updates, reducing computational cost while preserving key features of the stress distribution. These results establish microstructure-informed RNN surrogates as a promising alternative to direct CP simulations, offering a pathway toward rapid multiscale modelling and uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>SiC-TGAP: A machine learning interatomic potential for radiation damage simulations in 3C-SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) has long been a subject of study for its application in harsh environments. Existing empirical interatomic potentials for 3C-SiC show significant discrepancies in predicting the properties that are crucial in describing the evolution of defects generated in collision cascades. We present a Gaussian approximation potential model for 3C-SiC (TGAP) trained by two-body and the turboSOAP many-body descriptors. The dataset covers crystalline, liquid and amorphous phases. To accurately capture defect dynamics, twenty-one defect types have been included in the dataset. TGAP captures the experimentally observed decomposition of carbon atoms in the liquid phase at atmospheric pressure, while also accurately reproducing the radial distribution function of the high-temperature homogeneous liquid phase across a range of densities. Moreover, it predicts the melting point in very good agreement with density functional theory and experiments. The potential is equipped with the Nordlund-Lehtola-Hobler repulsive potential to capture the high repulsion of recoils in the collision cascades. TGAP provides an accurate tool for atomistic simulation of radiation damage in cubic SiC.</description>

      <title>Anomalous strain-dependent thermal conductivity in superelastic screw-dislocated graphites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of strain-stable, or even strain-enhanced thermal transport materials is critical for stable operation of high-performance electronic devices. However, most nanomaterials suffer from strain-induced degradation, with even minor tensile strains markedly reducing thermal conductivity. Here, we demonstrate that screw-dislocated graphites (SDGs), recently identified as topological semimetals, display an unusual increase in cross-plane thermal conductivity under both tensile and compressive strains, revealed by high-accuracy machine-learning-potential-driven non-equilibrium molecular dynamics. Notably, SDGs exhibit over 100% enhancement under tensile strains up to 80% along the dislocation axis, arising from strain-induced increase in dislocation interface tilt angle that elongates the effective heat transfer paths. Their thermal conductivity surpasses multilayer graphene by an order of magnitude. An analytical model is further derived linking thermal conductivity to dislocation number and strain, offering a predictive framework for designing strain-tunable screwdislocated structures. These findings highlight SDGs as a promising platform for high-performance electronic and wearable devices with tunable thermal properties.</description>

      <title>Understanding Polaronic Transport in Anatase TiO2 Films by Combining Precise Synthesis and First-Principles Many-Body Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In complex oxides, charge carriers often couple strongly with lattice vibrations to form polarons-entangled electron-phonon quasiparticles whose transport properties remain difficult to characterize. Experimental access to intrinsic polaronic transport requires ultraclean samples, while theoretical descriptions demand methods beyond low-order perturbation theory. Here, we combine the growth of high-quality oxygen-vacancy-doped anatase TiO2 films by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) with a first-principles electron-phonon diagrammatic Monte Carlo (FEP-DMC) framework recently developed for accurate polaron predictions. Our films exhibit record-high electron mobility for anatase TiO2, in excellent agreement with FEP-DMC calculations conducted prior to experiment, which predict a room-temperature mobility of 45 +/- 15 cm2V-1s-1 and a mobility-temperature scaling of mobility proportional to T^(-1.9 +/- 0.077). Microscopic analysis using scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals the role of oxygen vacancies in modulating transport at lower temperatures. FEP-DMC further provides quantitative insight into polaron formation energy, phonon cloud distribution, lattice distortion around the polaron, and the polaronic contribution to mobility. Together, these results establish a predictive theory-experiment workflow to characterize polarons and provide a microscopic understanding of large-polaron transport in anatase TiO2, with broader implications for complex oxides and other polaronic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanical performance of fiber-reinforced concrete is critically dependent on the orientation and concentration of its reinforcing fibers. This paper presents a non-destructive method for diagnosing fiber parameters in large planar specimens. The proposed technique utilizes an electromagnetic measurement system using electrical coils with commercial LCR meters, but also a novel custom-made meter suitable for factory environments, offering a practical solution for quality control in prefabrication of high-performance structural elements. This study details the theoretical background, experimental setup and methodology, and provides an evaluation of the diagnostic system's effectiveness and accuracy. The results demonstrate a strong correlation between the electromagnetic measurements and the actual fiber parameters, confirming the method's reliability.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Molecular Single-Photon Emitters: A Materials-Modelling Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfacing light with quantum systems is an integral part of quantum technology, with the most essential building block being single-photon emitters. Although various platforms exist, each with its individual strengths, molecular emitters boast a unique advantage -- namely the flexibility to tailor their design to fit the requirements of a specific task. However, the characteristics of the vast space of possible molecular configurations are challenging to understand and explore. Here, we present a theoretical and computational framework to initiate exploration of this vast potential by integrating database analysis with microscopic predictions. Using a model system of dibenzoterrylene in an anthracene host as benchmark, our approach identifies promising new candidates, among them a chiral molecular emitter. Future extensions of our approach integrated with machine learning routines hold the promise of ultimately unlocking the full potential of molecular quantum light-matter interfaces.</description>

      <title>Kekul\'e Superconductivity in Twisted Magic Angle Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiments which report Kekul\'e ordering in the twisted graphene family, we develop a microscopic theory of superconductivity, specifically for the bi-layer case. This involves an intra-valley, finite-momentum pair-density wave (PDW) which naturally incorporates a Kekul\'e distortion into the superconducting phase. The PDW state displays three central features: (i) it spontaneously breaks $C_3$ rotational symmetry, producing nematic order, and (ii) it possesses a large gap-to-critical-temperature ratio. Moreover, (iii) it yields a quasi-particle density of states having a V-like shape (with a finite value at zero energy) which transitions to a fully gapped, U-shaped spectrum with increasing attraction. These characteristics, including consistency with an allowed Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, align with key experimental signatures in the twisted graphene family where the U-V transition is observed in the tri-layer case. We find the paired state with a modest interaction strength is near to a BEC-like regime, as appears consistent with the observed extremely short coherence lengths. Together, these results establish a microscopic intra-valley Kekul\'e PDW state as an essential ingredient towards understanding unconventional superconductivity in twisted graphene.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic ultrafast edge photocurrent dynamics in WTe$_2$ driven by broken crystal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directional photocurrents in two-dimensional materials arise from broken crystal symmetry, offering pathways to high-speed, bias-free photodetection beyond conventional devices. Tungsten ditelluride (WTe$_2$), a type-II Weyl semimetal, exhibits robust symmetry-breaking-induced edge photocurrents from competing nonlinear optical and photothermoelectric (PTE) mechanisms, whose intrinsic dynamics have remained experimentally inaccessible. Here, we directly resolve sub-picosecond edge photocurrent dynamics in WTe$_2$ through ohmic contacts over temperatures from 300 K to 4 K. We demonstrate ultrafast optical-to-electrical conversion with a 3 dB bandwidth of $\sim$250 GHz and reveal picosecond-timescale switching of the net photocurrent direction below 150 K, linked to a Lifshitz transition. This transient bipolar response arises from non-equilibrium Seebeck effects due to asymmetric cooling of hot electrons and holes. These findings reveal previously hidden ultrafast dynamics in symmetry-engineered materials, offering new strategies to disentangle competing photocurrent mechanisms and enabling the development of self-powered, ultrafast optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle Description of Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy for SrCuO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SrCuO2 has long been considered a near-archetypal realization of a quasi one dimensional (1D) system of interacting electrons with short-range interactions. Within this framework, experimental observations - interpreted through the lens of the 1D Hubbard model-suggest that electron and hole excitations decay into two types of (unphysical) collective bosonic modes: spinons, which carry the spin degree of freedom, and holons, which carry the charge degree of freedom. This model, known as spin-charge separation, is most directly evidenced by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), where a photo-induced hole decays into a continuum of these excitations. Here we present an alternative perspective grounded in first-principles, self-consistent, and parameter-free many-body perturbation theory. In this revised quasiparticle framework, ARPES can be understood as a one-body effect arising from mild disorder in a long-range antiferromagnetic ground state. the emergence of the so-called spinon branch arises naturally from spin disorder, the anomalous line widths are accurately captured, and we provide a compelling explanation for the spectral weight observed at the non-magnetic zone boundary. This reinterpretation provides a unified explanation for key experimental signatures previously attributed to spin-charge separation, including features observed in optical conductivity. Additionally, we show that SrCuO2 exhibits a nontrivial interchain coupling that significantly influences both its one-particle and two-particle spectral functions. By comparing the spectral features of SrCuO2 with those of La2CuO4, we argue that SrCuO2 shares notable similarities with the two-dimensional cuprates - both being rooted in a common CuO4 plaquette-based molecular orbital framework.</description>

      <title>Electrical and thermal magnetotransport and the Wiedemann-Franz law in semimetals with electron-electron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the electrical and thermal transport properties and the violation of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law of two-carrier semimetals using exact treatments of the Boltzmann equation with the impurity and electron-electron scatterings in a magnetic field. For comparison, we also study those in the case of Baber scattering: a single-carrier system with an impurity scattering and phenomenological momentum-dissipative electron-electron scattering. In both systems, the longitudinal and transverse WF laws, $L = L_{\text{H}} = L_{0}= \pi^2k_B^2/3e^2$, hold at zero temperature, where the Lorenz ratio $L$ and the Hall Lorenz ratio $L_{\text{H}}$ are ratios of thermal conductivity $\kappa_{\mu\nu}$ to electrical conductivity $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ divided by temperature. However, the electron-electron scattering makes Lorenz ratios deviate from $L_{0}$ with increasing temperature. To describe the WF law in a magnetic field, we introduce another set of Lorenz ratios, $\widetilde{L}$ and $\widetilde{L}_{\text{H}}$, defined as the ratios of the resistivity and the Hall coefficient to their thermal counterparts. The WF laws for them, $\widetilde{L} = \widetilde{L}_{\text{H}} = L_{0}$, and their violation are helpful for the discussion of $L$ and $L_{\text{H}}$. For Baber scattering, our exact result shows $L_{\text{H}}/L_{0} \sim (L/L_{0})^2$ in a weak magnetic field. In semimetals, the violations of the WF laws are significant, reflecting the different temperature dependence between the electrical and thermal resistivities in a magnetic field. This is because the momentum conservation of the electron-electron scattering has a completely different effect on electrical and thermal magnetotransport. We sort out these behaviors using $\widetilde{L}$ and $\widetilde{L}_{\text{H}}$. We also provide a relaxation time approximation, which is useful for comparing theory and experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral properties, momentum dispersion, and broadening of bulk plasmonic excitations of 25 elemental metals are studied from first principles calculations in the random-phase approximation. Spectral band structures are constructed from the resulting momentum- and frequency-dependent inverse dielectric function. We develop an effective analytical representation of the main collective excitations in the dielectric response, by extending our earlier model based on multipole-Pad\'e approximants (MPA) to incorporate both momentum and frequency dependence. With this tool, we identify plasmonic quasiparticle dispersions exhibiting complex features, including non-parabolic energy and intensity dispersions, discontinuities due to anisotropy, and overlapping effects that lead to band crossings and anti-crossings. We also find good agreement between computed results and available experiments in the optical limit. The results for elemental metals establish a reference point that can guide both fundamental studies and practical applications in plasmonics and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>How Semilocal Are Semilocal Density Functional Approximations? -Tackling Self-Interaction Error in One-Electron Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-interaction error (SIE), arising from the imperfect cancellation of the spurious classical Coulomb interaction between an electron and itself, is a persistent challenge in modern density functional approximations. This issue is illustrated using the prototypical one-electron system $H_2^+$. While significant efforts have been made to eliminate SIE through the development of computationally expensive nonlocal density functionals, it is equally important to explore whether SIE can be mitigated within the framework of more efficient semilocal density functionals. In this study, we present a non-empirical meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) that incorporates the Laplacian of the electron density. Our results demonstrate that the meta-GGA significantly reduces SIE, yielding a binding energy curve for $H_2^+$ that matches the exact solution at equilibrium and improves across a broad range of bond lengths over those of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and strongly-constrained and appropriately-normed (SCAN) semilocal density functionals. This advancement paves the way for further development within the realm of semilocal approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exchange coupling parameters $J_{ij}$ within the Heisenberg model and its extensions are crucial for understanding magnetic behavior at the atomic level. Perturbative approaches based on the magnetic force theorem (MFT, often called the Liechtenstein method) are well established in the infinitesimal-rotation limit, yet the accuracy of such mappings for finite-angle spin fluctuations -- including slightly to moderately disordered spin configurations -- remains to be clarified. Here we evaluate $J_{ij}$ nonperturbatively for systems of both fundamental and practical interest, including perovskite SrMnO$_3$, neodymium-magnet compounds, and elemental 3$d$ transition metals, and compare the results with MFT-based calculations. The nonperturbative approach provides results that remain consistent for both small and large finite spin rotations, thereby complementing MFT-based methods by extending validated applicability beyond the infinitesimal-rotation limit. Further analysis shows that this consistency arises from explicitly incorporating finite-angle-induced changes in charge and spin densities -- effects that are neglected in perturbative mappings -- into the extracted $J_{ij}$. This provides a practical route to more quantitative spin models for the analysis and design of magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Amplitude Expansion Phase Field Crystal (APFC) Modeling based Efficient Dislocation Simulations using Fourier Pseudospectral Method</title>

Abstract: Crystalline defects critically influence material properties, necessitating accurate simulation methods. Existing approaches, from atomic-scale configurations to continuum elasticity, face inherent limitations in modeling dislocation-induced lattice deformation. The amplitude expansion of the phase field crystal (APFC) model bridges this gap with a mesoscopic description. This paper introduces a computationally efficient Fourier pseudospectral method for solving the APFC equations. The method exploits system periodicity and solution analyticity--the latter's rigorous proof remaining an open question, as discussed herein--to enable precise implementation of periodic boundary conditions. Numerical experiments on 2D triangular and 3D body-centered cubic lattices demonstrate that the method accurately reproduces the strain fields of edge dislocations, matching continuum theory predictions. These results confirm the APFC model's potential for capturing complex defect structures at the mesoscale, paving the way for simulating more intricate defect dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear phononics in Bi$_2$Te$_3$ nanoscale thin films: A theoretical approach</title>

Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations not only allow to predict the vibrational and optical properties of solids but also to understand and disentangle the mechanisms playing a key role in the generation of coherent optical phonons. Recent experiments performed on a Bi$_2$Te$_3$ nanofilm have shown that a THz pulse launches at least a coherent $A_{1g}^1$ phonon as the transient transmittance measured using an isotropic detection scheme displays oscillations with a frequency matching the frequency of the $A_{1g}^1$ mode measured in Raman experiments. Such an observation can be explained by invoking either a sum frequency process or cubic/quartic phonon-phonon couplings as considered for Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a parent compound of Bi$_2$Te$_3$. By resorting to group theory and calculating energy surfaces from first-principles, the main phonon-phonon couplings can be identified. Furthermore, a minimal model can be built to compute the dynamics of the Raman active modes coupled to the infrared active mode driven by the experimental THz pulse. Our model firmly establishes that cubic phonon-phonon interactions are relevant as the agreement between the computed and experimental transmittance is noteworthy.</description>

      <title>Fe contribution to the magnetic anisotropy of $L{1_0}$-ordered FePt thin films studied by angle-dependent x-ray magnetic circular dichroism</title>

Abstract: Among magnetic thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), $L1_0$-ordered FePt has attracted significant attention because of its exceptionally strong PMA. However, the microscopic origin of its strong PMA has not been elucidated experimentally. We have investigated the contribution of the Fe $3d$ electrons to its magnetic anisotropy energy by angle-dependent x-ray magnetic circular dichroism at the Fe $L_{2,3}$ edge. By this technique, one can deduce the magnetic dipole moment $m_\text{T}$, which represents the anisotropic spatial distribution of spin-polarized electrons, and the orbital moment anisotropy (OMA) of Fe $3d$ electrons. Detected finite $m_\text{T}$ indicates that the spin-polarized Fe $3d$ electrons are distributed preferentially in the out-of-plane direction of the films. This $m_\text{T}$ of Fe overwhelms the positive contribution of OMA to PMA, and reduces the PMA of $L1_0$-ordered FePt thin films, consistent with a previous first-principles calculation. The present result implies that a large positive contribution of the non-magnetic element Pt rather than Fe governs the PMA of $L1_0$-ordered FePt thin films.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Lithium-Ion Transport Mechanism in Li2ZrCl6 Solid-State Electrolyte via Deep Learning-Accelerated Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>

Abstract: Lithium zirconium chlorides (LZCs) present a promising class of cost-effective solid electrolyte for next-generation all-solid-state batteries. The unique crystal structure of LZCs plays a crucial role in facilitating lithium-ion mobility, which further affects its electrochemical performance. To understand the underlying mechanism governing ion transport, we employed deep learning-accelerated molecular dynamics simulation on Li2ZrCl6 (trigonal {\alpha}- and monoclinic \b{eta}-LZC), focusing specifically on the zirconium coordination environment. Our results reveal that disordered {\alpha}-LZC exhibits the highest ionic conductivity, while \b{eta}-LZC demonstrates significantly lower conductivity, closely aligning with experimental findings. The study confirms that across all phases, lithium migration proceeds via site-to-site hopping mechanism, where variations in site residence times critically impact the overall ionic conductivity. In {\alpha}-LZCs, lithium ions prefer to anisotropically diffuse across interlayers as the result of lower energy barrier, driven primarily by collective diffusion. In contrast, lithium ions in \b{eta}-LZC primarily isotropically diffuse within intralayer, hindered by higher energy barriers and determined by individual diffusion. The variation in ZrCl62- octahedral unit softening, induced by the specific layered arrangement of zirconium atoms, emerges as a critical determinant of the energy barriers across the LZC phases. These atomic-scale insights into the transport processes provide valuable guidance for the rational design and optimization of LZCs-based electrolytes, accelerating their practical application in advanced energy storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the physical attributes of CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 compounds: A first-principles study for next-generation photovoltaics</title>

Abstract: The electronic and optical properties of CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 were studied using first-principles DFT calculations. Band gaps were calculated using the GGA-PBESol functional. Both materials show promise for photovoltaic applications because of their large, near-unity absorption efficiencies (10^4 cm^-1) in the visible region. They exhibit low exciton binding energies (18.85-26.81 meV), large Bohr radii (23-34.3 Angstrom), and moderate exciton temperatures (218-311 K), which are favorable for photovoltaic applications. Their performance as solar cells was simulated using the SCAPS-1D tool for thin-film devices with Pt/CdS/CdGa2Te4/Cu2O/Ti and Pt/CdS/ZnGa2Te4/Cu2O/Ti structures. We investigated the effects of layer thickness, donor and acceptor concentrations (shallow donors/acceptors), and defect density on device performance. The ideal absorber thickness for XGa2Te4 (X = Cd, Zn) was found to be 1000-1800 nm, and the CdS buffer layer around 150 nm. To obtain an efficiency above 20%, the defect density in the CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 absorber layers should be kept below 1.772 x 10^13 cm^-3. The best simulations show efficiencies of 18.46% and 17.35% for CdGa2Te4- and ZnGa2Te4-based solar cells, respectively.</description>

      <title>Chirality-induced selectivity of angular momentum by orbital Edelstein effect in carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising materials exhibiting exceptional strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal properties, making them promising for various technologies. Besides achiral configurations with a zigzag or armchair edge, there exist chiral CNTs with a broken inversion symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that chiral CNTs exhibit chirality-induced orbital selectivity (CIOS), which is caused by the orbital Edelstein effect and could be detected as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). We find that the orbital Edelstein susceptibility is an odd function of the chirality angle of the nanotube and is proportional to its radius. For metallic CNTs close to the Fermi level, the orbital Edelstein susceptibility increases quadratically with energy. This makes the CISS and CIOS of metallic chiral nanotubes conveniently tunable by doping or applying a gate voltage, which allows for the generation of spin- and orbital-polarized currents. The possibility of generating large torques makes chiral CNTs interesting candidates for technological applications in spin-orbitronics and quantum computing.</description>
