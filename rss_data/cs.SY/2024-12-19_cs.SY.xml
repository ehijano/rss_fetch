      <title>Alternative Channel Charting Techniques in Cellular Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the use of conventional angle of arrival (AoA) algorithms the Bartlett's algorithm, the Minimum Variance Distortion Response (MVDR or Capon) algorithm, and the Minimum Norm algorithm for estimating the AoA $\theta$ together with our previously introduced algorithms linear regression (LR), inverse of the root sum squares of channel coefficients (ISQ), as well as a novel use of the MUSIC algorithm for estimating the distance from the base station, $\rho$ in the context of channel charting. We carry out evaluations in terms of the visual quality of the channel charts, the dimensionality reduction performance measures trustworthiness (TW) and connectivity (CT), as well as the execution time of the algorithms. We find that although the Bartlett's algorithm, MVDR, and Minimum Norm algorithms have sufficiently close performance to techniques we studied earlier, the Minimum Norm algorithm has significantly higher computational complexity than the other two. Previously, we found that the use of the MUSIC algorithm for estimation of both $\theta$ and $\rho$ has a very high performance. In this paper, we investigated and quantified the performance of the Bartlett algorithm in its use for estimating both $\theta$ and $\rho$, similar to the our previously introduced technique of using MUSIC for estimating both.</description>

      <title>Phase Robustness Analysis for Structured Perturbations in MIMO LTI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of interconnected linear time-invariant systems using singular values and the small gain theorem has been studied for many decades. The methods of mu-analysis and synthesis has been extensively developed to provide robustness guarantees for a plant subject to structured perturbations, with components in the structured perturbation satisfying a bound on their largest singular value. Recent results on phase-based stability measures have led to a counterpart of the small gain theorem, known as the small phase theorem. To date these phase-based methods have only been used to provide stability robustness measures for unstructured perturbations. In this paper, we define a phase robustness metric for multivariable linear time-invariant systems in the presence of a structured perturbation. We demonstrate its relationship to a certain class of multiplier functions for integral quadratic constraints, and show that a upper bound can be calculated via a linear matrix inequality problem. When combined with robustness measures from the small gain theorem, the new methods are able provide less conservative robustness metrics than can be obtained via conventional mu-analysis methods.</description>

      <title>The networked input-output economic problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate an input-output economic model with multiple interactive economic systems. The model captures the multi-dimensional nature of the economic sectors or industries in each economic system, the interdependencies among industries within an economic system and across different economic systems, and the influence of demand. To determine the equilibrium price structure of the model, a matrix-weighted updating algorithm is proposed. We prove that the equilibrium price structure can be globally asymptotically achieved given that certain joint conditions on the matrix-weighted graph and the input-output matrices are satisfied. The theoretical results are then supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>PR-CARA: Proactive V2X Resource Allocation with Extended 1-Stage SCI and Deep Learning-based Sensing Matrix Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed resource allocation algorithms differ from centralized methods by relying on locally collected information for resource selection, leading to a low vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication quality of service (QoS) in high-traffic congestion. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a proactive received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based collision avoidance resource allocation (PR-CARA) algorithm. This algorithm features an extended 1-stage SCI system, which is a critical component that enables resource monitoring of adjacent vehicle user equipment (VUE). Monitored resources were then processed through a deep learning-based proactive RSSI estimator. The estimated proactive RSSI helps avoid resource selection, which leads to packet collisions, thereby significantly reducing the occurrence of this issue during resource allocation. The proposed algorithm is tested in a cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC)-based platoon driving scenario that requires ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed deep-learning-based proactive resource allocation algorithm, with the extended 1-stage SCI system, reduces packet collisions and improves the transmission signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), thereby significantly enhancing communication reliability compared to the benchmark resource allocation algorithm.</description>

      <title>Aggregative games with bilevel structures: Distributed algorithms and convergence analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of distributively searching the Stackelberg equilibria of aggregative games with bilevel structures is studied. Different from the traditional aggregative games, here the aggregation is determined by the minimizer of the objective function in the inner level, which depends on players' actions in the outer level. Moreover, the global objective function in the inner level is formed by the sum of some local bifunctions, each of which is strongly convex with respect to the second argument and is only available to a specific player. To handle this problem, first, we propose a second order gradient-based distributed algorithm, where the Hessain matrices associated with the objective functions in the inner level is involved. By the algorithm, players update their actions in the outer level while cooperatively minimizing the sum of the bifunctions in the inner level to estimate the aggregation by communicating with their neighbors via a connected graph. Under mild assumptions on the graph and cost functions, we prove that the actions of players and the estimate on the aggregation asymptotically converge to the Stackelberg equilibrium. Then, for the case where the Hessain matrices associated with the objective functions in the inner level are not available, we propose a first order gradient-based distributed algorithm, where a distributed two-point estimate strategy is developed to estimate the gradients of cost functions in the outer level. Under the same conditions, we prove that the convergence errors of players' actions and the estimate on the aggregation to the Stackelberg equilibrium are linear with respect to the estimate parameters. Finally, simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Achieving Dispatchability in Data Centers: Carbon and Cost-Aware Sizing of Energy Storage and Local Photovoltaic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data centers are large electricity consumers due to the high consumption needs of servers and their cooling systems. Given the current crypto-currency and artificial intelligence trends, the data center electricity demand is bound to grow significantly. With the electricity sector being responsible for a large share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it is important to lower the carbon footprint of data centers to meet GHG emissions targets set by international agreements. Moreover, uncontrolled integration of data centers in power distribution grids contributes to increasing the stochasticity of the power system demand, thus increasing the need for capacity reserves, which leads to economic and environmental inefficiencies in the power grid operation. This work provides a method to size a PhotoVoltaic (PV) system and an Energy Storage System (ESS) for an existing data center looking to reduce both its carbon footprint and demand stochasticity via dispatching. The proposed scenario-based optimization framework allows to size the ESS and the PV system to minimize the expected operational and capital costs, along with the carbon footprint of the data center complex. The life cycle assessment of the resources, as well as the dynamic carbon emissions of the upstream power distribution grid, are accounted for while computing the day-ahead planning of the data center aggregated demand and PV generation. Case studies in different Swiss cantons and regions of Germany emphasize the need for location-aware sizing processes since the obtained optimal solutions strongly depend on the local electricity carbon footprint, cost and on the local irradiance conditions. Some regions show potential in carbon footprint reduction, while other regions do not.</description>

      <title>Security and Privacy of Digital Twins for Advanced Manufacturing: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Industry 4.0, the digital twin is one of the emerging technologies, offering simulation abilities to predict, refine, and interpret conditions and operations, where it is crucial to emphasize a heightened concentration on the associated security and privacy risks. To be more specific, the adoption of digital twins in the manufacturing industry relies on integrating technologies like cyber-physical systems, the Industrial Internet of Things, virtualization, and advanced manufacturing. The interactions of these technologies give rise to numerous security and privacy vulnerabilities that remain inadequately explored. Towards that end, this paper analyzes the cybersecurity threats of digital twins for advanced manufacturing in the context of data collection, data sharing, machine learning and deep learning, and system-level security and privacy. We also provide several solutions to the threats in those four categories that can help establish more trust in digital twins.</description>

      <title>Generation of Large District Heating System Models Using Open-Source Data and Tools: An Exemplary Workflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: District heating (DH) systems play a pivotal role in decarbonizing the building sector's heat supply. While innovative low-exergy DH and cooling systems are increasingly adopted in new developments, the transformation of existing DH systems remains critical, as many still depend on fossil-based heating plants. Achieving a sustainable heat supply necessitates integrating renewable energy and waste heat sources into current DH systems and enhancing operational efficiency through measures such as reduced supply temperatures and advanced control algorithms. These improvements can reduce costs and CO2 emissions but may require infrastructure adaptations, including pipe replacements and building-level system adjustments.
  This paper introduces a workflow for generating DH models using publicly available data and open-source tools. Such models enable comprehensive analyses of existing DH systems, allowing for the evaluation of sustainable heat integration, operational improvements, and the testing of analytical tools, such as simulation and optimization models. The workflow, detailed in this study, combines general structural data with computational estimations to create digital representations of DH systems. These models facilitate scenario-based analyses, tool benchmarking, and the identification of necessary infrastructure adaptations.
  Two example DH models generated using the proposed workflow are presented, followed by a discussion of the methodology's applicability and limitations. This study demonstrates how leveraging open data and tools can advance the transformation of DH systems, supporting the transition to a sustainable heat supply infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Towards privacy-preserving cooperative control via encrypted distributed optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative control is crucial for the effective operation of dynamical multi-agent systems. Especially for distributed control schemes, it is essential to exchange data between the agents. This becomes a privacy threat if the data is sensitive. Encrypted control has shown the potential to address this risk and ensure confidentiality. However, existing approaches mainly focus on cloud-based control and distributed schemes are restrictive.
  In this paper, we present a novel privacy-preserving cooperative control scheme based on encrypted distributed optimization. More precisely, we focus on a secure distributed solution of a general consensus problem, which has manifold applications in cooperative control, by means of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). As a unique feature of our approach, we explicitly take into account the common situation that local decision variables contain copies of quantities associated with neighboring agents and ensure the neighbor's privacy. We show the effectiveness of our method based on a numerical case study dealing with the formation of mobile robots.</description>

      <title>Robust Optimal Safe and Stability Guaranteeing Reinforcement Learning Control for Quadcopter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have provided new data-driven ways of controller design to replace the traditional manual synthesis and certification approaches. Employing neural network (NN) as controllers however, presents its own challenge: that of certifying stability due to their inherent complex nonlinearity, and while NN controllers have demonstrated high performance in complex systems, they often lack formal stability guarantees. This issue is further accentuated for critical nonlinear applications such as of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), complicating their stability guarantees, whereas a lack of stability assurance raises the risk of critical damage or even complete failure under a loss of control. In this study, we improve a Robust, Optimal, Safe and Stability Guaranteed Training (ROSS-GT) method of [1] to design an NN controller for a quadcopter flight control. The approach ensures closed-loop system stability by finding a Lyapunov function, and providing a safe initial state domain that remains invariant under the control and guarantees stability to an equilibrium within it. Stability guaranteeing constraints are derived from the sector bound of the system nonlinearity and of its parameters and disturbance variations, in the form of a Lipschitz bound for a NN control. The control performance is further optimized by searching over the class of stability-guaranteeing controllers to minimize the reference tracking error and the control costs.</description>

      <title>Predictive Probability Density Mapping for Search and Rescue Using An Agent-Based Approach with Sparse Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the location where a lost person could be found is crucial for search and rescue operations with limited resources. To improve the precision and efficiency of these predictions, simulated agents can be created to emulate the behavior of the lost person. Within this study, we introduce an innovative agent-based model designed to replicate diverse psychological profiles of lost persons, allowing these agents to navigate real-world landscapes while making decisions autonomously without the need for location-specific training. The probability distribution map depicting the potential location of the lost person emerges through a combination of Monte Carlo simulations and mobility-time-based sampling. Validation of the model is achieved using real-world Search and Rescue data to train a Gaussian Process model. This allows generalization of the data to sample initial starting points for the agents during validation. Comparative analysis with historical data showcases promising outcomes relative to alternative methods. This work introduces a flexible agent that can be employed in search and rescue operations, offering adaptability across various geographical locations.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Predictive Monitoring and Control for Safe Human-Machine Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing trend toward AI systems interacting with humans to revolutionize a range of application domains such as healthcare and transportation. However, unsafe human-machine interaction can lead to catastrophic failures. We propose a novel approach that predicts future states by accounting for the uncertainty of human interaction, monitors whether predictions satisfy or violate safety requirements, and adapts control actions based on the predictive monitoring results. Specifically, we develop a new quantitative predictive monitor based on Signal Temporal Logic with Uncertainty (STL-U) to compute a robustness degree interval, which indicates the extent to which a sequence of uncertain predictions satisfies or violates an STL-U requirement. We also develop a new loss function to guide the uncertainty calibration of Bayesian deep learning and a new adaptive control method, both of which leverage STL-U quantitative predictive monitoring results. We apply the proposed approach to two case studies: Type 1 Diabetes management and semi-autonomous driving. Experiments show that the proposed approach improves safety and effectiveness in both case studies.</description>

      <title>Harvesting energy from turbulent winds with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) is an emerging technology designed to harness the power of high-altitude winds, offering a solution to several limitations of conventional wind turbines. AWE is based on flying devices (usually gliders or kites) that, tethered to a ground station and driven by the wind, convert its mechanical energy into electrical energy by means of a generator. Such systems are usually controlled by manoeuvering the kite so as to follow a predefined path prescribed by optimal control techniques, such as model-predictive control. These methods are strongly dependent on the specific model at use and difficult to generalize, especially in unpredictable conditions such as the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer. Our aim is to explore the possibility of replacing these techniques with an approach based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unlike traditional methods, RL does not require a predefined model, making it robust to variability and uncertainty. Our experimental results in complex simulated environments demonstrate that AWE agents trained with RL can effectively extract energy from turbulent flows, relying on minimal local information about the kite orientation and speed relative to the wind.</description>

Abstract: We consider finite Markov decision processes (MDPs) with convex constraints and known dynamics. In principle, this problem is amenable to off-the-shelf convex optimization solvers, but typically this approach suffers from poor scalability. In this work, we develop a first-order algorithm, based on the Douglas-Rachford splitting, that allows us to decompose the dynamics and constraints. Thanks to this decoupling, we can incorporate a wide variety of convex constraints. Our scheme consists of simple and easy-to-implement updates that alternate between solving a regularized MDP and a projection. The inherent presence of regularized updates ensures last-iterate convergence, numerical stability, and, contrary to existing approaches, does not require us to regularize the problem explicitly. If the constraints are not attainable, we exploit salient properties of the Douglas-Rachord algorithm to detect infeasibility and compute a policy that minimally violates the constraints. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on two benchmark problems and show that it compares favorably to competing approaches.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Newton Dynamics for Neural Networks: A Riemannian Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14031v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence of Gauss-Newton dynamics for training neural networks with smooth activation functions. In the underparameterized regime, the Gauss-Newton gradient flow induces a Riemannian gradient flow on a low-dimensional, smooth, embedded submanifold of the Euclidean output space. Using tools from Riemannian optimization, we prove \emph{last-iterate} convergence of the Riemannian gradient flow to the optimal in-class predictor at an \emph{exponential rate} that is independent of the conditioning of the Gram matrix, \emph{without} requiring explicit regularization. We further characterize the critical impacts of the neural network scaling factor and the initialization on the convergence behavior. In the overparameterized regime, we show that the Levenberg-Marquardt dynamics with an appropriately chosen damping factor yields robustness to ill-conditioned kernels, analogous to the underparameterized regime. These findings demonstrate the potential of Gauss-Newton methods for efficiently optimizing neural networks, particularly in ill-conditioned problems where kernel and Gram matrices have small singular values.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimization for Energy Management: A Coherent Variational Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantum-enhanced optimization approach for solving optimal power flow (OPF) by integrating the interior point method (IPM) with a coherent variational quantum linear solver (CVQLS). The objective is to explore the applicability of quantum computing to power systems optimization and address the associated challenges. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art quantum linear solvers - Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL), variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), and CVQLS - revealed that CVQLS is most suitable for OPF due to its stability with ill-conditioned matrices, such as the Hessian in IPM. To ensure high-quality solutions, prevent suboptimal convergence, and avoid the barren plateau problem, we propose a quantum circuit parameter initialization technique along with a method to guide the IPM along the central path. Moreover, we design an ansatz tailored for OPF, optimizing the expressibility and trainability of the quantum circuit to ensure efficient convergence and robustness in solving quantum OPF. Various optimizers are also tested for quantum circuit parameter optimization, and based on the comparative analysis, the best optimizer is selected. We evaluate our approaches on IEEE 3-, 5-, 118-, and 300-bus systems, demonstrating their effectiveness in providing reliable OPF solutions. Our resource comparison between the power flow and OPF matrices on quantum hardware highlights that OPF needs considerably more resources, making its implementation significantly more challenging than in previous studies. Although promising, the application of CVQLS is currently constrained by the limitations of existing quantum hardware, especially for larger power systems. To address this, we use a quantum noise simulator for testing on larger systems.</description>

      <title>Learning and Reconstructing Conflicts in O-RAN: A Graph Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment of third-party applications on the RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs) to provide Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) with different functionality. However, the operation of third-party applications in the Near Real-Time RIC (Near-RT RIC), known as xApps, can result in conflicting interactions. Each xApp can independently modify the same control parameters to achieve distinct outcomes, which has the potential to cause performance degradation and network instability. The current conflict detection and mitigation solutions in the literature assume that all conflicts are known a priori, which does not always hold due to complex and often hidden relationships between control parameters and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In this paper, we introduce a novel data-driven Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based method for reconstructing conflict graphs. Specifically, we leverage GraphSAGE, an inductive learning framework, to dynamically learn the hidden relationships between xApps, control parameters, and KPIs. Our experimental results validate our proposed method for reconstructing conflict graphs and identifying all types of conflicts in O-RAN.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Distributed MPC as a Function Approximator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05166v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) for linear systems with convex polytopic constraints. Existing work on RL has demonstrated the use of model predictive control (MPC) as a function approximator for the policy and value functions. The current paper is the first work to extend this idea to the multi-agent setting. We propose the use of a distributed MPC scheme as a function approximator, with a structure allowing for distributed learning and deployment. We then show that Q-learning updates can be performed distributively without introducing nonstationarity, by reconstructing a centralized learning update. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Semi-on-Demand Off-Peak Transit Services with Shared Autonomous Vehicles -- Service Planning, Simulation, and Analysis in Munich, Germany</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the implementation of semi-on-demand (SoD) hybrid-route services using Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) on existing transit lines. SoD services combine the cost efficiency of fixed-route buses with the flexibility of on-demand services. SAVs first serve all scheduled fixed-route stops, then drop off and pick up passengers in the pre-determined flexible-route portion, and return to the fixed route. This study addresses four key questions: optimal fleet and vehicle sizes for peak-hour fixed-route services with SAVs and during transition (from drivers to autonomous vehicles), optimal off-peak SoD service planning, and suitable use cases. The methodology combines analytical modeling for service planning with agent-based simulation for operational analysis. We examine ten bus routes in Munich, Germany, considering full SAV and transition scenarios with varying proportions of drivers. Our findings demonstrate that the lower operating costs of SAVs improve service quality through increased frequency and smaller vehicles, even in transition scenarios. The reduced headway lowers waiting time and also favors more flexible-route operation in SoD services. The optimal SoD settings range from fully flexible to hybrid routes, where higher occupancy from the terminus favors shorter flexible routes. During the transition phase, limited fleet size and higher headways constrain the benefits of flexible-route operations. The simulation results corroborate the SoD benefits of door-to-door convenience, attracting more passengers without excessive detours and operator costs at moderate flexible-route lengths, and validate the analytical model.</description>

      <title>Urban traffic analysis and forecasting through shared Koopman eigenmodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting traffic flow in data-scarce cities is challenging due to limited historical data. To address this, we leverage transfer learning by identifying periodic patterns common to data-rich cities using a customized variant of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD): constrained Hankelized DMD (TrHDMD). This method uncovers common eigenmodes (urban heartbeats) in traffic patterns and transfers them to data-scarce cities, significantly enhancing prediction performance. TrHDMD reduces the need for extensive training datasets by utilizing prior knowledge from other cities. By applying Koopman operator theory to multi-city loop detector data, we identify stable, interpretable, and time-invariant traffic modes. Injecting ``urban heartbeats'' into forecasting tasks improves prediction accuracy and has the potential to enhance traffic management strategies for cities with varying data infrastructures. Our work introduces cross-city knowledge transfer via shared Koopman eigenmodes, offering actionable insights and reliable forecasts for data-scarce urban environments.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-based Model Predictive Control for Greenhouse Climate Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Greenhouse climate control is concerned with maximizing performance in terms of crop yield and resource efficiency. One promising approach is model predictive control (MPC), which leverages a model of the system to optimize the control inputs, while enforcing physical constraints. However, prediction models for greenhouse systems are inherently inaccurate due to the complexity of the real system and the uncertainty in predicted weather profiles. For model-based control approaches such as MPC, this can degrade performance and lead to constraint violations. Existing approaches address uncertainty in the prediction model with robust or stochastic MPC methodology; however, these necessarily reduce crop yield due to conservatism and often bear higher computational loads. In contrast, learning-based control approaches, such as reinforcement learning (RL), can handle uncertainty naturally by leveraging data to improve performance. This work proposes an MPC-based RL control framework to optimize the climate control performance in the presence of prediction uncertainty. The approach employs a parametrized MPC scheme that learns directly from data, in an online fashion, the parametrization of the constraints, prediction model, and optimization cost that minimizes constraint violations and maximizes climate control performance. Simulations show that the approach can learn an MPC controller that significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of constraint violations and efficient crop growth.</description>

      <title>Adaptive bias for dissensus in nonlinear opinion dynamics with application to evolutionary division of labor games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of adaptively controlling the bias parameter in nonlinear opinion dynamics (NOD) to allocate agents into groups of arbitrary sizes for the purpose of maximizing collective rewards. In previous work, an algorithm based on the coupling of NOD with an multi-objective behavior optimization was successfully deployed as part of a multi-robot system in an autonomous task allocation field experiment. Motivated by the field results, in this paper we propose and analyze a new task allocation model that synthesizes NOD with an evolutionary game framework. We prove sufficient conditions under which it is possible to control the opinion state in the group to a desired allocation of agents between two tasks through an adaptive bias using decentralized feedback. We then verify the theoretical results with a simulation study of a collaborative evolutionary division of labor game.</description>

      <title>Physics-based battery model parametrisation from impedance data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-invasive parametrisation of physics-based battery models can be performed by fitting the model to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data containing features related to the different physical processes. However, this requires an impedance model to be derived, which may be complex to obtain analytically. We have developed the open-source software PyBaMM-EIS that provides a fast method to compute the impedance of any PyBaMM model at any operating point using automatic differentiation. Using PyBaMM-EIS, we investigate the impedance of the single particle model, single particle model with electrolyte (SPMe), and Doyle-Fuller-Newman model, and identify the SPMe as a parsimonious option that shows the typical features of measured lithium-ion cell impedance data. We provide a grouped parameter SPMe and analyse the features in the impedance related to each parameter. Using the open-source software PyBOP, we estimate 18 grouped parameters both from simulated impedance data and from measured impedance data from a LG M50LT lithium-ion battery. The parameters that directly affect the response of the SPMe can be accurately determined and assigned to the correct electrode. Crucially, parameter fitting must be done simultaneously to data across a wide range of states-of-charge. Overall, this work presents a practical way to find the parameters of physics-based models.</description>

      <title>(Corrected Version) Push-LSVRG-UP: Distributed Stochastic Optimization over Unbalanced Directed Networks with Uncoordinated Triggered Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09181v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed stochastic optimization, arising in the crossing and integration of traditional stochastic optimization, distributed computing and storage, and network science, has advantages of high efficiency and a low per-iteration computational complexity in resolving large-scale optimization problems. This paper concentrates on resolving a large-scale convex finite-sum optimization problem in a multi-agent system over unbalanced directed networks. To tackle this problem in an efficient way, a distributed consensus optimization algorithm, adopting the push-sum technique and a distributed loopless stochastic variance-reduced gradient (LSVRG) method with uncoordinated triggered probabilities, is developed and named Push-LSVRG-UP. Each agent under this algorithmic framework performs only local computation and communicates only with its neighbors without leaking their private information. The convergence analysis of Push-LSVRG-UP is relied on analyzing the contraction relationships between four error terms associated with the multi-agent system. Theoretical results provide an explicit feasible range of the constant step-size, a linear convergence rate, and an iteration complexity of Push-LSVRG-UP when achieving the globally optimal solution. It is shown that Push-LSVRG-UP achieves the superior characteristics of accelerated linear convergence, fewer storage costs, and a lower per-iteration computational complexity than most existing works. Meanwhile, the introduction of an uncoordinated probabilistic triggered mechanism allows Push-LSVRG-UP to facilitate the independence and flexibility of agents in computing local batch gradients. In simulations, the practicability and improved performance of Push-LSVRG-UP are manifested via resolving two distributed learning problems based on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Distributed Model Predictive Control for Piecewise Affine Systems Based on Switching ADMM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for distributed model predictive control (MPC) for piecewise affine (PWA) systems. Existing approaches rely on solving mixed-integer optimization problems, requiring significant computation power or time. We propose a distributed MPC scheme that requires solving only convex optimization problems. The key contribution is a novel method, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, for solving the non-convex optimal control problem that arises due to the PWA dynamics. We present a distributed MPC scheme, leveraging this method, that explicitly accounts for the coupling between subsystems by reaching agreement on the values of coupled states. Stability and recursive feasibility are shown under additional assumptions on the underlying system. Two numerical examples are provided, in which the proposed controller is shown to significantly improve the CPU time and closed-loop performance over existing state-of-the-art approaches.</description>
