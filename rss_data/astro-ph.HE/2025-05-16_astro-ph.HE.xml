      <title>Radiation and Magnetic Pressure Support in Accretion Disks around Supermassive Black Holes and The Physical Origin of the Extreme Ultraviolet to Soft X-ray Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of four three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion disks around a $10^8$ solar mass black hole, which produce the far ultraviolet spectrum peak and demonstrate a robust physical mechanism to produce the extreme ultraviolet to soft X-ray power-law continuum component. The disks are fed from rotating tori and reach accretion rates ranging from $0.03$ to $4$ times the Eddington value. The disks become radiation pressure or magnetic pressure dominated depending on the relative timescales of radiative cooling and gas inflow. Magnetic pressure supported disks can form with or without net poloidal magnetic fields as long as the inflowing gas can cool quickly enough, which can typically happen when the accretion rate is low. We calculate the emerging spectra from these disks using multi-group radiation transport with realistic opacities and find that they typically peak around $10$ eV. At accretion rates close to or above the Eddington limit, a power-law component can appear for photon energies between $10$ eV and 1 keV with a spectral slope varying between $L_\nu\propto\nu^{-1}$ and $\nu^{-2}$, comparable to what is observed in radio quiet quasars. The disk with $3\%$ Eddington accretion rate does not exhibit this component. These high energy photons are produced in an optically thick region $\approx 30^{\circ}-45^{\circ}$ from the disk midplane by compressible bulk Comptonization within the converging accretion flow. Strongly magnetized disks that have a very small surface density will produce a spectrum that is very different from what is observed.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Galactic centre X-ray reflection signal using XMM-Newton data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the X-ray emission from the Galactic Centre (GC) region, focusing on the 6.4 keV fluorescent line of neutral or weakly ionised iron, which is commonly attributed to X-ray reflection from dense molecular clouds. Our goal is to separate the reflection signal from other physical X-ray components. We aim to produce a clean map of the 6.4 keV emission, thus providing a better understanding of the X-ray reflection processes in the GC. We utilised a deep mosaic of all available XMM-Newton observations, encompassing the central 40 square degrees of the Galaxy. The mosaics of two narrow bands centred at 6.7 keV and 6.4 keV, and a broader continuum band at lower energies (5-6.1 keV), provided valuable spatial and spectral information on the X-ray emission. These combined with the stellar mass distribution of our Galaxy enabled us to decompose the observed signal into physically meaningful components. Our analysis shows that the cleaned 6.4 keV band map, free from the contribution of bright and unresolved point sources, is predominantly shaped by X-ray reflection from dense molecular clouds. The spatial distribution of this emission, which strongly correlates with the molecular gas distribution in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), supports the interpretation that this map provides the best estimate of the X-ray reflection signal averaged over the last two decades. The cleaned reflection map produced could serve as a tool for future studies to quantify upper limits on the reflection contribution from low-energy cosmic rays in unilluminated regions. Moreover, we estimate that, on average within the CMZ, approximately 65% of the ridge emission contributes to the observed 6.4 keV emission, a factor that should be incorporated into upcoming investigations of the GC, such as polarisation studies of the reflected X-ray continuum from molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>X-Ray Radiative Transfer Calculation Based on a Physics-based Model of the Sub-parsec-scale Gases around an Active Galactic Nucleus and Its Application to NGC 3783</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the X-ray spectra of Seyfert 1 galaxies exhibit absorption lines of He-like iron and H-like iron at blue-shifted velocities of approximately $500 \ \mathrm{km} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, the physical origin of these absorption lines remains uncertain. In this study, we performed X-ray radiative transfer based on the sub-parsec-scale thermally driven outflows. The initial step involved calculating the photoionization equilibrium using the Cloudy code, which is based on three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamic simulations. Subsequently, X-ray radiative transfer was performed using the Monte Carlo simulation for astrophysics and cosmology code. Our findings indicate that when the angle of inclination ranges from $55 \ \mathrm{degrees}$ to $65 \ \mathrm{degrees}$, the transmitted component of the X-ray spectrum displays absorption lines of He-like and H-like iron, exhibiting a blue shift of approximately $500 \ \mathrm{km} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The results suggest that the absorption lines are generated by a photoionized gas within $0.005 \ \mathrm{pc}$. Additionally, the results indicate that the scattered component of the X-ray spectrum exhibits emission lines originating from neutral iron fluorescence, He-like iron, and H-like iron. The emission lines are broadened by approximately $7000 \ \mathrm{km} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ due to the Keplerian rotation. Furthermore, the model reproduced the H-like iron and H-like iron absorption lines in NGC 3783 observed by the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating.</description>

      <title>X-ray polarization in SN 1006 southwest shows spatial variations and differences with the radio band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of a spatial variation of X-ray polarization in the southwestern shell of SN 1006 (SN 1006 SW) using IXPE. The shell has an average X-ray polarization degree (PD) of $21.6\%\pm 4.5\%$ and polarization angle (PA) of $-48^\circ \pm 5^\circ$ in the 2--4 keV energy band, similar to those in the northeastern shell. The PD varies along SN 1006 SW, with a peak PD$= 40\%\pm 8\%$ in the south and a significantly lower PD $\lesssim 27\%$ (99\% upper limit) in the west where the shell has been proposed to be interacting with an interstellar cloud. The correlation between the PD, which reflects the magnetic orderliness, and the preshock density provides observational evidence that magnetic turbulence and amplification are environment-dependent. The high PD detected in the southern region of the shell constrains the magnetic turbulence scale of $\lesssim 0.1$~pc. Moreover, by comparing the IXPE X-ray and MeerKAT radio polarization measurements for SN 1006 SW, we found that magnetic fields traced by X-ray polarization are nearly radially distributed, whereas those traced by radio polarization tend to follow a direction parallel to the Galactic plane. This suggests that the X-ray polarization probes freshly amplified magnetic fields from small-scale structures in the immediate postshock region, while the radio traces more extended regions influenced by the pre-existing ambient magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>XRISM spectroscopy on orbital modulation of Fe Ly$\alpha$ lines in Cygnus X-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand physical processes such as mass transfer and binary evolution in X-ray binaries, the orbital parameters of the system are fundamental and crucial information. Cygnus X-3 is a high-mass X-ray binary composed of a compact object of unknown nature and a Wolf-Rayet star, which is of great interest in the context of wind-fed mass accretion and binary evolution. Here we present XRISM/Resolve high-resolution spectroscopy focusing on the Fe Ly$\alpha$ lines in its hypersoft state. We perform an orbital phase-resolved spectral analysis of the lines to study the orbital modulation of the emission and absorption lines. It is found that the emission lines reflect the orbital motion of the compact object whose estimated velocity amplitude is $430^{~~+150}_{~~-140}~~\mathrm{km\,s^{~-1}}$, while the absorption lines show a variation that can be interpreted as originating from the stellar wind. We discuss possible mass ranges for the binary components using the mass function with the estimated value of the velocity amplitude in this work, combined with the relation between the mass loss rate and the orbital period derivative and the empirical mass and mass loss rate relation for Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars. They are constrained to be $(1.3\text{-}5.1)\,M_\odot$ and $(9.3\text{-}12)\,M_\odot$ for the assumed inclination angle of $i = 25$ deg, which becomes more relaxed to $(1.3\text{-}24)\,M_\odot$ and $(9.3\text{-}16)\,M_\odot$ for $i = 35$ deg, respectively. Thus, it remains unclear whether the system harbors a black hole or a neutron star.</description>

      <title>Constraining Fermionic Dark Matter with Galactic Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) remains one of the most significant open questions in modern physics, with its nature and interactions largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the behavior of massive fermionic DM particles in the context of neutron stars (NSs), extending prior studies which focused on the bosonic DM. By incorporating the motion of NSs in the Galaxy and considering scenarios with and without DM self-annihilation, we demonstrate their impact on the DM capture rate and the accumulation process inside NSs. Observational data from pulsars in the Milky Way are used to place constraints on DM properties, including the mass and the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section, offering a more comprehensive picture in probing DM interactions in astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>$f$-mode oscillations of protoneutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nonradial $f$-mode oscillations of protoneutron stars in full general relativity, employing equations of state described by the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory or the relativistic mean field model, while assuming isentropy and fixed lepton fractions for the internal structure. The validity of various universal relations for cold neutron stars involving $f$-mode characteristics and macroscopic properties of the star is confirmed for those isentropic protoneutron stars. Prospects of observations are also discussed. According to simulation results, we then model details of the thermal and trapping profiles in a PNS with the canonical mass. The corresponding $f$-mode frequencies and gravitational-wave strain amplitudes are presented. The validity of the universal relations during the evolution to the formation of a cold neutron star is confirmed.</description>

      <title>MAD-Accretion Scenario in High-Mass X-Ray Binaries with Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wind-fed accretion of gas with an intrinsic magnetic field onto neutron stars in high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) is discussed. The criteria for the implementation of quasi-spherical accretion in the system, the formation of a Keplerian accretion disk and a non-Keplerian magnetically arrested disk (MAD-accretion scenario) are formulated. It is shown that the period of the equilibrium rotation of a neutron star in the MAD-accretion scenario, in addition to the parameters of the binary system, is also determined by the velocity, temperature, and degree of magnetization of the stellar wind of its massive companion. Within the hypothesis of the equilibrium rotation, we have estimated the parameters of the stellar wind for the most fully-studied quasi-equilibrium accreting pulsars in the HMXBs corresponding to the criteria for the MAD-accretion scenario implementation. We show that the period of the equilibrium rotation of a neutron star in the system, all other things being equal, increases with the growth of the magnetization degree of the stellar wind component of its massive companion flowing out in the plane of the system's orbit. Therefore, the periods of accreting pulsars in systems with similar parameters can differ from each other by several orders of magnitude and, under favorable conditions, reach values of several thousand and even tens of thousands of seconds.</description>

      <title>Shared Properties of Merger-driven Long-duration Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent detections of bright optical/infrared kilonova signals following two long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A, have significantly challenged the traditional classification of GRBs. These merger-driven LGRBs may represent a distinct GRB population. Since traditional GRB classification methods often struggle to distinguish merger-driven LGRBs from traditional merger-driven short-duration GRBs resulting from compact object mergers and collapse-driven LGRBs produced by massive stars, this work aims to explore the shared properties in terms of hardness, energy, and duration among currently observed merger-driven LGRB events, thereby identifying their observed differences from the traditional GRB population. We collect a sample of merger-driven LGRBs with known redshifts, including observed information on their main emission (ME) and whole emission (WE) phases. Treating ME and WE properties as two independent sets of information, we apply several GRB classification methodologies to explore their potential shared properties. Using the phenomenologically defined Energy-Hardness (EH) parameter, we identify a probable universal linear correlation across merger-driven LGRBs, regardless of whether their ME or WE phases are considered. We propose that such shared properties of merger-driven LGRBs are unlikely to arise from the low-redshift selection effect and they become particularly intriguing when compared with the relatively weak correlations or lack of correlation observed in traditional merger-driven short-duration GRBs (with or without extended emissions) and collapse-driven LGRBs. Our newly proposed correlation highlights the necessity for further investigation into the observations of merger-driven LGRBs and the physical mechanisms underlying the empirical correlation.</description>

      <title>Dips in the sub-TeV gamma-ray light curves from central parts of galaxies due to transiting luminous stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GeV-TeV {\gamma}-ray emission is observed from the direction of the source Sgr A^*, which is identified with the SMBH in the centre of our Galaxy. According to some models this {\gamma}-ray emission might originate in the very compact, central region identified with the direct surrounding of the SMBH. Sgr A^* is surrounded by a massive nuclear star cluster. Occasionally these stars might pass close to the line of sight of the observer, resulting in partial absorption of the sub-TeV {\gamma}-ray emission. We investigate the conditions at which an absorption feature appears in the {\gamma}-ray light curves from the Galactic Centre or nuclei of other galaxies containing SMBHs. The detection of such features would allow to obtain constraints on the emission site of {\gamma} rays in active galaxies. We calculate the optical depths for {\gamma} rays in the radiation of individual massive stars, or from the whole population of stars for different parameters of the star cluster. We show that the observer with a line of sight close to the orbital plane of the star can register a {\gamma}-ray absorption dip lasting from a fraction of a day up to a few tens of days. The combined effect of the bulk absorption on the whole population of stars instead can produce a flickering of the observed emission of a red-noise type in the power spectrum of the emission. Predicted absorption features in the sub-TeV {\gamma}-ray light curves from galaxies with SMBHs should be easily detectable by the Large-Sized Telescopes of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory. The discovery of such absorption features provides a unique indication that the {\gamma}-ray production is occurring in a compact region, close to the horizon of the SMBH.</description>

      <title>Prediction of radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar distances using the Fundamental Plane relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental plane (FP) relation connects gamma-ray luminosity to intrinsic pulsar properties, offering the potential to estimate distances for radio-quiet (RQ) gamma-ray pulsars, where direct measurements are often unavailable. The Fermi Third Pulsar Catalog presents spectral data for 294 gamma-ray pulsars, including 72 RQ pulsars, of which only 9 have known distances. This study investigates the FP relation's potential to predict distances for RQ gamma-ray pulsars using machine learning (ML) approaches. Ordinary least-squares regression was employed alongside ML methods, including random forest and support vector regression, to predict RQ gamma-ray pulsar distances. To ensure robustness, the analysis considered spectral cutoff significance and outlier data. Results confirm that the FP relation is valid only for pulsars exhibiting significant gamma-ray cutoffs, with FP exponents closely matching theoretical expectations. It was shown that gamma-ray emission origins significantly favor the curvature radiation regime over the synchrotron regime at the 4.2 sigma level. The distances for 62 RQ pulsars, for which no traditional measurements exist, are predicted for the first time. The luminosity and spatial distributions of the considered RQ pulsar population match known pulsar distributions. Predictions for RQ pulsars with known distances are consistent with measured data. This study provides a proof of principle that the FP relation, combined with ML methods, is a promising tool for distance estimation in RQ gamma-ray pulsars, using gamma-ray emission directly for the first time in pulsar distance estimates. Future improvements can be achieved with larger data sets, precise spectral cutoff determinations, and corrections for key factors like the beaming factor.</description>

      <title>Confronting recent light compact star observations with color-flavor locked quark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analyses on the properties of the central compact object in the HESS J1731-347 remnant and the PSR J1231-1411 pulsar indicated that these two compact objects are characterized by similar (low) masses and possibly different radii. This paper aims at reconciling the aforementioned measurements by utilizing the widely employed color-flavor locked (CFL) MIT bag model. The main objective is related to the examination of the acceptable values for the color superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the bag parameter $B$. Furthermore, our analysis involves two distinct hypotheses for the nature of compact stars. Firstly, we considered the case of absolute stability for strange quark matter and we found that it is possible to explain both measurements, while also respecting the latest astronomical constraints on the masses and radii of compact stars. Secondly, we studied the case of hybrid stellar matter (transition from hadrons to quarks), and concluded that, when early phase transitions are considered, the simultaneous reconciliation of both measurements leads to results that are inconsistent to the existence of massive compact stars. However, we showed that all current constraints may be satisfied under the consideration that the HESS J1731-347 remnant contains a slow stable hybrid star.</description>

      <title>Origin of the ring ellipticity in the black hole images of M87*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the origin of the elliptical ring structure observed in the images of the supermassive black hole M87*, aiming to disentangle contributions from gravitational, astrophysical, and imaging effects. Leveraging the enhanced capabilities of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) 2018 array, including improved $(u,v)$-coverage from the Greenland Telescope, we measure the ring's ellipticity using five independent imaging methods, obtaining a consistent average value of $\tau = 0.08_{-0.02}^{+0.03}$ with a position angle $\xi = 50.1_{-7.6}^{+6.2}$ degrees. To interpret this measurement, we compare against General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations spanning a wide range of physical parameters including thermal or non-thermal electron distribution function, spins, and ion-to-electron temperature ratios in both low and high-density regions. We find no statistically significant correlation between spin and ellipticity in GRMHD images. Instead, we identify a correlation between ellipticity and the fraction of non-ring emission, particularly in non-thermal models and models with higher jet emission. These results indicate that the ellipticity measured from the \m87 emission structure is consistent with that expected from simulations of turbulent accretion flows around black holes, where it is dominated by astrophysical effects rather than gravitational ones. Future high-resolution imaging, including space very long baseline interferometry and long-term monitoring, will be essential to isolate gravitational signatures from astrophysical effects.</description>

      <title>S241125n: Binary Black Hole Merger Produces Short GRB in AGN Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the gravitational wave (GW) event for black hole (BH)-BH mergers, S241125n, has been reported to be associated with a short gamma-ray burst (GRB) and X-ray afterglow emission. Such an association could potentially unveil the environments of mergers and provide attractive targets for multi-messenger observations. We summarize these observations and model it as a binary BH merger occurring within an active galactic nucleus (AGN), where the merger remnant accretes disk material at hyper-Eddington rates. The resulting jet could lead to the GRB associated with the GW event. The GRB, detected by Swift-BAT, exhibits a Comptonized spectrum with an unusually soft photon index, which is consistent with emission from the jet interacting the emission associated with the dense AGN disk environment. Its X-ray afterglow shows an unusually hard spectrum, indicating possible strong absorption by a high column density typical of AGN disks. We highlight the importance of identifying the host galaxy and conducting more sensitive infrared observations to test the model.</description>

      <title>SMIET: Fast and accurate synthesis of radio pulses from extensive air shower using simulated templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpreting the data from radio detectors for extensive air showers typically relies on Monte-Carlo based simulation codes, which, despite their accuracy are computationally expensive and present bottlenecks for analyses. To address this issue we developed a novel method called template synthesis, which synthesises the radio emission from cosmic ray air showers in seconds. This hybrid approach uses a microscopically simulated, sliced shower (the origin) as an input. It rescales the emission from each slice individually to synthesise the emission from a shower with different properties (the target). In order to be able to change the arrival direction during synthesis, we adjust the phases based on the expected geometrical delays. We benchmark the method by comparing synthesised traces to CoREAS simulations over a wide frequency range of [30, 500] MHz . The synthesis quality is primarily influenced by the difference in $X_{max}$ between the origin and target shower. When $\Delta X_{max} \leq 100 g/cm^2$ , the scatter on the maximum amplitudes of the geomagnetic traces is at most 4%. For the traces from the charge-excess component this scatter is smaller than 6%. We also observe a bias with $\Delta X_{max}$ up to 5% for both components, which appears to depend on the antenna position. Since the bias is symmetrical around $\Delta X_{max} = 0 g/cm^2$, we can use an interpolation approach to correct for it. We have implemented the template synthesis algorithm in a Python package called \texttt{SMIET}, which includes all the necessary parameters. This package has been successfully tested with air showers with zenith angles up to $50^{\circ}$ and can be used with any atmosphere, observation level and magnetic field. We demonstrate that the synthesis quality remains comparable to our main benchmarks across various scenarios and discuss use cases, including machine-learning-based analyses.</description>

      <title>Generation of magnetic fields around black hole accretion discs due to non conservative radiation fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of magnetic fields above black hole accretion discs due to the non-zero curl of the disc radiation field. By self consistently computing the components of the radiation flux and their curl, we show that the rotational nature of the radiation field induces charge separation, leading to magnetic field generation in the plasma above the disc. Solving the magnetohydrodynamic equations, we derive the time evolution of these fields and demonstrate that they grow over astrophysically relevant timescales. For a standard Keplerian accretion disc, the produced magnetic fields remain weak, on the order of a few Gauss, consistent with previous predictions. However, when a luminous corona is present in the inner disc region ($r_d &lt; 3-10 r_g$), the generated fields reach dynamically significant strengths of up to $10^5$ Gauss where the magnetic energy density approaching few percentage of equipartition with the gas pressure. These fields develop within realistic growth timescales (such as viscous timescale) and can be dynamically significant in governing disc and jet evolution. Our findings suggest that radiation-driven magnetic fields play a crucial role in accretion flow magnetization, influencing both disc dynamics and observational signatures. The predicted field strengths could affect the thermal emission, synchrotron radiation, and polarization properties of black hole accretion systems, with implications for X-ray binaries, AGN, and jet formation. Future numerical simulations and high-resolution polarimetric observations, such as those from IXPE, eXTP, and EHT, may provide observational confirmation of our findings.</description>

      <title>A possible periodic RM evolution in the repeating FRB 20220529</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious millisecond-duration radio transients from the distant universe. Some of them repeat, while others do not. In order to explore their origin, periodic examinations have been conducted on repeating FRBs. Most of them show irregular properties, including burst rate, dispersion measure (DM), and rotation measure (RM). A notable exception is FRB~20180916B, which shows a significant 16-day periodic burst rate. Possible periodic activities have also been reported in FRB~20121102A and FRB~20240209A. However, periodic studies of other properties are sparse. FRB~20220529 was monitored by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) for nearly three years, enabling periodic examinations of its properties. Here we report a possible period of $\sim 200$ days in the RM evolution, with a significance of 4.2 $\sigma$ estimated via the Lomb-Scargle algorithm and 3.5 $\sigma$ with a phase-folding method. The burst rate was also examined for periodicity. This is consistent with the binary origin indicated by the significant RM increase and its prompt recovery.</description>

      <title>Searching for Accreting Compact Binaries in eROSITA DR1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact binaries with accreting white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes are crucial for understanding accretion physics. In this study, we identify accreting compact binary candidates in the eROSITA DR1 by combining Gaia astrometry and ZTF time-domain photometry. We select accreting compact binary candidates whose X-ray emission is likely accretion-driven, based on their X-ray-to-optical flux ratios and optical colors, and further identify systems with short-period ZTF light curves, thereby ruling out AGNs. The resulting 22 candidates, including two known compact binaries, represent promising candidates for spectroscopic follow-up to confirm their accreting nature and explore their physical properties. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining X-ray-to-optical flux ratio and optical color, and time-domain photometry in selecting accreting compact binaries. The method is scalable and adaptable to future multi-wavelength sky surveys, offering a promising path toward a more complete census of compact binaries in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Possibility of Multi-Messenger Observations of Quasi-Periodic Eruptions with X-rays and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent X-ray observations have discovered a class of periodic X-ray flares in galactic nuclei known as quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs). A promising explanation of QPEs is an emission produced when a stellar-mass object orbiting a central supermassive black hole crosses an accretion disk. If the companion is a compact object, such systems would be a prospective multi-messenger target for the space-based observatory LISA and its successors. Here we quantify the prospects for joint X-ray and GW detection of QPEs with orbital frequency in the mHz band using a minimal flare-emission model. Our analysis shows that X-ray observations are most effective at orbital frequencies up to roughly 1 mHz, whereas LISA is sensitive chiefly above about 1 mHz. Because the optimal sensitivity windows overlap only marginally, we predict at most one joint detection during LISA's nominal mission lifetime. Extending GW sensitivity into the sub-millihertz regime (&lt; 0.1 mHz) would raise the possibility of the joint detection by an order of magnitude, enabling QPEs as an interesting multi-messenger target.</description>

      <title>Testing the Hypothesis that the Quasar J0950+5128 Harbors a Supermassive Black Hole Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic observations of the quasar J0950+5128 spanning 22 years show that its broad H$\beta$ emission line displays monotonic radial velocity variations consistent with those expected from a supermassive binary. At the same time, the profile of the broad H$\beta$ line is changing, necessitating careful measurements. We present robust measurements of the broad H$\beta$ velocity shifts. We fit the spectra with a multi-component parametric model to isolate the broad H$\beta$ by removing the stellar and non-stellar continua, the Fe ii line blends, and various narrow and broad emission lines in its vicinity. We measure the H$\beta$ velocity shifts via cross-correlation, both before and after decomposing the spectra, and we demonstrate that they can be reliably measured in spite of variations in the line profiles. We incorporate radial velocity "jitter" into the radial velocity curve to emulate typical quasar variability, and fit the curve with a Keplerian orbit model. The fit yields a period of 33 years and an eccentricity of 0.65, with lower limits on the semi-major axis and black hole mass of $10^{-2}$ pc and $10^7\ M_\odot$, respectively. Thus, this quasar is a compelling supermassive binary candidate. Continued monitoring is essential to further evaluate its credentials.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Cosmic Ray Spectrum with Next Generation Neutrino Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the capabilities of upcoming kiloton-scale neutrino detectors, such as Hyper-Kamiokande, in determining the primary cosmic ray spectrum. These detectors provide full-sky coverage and long-term monitoring, unlike traditional satellite and balloon experiments that measure cosmic ray flux at specific altitudes and locations. By analyzing the atmospheric neutrino flux generated by cosmic ray interactions, we demonstrate that future detectors can differentiate between various cosmic ray models with high statistical significance, even when accounting for uncertainties in neutrino cross sections and hadronic interactions. We introduce a technique for reconstructing the primary cosmic ray spectrum using neutrino measurements, which reduces the flux uncertainty from approximately 20\% to about 7\%. We then show that Hyper-K has the potential to increase sensitivity to neutrino oscillation parameters, such as $\sin^2\theta_{23}$, by a factor of 2. Our results highlight the complementary role of neutrino detectors in cosmic ray physics and their critical importance for precision measurements in particle astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Chandra Rules Out Super-Eddington Accretion For Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most puzzling discoveries by JWST is the population of high-redshift, red, and compact galaxies dubbed little red dots (LRDs). Based on broad-line diagnostics, these galaxies have been argued to host accreting $10^7-10^8$ M$_\odot$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs), a claim with crucial consequences for our understanding of how the first black holes form and grow over cosmic time. A key feature of LRDs is their extreme X-ray weakness: analyses of individual and stacked sources have yielded non-detections or only tentative, inconclusive X-ray signals, except for a handful of individual cases. As the most natural explanation, high obscuration, is disfavored by JWST spectroscopic evidence, several authors have suggested that the X-ray weakness of LRDs is intrinsic, due to super-Eddington accretion rates. In this work, we test that scenario by stacking X-ray data for 55 LRDs in the Chandra Deep Field South, accumulating a total exposure time of nearly 400 Ms. Despite reaching unprecedented X-ray depths, our stack still yields a non-detection. The corresponding upper limits are deep enough to rule out current super-Eddington accretion models, and are compatible only with extremely high levels of obscuration ($N_H\gtrsim10^{25}$~cm$^{-2}$). To explain the X-ray weakness of LRDs, we therefore speculate that the SMBHs in these systems are neither as massive nor as luminous as currently believed.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Very Heavy Dark Matter in the Earth with Tau Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter accumulates in the center of the Earth as the planet plows through the dark matter halo in the Milky Way. Possible annihilation of dark matter to Standard Model particles can be probed in indirect dark matter searches. Among possible messengers, neutrinos are uniquely ideal as they can escape dense regions. Therefore, neutrino telescopes, with their large volume and broad energy exposures, offer new opportunities to search for dark matter signals from the center of the Earth. However, such studies have been restricted to dark matter masses below $\sim$ PeV as the Earth becomes opaque to very-high-energy neutrinos. In this study, we demonstrate that neutrino telescopes operating at TeV-PeV energies can probe very heavy dark matter particles if they annihilate to tau neutrinos or tau leptons. Here, we report upper limits on the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon cross section for masses between $10^5$ GeV and $10^{10}$ GeV by using 7.5 years of IceCube high-energy starting event observations. Our results motivate detailed analyses in IceCube and other upcoming neutrino telescopes in the Northern Hemisphere.</description>

Abstract: Ultralight bosons (ULBs) can form macroscopic superradiant clouds around spinning black holes. We show that for scalar ULB masses $\mu \sim 10^{-22}-10^{-21}$ eV boson cloud dynamical friction drives supermassive black hole (SMBH) final-parsec evolution in $\lesssim 1$ Gyr and suppresses the nanohertz gravitational wave background with turnover. Considering century-monitored OJ287 system, we place novel bounds restricting ULB mass range $\mu \simeq (8.5-22) \times 10^{-22}$ eV independent of any dark matter assumptions and show ULB drag can also efficiently reconcile any future confirmations of the debated orbital decay excess. Forthcoming pulsar timing array data and precise SMBH orbital timings will decisively test this scenario.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and Magnetic Reconnection in Relativistic Multi-Species Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of relativistic plasmas traditionally focus on the dynamics of two-species mixtures of charged particles under the influence of external magnetic fields and those generated by particle currents. However, the extreme conditions of astrophysical plasmas near compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars are often characterized by mixtures of electrons, protons, and positrons, whose dynamics can differ significantly because of the considerable mass contrast. We present the first two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of relativistic turbulence and magnetic reconnection in a three-species plasma, varying the relative abundance of electrons, protons, and positrons while employing realistic mass ratios to achieve unprecedented accuracy. We find that turbulence leads to the formation of magnetic islands, current sheets, and plasmoids. Reconnection occurs between these structures, with plasma composition playing a key role in determining the number of reconnection sites and their energy-conversion efficiency. In particular, as the proton fraction increases, very small-scale features of the turbulence are washed out, while global dissipative effects are amplified. Finally, using a novel generalization of Ohm's law for a relativistic multi-species plasma, we find that the reconnection rate is primarily governed by the electric fields associated to the divergence of the positron and electron pressure tensors. These results provide new insights into dissipation and particle acceleration in turbulent relativistic plasmas, such as those near black holes and neutron stars, and can be used to interpret their high-energy emission and phenomenology.</description>

      <title>A fully relativistic treatment of EMRIs in collisionless environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future mHz gravitational wave (GW) interferometers will precisely probe massive black hole environments, such as accretion discs, cold dark matter overdensities, and clouds of ultralight bosons, as long as we can accurately model the dephasing they induce on the waveform of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Most existing models rely on extrapolations from Newtonian results to model the interaction of the small black hole in an EMRI system with the environment surrounding the massive black hole. Here, we present a fully relativistic formalism to model such interaction with collisionless environments, focusing on the case of cold dark matter overdensities, like 'spikes' and 'mounds'. We implement our new formalism in the FastEMRIWaveforms framework and show that the resulting waveforms are significantly different from those based on a Newtonian treatment of environmental effects. Our results indicate that a fully relativistic treatment is essential to capture the environmental dephasing of GW signals from EMRIs accurately.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quasar Variability With ZTF at 0&lt;z&lt;3: A Universal Relation with Eddington Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasars, powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs), exhibit significant variability, offering insights into the physics of accretion and the properties of the central engines. In this study, we analyze photometric variability and its correlation with key quasar properties, including black hole mass ($M_{\mathrm{BH}}$) and nuclear luminosities, using 915 quasars with $0\leq z&lt;3.0$ from the AQMES sample monitored within SDSS-V. Variability metrics were derived from approximately 6-year light curves provided by the Zwicky Transient Facility -- ZTF, while SMBH masses and luminosities were obtained from the SDSS DR16 quasar catalog of \citet{wu2022catalog}. We identify a strong anti-correlation between variability amplitude and luminosity, which strengthens with redshift, and a redshift-dependent trend for $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$: a positive correlation at low redshifts, no significant correlation at intermediate redshifts, and an anti-correlation the highest redshifts. Our main finding is a robust anti-correlation between photometric variability amplitude and Eddington ratio, consistent across redshift bins. We present a general equation encapsulating this relationship, that appears to be almost free of redshift dependence, enabling predictions of quasar variability based on accretion parameters {\bf or vice-versa}. The derived relation with the Eddington ratio provides a unified framework for interpreting variability in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and facilitates future studies of quasar variability using high-cadence surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time -- LSST.</description>

      <title>Strontium I, III, IV and V: Electron Impact Excitation Data for Kilonovae and White Dwarf Diagnostic Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strontium (Sr) emissions have been observed across a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, from kilonovae (KNe) events to white dwarf (WD) stars. Precise and extensive atomic data for low ionisation stages of Sr is required for accurate theoretical modelling and to improve our understanding of evolutionary pathways. We calculated energy levels, Einstein A coefficients and electron-impact excitation collision strengths for Sr I, Sr III, Sr IV and Sr V at the temperature and density ranges of interest in KNe and WD research. We developed new target structures using the GRASP0 and AUTOSTRUCTURE packages. The energies and A-values arising from the new structures were found to be in good agreement with experimental and theoretical equivalents reported in the literature. Maxwellian averaged electron impact collision strengths were calculated using the R-matrix approach, as applied through the DARC and RMBP coding packages. These are presented in adf04 file format. The new data sets allowed us to construct synthetic spectra for the first five ionisation stages of Sr and probe possible density and temperature diagnostic lines. The synthetic spectra within the KNe regime revealed possible Sr IV and Sr V candidate lines at 1027.69nm and 1203.35nm respectively. These may provide useful benchmarks for determining the extent of Sr ionisation that can be reached in an evolving KNe event. Additional diagnostic lines were found to be poor across the Sr ion stages for both KNe and WD regimes due to most levels being in either coronal or Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) conditions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian pulsar timing and noise analysis with Vela.jl: the wideband paradigm</title>

Abstract: Vela.jl is a package for performing Bayesian pulsar timing &amp; noise analysis written in Julia and Python. In the wideband paradigm of pulsar timing, simultaneous time of arrival and dispersion measure measurements are derived from a radio observation using frequency-resolved integrated pulse profiles and templates without splitting the observation into multiple frequency sub-bands. We describe the implementation of the wideband timing paradigm in Vela.jl, and demonstrate its usage using the NANOGrav 12.5-year wideband data of PSR J1923+2515. Vela.jl is the first software package to provide this functionality.</description>

      <title>First polarization study of the M87 jet and active galactic nuclei at submillimeter wavelengths with ALMA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present full-polarization observations at $\lambda = 0.87$ mm (345 GHz) conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) toward Messier 87 (M87) and seven other radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN). We determine polarization and Faraday properties of the targets, with linear polarization (LP) fractions spanning 1\% to 17\%, and Faraday rotation measures (RMs) exceeding $10^{5}$ rad m$^{-2}$. These RM values, 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than typically observed at $\lambda &gt; 3$ mm, suggest denser Faraday screens or stronger magnetic fields in the (sub)millimeter emission regions. Additionally, we present the first submillimeter polarized images of the M87 jet and the observed AGN. In the M87 jet, we identify RM gradients and sign reversals, suggestive of a helical magnetic field structure extending over kiloparsec scales. These observations were part of the ALMA Band~7 Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) commissioning during the April 2021 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) campaign. The results provide essential constraints for calibrating, analyzing, and interpreting VLBI data from the EHT at 345 GHz, representing a critical step toward submillimeter VLBI imaging.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Mass Loss of Very Massive Stars: Impact on the Evolution, Binary Processes, and Remnant Mass Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very massive stars (VMS) play a fundamental role in astrophysics due to their winds and supernovae (SN), and their role as massive black hole (BH) progenitors. However, their origin and evolution remain a significant challenge. Recent theoretical work and observations suggest that VMS approaching the Eddington limit may experience mass loss above the standard wind predictions. This study investigates how enhanced winds influence single and binary VMS evolution, observable properties, and resulting BH populations. New stellar wind prescriptions, sensitive to the Eddington parameter ($\Gamma_e$) and the luminosity-to-mass ratio, were implemented into the stellar evolution code PARSEC v2.0. These updated single-star tracks (100 - 600 M$_{\odot}$ at Z=0.006) were used to model the VMS population in the Tarantula Nebula and integrated into the SEVN binary evolution code. The $\Gamma_e$-enhanced single-star tracks match observed VMS properties better than standard models. Explaining the most massive star, R136a1, through a single-star origin suggests a zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass limit of $&lt;$ 400 M$_{\odot}$ regardless of the wind recipe used. However, binary stellar mergers also offer a suitable origin for R136a1 and other observed VMS, potentially lowering the upper ZAMS mass limit by ~100 M$_{\odot}$. In binaries, enhanced winds inhibit main-sequence stellar mergers and limit BH production above the pair-instability mass gap's lower edge (~50 M$_{\odot}$). Binary BHs merging in a Hubble time with enhanced winds yield more primary BHs above 30 M$_{\odot}$ and enable secondary BHs between 30-40 solar masses, a range not found with standard stellar winds at LMC metallicity. This study highlights the crucial role that stellar winds and binary interactions play in VMS evolution and offers predictions relevant for interpreting VMS observations and gravitational wave source origins.</description>

      <title>Implications of pulsar timing arrays for Gauss-Bonnet Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated time-of-arrival measurements by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have provided a new means of constraining astrophysical or cosmological models that produce a gravitational wave (GW) background. For this work, we discuss the implications of PTA observations for Gauss-Bonnet (GB) inflationary models through the production and propagation of inflationary GWs. We show that our GB inflationary scenario is consistent with present PTA and cosmological data. A blue-tilted tensor power spectrum supported by PTAs can be naturally accommodated in GB inflation. Using observational constraints, we derive general conditions for the inflaton potential and the GB coupling function, suggesting that in GB inflation, the inflaton must climb up the potential before rolling downhill and reaching the end of inflation. We provide two concrete GB inflationary models to demonstrate the viability of this mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict that neutrino sources following the matter distribution of the universe result in an anisotropy in the neutrino sky imprinted by the local large-scale structure. We calculate the level of this anisotropy and explore how it depends on the cosmological evolution of neutrino sources. We show how the level of anisotropy can be amplified when a cutoff in the neutrino spectrum is considered, introducing an effective neutrino horizon. This effect might allow for future neutrino detectors to measure a neutrino anisotropy associated with the local large-scale structure. Measurement of the level of this anisotropy along with features of the neutrino spectrum will allow observers to constrain the cosmological evolution of neutrino sources, which at ultrahigh energies (UHEs) are also expected to be the sources of UHE cosmic rays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12875v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of compact stars admixed with non-self annihilating self-interacting fermionic dark matter, delineating the dependence on the nuclear equation of state by considering the two limiting parametrized equations of state for neutron star matter obtained by smoothly matching the low-density chiral effective theory and the high-density perturbative QCD. These two parametrizations are the limiting cases of a wide variety of smooth equations of state, i.e. the softest and stiffest possible one without a phase transition, that generate masses and radii compatible with 2M$_\odot$ observations and the tidal constraint from GW170817. With an exhaustive analysis of the possible stable mass-radius configurations, we determine the quantity of dark matter contained in stars with masses and radii compatible with the aforementioned astrophysical constraints. We find that for dark particle masses of a few tenths of GeV, the dark core collapses and no stable solutions are found for the two limiting ordinary matter equations of state. For lower masses, the dark matter fraction is limited to 10%, being at most 1% for masses ranging from 0.1 to 10 GeV for the limiting soft nuclear equation of state. For the limiting stiff nuclear equation of state, the dark matter fraction can reach values of more than 10%, but the dark particle mass is being constrained to 0.3 GeV and 10 GeV for the weak self-interacting case and has to be at least 5 GeV for the strong self-interacting one. For dark particle masses of less than 0.1 GeV, stable neutron star configurations should have less than 1% of self-interacting dark matter to be compatible with the constraint of the tidal deformability from GW170817 for the two limiting ordinary matter equations of state studied.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave model for neutron star merger remnants with supervised learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a time-domain model for the gravitational waves emitted by equal-mass binary neutron star merger remnants for a fixed equation of state. We construct a large set of numerical relativity simulations for a single equation of state consistent with current constraints, totaling 157 equal-mass binary neutron star merger configurations. The gravitational-wave model is constructed using the supervised learning method of K-nearest neighbor regression. As a first step toward developing a general model with supervised learning methods that accounts for the dependencies on equation of state and the binary masses of the system, we explore the impact of the size of the dataset on the model. We assess the accuracy of the model for a varied dataset size and number density in total binary mass. Specifically, we consider five training sets of $\{ 20,40, 60, 80, 100\}$ simulations uniformly distributed in total binary mass. We evaluate the resulting models in terms of faithfulness using a test set of 30 additional simulations that are not used during training and which are equidistantly spaced in total binary mass. The models achieve faithfulness with maximum values in the range of $0.980$ to $0.995$. We assess our models simulating signals observed by the three-detector network of Advanced LIGO-Virgo. We find that all models with training sets of size equal to or larger than $40$ achieve an unbiased measurement of the main gravitational-wave frequency. We confirm that our results do not depend qualitatively on the choice of the (fixed) equation of state. We conclude that training sets, with a minimum size of $40$ simulations, or a number density of approximately $11$ simulations per $0.1\,M_\odot$ of total binary mass, suffice for the construction of faithful templates for the post-merger signal for a single equation of state and equal-mass binaries (abbreviated).</description>

Abstract: Since the universe is not transparent to gamma rays with energies above around one hundred GeV, it is necessary to account for the interaction of high-energy photons with intergalactic radiation fields in order to model gamma-ray propagation. Here, we present a public numerical software for the modeling of gamma-ray observables. This code computes the effects on gamma-ray spectra from the development of electromagnetic cascades and cosmological redshifting. The code introduced here is based on the original $\gamma$-Cascade, and builds on it by improving its performance at high redshifts, introducing new propagation modules, and adding many more extragalactic radiation field models, which enables the ability to estimate the uncertainties inherent to EBL modeling. We compare the results of this new code to existing Monte Carlo electromagnetic transport models, finding good agreement within EBL uncertainties.</description>

Abstract: The abundances resulting from $r$-process nucleosynthesis as predicted by simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers remain an open question as the current state of the art is still restricted to three-species neutrino transport. We present the first BNS merger simulations employing a moment-based general-relativistic neutrino transport with five neutrino species, thus including (anti)muons and advanced muonic $\beta$-processes, and contrast them with traditional three-neutrino-species simulations. Our results show that a muonic trapped-neutrino equilibrium is established, forming a different trapped-neutrino hierarchy akin to the electronic equilibrium. The formation of (anti)muons and the muonization via muonic $\beta$-processes enhance the neutrino luminosity, leading to rapid cooling in the early postmerger phase. Since muonic processes redirect part of the energy otherwise used for protonization by electronic processes, they yield a cooler remnant and disk, together with neutrino-driven winds that are more neutron-rich. Importantly, the unbound ejected mass is smaller than three-species simulations, and, because of its comparatively smaller temperature and proton fraction, it can enhance lanthanide production and reduce the overproduction of light $r$-process elements for softer equations of state. This finding underlines the importance of muonic interactions and five neutrino species in long-lived BNS remnants.</description>

      <title>Jet-shaped filamentary ejecta in common envelope evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations of common envelope evolution (CEE) of a neutron star (NS) that launches jets as it spirals in inside the envelope of a rotating red supergiant (RSG) stellar envelope and find that Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities form filamentary ejecta. We first study the 3D RSG envelope properties before we launch the jets. Adding envelope rotation causes the RSG envelope to expand in the equatorial plane and contract along the poles, leading to non-radial oscillations that decay after two oscillation periods, like the radial oscillation of the non-rotating model. In addition, the envelope becomes convective with large vortices, as in the non-rotating case. Since RSG stars oscillate and have envelope convection, we strengthen the claim that there is no need to relax one-dimensional stellar models of cool giant stars when transporting them to 3D grids. When adding jets, the 3D simulations that include pre-set envelope rotation show that envelope rotation leads to more prominent spiral structures of the ejecta than in the non-rotating case. We map the envelope zones that are Rayleigh-Taylor unstable and conclude that this instability forms the filamentary ejecta, with and without envelope rotation. The jet-inflated high-pressure volumes around the NS accelerate the envelope, a process prone to Rayleigh-Taylor instability.</description>

      <title>Inferring Black Hole Spin from Interferometric Measurements of the First Photon Ring: A Geometric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately inferring black hole spin is crucial for understanding black hole dynamics and their astrophysical environments. In this work, we outline a geometric method for spin estimation by using the interferometric shape of the first photon ring ($n=1$) as an approximation to the critical curve, which, given an assumed value of the black hole inclination, is then mapped to a spin value. While future space-based missions will capture a wealth of data on the first photon ring--including the full angle-dependent diameter, angular brightness profile, and astrometric offset from the $n=0$ ring--our analysis is restricted to using only two angle-dependent diameters to compute its shape asymmetry and infer spin. Focusing on low inclinations and moderate-to-high spins, we test the method across various emission models, baselines, and noise sources, including a mock space-based observation. Although the size of the $n=1$ ring depends on the emission model, its interferometric shape remains a robust spin probe at low inclinations. We find that the inferred asymmetry of the $n=1$ image may be biased by the critical curve morphology, and it can be heavily skewed by the presence of noise, whether astrophysical or instrumental. In low-noise limits at low viewing inclination, significant contributions from the $n=0$ image at short baselines may lead to a downward bias in asymmetry estimates. While our method can estimate high spins in noise-free time-averaged images, increasing the noise and astrophysical variability degrades the resulting constraints, providing only lower bounds on the spin when applied to synthetic observed data. Remarkably, even using only the ring's asymmetry, we can establish lower bounds on the spin, underscoring the promise of photon ring-based spin inference in future space-based very long baseline interferometry missions, such as the proposed Black Hole Explorer.</description>

      <title>Identifying intermediate mass binary black hole mergers in AGN disks using LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Laser Interferometer Space Antenna can uniquely identify the sites of intermediate-mass binary black hole (IMBBH) mergers if they occur in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disks with a gas density $\rho\geq10^{-12} \, {\rm g/cc}$ via measurement of dynamical friction effect in the gravitational waveform. We find that even a single observation of a gravitational wave source with a total mass of $10^3 M_{\odot}$ and a mass ratio of 2 at a luminosity distance of 3 Gpc is sufficient to confidently associate the merger to be in an AGN disk with a density $\sim 10^{-12} \, {\rm g/cc}$, as it allows estimation of the density with an error bar $O(100\%)$. This provides a new way of inferring AGN disk densities that complement traditional X-ray observations. Further, we find that neglecting the presence of environmental effects in the waveform models used for parameter estimation can bias the chirp mass, mass ratio and arrival time of a merger. If not corrected, this can significantly impact our ability to carry out multiband data analysis of IMBBHs that combines information from LISA and ground-based gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>X-ray Polarization of the High-Synchrotron-Peaked BL Lac H 1426+428</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the X-ray polarization properties of the high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac H 1426+428, based on two-epoch observational data from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). For the first observation, only an upper limit of polarization degree ($\Pi_{\rm X}$), $\Pi_{\rm X}&lt;19.5\%$, at the $99\%$ confidence level (C.L.) is determined. In contrast, for the second observation, we derive $\Pi_{\rm X}=20.6\%\pm2.9\%$ with a polarization angle ($\psi_{\rm X}$) of $\psi_{\rm X}=116.1^{\circ}\pm4.1^{\circ}$ at a C.L. of 7.1 $\sigma$. The time-resolved and energy-resolved polarization analysis reveals no significant variation in $\psi_{\rm X}$ and no detectable polarization within narrower energy bins for the first observation, while the polarization during the second observation is dominated by low-energy photons. Furthermore, the X-rays during the second observation are found to be in a higher flux state with a harder spectrum compared to that observed during the first observation, consistent with a {\it harder-when-brighter} behavior. We propose that the enhanced X-ray emission observed during the second observation is produced by shock-accelerated electrons within an ordered magnetic field region via synchrotron radiation. Nonetheless, no significant detection of polarization during the first IXPE observation may be due to the limited number of detected photons.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent treatment of thermal effects in neutron-star post-mergers: observational implications for third-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We assess the impact of accurate, self-consistent modelling of thermal effects in neutron-star merger remnants in the context of third-generation gravitational-wave detectors. This is done through the usage, in Bayesian model selection experiments, of numerical-relativity simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers modelled through: a) nuclear, finite-temperature (or ``tabulated'') equations of state (EoSs), and b) their simplifed piecewise (or ``hybrid'') representation. These cover four different EoSs, namely SLy4, DD2, HShen and LS220. Our analyses make direct use of the Newman-Penrose scalar $\psi_4$ outputted by numerical simulations. Considering a detector network formed by three Cosmic Explorers, we show that differences in the gravitational-wave emission predicted by the two models are detectable with a natural logarithmic Bayes Factor $\log{\cal{B}}\geq 5$ at average distances of $d_L \simeq 50$Mpc, reaching $d_L \simeq 100$Mpc for source inclinations $\iota \leq 0.8$, regardless of the EoS. This impact is most pronounced for the HShen EoS. For low inclinations, only the DD2 EoS prevents the detectability of such modelling differences at $d_L \simeq 150$Mpc. Our results suggest that the usage a self-consistent treatment of thermal effects is crucial for third-generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional tearing instability of flux-tube-like magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection, a fundamental plasma process, is pivotal in understanding energy conversion and particle acceleration in astrophysical systems. While extensively studied in two-dimensional (2D) configurations, the dynamics of reconnection in three-dimensional (3D) systems remain under-explored. In this work, we extend the classical tearing mode instability to 3D by introducing a modulation along the otherwise uniform direction in a 2D equilibrium, given by $g(y)$, mimicking a flux tube-like configuration. We perform linear stability analysis (both analytically and numerically) and direct numerical simulations to investigate the effects of three-dimensionality. Remarkably, we find that a tearing-like instability arises in 3D as well, even without the presence of guide fields. Further, our findings reveal that the 3D tearing instability exhibits reduced growth rates compared to 2D by a factor of $\int g(y)^{1/2} dy~/\int dy$, with the dispersion relation maintaining similar scaling characteristics. We show that the modulation introduces spatially varying resistive layer properties, which influence the reconnection dynamics.</description>

      <title>Supercooled Phase Transitions: Why Thermal History of Hidden Sector Matters in Analysis of Pulsar Timing Array Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of a gravitational wave background in the nano-Hertz frequency range from Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations offers new insights into evolution of the early universe. In this work we analyze gravitational wave data from PPTA, EPTA, and NANOGrav, as arising from a supercooled first-order phase transition within a hidden sector, characterized by a broken $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry. Several previous works have discussed challenges in producing observable {PTA signal} from supercooled phases transitions. We discuss these challenges and show how they are overcome by inclusion in part of the proper thermal history of the hidden and the visible sectors. The analysis of this work demonstrates that thermal histories of hidden and visible sectors profoundly influence the gravitational wave power spectrum, an aspect not previously explored in the literature. Further, the analysis of this work suggests that supercooled phase transitions not only align with the Pulsar Timing Array observations but also show promise for gravitational wave detection by future gravitational wave detectors. Our analysis shows that the dominant contribution to the gravitational wave power spectrum for PTA signals comes from bubble collision while the sound wave and turbulence contributions are highly suppressed. It is also found that all the PTA events are of detonation type while deflagration and hybrid events are absent. The analysis presented in this work provides a robust framework for further investigations on the origin of gravitational wave power spectrum in the early universe and for their experimental observation in the future.</description>

      <title>Highly Variable Quasar Candidates Selected from 4XMM-DR13 with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a sample of 12 quasar candidates with highly variable soft X-ray emission from the 4th XMM-newton Serendipitous Source Catalog (4XMM-DR13) using random forest. We obtained optical to mid-IR photometric data for the 4XMM-DR13 sources by correlating the sample with the SDSS DR18 photometric database and the AllWISE database. By cross-matching this sample with known spectral catalogs from the SDSS and LAMOST surveys, we obtained a training data set containing stars, galaxies, and quasars. The random forest algorithm was trained to classify the XMM-WISE-SDSS sample. We further filtered the classified quasar candidates with $\it{Gaia}$ proper motion to remove stellar contaminants. Finally, 53,992 quasar candidates have been classified, with 10,210 known quasars matched in SIMBAD. The quasar candidates have systematically lower X-ray fluxes than quasars in the training set, which indicates the classifier is helpful to single out fainter quasars. We constructed a sample of 12 sources from these quasars candidates which changed their soft X-ray fluxes by a factor of 10 over $\sim$ 20 years in the 4XMM-newton survey. Our selected highly variable quasar candidates extend the quasar sample, characterized by extreme soft X-ray variability, to the optically faint end with magnitudes around $r \sim 22$. None of the 12 sources were detected in ROSAT observations. Given the flux limit of ROSAT, the result suggests that quasars exhibiting variations of more than two orders of magnitudes are extremely rare.</description>

      <title>Possible origin of the KM3-230213A neutrino event from dark matter decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of the highest energy neutrino event with 220 PeV energy, detected recently by the KM3NeT experiment to be originating from heavy dark matter (DM) decay. Considering a heavy right handed neutrino (RHN) DM for illustrative purpose, we show that DM mass of 440 PeV, can explain the observed flux. The required DM lifetime to produce the best-fit value of the neutrino flux saturates the existing gamma-ray bounds. Due to the large uncertainty in the flux, it is possible to explain the KM3NeT event from RHN DM decay at $3\sigma$ confidence level (CL) while being in agreement with gamma-ray bounds and non-observation of similar events at IceCube. While we consider a gauged $B-L$ scenario where DM relic can be generated due to other interactions, we also briefly discuss some alternate DM possibilities where the gamma-ray bounds can be alleviated compared to the minimal RHN DM discussed here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a coordinate-invariant expression for the photon deflection angle in the strong deflection limit (SDL) of stationary axisymmetric spacetimes. The key logarithmic-divergence coefficient is shown to depend only on quantities locally measurable by a zero-angular-momentum observer -- curvature scalars, the circumferential radius, and the proper angular velocity. The same coefficient governs the damping rate of quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the eikonal limit, establishing a curvature-based, model-independent connection between QNMs and lensing in the SDL near rotating compact objects.</description>
