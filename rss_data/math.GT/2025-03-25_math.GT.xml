      <title>Landing rays and ray Cannon-Thurston maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a hyperbolic subgroup H of a hyperbolic group G, we describe sufficient criteria to guarantee the following.
  1) Geodesic rays in H starting at the identity land at a unique point of the boundary of G.
  2)The inclusion of H into G does not extend continuously to the boundary.
  As a consequence we obtain sufficient conditions that provide a mechanism to guarantee the non-existence of Cannon-Thurston maps. One such criterion we use extensively is an adaptation of a property proven by Jeon, Kapovich, Leininger and Ohshika. As a consequence we describe a number of classes of examples demonstrating the non-existence of Cannon-Thurston maps. We recover, in the process, a simple counter-example lying at the heart of Baker and Riley's examples.</description>

      <title>A Remark on the Lewark-Zibrowius Invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture about the concordance invariant $\vartheta$, defined in a recent paper by Lewark and Zibrowius. This result simplifies the relation between $\vartheta$ and Rasmussen's $s$-invariant. The proof relies on Bar-Natan's tangle version of Khovanov homology or, more precisely, on its distillation in the case of 4-ended tangles into the immersed curve theory of Kotelskiy-Watson-Zibrowius.</description>

      <title>On a family of hyperbolic Brunnian links and their volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $n$-component link $L$ is said to be \emph{Brunnian} if it is non-trivial but every proper sublink of $L$ is trivial. The simplest and best known example of a hyperbolic Brunnian link is the 3-component link known as "Borromean rings". For $n\geq 2,$ we introduce an infinite family of $n$-component Brunnian links with positive integer parameters $Br(k_1, \ldots, k_n)$ that generalize examples constructed by Debrunner in 1964. We are interested in hyperbolic invariants of 3-manifolds $S^3 \setminus Br(k_1, \ldots, k_n)$ and we obtain upper bounds for their volumes. Our approach is based on Dehn fillings on cusped manifolds with volumes related to volumes of ideal right-angled hyperbolic antiprisms.</description>

      <title>On geometric representation of $\mathbb{L}$-homology classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this chapter we give a geometric representation of $H_{n}(B;\mathbb{L})$ classes, where $\mathbb{L}$ is the $4$-periodic surgery spectrum, by establishing a relationship between the normal cobordism classes ${\mathcal{N}}^{H}_{n}(B,\partial)$ and the $n$-th $\mathbb{L}$-homology of $B$, representing the elements of $H_{n}(B;\mathbb{L})$ by normal degree one maps with a reference map to $B$. More precisely, we prove that for every $n \ge 6$ and every finite complex $B,$ there exists a map $\Gamma: H_n(B;\mathbb{L}) \longrightarrow \mathcal{N}^{H}_{n}(B,\partial).$</description>

      <title>Cubulating the sphere with many facets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each $d\geq 3$ we construct cube complexes homeomorphic to the $d$-sphere with $n$ vertices in which the number of facets (assuming $d$ constant) is $\Omega(n^{5/4})$.
  This disproves a conjecture of Kalai's stating that the number of faces (of all dimensions) of cubical spheres is maximized by the boundaries of neighbourly cubical polytopes. The conjecture was already known to be false for $d=3$, $n=64$. Our construction disproves it for all $d\geq 3$ and $n$ sufficiently large. Moreover, since neighborly cubical polytopes have roughly $n (\log n)^{d/2}$ facets, we show that even the order of growth (at least for the number of facets) in the conjecture is wrong.</description>

      <title>Isospectrality of Margulis-Smilga spacetimes for irreducible representations of real split semisimple Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.12746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we look at real split semisimple algebraic groups $\mathsf{G}$ with trivial center and faithful irreducible algebraic representations $\mathtt{R}$ of $\mathsf{G}$ on some vector space $\mathsf{V}$ which admit zero as a weight and which are self-contragredient (for example, adjoint representation of $\mathsf{PSL}(n,\mathbb{R})$).
  We show that, there exist polynomials made out of Margulis invariants of $(g,X)\in\mathsf{G}\ltimes_\mathtt{R}\mathsf{V}$ which are also rational expressions in $(g,X)$. Moreover, we show that any Zariski dense finitely generated subgroup of $\mathsf{G}\ltimes_\mathtt{R}\mathsf{V}$, for which the linear parts of the non-identity elements are loxodromic, is isospectrally rigid with respect to the Margulis invariants. In particular, we show that Margulis--Smilga spacetimes are isospectrally rigid too.</description>

      <title>Anosov triangle reflection groups in SL(3,R)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.11349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify all Anosov representations of compact hyperbolic triangle reflection groups into the higher rank Lie group $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb R)$. Specifically, we prove that such a representation is Anosov if and only if either it lies in the Hitchin component of the representation space, or it lies in the "Barbot component" and the product of the three generators of the triangle group has distinct real eigenvalues. Unlike representations in the Hitchin component, Anosov representations in the Barbot component have non-convex boundary maps.</description>

      <title>Folding Branched Covers of the $3$-Sphere Branched over Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A folding of a branched cover of the 3-sphere that is branched over a knot is a continuous map of the cover into the product of the sphere with a disk that has the property that the projection onto the sphere factor induces the covering. Moreover, away from the branch set, the map is a general position immersion. Cyclic branched covers can be folded so that the map is an embedding when the disk factor is 2-dimensional. Dihedral branched covers can also be folded. In as much as possible, the foldings that are presented are quite detailed. In particular, the paper focuses upon a folding of the dihedral cover of the 3-sphere that is branched along a torus knot of type (2,5). The cover also is homeomorphic to the $3$-sphere.</description>

      <title>Weighted homology theory of orbifolds and Weighted Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.06794v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two new homology theories of orbifolds from some special type of triangulations adapted to orbifolds, called AW-homology and DW-homology. The main idea in the definitions of these two homology theories is that we use divisibly weighted simplices as the building blocks of an orbifold and encode the orders of the local groups of the orbifold in the boundary maps of their chain complexes so that these two theories can reflect some structural information of the singular set of the orbifold. We prove that AW-homology and DW-homology groups are invariants of compact orbifolds under orbifold isomorphisms and more generally under certain type of homotopy equivalences of orbifolds. Moreover, we find that there exists a natural graded commutative product in the cohomology theory corresponding to the DW-homology, which generalizes the cup product in the ordinary simplicial cohomology. In addition, we introduce a broader class of objects called weighted polyhedra and develop our AW-homology and DW-homology theory in this broader setting. Our goal is to generalize the whole simplicial homology and cohomology theory to any triangulable topological space with a weight function that is compatible with its triangulation.</description>

      <title>Friezes from surfaces and Farey triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a classification of positive integral friezes on marked bordered surfaces. The classification is similar to the Conway--Coxeter's one: positive integral friezes are in one-to-one correspondence with ideal triangulations supplied with a collection of rescaling constants assigned to punctures. For every triangulation the set of the collections of constants is finite and is completely determined by the valencies of vertices in the triangulation. In particular, it follows that the number of non-equivalent friezes on bordered surfaces is finite, and all friezes on unpunctured surfaces are unitary.</description>
