      <title>Wrinkling and imaging of thin curved sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin films or sheets subjected to external forces often undergo mechanical instability, leading to regular patterns of wrinkles, folds, and creases. As can be anticipated from the difficulty of flattening a curved globe, any natural curvature of the sheet will have a strong influence on these instabilities. Here, we develop a non-invasive synthetic schlieren imaging technique to image and reconstruct the surface of wrinkling curved sheets, confined to float on water. Our method circumvents the small-amplitude limit of related imaging techniques, and we demonstrate robust means to estimate the reconstruction accuracy. We then evaluate how the sign and magnitude of Gaussian curvature affects the wrinkling of thin curved sheets, and compare observations of the wrinkle wavelength, amplitude and domain structure with recent theoretical predictions. While generally validating model predictions, we find that the assumption of a conserved surface area during wrinkling should be treated with some care. The control of wrinkling behavior demonstrated here can have application in design of liquid lenses, microfluidics, active textured surfaces, and flexible electronic components.</description>

      <title>Modulational instability in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Bragg grating structures with four-wave mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of modulational instability (MI) in $\cal PT$-symmetric fiber Bragg gratings with a phenomenon of intermodulation known as four-wave mixing (FWM). Although the impact of FWM has already been analyzed in the conventional systems, the inclusion of gain and loss, which induces the notion of $\cal PT$- symmetry, gives rise to many noteworthy outcomes. These include the manifestation of an unusual double-loop structure in the dispersion curve, which was unprecedented in the context of conventional periodic structures. When it comes to the study of MI, which is usually obtained in the system by imposing a small amount of perturbations on the continuous wave by executing linear stability analysis, different regimes which range from conventional to broken $\cal PT$- symmetry tend to create quite a few types of MI spectra. Among them, we observe a unique MI pattern that mimics a tilted two-conical structure facing opposite to each other. In addition, we also address the impact of other non-trivial system parameters, such as input power, gain and loss and self-phase modulation in two important broad domains, including normal and anomalous dispersion regimes under the three types of $\cal PT$- symmetric conditions in detail.</description>

      <title>Tightly bound solitons and vortices in three-dimensional bosonic condensates with the electromagnetically-induced gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $1/r$ long-range interaction introduced by the laser beams offers a mechanism for the implementation of stable self-trapping in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in the three-dimensional free space. Using the variational approximation and numerical solution, we find that self-trapped states in this setting closely resemble tightly-bound compactons. This feature of the self-trapped states is explained by an analytical solution for their asymptotic tails. Further, we demonstrate that stable vortex quasi-compactons (QCs), with topological charges up to $6$ (at least), exist in the same setting. Addressing two-body dynamics, we find that pairs of ground states, as well as vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex pairs, form stably rotating bound states. Head-on collisions between vortex QCs under small kicks are inelastic, resulting in their merger into a ground state soliton that may either remain at the collision position or move aside, or alternatively, lead to the formation of a vortex that also moves aside.</description>

      <title>Exact periodic solutions of the generalized Constantin-Lax-Majda equation with dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present exact pole dynamics solutions to the generalized Constantin-Lax-Majda (gCLM) equation in a periodic geometry with dissipation $-\Lambda^\sigma$, where its spatial Fourier transform is $\widehat{\Lambda^\sigma}=|k|^\sigma$. The gCLM equation is a simplified model for singularity formation in the 3D incompressible Euler equations. It includes an advection term with parameter $a$, which allows different relative weights for advection and vortex stretching. There has been intense interest in the gCLM equation, and it has served as a proving ground for the development of methods to study singularity formation in the 3D Euler equations. Several exact solutions for the problem on the real line have been previously found by the method of pole dynamics, but only one such solution has been reported for the periodic geometry. We derive new periodic solutions for $a=0$ and $1/2$ and $\sigma=0$ and $1$, for which a closed collection of (periodically repeated) poles evolve in the complex plane. Self-similar finite-time blow-up of the solutions is analyzed and compared for the different values of $\sigma$, and to a global-in-time well-posedness theory for solutions with small data presented in a previous paper of the authors. Motivated by the exact solutions, the well-posedness theory is extended to include the case $a=0$, $\sigma \geq 0$. Several interesting features of the solutions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal patterns in a 2D lattice of Hindmarsh-Rose neurons induced by high-amplitude pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present numerical results for the effects of influence by high-amplitude periodic pulse series on a network of nonlocally coupled Hindmarsh-Rose neurons with 2D geometry of the topology. We consider the case when the pulse amplitude is larger than the amplitude of oscillations in the autonomous network for a wide range of pulse frequencies. An initial regime in the network is a spiral wave chimera. We show that the effects of external influence strongly depend on a balance between the pulse frequency and frequencies of the spectral peaks of the autonomous network. Except for the destructive role of the pulses, when they lead to loss of stability of the initial regime, we have also revealed a constructive role. We have found for the first time the emergence of a new type of multi-front spiral waves, when the wavefront represents a set of several close fronts, and the wave dynamics are significantly different from common spiral waves: neurons oscillate independently to the wave rotation, the rotation velocity is in many times less than for the common spiral wave, etc. We have also discovered several types of cluster spatiotemporal structures induced by the pulses.</description>

      <title>Exact solitary wave solutions for a coupled gKdV-Schrodinger system by a new ODE reduction method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new method is developed for finding exact solitary wave solutions of a generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation with p-power nonlinearity coupled to a linear Schr\"odinger equation arising in many different physical applications. This method yields 22 solution families, with p=1,2,3,4. No solutions for p&gt;1 were known previously in the literature. For p=1, four of the solution families contain bright/dark Davydov solitons of the 1st and 2nd kind, obtained in recent work by basic ansatze applied to the ODE system for travelling waves. All of the new solution families have interesting features, including bright/dark peaks with (up to) p symmetric pairs of side peaks in the amplitude and a kink profile for the nonlinear part in the phase. The present method is fully systematic and involves several novel steps which reduce the travelling wave ODE system to a single nonlinear base ODE for which all polynomial solutions are found by symbolic computation. It is applicable more generally to other coupled nonlinear dispersive wave equations as well as to nonlinear ODE systems of generalized H\'enon-Heiles form.</description>
