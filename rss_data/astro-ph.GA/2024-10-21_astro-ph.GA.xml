      <title>Identifying supermassive black hole recoil in elliptical galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stellar core growth in simulations of merging massive ($M_\star&gt;10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) elliptical galaxies by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) displaced by gravitational wave induced recoil velocity. With controlled, dense sampling of the SMBH recoil velocity, we find the core radius originally formed by SMBH binary scouring can grow by a factor of 2-3 when the recoil velocity exceeds $\sim50$ per cent of the central escape velocity, and the mass deficit grows by up to a factor of $\sim4$. Using Bayesian inference we predict the distribution of stellar core sizes formed through this process to peak at $\sim1\,\mathrm{kpc}$. An orbital decomposition of stellar particles within the core reveals that radial orbits dominate over tube orbits when the recoil velocity exceeds the velocity dispersion of the core, whereas tube orbits dominate for the lowest recoil kicks. A change in orbital structure is reflected in the anisotropy parameter, with a central tangential bias present only for recoil velocities less than the local stellar velocity dispersion. Emulating current integral field unit observations of the stellar line-of-sight velocity distribution, we uncover a distinct signature in the Gauss-Hermite symmetric deviation coefficient $h_4$ that uniquely constrains the core size due to binary scouring. This signature is insensitive to the later evolution of the stellar mass distribution due to SMBH recoil. Our results provide a novel method to estimate the SMBH recoil magnitude from observations of local elliptical galaxies, and implies these galaxies primarily experienced recoil velocities less than the stellar velocity dispersion of the core.</description>

      <title>The redshift evolution of the $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$ scaling relation: new insights from cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the co-evolution of black holes (BHs) and their host galaxies in the ASTRID and Illustris-TNG300 cosmological simulations and the Dark Sage Semi-Analytic Model (SAM), focusing on the evolution of the BH mass - stellar mass ($M_{\rm BH}-M_*$) relation. Due to differences in the adopted sub-grid modeling of BH seeding, dynamics, and feedback, the models differ in their predicted redshift evolution of the $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$ relation. We find that it is the interplay between the star formation rate (SFR) and the black hole accretion rate (BHAR) which drives the evolution of the mean relation. We define a quantity $\mathcal{R}$, the ratio between the specific BHAR and SFR (i.e. $\mathcal{R} \equiv\ $sBHAR/sSFR), and demonstrate that it is $\mathcal{R}$ that governs the evolution of individual sources in the $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$ plane. The efficiency of BH growth versus stellar mass growth in the sSFR-sBHAR plane reflects the partitioning of gas between fueling star formation versus BH accretion. This partitioning depends on the implementation of BH dynamics and the nature of how AGN feedback quenches galaxies. In the cosmological simulations (ASTRID and Illustris-TNG300), the BHAR and SFR are intrinsically linked, resulting in a tight $M_{\rm BH}-M_*$ correlation, while the Dark Sage SAM produces a significantly larger scatter. We discuss these results in the context of recently discovered over-massive BHs and massive quenched galaxies at high redshift by the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>An automated method to detect and characterise semi-resolved star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for automatically detecting and characterising semi-resolved star clusters: clusters where the observational point-spread function (PSF) is smaller than the cluster's radius, but larger than the separations between individual stars. We apply our method to a 1.77 deg$^2$ field located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds (VMC), which surveyed the LMC in the $YJK_\text{s}$ bands. Our approach first models the position-dependent PSF to detect and remove point sources from deep $K_\text{s}$ images; this leaves behind extended objects such as star clusters and background galaxies. We then analyse the isophotes of these extended objects to characterise their properties, perform integrated photometry, and finally remove any spurious objects this procedure identifies. We demonstrate our approach in practice on a deep VMC $K_\text{s}$ tile that contains the most active star-forming regions in the LMC: 30 Doradus, N158, N159, and N160. We select this tile because it is the most challenging for automated techniques due both to crowding and nebular emission. We detect 682 candidate star clusters, with an estimated contamination rate of 13% from background galaxies and chance blends of physically unrelated stars. We compare our candidates to publicly available James Webb Space Telescope data and find that at least 80% of our detections appear to be star clusters.</description>

      <title>Atomic and molecular gas as traced by [C II] emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest ALMA and JWST observations provide new information on the birth and evolution of galaxies in the early Universe, at the epoch of reionization. Of particular importance are measurements at redshift $ z &gt; 5$ of their cold-gas budget, which is known to be the main fuel for star formation. A powerful tool for probing the physics characterising galaxies at high redshift is the \CII\ $158\,\rm \mu m$ emission line. Due to its low excitation potential, \CII\ emission can be produced in photodissociation regions, neutral atomic gas and molecular clouds. To properly capture the cold-gas processes taking place in such environments (molecule formation, self-shielding, dust grain catalysis, photoelectric and cosmic-ray heating), we make use of a new set of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations (\coldsim) including time-dependent non-equilibrium chemistry, star formation, stellar evolution, metal spreading and feedback mechanisms. We are able to accurately track the evolution of \HI, \HII\ and H$_2$ in a cosmological context and predict the contribution of each gas phase to \CII\ luminosity. We provide formulas that can be used to estimate the mass of molecular and atomic gas from \CII\ detections. Furthermore, we analyse how conversion factors evolve with galactic properties, such as stellar metallicity, star formation rate and stellar mass. We demonstrate that \CII\ emission is dominated by \HI\ gas and most of the \CII\ luminosity is generated in warm, dense star-forming regions. Importantly, we conclude that, despite \CII\ tracing predominantly atomic rather than molecular gas, the \CII\ luminosity remains a robust indicator of the H$_2$ mass.</description>

      <title>First results from the JWST Early Release Science Program Q3D: The Fast Outflow in a Red Quasar at z=0.44</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasar feedback may play a key role in the evolution of massive galaxies. The dust-reddened quasar, F2M110648.35$+$480712 at $z = 0.4352$ is one of the few cases at its redshift that exhibits powerful quasar feedback through bipolar outflows. Our new observation with the integral field unit mode of Near-infrared Spectrograph onboard JWST opens a new window to examine this spectacular outflow through Pa$\alpha$ emission line with $\sim$3$\times$ better spatial resolution than previous work. The morphology and kinematics of the Pa$\alpha$ nebula confirm the existence of a bipolar outflow extending on a scale of $\sim$17$\times$14 kpc and with a velocity reaching $\sim$1100 km s$^{-1}$. The higher spatial resolution of our new observation leads to more reliable measurements of outflow kinematics. Considering only the spatially resolved outflow and assuming an electron density of 100 cm$^{-2}$, the mass, momentum and kinetic energy outflow rates are $\sim$50-210 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, $\sim$0.3-1.7$\times$10$^{36}$ dynes ($\sim$14-78\% of the quasar photon momentum flux) and $\sim$0.16-1.27$\times$10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\sim$0.02-0.20\% of the quasar bolometric luminosity), respectively. The local instantaneous outflow rates generally decrease radially. We infer that the quasar is powerful enough to drive the outflow, while stellar processes cannot be overlooked as a contributing energy source. The mass outflow rate is $\sim$0.4-1.5 times the star formation rate, and the ratio of kinetic energy outflow rate to the quasar bolometric luminosity is comparable to the minimum value required for negative quasar feedback in simulations. This outflow may help regulate the star formation activity within the system to some extent.</description>

      <title>Generalized rotation curves of the Milky Way from the GAIA DR3 data-set: constraints on mass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circular velocity curve traced by stars provides a direct means of investigating the potential and mass distribution of the Milky Way. Recent measurements of the Galaxy's rotation curve have revealed a significant decrease in velocity for galactic radii larger than approximately 15 kpc. While these determinations have primarily focused on the Galactic plane, the Gaia DR3 data also offer information about off-plane velocity components. By assuming the Milky Way is in a state of Jeans equilibrium, we derived the generalized rotation curve for radial distances spanning from 8.5 kpc to 25 kpc and vertical heights ranging from -2 kpc to 2 kpc. These measurements were employed to constrain the matter distribution using two distinct mass models. The first is the canonical NFW halo model, while the second, the dark matter disk (DMD) model, posits that dark matter is confined to the Galactic plane and follows the distribution of neutral hydrogen. The best-fitting NFW model yields a virial mass of $M_{\text{vir}} = (6.5 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{11} M_\odot$, whereas the DMD model indicates a total mass of $M_{\text{DMD}} = (1.7 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{11} M_\odot$. Our findings indicate that the DMD model generally shows a better fit to both the on-plane and off-plane behaviors at large radial distances of the generalized rotation curves when compared to the NFW model. We emphasize that studying the generalized rotation curves at different vertical heights has the potential to provide better constraints on the geometrical properties of the dark matter distribution.</description>

      <title>The Radcliffe Wave as traced by young open clusters: Stellar parameters, activity indicators, and abundances of solar-type members of eight young clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Radcliffe Wave has only recently been recognised as a about 3 kpc long coherent gas structure encompassing most of the star forming regions in the solar vicinity. Since its discovery, it has been mainly studied from the perspective of dynamics, but a detailed chemical study is necessary to understand its nature and the composition of the natal clouds that gave rise to it. In this paper we used some of the connected young open clusters (age $\lesssim$ 100 Myr) as tracers of the molecular clouds. We performed high-resolution spectroscopy with GIARPS at the TNG of 53 stars that are bona fide members of seven clusters located at different positions along the Radcliffe Wave. We provide radial velocities and atmospheric parameters for all of them. For a subsample consisting of 41 FGK stars we also studied the chromospheric activity and the content of Li, from which we inferred the age of the parent clusters. These values agree with the evolutionary ages reported in the literature. For these FGK stars we determined the chemical abundances for 25 species. Pleiades, ASCC 16 and NGC 7058 exhibit a solar metallicity while Melotte 20, ASCC 19, NGC 2232, and Roslund 6 show a slightly subsolar value ($\approx-$0.1 dex). On average, the clusters show a chemical composition compatible with that of the Sun, especially for $\alpha$- and Fe-peak elements. Neutron-capture elements, on the other hand, present a slight overabundance of about 0.2 dex, specially barium. Finally, considering also ASCC 123, studied by our group in a previous research, we infer a correlation between the chemical composition and the age or position of the clusters along the Wave, demonstrating their physical connection within an inhomogeneous mixing scenario.</description>

      <title>Quokka-based understanding of outflows (QED) -- II. X-ray metallicity gradients as a signature of galactic wind metal loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova-driven galactic outflows play a vital but still poorly-understood role in galactic chemical evolution, and one of the largest uncertainties about them is the extent to which they consist of supernova ejecta that are unmixed, or only poorly-mixed, with the remainder of the interstellar medium (ISM). Simulations of wind launching make a range of predictions about the extent of mixing between the wind and the ISM, but thus far these have proven challenging to test observationally. In this study, we post-process high-resolution simulations of outflows from the QED simulation suite to generate synthetic X-ray spectra from galactic winds, which we then analyse using standard observational procedures, in order to search for detectable markers of wind mixing. Our synthetic observations reveal that partially-mixed winds show significant and detectable metallicity gradients when viewed edge-on, with metallicity decreasing away from the central galactic disc. We explore how this signature results from imperfect mixing and the extent to which measurements of it can be used to diagnose the level of mixing in winds. We determine the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements for such measurements to be reliable, and provide a simple quantitative model that can be used to connect metallicity gradients to mixing between the hot ($T&gt;10^{6}$ K) and cold ($T&lt;10^{4}$ K) phases in observations that reach the required SNR, providing a framework to interpret current and future observations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of star associations in an SMBH-IMBH system: The case of IRS13 in the Galactic centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The existence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) still poses challenges to theoretical and observational astronomers. Several candidates have been proposed, including the one in the IRS13 cluster in the Galactic centre, where the evidence is based on the velocity dispersion of its members, however, none have been confirmed to date.
  Aims: We aim to gain insights into the presence of an IMBH in the Galactic centre by a numerical study of the dynamical interplay between an IMBH and star clusters (SCs) in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole (SMBH).
  Methods: We use high-precision N-body models of IRS13-like SCs in the Galactic centre, and of more massive SCs that fall into the centre of the Galaxy from larger distances.
  Results: We find that at IRS13's physical distance of 0.4 pc, an IRS13-size SC cannot remain gravitationally bound even if it contains an IMBH of thousands $M_\odot$. Thus, IRS13 appears to be an incidental present-day clumping of stars. Furthermore, we show that the velocity dispersion of tidally disrupted SCs (the likely origin of IRS13) can be fully accounted for by the tidal forces of the central SMBH; the IMBH's influence is not essential.</description>

      <title>Little time for oscillation: Fast disruption of the Radcliffe Wave by Galactic motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Radcliffe wave \cite{2020Natur.578..237A} is a 2.7 kpc long, 100 pc wide-like structure in the Galactic disk with a wave-like velocity structure \cite{2022MNRAS.517L.102L,2024arXiv240212596K}. A referent Nature paper \cite{2024arXiv240212596K} treated the Wave as a solid body in the disk plane, modeled its oscillation along the vertical direction, and derived the local Galactic mass distribution from the oscillation pattern. In reality, Galactic shear can stretch gas through differential rotation, whereas gas clouds experience epicyclic motions. We simulate the 3D evolution of the local interstellar gas and find shear and encyclic motion stretches the Radcliffe wave to almost twice its current length at the timescale of 45 Myr, within which only half a cycle of the proposed vertical oscillation occurs. The simulation also reveals the formation of new filaments and filament-filament mergers. Treating the Radcliffe wave as a solid body in the Galactic disk and an oscillating structure in the vertical direction is thus an oversimplification. Our data-driven simulation reveals the 3D evolution of the local interstellar gas with several processes at play, strengthening the role of the Solar Neighborhood as a unique test ground for theories of interstellar gas evolution.</description>

      <title>Super-Jeans fragmentation in massive star-forming regions revealed by triangulation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the fragmentation of the gas cloud and the formation of massive stars remains one of the most challenging questions of modern astrophysical research. Either the gas fragmentation in a Jeans-like fashion, after which the fragments grow through accretion, or the fragmentation length is larger than the Jeans length from the start. Despite significant observational efforts, a consensus has not been reached. The key is to infer the initial density distribution upon which gravitational fragmentation occurs. Since cores are the products of the fragmentation process, the distances between adjacent cores serve as a scale indicator. Based on this observation, we propose a Delaunay triangulation-based approach to infer the density structure before the fragmentation and establish the link between density distribution and gas fragmentation length. We find that at low density, the fragmenting is Jeans-like, and at high densities, the core separations are larger than the prediction of the Jeans fragmentation. This super-Jeans fragmentation, which often occurs in groups, is responsible for the clustered formation of massive stars.</description>

      <title>Rapid Dust Formation in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar dust links the formation of the first stars to the rocky planet we inhabit by playing a pivotal role in the cooling and fragmentation of molecular clouds, and catalyzing the formation of water and organic molecules. Despite its central role, the origin of dust and its formation timescale remain unknown. Some models favor rapid production in supernova ejecta as the primary origin of dust, while others invoke slower production by evolved asymptotic giant branch stars or grain growth in the interstellar medium (ISM). The dust content of young early-universe galaxies is highly sensitive to the dust formation timescales. Here, we evaluate the dust content of 631 galaxies at $3 &lt; z_{\rm spec} &lt; 14$ based on rest-UV to optical spectroscopy obtained with JWST NIRSpec. We find that dust appears rapidly. Attenuation immediately follows star formation on timescales shorter than $\sim 30$ Myr, favoring dust production by supernovae. The degree of attenuation is $\sim 30$ times lower than expected if the entire supernova dust yield were preserved in the ISM, and had Milky Way-like grain properties. This can be reconciled if the early-universe dust is composed mostly of silicate or grains much larger than those in the Milky Way, and if significant dust destruction or ejection by outflows takes place.</description>

      <title>Modelling absorption and emission profiles from accretion disc winds with WINE</title>

Abstract: Fast, massive winds are ubiquitously observed in the UV and X-ray spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and other accreting sources. Theoretical and observational evidences suggest they are launched at accretion disc scales, carrying significant mass and angular momentum. Thanks to such high energy output, they may play an important role in transferring the accretion energy to the surrounding environment. In the case of AGNs, this process can help setting the so-called coevolution between the AGN and its host galaxy. To precisely assess the effective role of these winds, it is necessary to accurately measure their properties, including mass and energy rates. We aim to maximise the scientific return of current and future observations by improving the theoretical modelling of these winds through our Winds in the Ionised Nuclear Environment (WINE) model. WINE is a spectroscopic model designed for disc winds in AGNs and compact accreting sources, which couples photoionisation and radiative transfer with special relativistic effects and a three-dimensional model of the emission profiles. We explore with WINE the main spectral features associated to AGN disc winds, with particular emphasis on the detectability of the wind emission. We simulate observations with the X-ray microcalorimeters Resolve on board the XRISM satellite and the future Athena's X-IFU for the typical properties and exposure times of the sources in the XRISM Performance Verification phase. The wind kinematic, geometry, ionisation and column density deeply affect shape and strength of the spectral features. Thanks to this, both Resolve and X-IFU will be able to accurately constrain the main properties of disc winds in a broad range of parameters. We also find a dramatic difference in the gas opacity when using a soft, Narrow Line Seyfert 1-like SED compared to a canonical powerlaw SED with spectral index Gamma=2.</description>

      <title>On Finding Black Holes in Photometric Microlensing Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are expected to be millions of isolated black holes in the Galaxy resulting from the death of massive stars. Measuring the abundance and properties of this remnant population would shed light on the end stages of stellar evolution and the evolution paths of black hole systems. Detecting isolated black holes is currently only possible via gravitational microlensing which has so far yielded one definitive detection. The difficulty in finding microlensing black holes lies in having to choose a small subset of events based on characteristics of their lightcurves to allocate expensive and scarce follow-up resources to confirm the identity of the lens. Current methods either rely on simple cuts in parameter space without using the full distribution information or are only effective on a small subsets of events. In this paper we present a new lens classification method. The classifier takes in posterior constraints on lightcurve parameters and combines them with a Galactic simulation to estimate the lens class probability. This method is flexible and can be used with any set of microlensing lightcurve parameters making it applicable to large samples of events. We make this classification framework available via the popclass python package. We apply the classifier to $\sim10,000$ microlensing events from the OGLE survey and find $23$ high-probability black hole candidates. Our classifier also suggests that the only known isolated black hole is an observational outlier according to current Galactic models and allocation of astrometric follow-up on this event was a high-risk strategy.</description>

      <title>Gaia Data Release 3: spectroscopic binary-star orbital solutions and the SB1 processing chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia is an astrometric space experiment that is measuring positions, proper motions as well as parallaxes for a huge number of stars. It operates a medium-dispersion spectrometer, the RVS, that provides spectra and thus radial velocity time-series. The paper is centred on the analysis of the RV time-series. We try to fit orbital and trend models and restrict ourselves to the objects of spectral types F-G-K brighter than magnitude 12 presenting only one single spectrum (SB1). Suitable time-series are processed and analysed object per object, providing orbital or trend solutions. The results of the various fits are further filtered on the basis of several quality measures in order to discard spurious solutions. The objects only having a spectroscopic solution are classified in one of the three classes SB1 (eccentric model), SB1C (circular model) or TrendSB1 (mere trend model). We detail the methods used and describe the derived parameters and results. After a description of the models considered, and of the related quality tests of the fit, we detail the internal filtering that is intended to reject bad solutions. We also present a full validation of the pipeline. A description of the current content of the catalogue is provided. We present the SB1, SB1C and the TrendSB1 spectroscopic solutions contained in the SB-subcatalogue which is part of the DR3 catalogue. We delivered some 181327 orbital solutions in the class SB1, 202 in the class SB1C and 56808 in the associated class TrendSB1. This is a first release and the delivered SB-subcatalogue could be tuned and refined. However the majority of the entries are correct; this data set constitutes by far the largest set of spectroscopic orbital solutions ever constituted.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Galaxy Clustering Predictions from Small-Volume Hydrodynamical Simulations via Control Variates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation are an invaluable tool for understanding galaxy formation and its impact on cosmological parameter inference from large-scale structure. However, their high computational cost is a significant obstacle for running simulations that probe cosmological volumes comparable to those analyzed by contemporary large-scale structure experiments. In this work, we explore the possibility of obtaining high-precision galaxy clustering predictions from small-volume hydrodynamical simulations such as MilleniumTNG and FLAMINGO via control variates. In this approach, the hydrodynamical full-physics simulation is paired with a matched low-resolution gravity-only simulation. By learning the galaxy-halo connection from the hydrodynamical simulation and applying it to the gravity-only counterpart, one obtains a galaxy population that closely mimics the one in the more expensive simulation. One can then construct an estimator of galaxy clustering that combines the clustering amplitudes in the small-volume hydrodynamical and gravity-only simulations with clustering amplitudes in a large-volume gravity-only simulation. Depending on the galaxy sample, clustering statistic, and scale, this galaxy clustering estimator can have an effective volume of up to around $100$ times the volume of the original hydrodynamical simulation in the non-linear regime. With this approach, we can construct galaxy clustering predictions from existing simulations that are precise enough for mock analyses of next-generation large-scale structure surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>Inverted EEMD: a robust method to identify narrow absorption features form spectral data and cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting information from complex data is a challenge shared by multiple frontiers of modern astrophysical research. Among those, analyzing spectra cubes, where the emission is mapped in the position-position-velocity space is a difficult task given the vast amount of information contained within. The cubes often contain a superposition of emissions and absorptions, where extracting absorption signatures is often necessary. One example is the extraction of narrow absorption structures in HI 21 cm emission spectra. These HI self-absorption (HISA) clouds trace the cold HI gas in interstellar space. We introduce an automatic and robust method called the \emph{inverted EEMD} method to extract narrow features from spectral cubes. Our method is based on the EEMD method, an established method to decompose 1d signals. The method is robust and parameter-free, making it useful in analyzing spectral cubes containing localized absorption signals of different types. The inverted-EEMD method is suitable for the analysis of spectral cubes where it can produce a cube containing the absorption signal and one containing the unabsorbed signal, where cold clouds can be identified as coherent regions in the absorption map. A Python implementation of the method is available at \url{https://github.com/zhenzhen-research/inverted_eemd_map}.</description>

      <title>The [OI] fine structure line profiles in Mon R2 and M17 SW: the puzzling nature of cold foreground material identified by [12CII] self-absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Recent studies of the optical depth comparing [12CII] and [13CII] line profiles in Galactic star-forming regions revealed strong self-absorption in [12CII] by low excitation foreground material, implying a large column density of C+ corresponding to an equivalent AV of a few, up to about 10 mag.
  Aims. As the nature and origin of such a large column of cold C+ foreground gas are difficult to explain, it is essential to constrain the physical conditions of this material.
  Methods. We conducted high-resolution observations of [OI] 63 um and [OI] 145 um lines in M17 SW and Mon R2. The [OI] 145 um transition traces warm PDR-material, while the [OI] 63 um line traces foreground material as manifested by absorption dips.
  Results. Comparison of both [OI] line profiles with [CII] isotopic lines confirms warm PDR-origin background emission and a significant column of cold foreground material causing self-absorption visible in [12CII] and [OI] 63 um profiles. In M17 SW, the C+ and O column densities are comparable for both layers. Mon R2 exhibits larger O columns compared to C+, indicating additional material where the carbon is neutral or in molecular form. Small-scale spatial variation of the foreground absorption profiles and the large column density (around 1E18 cm-2 ) of the foreground material suggest emission from high-density regions associated with the cloud complex, not a uniform diffuse foreground cloud.
  Conclusions. The analysis confirms that the previously detected intense [CII] foreground absorption is attributable to a large column of low excitation dense atomic material, where carbon is ionized, and oxygen is in neutral atomic form.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of High-velocity Clouds in the Galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of our Galaxy's high-velocity clouds (HVCs) remains a mystery after many decades of effort. In this paper, we use the TNG50 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project to identify cool, dense clouds that match observations of Galactic HI HVCs. We track these clouds back in time to determine their origin. For a TNG50 Milky Way-like galaxy, we find that only 17% of HVCs can be tracked directly to the disk, and 21% to material stripped out of satellites. The majority of HVCs (62%) arise from warm and hot circumgalactic gas that cools through thermal instability. They then obtain their anomalous velocities through interactions with the turbulent circumgalactic medium. At TNG50 resolution, we do not see evidence for HVCs forming out of very low metallicity intergalactic material. Instead, low metallicity HVCs are most likely associated with satellites. These results suggest that Galactic HVCs are highly heterogeneous in their origin, and can provide insight into the physical processes that shape the circumgalactic medium such as disk outflows, satellite accretion, and thermal instabilities.</description>

      <title>Revealing faint compact radio jets at redshifts above 5 with very long baseline interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, our knowledge of the high-redshift (z &gt; 5) radio quasars has expanded, thanks to dedicated high-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations. Distant quasars provide unique information about the formation and evolution of the first galaxies and supermassive black holes in the Universe. Powerful relativistic jets are likely to have played an essential role in these processes. However, the sample of VLBI-observed radio quasars is still too small to allow meaningful statistical conclusions. We extend the list of the VLBI observed radio quasars to investigate how the source structure and physical parameters are related to radio loudness. We assembled a sample of 10 faint radio quasars located at 5 &lt; z &lt; 6 with their radio-loudness indices spanning between 0.9-76. We observed the selected targets with the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 1.7 GHz. The milliarcsecond-scale resolution of VLBI at this frequency allows us to probe the compact innermost parts of radio-emitting relativistic jets. In addition to the single-band VLBI observations, we collected single-dish and low-resolution radio interferometric data to investigate the spectral properties and variability of our sources. The detection rate of this high-redshift, low-flux-density sample is 90%, with only one target (J0306+1853) remaining undetected. The other 9 sources appear core-dominated and show a single, faint and compact radio core on this angular scale. The derived radio powers are typical of FRII radio galaxies and quasars. By extending our sample with other VLBI-detected z &gt; 5 sources from the literature, we found that the core brightness temperatures and monochromatic radio powers tend to increase with radio loudness.</description>

      <title>Sequential formation of supermassive stars and heavy seed BHs through the interplay of cosmological cold accretion and stellar radiative feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive stars (SMSs) and heavy seed black holes, as their remnants, are promising candidates for Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) progenitors, especially for ones observed in the early universe $ z\simeq 8.5-10$ by recent JWST observations. Expected cradles of SMSs are the atomic cooling halos ($M_{\rm halo}\simeq 10^7~{\rm M_\odot}$), where "cold accretion" emerges and possibly forms SMSs. We perform a suit of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations and investigate star formation after the emergence of cold accretion, solving radiative feedback from stars inside the halo. We follow the mass growth of the protostars for $\sim 3~{\rm Myr}$, resolving the gas inflow down to $\sim 0.1~{\rm pc}$ scales. We discover that, after cold accretion emerges, multiple SMSs of $m_\star \gtrsim 10^5{\rm M_\odot}$ form at the halo centre with the accretion rates maintained at $\dot{m}_\star \simeq 0.04~{\rm M_\odot}~{\rm yr^{-1}}$ for $\lesssim 3~{\rm Myr}$. Cold accretion supplies gas at a rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm gas}\gtrsim 0.01-0.1~{\rm M_\odot}~{\rm yr^{-1}}$ from outside the halo virial radius to the central gas disc. Gravitational torques from spiral arms transport gas further inward, which feeds the SMSs. Radiative feedback from stars suppresses H$_2$ cooling and disc fragmentation, while photoevaporation is prevented by a dense envelope, which attenuates ionising radiation. Our results suggest that cold accretion can bring efficient BH mass growth after seed formation in the later universe. Moreover, cold accretion and gas migration inside the central disc increase the mass concentration and provide a promising formation site for the extremely compact stellar clusters observed by JWST.</description>

      <title>Measuring Star Formation Histories from Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars: A Demonstration in M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate how near infrared (NIR) imaging of resolved luminous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars can be used to measure well-constrained star formation histories (SFHs) across cosmic time. Using UKIRT J and K-band imaging of M31, we first show excellent agreement over the past $\sim8$ Gyr between the PHAT SFH of M31's outer disk derived from a deep optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD; $\sim3.3\times10^{7}$ stars with $M_{F814W} \lesssim +2$), and our spatially-matched SFH based only on modeling AGB stars on a NIR CMD ($\sim2.3\times10^{4}$ stars with $M_{J} \lesssim -5$). We find that only hundreds of AGB stars are needed for reliable SFH recovery, owing to their excellent age sensitivity in the NIR. We then measure the spatially resolved SFH of M31's inner stellar halo ($D_{M31, projected} \sim20-30$ kpc) using $\sim10^4$ AGB stars. We find: (i) a dominant burst of star formation across M31's inner stellar halo from $4-5$ Gyr ago and lower level, spatially distributed star formation $\sim1-2$ Gyr ago; (ii) a younger 'quenching time' in the vicinity of NGC 205 ($\sim1$ Gyr ago) than near M32 ($\sim1.6$ Gyr ago); (iii) $M_{\star}\sim4\pm0.5\times10^9 M_{\odot}$ formed over the past $\sim8$ Gyr. We discuss some caveats and the enormous potential of resolved AGB stars in the NIR for measuring SFHs back to ancient epochs ($\sim13$ Gyr ago) in galaxies to large distances ($D\gtrsim20$ Mpc) with JWST, Roman, and Euclid.</description>

      <title>A second view on the X-ray polarization of NGC 4151 with IXPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the second observing program of the active galactic nucleus NGC 4151 with simultaneous Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE; {\sim}750 ks), NuSTAR ({\sim}60 ks), XMM-Newton ({\sim}75 ks), and NICER ({\sim}65 ks) pointings. NGC 4151 is the first Type 1 radio-quiet Seyfert galaxy with constrained polarization properties for the X-ray corona. Despite the lower flux state in which the source is re-observed and the resulting higher contribution of the constant reflection component in the IXPE energy band, our results are in agreement with the first detection. From polarimetric analysis, a polarization degree {\Pi} = 4.7 {\pm} 1.3 percent and angle {\Psi} = 77{\deg} {\pm} 8{\deg} east of north (68 percent confidence level) are derived in the 2.0 - 8.0 keV energy range. Combining the two observations leads to polarization properties that are more constrained than those of the individual detections, showing {\Pi} = 4.5 {\pm} 0.9 percent and {\Psi} = 81{\deg} {\pm} 6{\deg} (with detection significance {\sim}4.6{\sigma}). The observed polarization angle aligns very well with the radio emission in this source, supporting, together with the significant polarization degree, a slab or wedge geometry for the X-ray corona. However, a switch in the polarization angle at low energies (37{\deg} {\pm} 7{\deg} in the 2 - 3.5 keV bin) suggests the presence of another component. When it is included in the spectro-polarimetric fit, a high polarization degree disfavors an interpretation in terms of a leakage through the absorbers, rather pointing to scattering from some kind of mirror.</description>

      <title>A Deeper Investigation of the Primordial Binary Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We hereby reported a new physical binary cluster (ASCC~19 and ASCC~21) near the Orion star-forming complex based on the data in the literature. Analysis of the results shows that it is a primordial binary cluster. It is possible that this binary cluster is undergoing two-body relaxation by inspecting the radial velocity anomalies of its member stars. In addition, based on the analysis of its metal abundances, we found that the components of this binary cluster may have been formed by the deep fusion of multiple subclusters. Finally, we investigated the 3D morphology of this binary cluster, simulated the trajectories of its components in the galactic disk, and concluded that its components may not merge into a single cluster.</description>

      <title>Gaia BH1 and BH2 -- evolutionary models with overshooting of the black hole progenitors within the present-day binary separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three black holes (BHs) in wide binaries - Gaia BH1, BH2 and BH3 - were recently discovered. The likely progenitors of the BHs were massive stars that experienced a supergiant phase, reaching radii of ~1000 Rsun, before collapsing to form the BH. Such radii are difficult to accommodate with the present-day orbits of BH1 and BH2 - with semi-major axes of 1.4 and 3.7 au, respectively. In this letter, we show that the maximal radii of the supergiants are not necessarily so large, and realistic stellar evolution models, with some assumed overshooting above the convective core into the radiative stellar envelope, produce substantially smaller maximal radii. The limited expansion of supergiants is consistent with the empirical Humphreys-Davidson limit - the absence of red supergiants above an upper luminosity limit, notably lower than the highest luminosity of main-sequence stars. We propose that the evolution that led to the formation of Gaia BH1 and BH2 simply did not involve an expansion to the cool supergiant phase.</description>
