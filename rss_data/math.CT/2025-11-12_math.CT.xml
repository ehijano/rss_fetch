      <title>Interval Decomposition of Infinite Persistence Modules over a Principal Ideal Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study pointwise free and finitely-generated persistence modules over a principal ideal domain, indexed by a (possibly infinite) totally-ordered poset category. We show that such persistence modules admit interval decompositions if and only if every structure map has free cokernel. We also show that, in torsion-free settings, the integer persistent homology module of a filtration of topological spaces admits an interval decomposition if and only if the associated persistence diagram is invariant to the choice of coefficient field. These results generalize prior work where the indexing category is finite.</description>

      <title>Partition Principle without Choice via Symmetric Iterations and Sheaf-Toposes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Partition Principal ($\mathsf{PP}$) asserts that every surjection $A\twoheadrightarrow B$ admits an injection $B\hookrightarrow A$.
  In $\mathsf{ZF}$, $\mathsf{AC}$ implies $\mathsf{PP}$, and $\mathsf{PP}$ implies choice from well-ordered families (ACWO), hence $\mathsf{PP}\Rightarrow\mathsf{DC}$.
  Whether $\mathsf{PP}$ implies $\mathsf{AC}$ remains open.
  This paper has two contributions.
  (1) Preservation under symmetric iterations.
  We prove that $\mathsf{DC}$ is preserved by countable and, more generally, by $&lt;\!\kappa$--support symmetric iterations satisfying a finite--support discipline and the local exactness properties we isolate (coherent selection, mixing/restriction preserving hereditary symmetry, and support--directed exactness for filtered colimits).
  (2) A sheaf--topos route to internal $\mathsf{PP}$ and external $\mathsf{ZF}+\mathsf{PP}+\neg\mathsf{AC}$.
  In the \'etal\'e sheaf topos $\mathbf E=\mathbf{Sh}(H\ltimes 2^{\mathbb N})$ we prove a {Local Embedding Property (LEP): for every epimorphism of displays there is a monomorphism in the opposite direction, hence the internal language of $\mathbf E$ validates $\mathsf{PP}$.
  Via the display representation and small--maps/AST hygiene (in particular, that monomorphisms are small), this yields a symmetric (external) model of $\mathsf{ZF}+\mathsf{PP}+\neg\mathsf{AC}$, together with an independent internal witness of $\neg\mathsf {AC}$.</description>

      <title>Left and right Bousfield localization on lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The key information of a model category structure on a poset is encoded in a transfer system, which is a combinatorial gadget, originally introduced to investigate homotopy coherence structures in equivariant homotopy theory. We describe how a transfer system associated with in a model structure on a lattice is affected by left and right Bousfield localization and provide a minimal generating system of morphisms which are responsible for the change in model structure. This leads to new concrete insights into the behavior of model categories on posets in general.</description>

      <title>Geometric Categories for Continuous Gauging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified categorical framework which encodes gauging of continuous and finite symmetries in arbitrary spacetime dimension. We show that electric symmetry breaking, resulting from the addition of charged matter, is implemented by this gauging procedure, and identify electric and magnetic symmetries expected in $G$-gauge theory. We work with geometric categories, i.e. categories internal to stacks. This allows us to extend (de)equivariantization of fusion categories to continuous groups, construct a functorial SymTFT and boundaries for this theory, and compute the relevant categories of endomorphisms and Drinfeld centers.</description>

      <title>Bornological LB-spaces and idempotent adjunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of an LB-space was introduced by Grothendieck in his 1953 th\`{e}se, referring to a countable colimit of Banach spaces taken within the category of locally convex topological vector spaces, and refining prior work done by Dieudonn\'{e}, Schwartz and K\"othe. Recently, two different notions of `bornological LB-spaces' emerged: one, given by Stempfhuber, refers to countable colimits of Banach spaces as well, but now taken in the category of bornological vector spaces. The other one, given by Bambozzi, Ben-Bassat and Kremnizer, refers to bornologifications of regular LB-spaces, i.e., of LB-spaces in the Grothendieck sense having the additional property that every bounded subset of the colimit is contained and bounded in one of its Banach steps. In this note, we show that the two notions are distinct, but nevertheless closely related. This involves, in particular, an intimate study of the idempotent adjunction of the bornologification and topologification functors.</description>

      <title>Coalgebraic models of Omega-groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate models of algebraic theories in the category of cocommutative coalgebras over a field. We establish some of their categorical properties, similar to those of algebraic varieties. We introduce a class of categories of coalgebraic models of algebraic theories endowed with an underlying structure of cocommutative Hopf algebra, and show that these categories are semi-abelian. We call them ``categories of Omega-Hopf algebras'', since it is possible to characterize them as coalgebraic models of algebraic theories of Omega-groups.</description>

      <title>Classification of metric fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study `a fibration of metric spaces' that was originally introduced by Leinster in the study of the magnitude and called metric fibrations. He showed that the magnitude of a metric fibration splits into the product of those of the fiber and the base, which is analogous to the Euler characteristic and topological fiber bundles. His idea and our approach is based on Lawvere's suggestion of viewing a metric space as an enriched category. Actually, the metric fibration turns out to be the restriction of the enriched Grothendieck fibrations to metric spaces. We give a complete classification of metric fibrations by several means, which is parallel to that of topological fiber bundles. That is, the classification of metric fibrations is reduced to that of `principal fibrations', which is done by the `1-Cech cohomology' in an appropriate sense. Here we introduce the notion of torsors in the category of metric spaces, and the discussions are analogous to the sheaf theory. Further, we can define the `fundamental group $\pi^m_1(X)$' of a metric space $X$, which is a group object in metric spaces, such that the conjugation classes of homomorphisms $Hom(\pi^m_1(X), G)$ corresponds to the isomorphism classes of `principal $G$-fibrations' over $X$. Namely, it is classified like topological covering spaces.</description>

      <title>A contramodule generalization of Neeman's flat and projective module theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10928v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper builds on top of arXiv:2306.02734. We consider a complete, separated topological ring $\mathfrak R$ with a countable base of neighborhoods of zero consisting of open two-sided ideals. The main result is that the homotopy category of projective left $\mathfrak R$-contramodules is equivalent to the derived category of the exact category of flat left $\mathfrak R$-contramodules, and also to the homotopy category of flat cotorsion left $\mathfrak R$-contramodules. In other words, a complex of flat $\mathfrak R$-contramodules is contraacyclic (in the sense of Becker) if and only if it is an acyclic complex with flat $\mathfrak R$-contramodules of cocycles, and if and only if it is coacyclic as a complex in the exact category of flat $\mathfrak R$-contramodules. These are contramodule generalizations of theorems of Neeman and of Bazzoni, Cortes-Izurdiaga, and Estrada.</description>

Abstract: We introduce rational $(\infty, 1)$-categories, which are $(\infty, 1)$-categories enriched in spaces whose higher homotopy groups are rational vector spaces. We provide two models for rational $(\infty, 1)$-categories, rational complete Segal spaces and rational Segal categories, and we show that they are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Silting reduction, relative AGK's construction and Higgs construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Calabi--Yau quadruple as a generalization of Iyama--Yang's Calabi--Yau triple. For each $(d+1)$-Calabi--Yau quadruple, we show that the associated Higgs category is a $d$-Calabi--Yau Frobenius extriangulated category, which moreover admits a canonical $d$-cluster-tilting subcategory. Concrete examples arise from the construction of relative cluster categories and Higgs categories in the setting of ice quivers with potentials, as well as from the singularity category of an isolated singularity. As an application, we prove that both the relative Amiot--Guo--Keller's construction and the Higgs construction of a $(d+1)$-Calabi--Yau quadruple take silting reduction to Calabi--Yau reduction.</description>

      <title>Games as recursive coalgebras: A categorical view on the Nim-sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1901, Bouton proved that a winning strategy of the game of Nim is given by the bitwise XOR, called the nim-sum. But, why does such a weird binary operation work? Led by this question, this paper introduces a categorical reinterpretation of combinatorial games and the nim-sum. The main categorical gadget used here is recursive coalgebras, which allow us to redefine games as ``graphs on which we can conduct recursive calculation'' in a concise and precise way.
  For game-theorists, we provide a systematic framework to decompose an impartial game into simpler games and synthesize the quantities on them, which generalizes the nim-sum rule for the Conway addition. To read the first half of this paper, the categorical preliminaries are limited to the definitions of categories and functors.
  For category theorists, this paper offers a nicely behaved category of games $\mathbf{Game}$, which is a locally finitely presentable symmetric monoidal closed category comonadic over $\mathbf{Set}$ admitting a subobject classifier!
  As this paper has several ways to be developed, we list seven open questions in the final section.</description>
