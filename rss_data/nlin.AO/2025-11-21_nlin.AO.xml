      <title>Generalized Wilson-Cowan model with short term synaptic plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalized version of the Wilson-Cowan (WC) model is proposed which accounts for the evolution of the synaptic resources. Adiabatic elimination of the fast variables is performed to yield a simplified framework for the coupled interaction between active excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The latter model is shown to smoothly converge to the benchmark WC model, when the appropriate limit is performed. Different dynamical regimes are identified for the reduced model and commented upon with reference to the original formulation of the generalized dynamics. This includes identifying limit cycle oscillations for population of available resources.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller in Mobile Robotic Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile robotic manipulators (MRMs), which integrate mobility and manipulation capabilities, present significant control challenges due to their nonlinear dynamics, underactuation, and coupling between the base and manipulator subsystems. This paper proposes a novel homogeneous Proportional-Integral-Derivative (hPID) control strategy tailored for MRMs to achieve robust and coordinated motion control. Unlike classical PID controllers, the hPID controller leverages the mathematical framework of homogeneous control theory to systematically enhance the stability and convergence properties of the closed-loop system, even in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances involved into a system in a homogeneous way. A homogeneous PID structure is designed, ensuring improved convergence of tracking errors through a graded homogeneity approach that generalizes traditional PID gains to nonlinear, state-dependent functions. Stability analysis is conducted using Lyapunov-based methods, demonstrating that the hPID controller guarantees global asymptotic stability and finite-time convergence under mild assumptions. Experimental results on a representative MRM model validate the effectiveness of the hPID controller in achieving high-precision trajectory tracking for both the mobile base and manipulator arm, outperforming conventional linear PID controllers in terms of response time, steady-state error, and robustness to model uncertainties. This research contributes a scalable and analytically grounded control framework for enhancing the autonomy and reliability of next-generation mobile manipulation systems in structured and unstructured environments.</description>

      <title>Division Strategies Determine Growth and Viability of Growing-Dividing Autocatalytic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a geometric framework to study the growth-division dynamics of cells and protocells, and demonstrate that self-reproduction emerges only when a system's growth dynamics and division strategy are mutually compatible. Using several commonly used models (the linear Hinshelwood cycle and non-linear coarse-grained models of protocells and bacteria), we show that, depending on the chosen division mechanism, the same chemical system can exhibit either (i) balanced exponential growth, (ii) balanced nonexponential growth, or (iii) system death (where the system either diverges to infinity or collapses to zero over successive generations). In particular, we show that cellular trajectories in an N-dimensional phase space (where N is the number of distinct chemical species) shuttle between two N-1 dimensional surfaces - a division surface and a birth surface - and that the relationship between these surfaces and the growth trajectories determine something as fundamental as cellular homeostasis and self-reproduction. Geometrically visualizing bacterial growth and division uncovers, for the first time, the type of division processes that sustain or destroy cellular homeostasis in autocatalytic chemical systems, thereby offering strategies to stabilize or destabilize growing-dividing systems. This reveals that, in addition to autocatalysis of growth, division mechanisms are not passive bystanders but active determinants of a growing-dividing system's long-term fate. Our work thus provides a framework for further exploration of growing dividing systems that will aid in the design of self-reproducing synthetic cells.</description>

      <title>Binary Decision Process in Pre-Evacuation Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08284v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In crowd evacuation the time interval before decisive movement towards a safe place is defined as the pre-evacuation phase, and it has crucial impact on the total time required for safe egress. This process mainly refers to situation awareness and response to an external stressors, e.g., fire alarms. Due to the complexity of human cognitive process, simulation is used to study this important time interval. In this paper a binary decision process is formulated to simulate pre-evacuation time of many evacuees in a given social context. The model combines the classic opinion dynamics (the French-DeGroot model) with binary phase transition to describe how group pre-evacuation time emerges from individual interaction. The model parameters are quantitatively meaningful to human factors research within socio-psychological background, e.g., whether an individual is stubborn or open-minded, or what kind of the social topology exists among the individuals and how it matters in aggregating individuals into social groups. The modeling framework also describes collective motion of many evacuee agents in a planar space, and the resulting multi-agent system is partly similar to the Vicsek flocking model, and it is meaningful to explore complex social behavior during phase transition of a non-equilibrium process.</description>

      <title>Threshold model of language competition including the bilingual state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a threshold model of language competition which includes intermediate bilingual state. The model is based on the Minett-Wang model but through the introduction of thresholds in the language shift rates it incorporates the effects of memory and learning. The model is piecewise-linear, allowing the exact analytical treatment. We study the symmetric case where two competing languages are equivalent in terms of status and social pressure and provide a complete list of the various dynamical regimes. We also study several limiting regimes corresponding to asymmetric systems and characterize the full spectrum of possible asymptotic behaviors. Unlike the Minett-Wang model, which always predicts the extinction of one of the languages, the proposed new model exhibits a wide range of possible equilibrium scenarios, including equilibrium states of coexistence. Most commonly, in such coexistence regimes the minority language speakers are either completely monolingual or completely bilingual.</description>
