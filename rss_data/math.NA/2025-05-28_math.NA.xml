      <title>Maxwell \`a la Helmholtz: Electromagnetic scattering by 3D perfect electric conductors via Helmholtz integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20440v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel class of indirect boundary integral equation (BIE) formulations for the solution of electromagnetic scattering problems involving smooth perfectly electric conductors (PECs) in three-dimensions. These combined-field-type BIE formulations rely exclusively on classical Helmholtz boundary operators, resulting in provably well-posed, frequency-robust, Fredholm second-kind BIEs. Notably, we prove that the proposed formulations are free from spurious resonances, while retaining the versatility of Helmholtz integral operators. The approach is based on the equivalence between the Maxwell PEC scattering problem and two independent vector Helmholtz boundary value problems for the electric and magnetic fields, with boundary conditions defined in terms of the Dirichlet and Neumann traces of the corresponding vector Helmholtz solutions. While certain aspects of this equivalence (for the electric field) have been previously exploited in the so-called field-only BIE formulations, we here rigorously establish and generalize the equivalence between Maxwell and Helmholtz problems for both fields. Finally, a variety of numerical examples highlights the robustness and accuracy of the proposed approach when combined with Density Interpolation-based Nystr\"om methods and fast linear algebra solvers, implemented in the open-source Julia package Inti$.$jl.</description>

      <title>Tensor finite elements for smectic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a tensor-based finite element scheme for a smectic-A liquid crystal model. We propose a simple C\'ea-type finite element projection in the linear case and prove its quasi-optimal convergence. Special emphasis is put on the formulation and treatment of appropriate boundary conditions. For the nonlinear case we present a formulation in two space dimensions and prove the existence of a solution. We propose a discretization that extends the linear case in Uzawa-fashion to the nonlinear case by an additional Poisson solver. Numerical results illustrate the performance and convergence of our schemes.</description>

      <title>Superfast 1-Norm Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A matrix algorithm is said to be superfast (that is, runs at sublinear cost) if it involves much fewer scalars and flops than the input matrix has entries. Such algorithms have been extensively studied and widely applied in modern computations for matrices with low displacement rank and more recently for low-rank approximation of matrices, even though they are known to fail on worst-case inputs in the latter application. We devise novel superfast algorithms that consistently produce accurate 1-norm estimates for real-world matrices and discuss some promising extensions of our surprisingly simple techniques. With further testing and refinement, our algorithms can potentially be adopted in practical computations.</description>

      <title>A minimax method for the spectral fractional Laplacian and related evolution problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical method for the approximation of the inverse of the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{s}$, based on its spectral definition, using rational functions to approximate the fractional power $A^{-s}$ of a matrix $A$, for $0&lt;s&lt;1$. The proposed numerical method is fast and accurate, benefiting from the fact that the matrix $A$ arises from a finite element approximation of the Laplacian $-\Delta$, which makes it applicable to a wide range of domains with potentially irregular shapes. We make use of state-of-the-art software to compute the best rational approximation of a fractional power. We analyze the convergence rate of our method and validate our findings through a series of numerical experiments with a range of exponents $s \in (0,1)$. Additionally, we apply the proposed numerical method to different evolution problems that involve the fractional Laplacian through an interaction potential: the fractional porous medium equation and the fractional Keller-Segel equation. We then investigate the accuracy of the resulting numerical method, focusing in particular on the accurate reproduction of qualitative properties of the associated analytical solutions to these partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Connecting randomized iterative methods with Krylov subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized iterative methods, such as the randomized Kaczmarz method, have gained significant attention for solving large-scale linear systems due to their simplicity and efficiency. Meanwhile, Krylov subspace methods have emerged as a powerful class of algorithms, known for their robust theoretical foundations and rapid convergence properties. Despite the individual successes of these two paradigms, their underlying connection has remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we develop a unified framework that bridges randomized iterative methods and Krylov subspace techniques, supported by both rigorous theoretical analysis and practical implementation. The core idea is to formulate each iteration as an adaptively weighted linear combination of the sketched normal vector and previous iterates, with the weights optimally determined via a projection-based mechanism. This formulation not only reveals how subspace techniques can enhance the efficiency of randomized iterative methods, but also enables the design of a new class of iterative-sketching-based Krylov subspace algorithms. We prove that our method converges linearly in expectation and validate our findings with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>An Operator-Splitting Scheme for Viscosity Solutions of Constrained Second-Order PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20618v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel operator-splitting scheme for approximating viscosity solutions of constrained second-order partial differential equations (PDEs) with low-regularity solutions in \( C(\overline{\Omega}_T) \cap H^1(\Omega_T) \). By decoupling PDE evolution and constraint enforcement, the scheme leverages stabilized finite elements and implicit Euler time-stepping to ensure consistency, stability, and monotonicity, guaranteeing convergence to the unique viscosity solution via the Barles-Souganidis framework. The method supports vector-valued constraints and unstructured meshes, addressing challenges in traditional approaches such as restrictive stability conditions and ill-conditioned systems. Theoretical analysis demonstrates a convergence rate of \( O(h^{1-\epsilon}) \) with a proper chosen time step. Applications to Hamilton-Jacobi equations, reaction-diffusion systems, and two-phase Navier-Stokes flows highlight the scheme's versatility and robustness, positioning it as a significant advancement in numerical methods for constrained nonlinear PDEs.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Conjugate Gradient Preconditioners for Solving Symmetric Positive Definite Systems of Linear Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite hundreds of papers on preconditioned linear systems of equations, there remains a significant lack of comprehensive performance benchmarks comparing various preconditioners for solving symmetric positive definite (SPD) systems. In this paper, we present a comparative study of 79 matrices using a broad range of preconditioners. Specifically, we evaluate 10 widely used preconditoners across 108 configurations to assess their relative performance against using no preconditioner. Our focus is on preconditioners that are commonly used in practice, are available in major software packages, and can be utilized as black-box tools without requiring significant \textit{a priori} knowledge. In addition, we compare these against a selection of classical methods. We primarily compare them without regards to effort needed to compute the preconditioner. Our results show that symmetric positive definite systems are mostly likely to benefit from incomplete symmetric factorizations, such as incomplete Cholesky (IC). Multigrid methods occasionally do exceptionally well. Simple classical techniques, symmetric Gauss Seidel and symmetric SOR, are not productive. We find that including preconditioner construction costs significantly diminishes the advantages of iterative methods compared to direct solvers; although, tuned IC methods often still outperform direct methods. Additionally, ordering strategies such as approximate minimum degree significantly enhance IC effectiveness. We plan to expand the benchmark with larger matrices, additional solvers, and detailed metrics to provide actionable information on SPD preconditioning.</description>

      <title>A Nested Krylov Method Using Half-Precision Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-precision computing is essential for efficiently utilizing memory bandwidth and computing cores. While many mixed-precision algorithms have been developed for iterative sparse linear solvers, effectively leveraging half-precision (fp16) arithmetic remains challenging. This study introduces a novel nested Krylov approach that integrates the flexible GMRES and Richardson methods in a deeply nested structure, progressively reducing precision from double-precision to fp16 toward the innermost solver. To avoid meaningless computations beyond precision limits, the low-precision inner solvers perform only a few iterations per invocation, while the nested structure ensures their frequent execution. Numerical experiments show that using fp16 in the approach directly enhances solver performance without compromising convergence, achieving speedups of up to 1.65x and 2.42x over double-precision and double-single mixed-precision implementations, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method outperforms or matches other standard Krylov solvers, including restarted GMRES, CG, and BiCGStab methods.</description>

      <title>Domain Decomposition Subspace Neural Network Method for Solving Linear and Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a domain decomposition subspace neural network method for efficiently solving linear and nonlinear partial differential equations. By combining the principles of domain decomposition and subspace neural networks, the method constructs basis functions using neural networks to approximate PDE solutions. It imposes $C^k$ continuity conditions at the interface of subdomains, ensuring smoothness across the global solution. Nonlinear PDEs are solved using Picard and Newton iterations, analogous to classical methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method achieves exceptionally high accuracy, with errors reaching up to $10^{-13}$, while significantly reducing computational costs compared to existing approaches, including PINNs, DGM, DRM. The results highlight the method's superior accuracy and training efficiency.</description>

      <title>Scattering Networks on Noncommutative Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering Networks were initially designed to elucidate the behavior of early layers in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) over Euclidean spaces and are grounded in wavelets. In this work, we introduce a scattering transform on an arbitrary finite group (not necessarily abelian) within the context of group-equivariant convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs). We present wavelets on finite groups and analyze their similarity to classical wavelets. We demonstrate that, under certain conditions in the wavelet coefficients, the scattering transform is non-expansive, stable under deformations, preserves energy, equivariant with respect to left and right group translations, and, as depth increases, the scattering coefficients are less sensitive to group translations of the signal, all desirable properties of convolutional neural networks. Furthermore, we provide examples illustrating the application of the scattering transform to classify data with domains involving abelian and nonabelian groups.</description>

      <title>A mathematical analysis of the discretized IPT-DMFT equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous contribution (E. Canc\`es, A. Kirsch and S. Perrin--Roussel, arXiv:2406.03384), we have proven the existence of a solution to the Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) equations under the Iterated Perturbation Theory (IPT-DMFT) approximation. In view of numerical simulations, these equations need to be discretized. In this article, we are interested in a discretization of the \acrshort{ipt}-\acrshort{dmft} functional equations, based on the restriction of the hybridization function and local self-energy to a finite number of points in the upper half-plane $\left(i\omega_n\right)_{n \in |[0,N_\omega]|}$, where $\omega_n=(2n+1)\pi / \beta$ is the $n$-th Matsubara frequency and $N_\omega \in \mathbb N$. We first prove the existence of solutions to the discretized equations in some parameter range depending on $N_\omega$. We then prove uniqueness for a smaller range of parameters. We also study more in depth the case of bipartite systems exhibiting particle-hole symmetry. In this case, the discretized IPT-DMFT equations have purely imaginary solutions, which can be obtained by solving a real algebraic system of $(N_\omega+1)$ equations with $(N_\omega+1)$ variables. We provide a complete characterization of the solutions for $N_\omega=0$ and some results for $N_\omega=1$ in the simple case of the Hubbard dimer. We finally present some numerical simulations on the Hubbard dimer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07672v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient restarting has been shown to improve the numerical performance of accelerated gradient methods. This paper provides a mathematical analysis to understand these advantages. First, we establish global linear convergence guarantees for both the original and gradient restarted accelerated proximal gradient method when solving strongly convex composite optimization problems. Second, through analysis of the corresponding ordinary differential equation model, we prove the continuous trajectory of the gradient restarted Nesterov's accelerated gradient method exhibits global linear convergence for quadratic convex objectives, while the non-restarted version provably lacks this property by [Su, Boyd, and Cand\'es, \textit{J. Mach. Learn. Res.}, 2016, 17(153), 1-43].</description>

      <title>Preconditioned Langevin Dynamics with Score-Based Generative Models for Infinite-Dimensional Linear Bayesian Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing algorithms for solving high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems directly in infinite-dimensional function spaces - where such problems are naturally formulated - is crucial to ensure stability and convergence as the discretization of the underlying problem is refined. In this paper, we contribute to this line of work by analyzing a widely used sampler for linear inverse problems: Langevin dynamics driven by score-based generative models (SGMs) acting as priors, formulated directly in function space. Building on the theoretical framework for SGMs in Hilbert spaces, we give a rigorous definition of this sampler in the infinite-dimensional setting and derive, for the first time, error estimates that explicitly depend on the approximation error of the score. As a consequence, we obtain sufficient conditions for global convergence in Kullback-Leibler divergence on the underlying function space. Preventing numerical instabilities requires preconditioning of the Langevin algorithm and we prove the existence and the form of an optimal preconditioner. The preconditioner depends on both the score error and the forward operator and guarantees a uniform convergence rate across all posterior modes. Our analysis applies to both Gaussian and a general class of non-Gaussian priors. Finally, we present examples that illustrate and validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Semi-Explicit Neural DAEs: Learning Long-Horizon Dynamical Systems with Algebraic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the promise of scientific machine learning (SciML) in combining data-driven techniques with mechanistic modeling, existing approaches for incorporating hard constraints in neural differential equations (NDEs) face significant limitations. Scalability issues and poor numerical properties prevent these neural models from being used for modeling physical systems with complicated conservation laws. We propose Manifold-Projected Neural ODEs (PNODEs), a method that explicitly enforces algebraic constraints by projecting each ODE step onto the constraint manifold. This framework arises naturally from semi-explicit differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), and includes both a robust iterative variant and a fast approximation requiring a single Jacobian factorization. We further demonstrate that prior works on relaxation methods are special cases of our approach. PNODEs consistently outperform baselines across six benchmark problems achieving a mean constraint violation error below $10^{-10}$. Additionally, PNODEs consistently achieve lower runtime compared to other methods for a given level of error tolerance. These results show that constraint projection offers a simple strategy for learning physically consistent long-horizon dynamics.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Neural Operators: Stable Long-Term PDE Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning solution operators of partial differential equations. However, in time-dependent problems, standard training strategies such as teacher forcing introduce a mismatch between training and inference, leading to compounding errors in long-term autoregressive predictions. To address this issue, we propose Recurrent Neural Operators (RNOs)-a novel framework that integrates recurrent training into neural operator architectures. Instead of conditioning each training step on ground-truth inputs, RNOs recursively apply the operator to their own predictions over a temporal window, effectively simulating inference-time dynamics during training. This alignment mitigates exposure bias and enhances robustness to error accumulation. Theoretically, we show that recurrent training can reduce the worst-case exponential error growth typical of teacher forcing to linear growth. Empirically, we demonstrate that recurrently trained Multigrid Neural Operators significantly outperform their teacher-forced counterparts in long-term accuracy and stability on standard benchmarks. Our results underscore the importance of aligning training with inference dynamics for robust temporal generalization in neural operator learning.</description>

      <title>A Hyperbolic Approximation of the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a first-order hyperbolic approximation of
  the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation. We show that the system
  is strictly hyperbolic and possesses a modified Hamiltonian structure, along with
  at least three conserved quantities that approximate those of NLS.
  We provide families of explicit standing-wave solutions to the hyperbolic system,
  which are shown to converge uniformly to ground-state solutions
  of NLS in the relaxation limit.
  The system is formally equivalent to NLS in the relaxation limit, and we
  develop asymptotic preserving discretizations that tend to a consistent discretization
  of NLS in that limit, while also conserving mass.
  Examples for both the focusing and defocusing regimes demonstrate that the
  numerical discretization provides an accurate approximation of the NLS
  solution.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a damped Newton's method for discrete Monge-Ampere functions with a prescribed asymptotic cone</title>

      <description>arXiv:1911.00260v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For finite difference discretizations with linear complexity and provably convergent to weak solutions of the second boundary value problem for the Monge-Amp\`ere equation, we give the first proof of uniqueness. The boundary condition is enforced through the use of the notion of asymptotic cone while the differential operator is discretized based on a discrete analogue of the subdifferential. We establish the convergence of a subsequence of a damped Newton's method for the nonlinear system resulting from the discretization, thereby proving the existence of a solution. Using related arguments we then prove that such a solution is necessarily unique. Convergence of the discretization as well as numerical experiments are given.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction Formulae for 3D Field-Free Line Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a promising noninvasive in vivo imaging modality that makes it possible to map the spatial distribution of superparamagnetic nanoparticles by exposing them to dynamic magnetic fields. In the Field-Free Line (FFL) scanner topology, the spatial encoding of the particle distribution is performed by applying magnetic fields vanishing on straight lines. The voltage induced in the receiving coils by the particles when exposed to the magnetic fields constitute the signal from which the particle distribution is to be reconstructed. To avoid lengthy calibration, model-based reconstruction formulae have been developed for the 2D FFL scanning topology. In this work we develop reconstruction formulae for 3D FFL. Moreover, we provide a model-based reconstruction algorithm for 3D FFL and we validate it with a numerical experiment.</description>

      <title>Low-rank tensor product Richardson iteration for radiative transfer in plane-parallel geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiative transfer equation (RTE) has been established as a fundamental tool for the description of energy transport, absorption and scattering in many relevant societal applications, and requires numerical approximations. However, classical numerical algorithms scale unfavorably with respect to the dimensionality of such radiative transfer problems, where solutions depend on physical as well as angular variables. In this paper we address this dimensionality issue by developing a low-rank tensor product framework for the RTE in plane-parallel geometry. We exploit the tensor product nature of the phase space to recover an operator equation where the operator is given by a short sum of Kronecker products. This equation is solved by a preconditioned and rank-controlled Richardson iteration in Hilbert spaces. Using exponential sums approximations we construct a preconditioner that is compatible with the low-rank tensor product framework. The use of suitable preconditioning techniques yields a transformation of the operator equation in Hilbert space into a sequence space with Euclidean inner product, enabling rigorous error and rank control in the Euclidean metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the iterative solution of anisotropic radiative transfer problems using residual minimization over suitable subspaces. We show convergence of the resulting iteration using Hilbert space norms, which allows us to obtain algorithms that are robust with respect to finite-dimensional realizations via Galerkin projections. We investigate in particular the behavior of the iterative scheme for discontinuous Galerkin discretizations in the angular variable in combination with subspaces that are derived from related diffusion problems. The performance of the resulting schemes is investigated in numerical examples for highly anisotropic scattering problems with heterogeneous parameters.</description>

      <title>{\varphi}-FD : A well-conditioned finite difference method inspired by {\varphi}-FEM for general geometries on elliptic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new finite difference method, called {\varphi}-FD, inspired by the {\phi}-FEM approach for solving elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) on general geometries. The proposed method uses Cartesian grids, ensuring simplicity in implementation. Moreover, contrary to the previous finite difference scheme on non-rectangular domain, the associated matrix is well-conditioned. The use of a level-set function for the geometry description makes this approach relatively flexible. We prove the quasi-optimal convergence rates in several norms and the fact that the matrix is well-conditioned. Additionally, the paper explores the use of multigrid techniques to further accelerate the computation. Finally, numerical experiments in both 2D and 3D validate the performance of the {\varphi}-FD method compared to standard finite element methods and the Shortley-Weller approach.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Solving of Linear Systems via Asynchronous Randomized Block Projections in ROS2 Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an event-triggered asynchronous distributed randomized block Kaczmarz projection (ER-AD-RBKP) algorithm for efficiently solving large-scale linear systems in resource-constrained and communication-unstable environments. The algorithm enables each agent to update its local state estimate independently and engage in communication only when specific triggering conditions are satisfied, thereby significantly reducing communication overhead. At each iteration, agents project onto randomized subsets of local data blocks to lower computational cost and enhance scalability.
  From a theoretical standpoint, we establish exponential convergence conditions for the proposed algorithm. By defining events that ensure strong connectivity in the communication graph, we derive sufficient conditions for global convergence under a probabilistic framework. Our analysis guarantees that the algorithm is guaranteed to converge in expectation under mild probabilistic assumptions, provided that persistent agent isolation is avoided. For inconsistent systems, auxiliary variables are incorporated to transform the problem into an equivalent consistent formulation, and theoretical error bounds are derived.
  For practical evaluation, we implement the ER-AD-RBKP algorithm in an asynchronous communication environment built on ROS2, a distributed middleware framework for real-time robotic systems. We evaluate the algorithm under various settings, including varying numbers of agents, neighborhood sizes, communication intervals, and failure scenarios such as communication disruptions and processing faults. Experimental results demonstrate robust performance in terms of computational efficiency, communication cost, and system resilience, highlighting its strong potential for practical applicability in real-world distributed systems.</description>

      <title>A data augmentation strategy for deep neural networks with application to epidemic modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we integrate the predictive capabilities of compartmental disease dynamics models with machine learning ability to analyze complex, high-dimensional data and uncover patterns that conventional models may overlook. Specifically, we present a proof of concept demonstrating the application of data-driven methods and deep neural networks to a recently introduced Susceptible-Infected-Recovered type model with social features, including a saturated incidence rate, to improve epidemic prediction and forecasting. Our results show that a robust data augmentation strategy trough suitable data-driven models can improve the reliability of Feed-Forward Neural Networks and Nonlinear Autoregressive Networks, providing a complementary strategy to Physics-Informed Neural Networks, particularly in settings where data augmentation from mechanistic models can enhance learning. This approach enhances the ability to handle nonlinear dynamics and offers scalable, data-driven solutions for epidemic forecasting, prioritizing predictive accuracy over the constraints of physics-based models. Numerical simulations of the lockdown and post-lockdown phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy and Spain validate our methodology.</description>

      <title>A high-order combined interpolation/finite element technique for evolutionary coupled groundwater-surface water problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A high-order combined interpolation/finite element technique is developed for solving the coupled groundwater-surface water system that governs flows in karst aquifers. In the proposed high-order scheme we approximate the time derivative with piecewise polynomial interpolation of second-order and use the finite element discretization of piecewise polynomials of degree $d$ and $d+1$, where $d \geq 2$ is an integer, to approximate the space derivatives. The stability together with the error estimates of the constructed technique are established in $L^{\infty}(0,T;\text{\,}L^{2})$-norm. The analysis suggests that the developed computational technique is unconditionally stable, temporal second-order accurate and convergence in space of order $d+1$. Furthermore, the new approach is faster and more efficient than a broad range of numerical methods discussed in the literature for the given initial-boundary value problem. Some examples are carried out to confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in quasi-Monte Carlo integration demonstrate that the median of linearly scrambled digital net estimators achieves near-optimal convergence rates for high-dimensional integrals without requiring a priori knowledge of the integrand's smoothness. Building on this framework, we prove that the median estimator attains dimension-independent convergence under tractability conditions characterized by low effective dimensionality, a property known as strong tractability in complexity theory. Our analysis strengthens existing guarantees by improving the convergence rates and relaxing the theoretical assumptions previously required for dimension-independent convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.07543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed statistical finite element (statFEM) approach synthesises measurement data with finite element models and allows for making predictions about the unknown true system response. We provide a probabilistic error analysis for a prototypical statFEM setup based on a Gaussian process prior under the assumption that the noisy measurement data are generated by a deterministic true system response function that satisfies a second-order elliptic partial differential equation for an unknown true source term. In certain cases, properties such as the smoothness of the source term may be misspecified by the Gaussian process model. The error estimates we derive are for the expectation with respect to the measurement noise of the $L^2$-norm of the difference between the true system response and the mean of the statFEM posterior. The estimates imply polynomial rates of convergence in the numbers of measurement points and finite element basis functions and depend on the Sobolev smoothness of the true source term and the Gaussian process model. A numerical example for Poisson's equation is used to illustrate these theoretical results.</description>

      <title>The Global R-linear Convergence of Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient Method with Unknown Strongly Convex Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) method is an important extrapolation-based numerical algorithm that accelerates the convergence of the gradient descent method in convex optimization. When dealing with an objective function that is $\mu$-strongly convex, selecting extrapolation coefficients dependent on $\mu$ enables global R-linear convergence. In cases where $\mu$ is unknown, a commonly adopted approach is to set the extrapolation coefficient using the original NAG method. This choice allows for achieving the optimal iteration complexity among first-order methods for general convex problems. However, it remains unknown whether the NAG method with an unknown strongly convex parameter exhibits global R-linear convergence for strongly convex problems. In this work, we answer this question positively by establishing the Q-linear convergence of certain constructed Lyapunov sequences. Furthermore, we extend our result to the global R-linear convergence of the accelerated proximal gradient method, which is employed for solving strongly convex composite optimization problems. Interestingly, these results contradict the findings of the continuous counterpart of the NAG method in [Su, Boyd, and Cand\'es, J. Mach. Learn. Res., 2016, 17(153), 1-43], where the convergence rate by the suggested ordinary differential equation cannot exceed the $O(1/{\tt poly}(k))$ for strongly convex functions.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Estimation of Piecewise Constant Coefficients in Elliptic PDEs via Bayesian Level-Set Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a non-parametric Bayesian level-set method for simultaneous reconstruction of two different piecewise constant coefficients in an elliptic partial differential equation. We show that the Bayesian formulation of the corresponding inverse problem is well-posed and that the posterior measure as a solution to the inverse problem satisfies a Lipschitz estimate with respect to the measured data in terms of Hellinger distance. We reduce the problem to a shape-reconstruction problem and use level-set priors for the parameters of interest. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method using numerical simulations by performing reconstructions of the original phantom using two reconstruction methods. Posing the inverse problem in a Bayesian paradigm allows us to do statistical inference for the parameters of interest, whereby we are able to quantify the uncertainty in the reconstructions for both methods. This illustrates a key advantage of Bayesian methods over traditional algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a spectral optimal control framework for Fokker-Planck equations based on the standard ground state transformation that maps the Fokker-Planck operator to a Schrodinger operator. Our primary objective is to accelerate convergence toward the (unique) steady state. To fulfill this objective, a gradient-based iterative algorithm with Pontryagin's maximum principle and the Barzilai-Borwein update is developed to compute time-dependent controls. Numerical experiments on two-dimensional ill-conditioned normal distributions and double-well potentials demonstrate that our approach effectively targets slow-decaying modes, thus increasing the spectral gap.</description>
