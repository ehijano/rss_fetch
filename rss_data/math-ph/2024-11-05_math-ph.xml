      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the anyonic spin systems with a global symmetry, the so-called symmetry enriched topological (SET) phases. We introduce the phase characterizing the symmetry fractionalization of the anyons. Our assumptions on how the global symmetry acts prevents anyon permutation effects.</description>

      <title>Duality of the Navier-Stokes dynamics and lack of finite-time explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the duality of incompressible Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics in three dimensions, leading to its reformulation in terms of a one-dimensional momentum loop equation. \textbf{The momentum loop equation does not have finite-time blow-up solutions.} The decaying turbulence is a solution of this equation equivalent to a string theory with discrete target space made of regular star polygons and Ising degrees of freedom on the sides. This string theory is solvable in the turbulent limit, equivalent to the quasiclassical approximation in a nontrivial calculable background. \textbf{As a result, the spectrum of decay indexes is analytically computed, and it agrees very well with real and numerical experiments. } Among the decay indexes, there are complex conjugate pairs related to zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The Kolmogorov scaling laws are replaced by certain number theory functions, which are nonlinear in the log-log scale.</description>

      <title>Pulsation of quantum walk on Johnson graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a phenomenon of discrete-time quantum walks on graphs called the pulsation, which is a generalization of a phenomenon in the quantum searches. This phenomenon is discussed on a composite graph formed by two connected graphs $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$. The pulsation means that the state periodically transfers between $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ with the initial state of the uniform superposition on $G_1$. In this paper, we focus on the case for the Grover walk where $G_{1}$ is the Johnson graph and $G_{2}$ is a star graph. Also, the composite graph is constructed by identifying an arbitrary vertex of the Johnson graph with the internal vertex of the star graph. In that case, we find the pulsation with $O(\sqrt{N^{1+1/k}})$ periodicity, where $N$ is the number of vertices of the Johnson graph. The proof is based on Kato's perturbation theory in finite-dimensional vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Digressions on Irreversibility and Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We attempt to characterize irreversibility of a dynamical system from the existence of different forward and backward mathematical representations depending on the direction of the time arrow. Such different representations only exist for stochastic diffusion models so one has to face the justification of stochastic descriptions for physical systems which are inherently conservative. This representation can be shown to hold for conservative finite dimensional deterministic systems coupled to an infinite-dimensional conservative heat bath. We show that the heat bath acts on the finite-dimensional model by {\em state-feedback} and shifts its eigenvalues to make the system dissipative. Moreover, under a natural family of invariant measures the heat bath induces a white noise input acting on the system making it look like a true dissipative diffusion.</description>

      <title>Ramsey Approach to Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ramsey theory enables re-shaping of the basic ideas of quantum mechanics. Quantum observables represented by linear Hermitian operators are seen as the vertices of a graph. Relations of commutation define the coloring of edges linking the vertices: if the operators commute, they are connected with a red link; if they do not commute, they are connected with a green link. Thus, a bi-colored complete Ramsey graph emerges. According to Ramsey's theorem, a complete bi-colored graph built of six vertices will inevitably contain at least one monochromatic triangle; in other words, the Ramsey number \( R(3,3) = 6 \). In our interpretation, this triangle represents the triad of observables that could or could not be established simultaneously in a given quantum system. The Ramsey approach to quantum mechanics is illustrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We repeat, using methods developed for BKM systems, the famous results of S. Novikov (1974), J. Moser (1981, 1982) , and A. Veselov (1980) that relate Schr\"odinger-Hill operators with finite-band spectra, solutions of the Neumann system, and certain solutions of the KdV equations. Our general motivation is to determine whether it is possible to apply inverse scattering methods to BKM systems, and in the conclusion, we indicate initial observations in this direction.</description>

      <title>Approximating Diffusion on Finite Multi-Topology Systems Using Ultrametrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by multi-topology building and city model data, first a lossless representation of multiple $T_0$-topologies on a given finite set by a vertex-edge-weighted graph is given, and the subdominant ultrametric of the associated weighted graph distance matrix is proposed as an index structure for these data. This is applied in a heuristic parallel topological sort algorithm for edge-weighted directed acyclic graphs. Such structured data are of interest in simulation of processes like heat flows on building or city models on distributed processors. With this in view, the bulk of this article calculates the spectra of certain unbounded self-adjoint $p$-adic Laplacian operators on the $L^2$-spaces of a compact open subdomain of the $p$-adic number field associated with a finite graph $G$ with respect to the restricted Haar measure. as well as to a Radon measure coming from an ultrametric on the vertices of $G$ with the help of $p$-adic polynomial interpolation. In the end, error bounds are given for the solutions of the corresponding heat equations by finite approximations of such operators.</description>

      <title>On gauge theory and parallel transport in principal 2-bundles over Lie groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an interplay between some ideas in traditional gauge theory and certain concepts in fibered categories. We accomplish this by introducing a notion of a principal Lie 2-group bundle over a Lie groupoid and studying its connection structures, gauge transformations, and parallel transport.
  We obtain a Lie 2-group torsor version of the one-one correspondence between fibered categories and pseudofunctors. This results in a classification of our principal 2-bundles based on their underlying fibration structures. This allows us to extend a class of our principal 2-bundles to be defined over differentiable stacks presented by the base Lie groupoids. We construct a short exact sequence of VB-groupoids, namely, the 'Atiyah sequence' associated to our principal 2-bundles. Splitting and splitting up to a natural isomorphism of our Atiyah sequence, respectively, gives us notions of 'strict connections' and 'semi-strict connections' on our principal 2-bundles. We describe such connections in terms of Lie 2-algebra valued 1-forms on the total Lie groupoids. The underlying fibration structure of our 2-bundle provides an existence criterion for strict and semi-strict connections. We study the action of the 2-group of gauge transformations on the groupoid of strict and semi-strict connections, and interestingly, we observe an extended symmetry of semi-strict connections. We demonstrate an interrelationship between `differential geometric connection-induced horizontal path lifting property in traditional principal bundles' and the `category theoretic cartesian lifting of morphisms in fibered categories' by developing a theory of connection-induced parallel transport along a particular class of Haefliger paths in the base Lie groupoid of our principle 2-bundles. Finally, we employ our results to introduce a notion of parallel transport along Haefliger paths in the setup of VB-groupoids.</description>

      <title>Shock profiles for the non-cutoff Boltzmann equation with hard potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Boltzmann equation models gas dynamics in the low density or high Mach number regime, using a statistical description of molecular interactions. Planar shock wave solutions have been constructed for the Boltzmann equation for hard potentials with angular cutoff, and more recently for the Landau equation of plasma dynamics. In this work, we construct shock profile solutions for the Boltzmann equation where the molecular interactions are long-range, and we show these solutions to be smooth and well approximated by compressible Navier Stokes shock profiles. Our proof procedes by standard energy estimates and a quantitative Chapman-Enskog approximation.</description>

      <title>Low-density parity-check codes as stable phases of quantum matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phases of matter with robust ground-state degeneracy, such as the quantum toric code, are known to be capable of robust quantum information storage. Here, we address the converse question: given a quantum error correcting code, when does it define a stable gapped quantum phase of matter, whose ground state degeneracy is robust against perturbations in the thermodynamic limit? We prove that a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code defines such a phase, robust against all few-body perturbations, if its code distance grows at least logarithmically in the number of degrees of freedom, and it exhibits "check soundness". Many constant-rate quantum LDPC expander codes have such properties, and define stable phases of matter with a constant zero-temperature entropy density, violating the third law of thermodynamics. Our results also show that quantum toric code phases are robust to spatially nonlocal few-body perturbations. Similarly, phases of matter defined by classical codes are stable against symmetric perturbations. In the classical setting, we present improved locality bounds on the quasiadiabatic evolution operator between two nearby states in the same code phase.</description>

      <title>Modulational instability in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Bragg grating structures with four-wave mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of modulational instability (MI) in $\cal PT$-symmetric fiber Bragg gratings with a phenomenon of intermodulation known as four-wave mixing (FWM). Although the impact of FWM has already been analyzed in the conventional systems, the inclusion of gain and loss, which induces the notion of $\cal PT$- symmetry, gives rise to many noteworthy outcomes. These include the manifestation of an unusual double-loop structure in the dispersion curve, which was unprecedented in the context of conventional periodic structures. When it comes to the study of MI, which is usually obtained in the system by imposing a small amount of perturbations on the continuous wave by executing linear stability analysis, different regimes which range from conventional to broken $\cal PT$- symmetry tend to create quite a few types of MI spectra. Among them, we observe a unique MI pattern that mimics a tilted two-conical structure facing opposite to each other. In addition, we also address the impact of other non-trivial system parameters, such as input power, gain and loss and self-phase modulation in two important broad domains, including normal and anomalous dispersion regimes under the three types of $\cal PT$- symmetric conditions in detail.</description>

      <title>Analytical Expressions for Effective Indices of Modes of Optical Fibers Near and Beyond Cutoff</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an analytical expression for the effective indices of modes of circular step-index fibers valid near their cutoff wavelengths. The approximation, being a first-order Taylor series of a smooth function, is also valid for the real part of the effective index beyond cutoff where the modes become lossy. The approximation is used to derive certain previously unknown mode properties. For example, it is shown that for non-dispersive materials the EH-mode group index at cutoff, surprisingly, does not depend on wavelength, core radius, or even radial mode order.</description>

      <title>Towers of Quantum Many-body Scars from Integrable Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct several models with multiple quantum many-body scars (QMBS) using integrable boundary states~(IBS). We focus on the tilted N\'eel states, which are parametrized IBS of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model, and show that these states can be used to construct a tower of scar states. Our models exhibit periodic revival dynamics, showcasing a characteristic behavior of superpositions of QMBS. Furthermore, the tower of QMBS found in this study possesses a restricted spectrum generating algebra (RSGA) structure, indicating that QMBS are equally spaced in energy. This approach can be extended to two-dimensional models, which can be decomposed into an array of one-dimensional models. In this case, the tilted N\'eel states again serve as parent states for multiple scar states. These states demonstrate low entanglement entropy, marking them as exact scar states. Notably, their entanglement entropy adheres to the sub-volume law, further solidifying the nonthermal properties of QMBS. Our results provide novel insights into constructing QMBS using IBS, thereby illuminating the connection between QMBS and integrable models.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal fluctuations in the passive and active Riesz gas on the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a periodic Riesz gas consisting of $N$ classical particles on a circle, interacting via a two-body repulsive potential which behaves locally as a power law of the distance, $\sim g/|x|^s$ for $s&gt;-1$. Long range (LR) interactions correspond to $s&lt;1$, short range (SR) interactions to $s&gt;1$, while the cases $s=0$ and $s=2$ describe the well-known log-gas and the Calogero-Moser (CM) model respectively. We study the fluctuations of the positions around the equally spaced crystal configuration, both for Brownian and run-and-tumble particles (RTP). Focusing on the regime of weak noise, we obtain exact expressions for the space-time correlations, both at the macroscopic and microscopic scale, for $N \gg 1$ and at fixed mean density $\rho$. They are characterized by a dynamical exponent $z_s=\min(1+s,2)$. We also obtain the gap statistics, described by a roughness exponent $\zeta_s=\frac{1}{2} \min(s,1)$. For $s&gt;0$ in the Brownian case, we find that in a broad time window, the mean square displacement of a particle is sub-diffusive as $t^{1/2}$ for SR as in single-file diffusion, and $t^{s/(1+s)}$ for LR interactions. Remarkably, this coincides, including the amplitude, with a recent prediction obtained using macroscopic fluctuation theory. These results also apply to RTPs beyond a time-scale $1/\gamma$, with $\gamma$ the tumbling rate, and a characteristic length-scale. Instead, for either shorter times or shorter distances, the active noise leads to a rich variety of static and dynamical regimes, with distinct exponents. For $-1&lt;s&lt;0$, the displacements are bounded, leading to true crystalline order at weak noise. The melting transition, recently observed numerically, is discussed in light of our calculation. Finally, we extend our method to the active Dyson Brownian motion and active CM model in a harmonic trap, generalizing to finite $\gamma$ the results of our earlier work.</description>

      <title>Condensation effects in kinetic models for consensus dynamics: finite-time blow-up and regularity aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the main properties of the solution of a Fokker-Planck equation characterized by a variable diffusion coefficient and a polynomial superlinear drift, modeling the formation of consensus in a large interacting system of individuals. The Fokker-Planck equation is derived from the kinetic description of the dynamics of a quantum particle system, and in presence of a high nonlinearity in the drift operator, mimicking the effects of the mass in the alignment forces, allows for steady states similar to a Bose-Einstein condensate. The analysis shows that the regularity of the solution is strongly linked to the degree of nonlinearity in the drift, and that finite-time blow-up of the solution can occur when the degree of nonlinearity is sufficiently high. However, the presence of diffusion prevents the solution from forming condensation after the blow-up time.</description>

      <title>More Nonlinearities? II. A Short Guide of First- and Second-Order Electromagnetic Perturbations in the Schwarzschild Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01441v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study second-order electromagnetic perturbations in the Schwarzschild background and derive the effective source terms for Regge-Wheeler equation which are quadratic in first-order gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations. In addition to the induced mixed quadratic modes, we find that linear gravitational modes are also excited, with amplitudes dependent on the electromagnetic potential. A toy model involving a Dirac delta function potential demonstrates mixing of linear gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations with frequencies \( \omega^{(1)} \) and \( \Omega^{(1)} \), resulting in the second-order QNM mixing in the electromagnetic field at \( \Omega^{(2)} =\Omega^{(1)} + \omega^{(1)} \). This complements prior work in [1] on the second-order gravitational perturbation mixing and highlights potential applications in multi-messenger astrophysics for systems observed by LIGO and upcoming LISA. We also study first-order perturbations due to a point charge and show it could be reduced to a one-dimensional path integral. Within the toy model, we investigate the first-order electromagnetic perturbation due to a radially free-falling single charge \( q \) and radial dipole moment \( p = q \eta \), employing semi-analytical and numerical methods. For the dipole case, we show that the QNM perturbation is excited with a nearly constant amplitude. Future work will focus on incorporating mixing in more realistic potentials and exploring numerical approach in the context of rotating spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Rapidly mixing loop representation quantum Monte Carlo for Heisenberg models on star-like bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods have proven invaluable in condensed matter physics, particularly for studying ground states and thermal equilibrium properties of quantum Hamiltonians without a sign problem. Over the past decade, significant progress has also been made on their rigorous convergence analysis.
  Heisenberg antiferromagnets (AFM) with bipartite interaction graphs are a popular target of computational QMC studies due to their physical importance, but despite the apparent empirical efficiency of these simulations it remains an open question whether efficient classical approximation of the ground energy is possible in general. In this work we introduce a ground state variant of the stochastic series expansion QMC method, and for the special class of AFM on interaction graphs with an $O(1)$-bipartite component (star-like), we prove rapid mixing of the associated QMC Markov chain (polynomial time in the number of qubits) by using Jerrum and Sinclair's method of canonical paths. This is the first Markov chain analysis of a practical class of QMC algorithms with the loop representation of Heisenberg models.
  Our findings contribute to the broader effort to resolve the computational complexity of Heisenberg AFM on general bipartite interaction graphs.</description>

      <title>Why Gauges? Gauge symmetries for the classification of the physical states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note focuses the problem of motivating the use of gauge symmetries (being the identity on the observables) from general principles, beyond their practical success, starting from global gauge symmetries and then by emphasizing the substantially different role of local gauge symmetries. In the latter case, a deterministic time evolution of the local field algebra, necessary for field quantization, requires a reduction of the full local gauge group $\cal{G}$ to a residual local subgroup $\cal{G}_r$ satisfying suitable conditions. A non-trivial residual local gauge group allows for a description/construction of the physical states by using the vacuum representation of a local field algebra, otherwise precluded if $\cal{G}$ is reduced to the identity. Moreover, in the non-abelian case the non-trivial topology of the a residual $\cal{G}_r$ defines the (gauge invariant) topological invariants which classify the vacuum structure with important physical effects; furthermore, it provides a general mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking without Goldstone bosons.</description>

      <title>Exponential volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A decorated surface S is an oriented topological surface with marked points on the boundary considered modulo the isotopy. We consider the moduli space of hyperbolic structures on S with geodesic boundary, such that the hyperbolic structure near each marked point is a cusp, equipped with a horocycle. This space carries a volume form. Let us fix the set K of distances between the horocycles at the adjacent cusps, and the set L of lengths of boundary circles without cusps. We get a subspace M(S; K,L) with the induced volume form Vol(K,L). However, if the cusps are present, the volume of the space M(S; K,L) is infinite.
  We introduce the exponential volume form exp(-W)Vol(K,L), where W is a positive function on the moduli space, given by the sum over cusps of the hyperbolic areas enclosed between the cusp and the horocycle at the cusp. We prove that the exponential volume, defined as the integral of the exponential volume form over the moduli space M(S; K,L), is always finite.
  We suggest that the moduli spaces M(S; K,L) with the exponential volume forms are the true analogs of the classical moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, with the Weil-Petersson volume forms. In particular, they should be relevant to the open string theory.
  We support this by proving an unfolding formula for the integrals of measurable functions multiplied by the exponential volume form. It expresses them as finite sums of similar integrals over moduli spaces for simpler surfaces. They generalise Mirzakhani's recursions for the volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces.</description>

      <title>On the Limit of the Tridiagonal Model for $\beta$-Dyson Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work, Edelman and Dumitriu provide a description of the result of applying the Householder tridiagonalization algorithm to a G$\beta$E random matrix. The resulting tridiagonal ensemble makes sense for all $\beta&gt;0$, and has spectrum given by the $\beta$-ensemble for all $\beta&gt;0$. Moreover, the tridiagonal model has useful stochastic operator limits introduced and analyzed by Edelman and Sutton, and subsequently analyzed in work by Ramirez, Rider, and Vir\'ag. In this work we analogously study the result of applying the Householder tridiagonalization algorithm to a G$\beta$E process which has eigenvalues governed by $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion. We propose an explicit limit of the upper left $k \times k$ minor of the $n \times n$ tridiagonal process as $n \to \infty$ and $k$ remains fixed. We prove the result for $\beta=1$, and also provide numerical evidence for $\beta=1,2,4$. This leads us to conjecture the form of a dynamical $\beta$-stochastic Airy operator with smallest $k$ eigenvalues evolving according to the $n \to \infty$ limit of the largest, centered and re-scaled, $k$ eigenvalues of $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Wiedemann-Franz Law and Thermoelectric Inequalities: Effective ZT and Single-leg Efficiency Overestimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01635v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a thermoelectric inequality in thermoelectric conversion between the material figure of merit (ZT) and the module effective ZT using the Constant Seebeck-coefficient Approximation combining with the Wiedemann-Franz law. In a P-N leg-pair module, the effective ZT lies between the individual ZT values of the P- and N-legs. In a single-leg module, however, the effective ZT is less than approximately one-third of the leg's ZT. This reduction results from the need for an external wire to complete the circuit, introducing additional thermal and electrical losses. Multi-dimensional numerical analysis shows that, although structural optimization can mitigate these losses, the system efficiency remains limited to below half of the ideal single-leg material efficiency. Our findings explain the single-leg efficiency overestimation and highlight the importance of optimizing the P-N leg-pair module structure. They also underscore the need for thermoelectric leg-compatibility, particularly with respect to Seebeck coefficients.</description>

      <title>The Painlev\'e equivalence problem for a constrained 3D system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a geometric approach to study Painlev\'e equations appearing as constrained systems of three first-order ordinary differential equations. We illustrate this approach on a system of three first-order differential equations arising in the theory of semi-classical orthogonal polynomials. We show that it can be restricted to a system of two first-order differential equations in two different ways on an invariant hypersurface. We build the space of initial conditions for each of these restricted systems and verify that they exhibit the Painlev\'e property from a geometric perspective. Utilising the Painlev\'e identification algorithm we also relate this system to the Painlev\'e VI equation and we build its global Hamiltonian structure. Finally, we prove that the autonomous limit of the original system is Liouville integrable, and the level curves of its first integrals are elliptic curves, which leads us to conjecture that the 3D system itself also possesses the Painlev\'e property without the need to restrict it to the invariant hypersurface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we calculate the reheating temperature in the cosmological scenarios where heavy scalar particles are gravitationally produced, due to a conformally coupled interaction between a massive scalar quantum field and the Ricci scalar, during the oscillations of the inflaton field. We explore two distinct cases, namely the one in which these particles decay during the domination of the inflaton's energy density and the other one where the decay occurs after this phase. For each scenario, we have derived formulas to calculate the reheating temperatures based on the energy density of the produced particles and their decay rate. We establish bounds for the maximum reheating temperature, defined as the temperature reached by the universe when the decay of gravitationally produced particles concludes at the onset of the radiation-dominated epoch. Finally, we use the Born approximation to find analytic formulas for the reheating temperature.</description>

Abstract: We study the Heisenberg double and the Drinfeld double of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded Hopf algebras. To present the constructions, we consider in detail the Borel half of $U_q(sl(2))$ and two super Hopf algebra examples: the Borel half of $U_q(osp(1|2))$ and the Borel half of $U_q(gl(1|1))$ for $q$ being a root of unity. We prove an isomorphism between the graded Heisenberg doubles and the handle algebras in the context of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded generalisation of Alekseev-Schomerus combinatorial quantisation of Chern-Simons theory and illustrate it on the example of the Heisenberg double of the full $U_q(gl(1|1))$ Hopf algebra.</description>

Abstract: We explore a notion of decomposably divisible (D-divisible) quantum evolution families, recently introduced in J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 56, 485202 (2023). Both necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for highly-symmetric qubit and qudit dynamical maps. Through a restructurization of the evolution generators, we encode the decomposable divisibility into the positivity of time-dependent coefficients that multiply generators of D-divisible dynamical maps. This provides an analogy to the CP-divisibility property, which is equivalent to the positivity of decoherence rates that multiply Markovian semigroup generators.</description>

Abstract: The dynamics and spontaneous organization of coupled particles is a classic problem in modeling and applied mathematics. Here we examine the behavior of particles coupled by the Ricker potential, exhibiting finite local repulsion transitioning to distal attraction, leading to an energy-minimizing ``preferred distance''. When compressed by a background potential well of varying severity, these particles exhibit intricate self-organization into ``stacks" with varying sizes and positions. We examine bifurcations of these high-dimensional arrangements, yielding tantalizing glimpses into a rich dynamical zoo of behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the classical and quantum Seiberg-Witten curves of 5d N = 1 SCFTs and their 4d limits. The 5d theories we consider are Seiberg's theories of type $E_{6,7,8}$, which serve as the UV completions of 5d SU(2) gauge theories with 5, 6, or 7 flavors. Their classical curves can be constructed using the five-brane web construction [1]. We also use it to re-derive their quantum curves [2], by employing a q-analogue of the Frobenius method in the style of [3]. This allows us to compare the reduction of these 5d curves with the 4d curves, i.e. Seiberg-Witten curves of the Minahan-Nemeschansky theories and their quantization, which have been identified in [4] with the spectral curves of rank-1 complex crystallographic elliptic Calogero-Moser systems.</description>

Abstract: We further develop the BPS/CFT correspondence between quiver W-algebras/$qq$-characters and partition functions of gauge origami. We introduce $qq$-characters associated with multi-dimensional partitions with nontrivial boundary conditions which we call Donaldson--Thomas (DT) $qq$-characters. They are operator versions of the equivariant DT vertices of toric Calabi--Yau three and four-folds. Moreover, we revisit the construction of the D8 $qq$-characters with no boundary conditions and give a quantum algebraic derivation of the sign rules of the magnificent four partition function. We also show that under the proper sign rules, the D6 and D8 $qq$-characters with no boundary conditions all commute with each other and discuss its physical interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile. We are interested in the existence of ground state solutions by considering the minimization problem on a Nehari-Pohozaev set. The presence of a doping profile causes several difficulties, especially in the proof of the uniqueness of a maximum point of a fibering map. A key ingredient is to establish the energy inequality. We also establish the relation between ground state solutions and $L^2$-constraint minimizers. When the doping profile is a characteristic function supported on a bounded smooth domain, some geometric quantities related to the domain, such as the mean curvature,are responsible for the existence of ground state solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity and generalized area law in fully connected models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The area law for entanglement entropy fundamentally reflects the complexity of quantum many-body systems, demonstrating ground states of local Hamiltonians to be represented with low computational complexity. While this principle is well-established in one-dimensional systems, little is known beyond 1D cases, and attempts to generalize the area law on infinite-dimensional graphs have largely been disproven. In this work, for non-critical ground states of Hamiltonians on fully connected graphs, we establish a generalized area law up to a polylogarithmic factor in system size, by effectively reducing the boundary area to a constant scale for interactions between subsystems. This result implies an efficient approximation of the ground state by the matrix product state up to an approximation error of $1/\text{poly}(n)$. As the core technique, we develop the mean-field renormalization group approach, which rigorously guarantees efficiency by systematically grouping regions of the system and iteratively approximating each as a product state. This approach provides a rigorous pathway to efficiently simulate ground states of complex systems, advancing our understanding of infinite-dimensional quantum many-body systems and their entanglement structures.</description>

      <title>Entanglement area law in interacting bosons: from Bose-Hubbard, $\phi$4, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement area law is a universal principle that characterizes the information structure in quantum many-body systems and serves as the foundation for modern algorithms based on tensor network representations. Historically, the area law has been well understood under two critical assumptions: short-range interactions and bounded local energy. However, extending the area law beyond these assumptions has been a long-sought goal in quantum many-body theory. This challenge is especially pronounced in interacting boson systems, where the breakdown of the bounded energy assumption is universal and poses significant difficulties. In this work, we prove the area law for one-dimensional interacting boson systems including the long-range interactions. Our model encompasses the Bose-Hubbard class and the $\phi4$ class, two of the most fundamental models in quantum condensed matter physics, statistical mechanics, and high-energy physics. This result achieves the resolution of the area law that incorporates both the challenges of unbounded local energy and long-range interactions in a unified manner. Additionally, we establish an efficiency-guaranteed approximation of the quantum ground states using Matrix Product States (MPS). These results significantly advance our understanding of quantum complexity by offering new insights into how bosonic parameters and interaction decay rates influence entanglement. Our findings provide crucial theoretical foundations for simulating long-range interacting cold atomic systems, which are central to modern quantum technologies, and pave the way for more efficient simulation techniques in future quantum applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General spin-1/2 chains with symmetric nearest-neighbor interaction are studied. We rigorously prove that all spin models in this class, except for known integrable systems, are non-integrable in the sense that they possess no nontrivial local conserved quantities. This result confirms that there are no missing integrable systems, i.e., integrable systems in this class are exactly those that are already known. In addition, this result excludes the possibility of intermediate systems which have a finite number of nontrivial local conserved quantities. Our findings support the expectation that integrable systems are exceptional in quantum many-body systems and most systems are non-integrable.</description>

Abstract: We provide a rigorous proof of the absence of nontrivial local conserved quantities in all spin-1/2 chains with symmetric nearest-neighbor interaction, except for known integrable systems. This result shows that there are no further integrable system that awaits to be discovered. Our finding also implies that there is no intermediate systems with a finite number of nontrivial local conserved quantities. In addition, we clarify all short-support conserved quantities in non-integrable systems, which we need to take into account in analyses of thermalization and level statistics.</description>

      <title>Two-loop Loewner potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the Schramm-Loewner evolution loop measure to pairs of non-intersecting Jordan curves on the Riemann sphere. We also introduce four equivalent definitions for a two-loop Loewner potential: respectively expressing it in terms of normalized Brownian loop measure, zeta-regularized determinants of the Laplacian, an integral formula generalizing universal Liouville action, and Loewner-Kufarev energy of a foliation. Moreover, we prove that the potential is finite if and only if both loops are Weil-Petersson quasicircles, that it is an Onsager-Machlup functional for the two-loop SLE, and a variational formula involving Schwarzian derivatives.
  Addressing the question of minimization of the two-loop Loewner potential, we find that any such minimizers must be pairs of circles. However, the potential is not bounded, diverging to negative infinity as the circles move away from each other and to positive infinity as the circles merge, thus preventing a definition of two-loop Loewner energy for the prospective large deviations theory for the two-loop SLE.
  To remedy the divergence, we study a way of generalizing the two-loop Loewner potential by taking into account how conformal field theory (CFT) partition functions depend on the modulus of the annulus between the loops. This generalization is motivated by the correspondence between SLE and CFT, and it also emerges from the geometry of the real determinant line bundle as introduced by Kontsevich and Suhov.</description>

      <title>Discrete the solving model of time-variant standard Sylvester-conjugate matrix equations using Euler-forward formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-variant standard Sylvester-conjugate matrix equations are presented as early time-variant versions of the complex conjugate matrix equations. Current solving methods include Con-CZND1 and Con-CZND2 models, both of which use ode45 for continuous model. Given practical computational considerations, discrete these models is also important. Based on Euler-forward formula discretion, Con-DZND1-2i model and Con-DZND2-2i model are proposed. Numerical experiments using step sizes of 0.1 and 0.001. The above experiments show that Con-DZND1-2i model and Con-DZND2-2i model exhibit different neural dynamics compared to their continuous counterparts, such as trajectory correction in Con-DZND2-2i model and the swallowing phenomenon in Con-DZND1-2i model, with convergence affected by step size. These experiments highlight the differences between optimizing sampling discretion errors and space compressive approximation errors in neural dynamics.</description>

      <title>LDPC stabilizer codes as gapped quantum phases: stability under graph-local perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the proof of stability of topological order, due to Bravyi, Hastings and Michalakis, to stabilizer Hamiltonians corresponding to low-density parity check (LDPC) codes without the restriction of geometric locality in Euclidean space. We consider Hamiltonians $H_0$ defined by $[[N,K,d]]$ LDPC codes which obey certain topological quantum order conditions: (i) code distance $d \geq c \log(N)$, implying local indistinguishability of ground states, and (ii) a mild condition on local and global compatibility of ground states; these include good quantum LDPC codes, and the toric code on a hyperbolic lattice, among others. We consider stability under weak perturbations that are quasi-local on the interaction graph defined by $H_0$, and which can be represented as sums of bounded-norm terms. As long as the local perturbation strength is smaller than a finite constant, we show that the perturbed Hamiltonian has well-defined spectral bands originating from the $O(1)$ smallest eigenvalues of $H_0$. The band originating from the smallest eigenvalue has $2^K$ states, is separated from the rest of the spectrum by a finite energy gap, and has exponentially narrow bandwidth $\delta = C N e^{-\Theta(d)}$, which is tighter than the best known bounds even in the Euclidean case. We also obtain that the new ground state subspace is related to the initial code subspace by a quasi-local unitary, allowing one to relate their physical properties. Our proof uses an iterative procedure that performs successive rotations to eliminate non-frustration-free terms in the Hamiltonian. Our results extend to quantum Hamiltonians built from classical LDPC codes, which give rise to stable symmetry-breaking phases. These results show that LDPC codes very generally define stable gapped quantum phases, even in the non-Euclidean setting, initiating a systematic study of such phases of matter.</description>

Abstract: In the literature, abelian higher gauge symmetry models are shown to be valid in all finite dimensions and exhibit the characteristic behavior of SPT phases models. While the ground state degeneracy and the entanglement entropy were thoroughly studied, the classification of the ground state space still remained obscure. Based on differentio-geometric approach and, anticipating the notation of the current paper, if $\left( C_{\bullet} , \partial^C_{\bullet} \right)$ is the chain complex associated to the geometrical content of these models, while $\left( G_{\bullet} , \partial^G_{\bullet} \right)$ is its symmetries counterpart, we show that the ground state space is classified by a $H^0 (C,G) \times H_0 (C,G)$ group, where $H^0(C,G)$ is the $0$-th cohomology and $H_0 (C,G)$ is the corresponding $0$-th homology group with coefficients in the chain complex.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of generalized Langevin equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world systems exhibit ``noisy'' evolution in time; interpreting their finitely-sampled behavior as arising from continuous-time processes (in the It\^o or Stratonovich sense) has led to significant success in modeling and analysis in a wide variety of fields. Yet such interpretation hinges on a fundamental linear separation of randomness from determinism in the underlying dynamics. Here we propose some theoretical systems which resist easy and self-consistent interpretation into this well-defined class of equations, requiring an expansion of the interpretive framework. We argue that a wider class of stochastic differential equations, where evolution depends nonlinearly on a random or effectively-random quantity, may be consistently interpreted and in fact exhibit finite-time stochastic behavior in line with an equivalent It\^o process, at which point many existing numerical and analytical techniques may be used. We put forward a method for this conversion, and demonstrate its use on both a toy system and on a system of direct physical relevance: the velocity of a meso-scale particle suspended in a turbulent fluid. This work enables the theoretical and numerical examination of a wide class of mathematical models which might otherwise be oversimplified due to a lack of appropriate tools.</description>

      <title>Towards 2-dimensional non-commutative integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We collect evidence that the notion of path-ordered non-abelian integration admits an extension to two dimensions. We propose the corresponding notion of non-abelian 2-form along the lines of Lie algebroid theory and argue it is an appropriate one. The processes of parallel transport and integration turn out to be subtly different in the 2-dimensional case; we discuss parallel transport along surfaces and present an indirect definition of a non-abelian integral. This integral includes, for specific choices of 2-forms, both abelian integrals and the continuous limit of Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula as special cases; it interpolates between those cases and broadly generalizes them, allowing, for example, an analog of path-exponential with local, point-depending commutators to be spoken about. We comment on all these objects, their relations, gauge symmetries and geometrical meaning, and roughly sketch a plausible order-by-order procedure for obtaining formulas for non-abelian integrals. The exposition is reasonably concrete, relying on no notions more abstract than sections of vector bundles and homotopies.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the resonance problem for the cubic nonlinear Helmholtz equation in the subwavelength regime. We derive a discrete model for approximating the subwavelength resonances of finite systems of high-contrast resonators with Kerr-type nonlinearities. Our discrete formulation is valid in both weak and strong nonlinear regimes. Compared to the linear formulation, it characterizes the soliton-like extra eigenmodes that have recently been experimentally observed.</description>

Abstract: The representation theory of the Clifford group is playing an increasingly prominent role in quantum information theory, including in such diverse use cases as the construction of protocols for quantum system certification, quantum simulation, and quantum cryptography. In these applications, the tensor powers of the defining representation seem particularly important. The representation theory of these tensor powers is understood in two regimes. 1. For odd qudits in the case where the power t is not larger than the number of systems n: Here, a duality theory between the Clifford group and certain discrete orthogonal groups can be used to make fairly explicit statements about the occurring irreps (this theory is related to Howe duality and the eta-correspondence). 2. For qubits: Tensor powers up to t=4 have been analyzed on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we provide a unified framework for the duality approach that also covers qubit systems. To this end, we translate the notion of rank of symplectic representations to representations of the qubit Clifford group, and generalize the eta correspondence between symplectic and orthogonal groups to a correspondence between the Clifford and certain orthogonal-stochastic groups. As a sample application, we provide a protocol to efficiently implement the complex conjugate of a black-box Clifford unitary evolution.</description>

      <title>Energy cascade for the Klein-Gordon lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07146v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study analytically the dynamics of a $d$-dimensional Klein-Gordon lattice with periodic boundary conditions, for $d \leq 3$. We consider initial data supported on one low-frequency Fourier mode. We show that, in the continuous approximation, the resonant normal form of the system is given by a small-dispersion nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation. By exploiting a result about the growth of Sobolev norms for solutions of small-dispersion NLS, we are able to describe an energy cascade phenomenon for the Klein-Gordon lattice, where part of the energy is transferred to modes associated to higher frequencies. Such phenomenon holds within the time-scale for which we can ensure the validity of the continuous approximation.</description>

      <title>Evolution of crystalline thin films by evaporation and condensation in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The morphology of crystalline thin films evolving on flat rigid substrates by condensation of extra film atoms or by evaporation of their own atoms in the surrounding vapor is studied in the framework of the theory of Stress Driven Rearrangement Instabilities (SDRI). By following the literature both the elastic contributions due to the mismatch between the film and the substrate lattices at their theoretical (free-standing) elastic equilibrium, and a curvature perturbative regularization preventing the problem to be ill-posed due to the otherwise exhibited backward parabolicity, are added in the evolution equation. The resulting Cauchy problem under investigation consists in an anisotropic mean-curvature type flow of the fourth order on the film profiles, which are assumed to be parametrizable as graphs of functions measuring the film thicknesses, coupled with a quasistatic elastic problem in the film bulks. The existence of a regular solution for a finite period of time is established under periodic boundary conditions by means of employing minimizing movements to exploit the gradient-flow structure of the evolution equation.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Porous Media Schr{\"o}dinger Equation: Feynman-type Motivation, Well-Posedness and Control Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper's aim is threefold. First, using Feynman's path approach to the derivation of theclassical Schr{\"o}dinger's equation in [6] and by introducing a slight path (or wave) dependency ofthe action, we derive a new class of equations of Schr{\"o}dinger type where the driving operatoris no longer the Laplace one but rather of complex porous media-type. Second, using suitableconcepts of monotonicity in the complex setting and on appropriate functional spaces, we showthe existence and uniqueness of the solution to this type of equation. In the formulation of ourequation, we adjoin possible measurement absolute errors translating in an additive Brownianperturbation and interactions between different waves translating in a mean-field (or McKean-Vlasov) dependency of drift coefficient. Finally, using Fitzpatrick's characterization of maximalmonotone operators (cf. [7]), we propose a Br{\'e}zis-Ekeland type characterization of the solutionof the deterministic equation via a control problem. This is envisaged as a possible way toovercome strict monotonicity requirements in the complex setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral zeta functions have been found many application in several branches of modern physics, including the quantum field theory, the string theory and the cosmology. In this paper, we shall consider the spectral zeta functions and their functional determinants in the $p$-adic field. Our approach for the constructions of $p$-adic spectral zeta functions is to apply the $p$-adic Mellin transforms with respect to locally analytic functions $f$, where $f$ interpolates the spectrum for the Hamiltonian of a quantum model.</description>

      <title>The generalized second law in Euclidean Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the Bekenstein generalized entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole, with the contribution of an external matter field affected by degrees of freedom near the event horizon. In the Euclidean section of the Schwarzschild manifold, we consider an Euclidean quantum effective model, a scalar theory in the presence of an additive disorder field. The average of the Gibbs free energy over the ensemble of possible configurations of the disorder is obtained by the distributional zeta-function method. In the series representation for the average free energy, the effective actions give rise to generalized Schr\"{o}dinger operators on Riemannian manifolds. Finally, is presented the generalized entropy density with the contributions of the black hole geometric entropy and the external matter fields. The validity of the generalized second law using Euclidean functional methods is obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Maxwell theory on a non-spin manifold. Depending on the choice of statistics for line operators, there are three non-anomalous theories and one anomalous theory with different symmetry fractionalizations. We establish the gauging maps that connect the non-anomalous theories by coupling them to a discrete gauge theory. We also construct topological interfaces associated with $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ duality and gauging of electric and magnetic one-form symmetries. Finally, by stacking the topological interfaces, we compose various kinds of duality defects, which lead to non-invertible symmetries of non-spin Maxwell theories.</description>

      <title>On the Exact Maxwell evolution equation of resonator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent publication [Opt. Express 32, 20904 (2024)], the accuracy of the main evolution equation that governs resonator dynamics in the coupled-mode theory (CMT) was questioned. The study concluded that the driving force is proportional to the temporal derivative of the excitation field rather than the excitation field itself. This conclusion was reached with a derivation of an "exact" Maxwell evolution (EME) equation obtained directly from Maxwell's equations, which was further supported by extensive numerical tests. Hereafter, we argue that the original derivation lacks mathematical rigor. We present a direct and rigorous derivation that establishes a solid mathematical foundation for the EME equation. This new approach clarifies the origin of the temporal derivative in the excitation term of CMT and elucidates the approximations present in the classical CMT evolution equation through a straightforward argument.</description>

      <title>The Study of the Canonical forms of Killing tensor in vacuum with {\Lambda}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the initial part of a comprehensive study of spacetimes that admit the canonical forms of Killing tensor in General Relativity. The general scope of the study is to derive either new exact solutions of Einstein's equations that exhibit hidden symmetries or to identify the hidden symmetries in already known spacetimes that may emerge during the resolution process. In this preliminary paper, we first introduce the canonical forms of Killing tensor, based on a geometrical approach to classify the canonical forms of symmetric 2-rank tensors, as postulated by R. V. Churchill. Subsequently, the derived integrability conditions of the canonical forms serve as additional equations transforming the under-determined system of equations, comprising of Einstein's Field Equations and the Bianchi Identities (in vacuum with {\Lambda}), into an over-determined one. Using a null rotation around the null tetrad frame we manage to simplify the system of equations to the point where the geometric characterization (Petrov Classification) of the extracted solutions can be performed and their null congruences can be characterized geometrically. Therein, we obtain multiple special algebraic solutions according to the Petrov classification (D, III, N, O) where some of them appeared to be new. The latter becomes possible since our analysis is embodied with the usage of the Newman-Penrose formalism of null tetrads.</description>

      <title>Exact solitary wave solutions for a coupled gKdV-Schrodinger system by a new ODE reduction method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new method is developed for finding exact solitary wave solutions of a generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation with p-power nonlinearity coupled to a linear Schr\"odinger equation arising in many different physical applications. This method yields 22 solution families, with p=1,2,3,4. No solutions for p&gt;1 were known previously in the literature. For p=1, four of the solution families contain bright/dark Davydov solitons of the 1st and 2nd kind, obtained in recent work by basic ansatze applied to the ODE system for travelling waves. All of the new solution families have interesting features, including bright/dark peaks with (up to) p symmetric pairs of side peaks in the amplitude and a kink profile for the nonlinear part in the phase. The present method is fully systematic and involves several novel steps which reduce the travelling wave ODE system to a single nonlinear base ODE for which all polynomial solutions are found by symbolic computation. It is applicable more generally to other coupled nonlinear dispersive wave equations as well as to nonlinear ODE systems of generalized H\'enon-Heiles form.</description>

      <title>Algebraic realisation of three fermion generations with $S_3$ family and unbroken gauge symmetry from $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on previous work, we extend an algebraic realisation of three fermion generations within the complex Clifford algebra $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$ by incorporating a $U(1)_{em}$ gauge symmetry. The algebra $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$ corresponds to the algebra of complex linear maps from the (complexification of the) Cayley-Dickson algebra of sedenions, $\mathbb{S}$, to itself. Previous work represented three generations of fermions with $SU(3)_C$ colour symmetry permuted by an $S_3$ symmetry of order-three, but failed to include a $U(1)$ generator that assigns the correct electric charge to all states. Furthermore, the three generations suffered from a degree of linear dependence between states. By generalising the embedding of the discrete group $S_3$, corresponding to automorphisms of $\mathbb{S}$, into $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$, we include an $S_3$-invariant $U(1)$ that correctly assigns electric charge. First-generation states are represented in terms of two even $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$ semi-spinors, obtained from two minimal left ideals, related to each other via the order-two $S_3$ symmetry. The remaining two generations are obtained by applying the $S_3$ symmetry of order-three to the first generation. In this model, the gauge symmetries, $SU(3)_C\times U(1)_{em}$, are $S_3$-invariant and preserve the semi-spinors. As a result of the generalised embedding of the $S_3$ automorphisms of $\mathbb{S}$ into $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$, the three generations are now linearly independent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We pursue the current developments in random tensor theory by laying the foundations of a free probability theory for tensors and establish its relevance in the study of random tensors of high dimension. We give a definition of freeness associated to a collection of tensors of possibly different orders. Our definition reduces to the usual freeness when only tensors of order 2 are concerned. We define the free cumulants which are associated to this notion of tensor freeness. We prove that the basic models of random tensors are asymptotically free as the dimension goes to infinity. On the way, we establish Schwinger-Dyson loop equations associated to random tensors.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary Field Sigma Models and Yang-Baxter Deformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine the Yang-Baxter (YB) and bi-Yang-Baxter (bi-YB) deformations with higher-spin auxiliary field deformations to construct multi-parameter families of integrable deformations of the principal chiral model on a Lie group $G$ with semi-simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. In the YB case, our construction produces one integrable deformation for each pair $(\mathcal{R}, E)$, where $\mathcal{R}$ is an antisymmetric bilinear operator on $\mathfrak{g}$ obeying the modified classical Yang-Baxter equation and $E$ is a function of several variables. In the bi-YB case, the pair becomes a triplet $(\mathcal{R},\tilde{\mathcal{R}}, E)$, where $\tilde{\mathcal{R}}$ is another antisymmetric bilinear operator on $\mathfrak{g}$ and obeys the non-split inhomogeneous modified classical Yang-Baxter equation. We show that every model in these families is (weakly) classically integrable by exhibiting a Lax representation for their equations of motion.</description>

      <title>A Note On Projective Structures On Compact Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projective structures on topological surfaces support the structure of 2d CFTs with a degree of technical simplification. We propose a complex analytic space $\mathcal{P}_g$ biholomorphic to $T^*_{(1,0)} \mathcal{M}_g$ as a candidate moduli space of the projective structures of the genus $g$ topological surface. Explicit analysis at $g=1$, including of the fibers over the fictitious orbifold loci of $\mathcal{M}_{g=1}$ and of transformations under the modular group, supports this proposal. It also shows that $\mathcal{P}_{g=1}$ naturally resolves the orbifold locus of the affine structure moduli space $\mathcal{A}_{g=1}$ which is related to the Hodge bundle over $\mathcal{M}_{g=1}$. For $g \geq 2$, intricate quotient operations are expected along fibers over the orbifold loci of $\mathcal{M}_g$, whose analysis we leave to future work.
  Physically, the space $\mathcal{P}_g$ represents the bundle of universal, stationary, chiral hydrodynamic flows spatially confined to compact genus-$g$ Riemann surfaces.</description>

      <title>Cusp Universality for Correlated Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For correlated real symmetric or complex Hermitian random matrices, we prove that the local eigenvalue statistics at any cusp singularity are universal. Since the density of states typically exhibits only square root edge or cubic root cusp singularities, our result completes the proof of the Wigner-Dyson-Mehta universality conjecture in all spectral regimes for a very general class of random matrices. Previously only the bulk and the edge universality were established in this generality [arXiv:1804.07744], while cusp universality was proven only for Wigner-type matrices with independent entries [arXiv:1809.03971, arXiv:1811.04055]. As our main technical input, we prove an optimal local law at the cusp using the Zigzag strategy, a recursive tandem of the characteristic flow method and a Green function comparison argument. Moreover, our proof of the optimal local law holds uniformly in the spectrum, thus also re-establishing universality of the local eigenvalue statistics in the previously studied bulk [arXiv:1705.10661] and edge [arXiv:1804.07744] regimes.</description>

Abstract: We remind the definition and main properties of the Krichever quasiclassical tau-function, and turn to the application of these formulas for recent studies of two-dimensional quantum gravity. We show, that in the case of minimal gravity it turns to be directly related with the Verlinde formula for minimal models, giving in particular case its one more direct proof. Generalizations for continuous "complex Liouville" theory are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12873v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the exact analytical traveling wave solutions of the Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov equation with the reaction term belonging to the class of functions, which includes that of the (generalized) Fisher equation, for the particular values of the waves speed. The solutions are written in terms of elementary functions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Probability Geometrically Realized in Projective Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The principal goal of this paper is to pass all quantum probability formulas to the projective space associated to the complex Hilbert space of a given quantum system, providing a more complete geometrization of quantum theory. Quantum events have consecutive and conditional probabilities, which have been used in the author's previous work to clarify 'collapse' and to generalize the concept of entanglement by incorporating it into quantum probability theory. In this way all of standard textbook quantum theory can be understood as a geometric theory of projective subspaces without any special role for the zero-dimensional projective subspaces, which are also called pure states. The upshot is that quantum theory is the probability theory of projective subspaces, or equivalently, of quantum events. For the sake of simplicity the ideas are developed here in the context of a type I factor, but comments will be given about how to adopt this approach to more general von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>Proof of bulk-edge correspondence for band topology by Toeplitz algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously yet concisely prove the bulk-edge correspondence for general $d$-dimensional ($d$D) topological insulators in complex Altland-Zirnbauer classes, which states that the bulk topological number equals to the edge-mode index. Specifically, an essential formula is discovered that links the quantity expressed by Toeplitz algebra, i.e., hopping terms on the lattice with an edge, to the Fourier series on the bulk Brillouin zone. We then apply it to chiral models and utilize exterior differential calculations, instead of the sophisticated \emph{K}-theory, to show that the winding number of bulk system equals to the Fredholm index of 1D edge Hamiltonian, or to the sum of edge winding numbers for higher odd dimensions. Moreover, this result is inherited to the even-dimensional Chern insulators as each of them can be mapped to an odd-dimensional chiral model. It is revealed that the Chern number of bulk system is identical to the spectral flow of 2D edge Hamiltonian, or to the negative sum of edge Chern numbers for higher even dimensions. Our methods and conclusions are friendly to physicists and could be easily extended to other physical scenarios.</description>
