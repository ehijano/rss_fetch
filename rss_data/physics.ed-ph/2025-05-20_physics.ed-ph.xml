      <title>The Hyperbolic Tangent as an Educational Tool for Teaching Variable Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an approximate analytical solution to the Falling Astronaut Problem by means of the hyperbolic tangent, and it explores the educational opportunities presented by this technique. The author's previous paper presented a function for time in terms of position t(x) that modeled the motion of an astronaut as she falls from an arbitrary height to the surface of a spherical planet with no air resistance, but an exact analytical function for position in terms of time x(t) was not found. This paper derives an approximate function for x(t) using kinematic equations with constant acceleration and "switch functions," specifically the hyperbolic tangent. The paper concludes with a discussion of the pedagogical implications of the technique, its potential for deepening student understanding of non-constant motion, and applications beyond the classroom.</description>

      <title>An introduction to Neural Networks for Physicists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have emerged as powerful tools to tackle various challenges. The integration of machine learning methods with Physics has led to innovative approaches in understanding, controlling, and simulating physical phenomena. This article aims to provide a practical introduction to neural network and their basic concepts. It presents some perspectives on recent advances at the intersection of machine learning models with physical systems. We introduce practical material to guide the reader in taking their first steps in applying neural network to Physics problems. As an illustrative example, we provide four applications of increasing complexity for the problem of a simple pendulum, namely: parameter fitting of the pendulum's ODE for the small-angle approximation; Application of Physics-Inspired Neural Networks (PINNs) to find solutions of the pendulum's ODE in the small-angle regime; Autoencoders applied to an image dataset of the pendulum's oscillations for estimating the dimensionality of the parameter space in this physical system; and the use of Sparse Identification of Non-Linear Dynamics (SINDy) architectures for model discovery and analytical expressions for the nonlinear pendulum problem (large angles).</description>

      <title>Recitation tasks revamped? Students' perceptions of smartphone-based experimental and programming tasks in introductory mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13382</link>

Abstract: This exploratory field study investigates the integration of innovative forms of recitation tasks in a first-year introductory mechanics course, focusing on smartphone-based experimental tasks alongside programming and standard recitation tasks. Smartphones, combined with external sensor modules, serve as a gateway enabling students to conduct various low-cost and authentic physics experiments with first-hand data collection outside traditional lab settings. These tasks aim to enhance students' agency in independent physics experimentation and enrich homework assignments by dissolving boundaries between lectures, recitation sessions, and traditional labs, and thereby linking theoretical and experimental aspects of undergraduate physics education. To explore this potential, we implemented and evaluated a sample set of nine smartphone-based experimental tasks and, for comparison, three programming tasks as weekly exercises in a first-year physics course at RWTH Aachen University. We investigated students' perceptions of learning with these new tasks through twelve short surveys involving up to 188 participants. In two additional surveys with 108 and 78 participants, students assessed affective responses to the smartphone-based experimental tasks relative to the programming and standard recitation tasks. Our findings indicate that the smartphone-based experimental tasks were generally well-suited to the students and tended to outperform the programming tasks in terms of perceptions of learning with the tasks and affective responses. Overall, students responded positively to the new experimental tasks, with perceptions comparable to, or only partly below, those of long-established standard recitation tasks. These results suggest that smartphone-based experimental tasks can be successfully integrated into teaching and contribute to refining traditional recitation tasks.</description>

      <title>Cosmology and general relativity (GR) in upper secondary school through new targeted teaching materials: a study on student learning and motivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmology and GR remain largely inaccessible to high-school teaching due to the advanced prerequisites to master these topics. Integrating them into upper secondary teaching is a significant challenge that remains unresolved. This contribution reports on an implementation study of a GR and cosmology course for upper secondary school students as part of an educational project launched during the centenary of GR and tested ever since for several years. The course aimed to expand students' knowledge to include current physics topics while highlighting their foundations in areas of classical physics such as Newtonian mechanics, electromagnetism, and waves. Targeted teaching and learning materials are focused on conceptual and qualitative understanding, while systematically combined with a mathematical treatment accessible at the upper secondary level, avoiding oversimplification. A key element is an active learning approach, incorporating activities and tasks such as engaging applications related to current research, reflective exercises, thought experiments, and hands-on tasks. The main research objective was to explore whether a conceptually deep and educationally effective GR and cosmology course could be successfully implemented for non-specialist upper secondary students. A pre-post study assessed both conceptual learning and affective outcomes, including interest, curiosity, self-concept, and perceived relevance of science. Results showed encouraging gains in both learning and motivation, with large to very large effect sizes for conceptual learning of core principles. Additionally, no or small effects of predictors such as gender were observed. We conclude that the integration of GR and cosmology into upper secondary physics teaching, in the form of courses and materials that are engaging, comprehensible, and impactful, is feasible.</description>

      <title>A simulation-heuristics dual-process model for intuitive physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of mental simulation in human physical reasoning is widely acknowledged, but whether it is employed across scenarios with varying simulation costs and where its boundary lies remains unclear. Using a pouring-marble task, our human study revealed two distinct error patterns when predicting pouring angles, differentiated by simulation time. While mental simulation accurately captured human judgments in simpler scenarios, a linear heuristic model better matched human predictions when simulation time exceeded a certain boundary. Motivated by these observations, we propose a dual-process framework, Simulation-Heuristics Model (SHM), where intuitive physics employs simulation for short-time simulation but switches to heuristics when simulation becomes costly. By integrating computational methods previously viewed as separate into a unified model, SHM quantitatively captures their switching mechanism. The SHM aligns more precisely with human behavior and demonstrates consistent predictive performance across diverse scenarios, advancing our understanding of the adaptive nature of intuitive physical reasoning.</description>
