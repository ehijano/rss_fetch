      <title>A lattice approach to matrix weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we recontextualize the theory of matrix weights within the setting of Banach lattices. We define an intrinsic notion of directional Banach function spaces, generalizing matrix weighted Lebesgue spaces. Moreover, we prove an extrapolation theorem for these spaces based on the boundedness of the convex-set valued maximal operator. We also provide bounds and equivalences related to the convex body sparse operator. Finally, we introduce a weak-type analogue of directional Banach function spaces. In particular, we show that the weak-type boundedness of the convex-set valued maximal operator on matrix weighted Lebesgue spaces is equivalent to the matrix Muckenhoupt condition, with equivalent constants.</description>

      <title>Using the Baire Category Theorem to Explore Lions Problem for Quasi-Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many results for Banach spaces also hold for quasi-Banach spaces. One important such example is results depending on the Baire Category Theorem (BCT). We use the BCT to explore Lions problem for a quasi-Banach couple $(A_0, A_1)$. Lions problem, posed in 1960's, is to prove that different parameters $(\theta,p)$ produce different interpolation spaces $(A_0, A_1)_{\theta, p}$. We first establish conditions on $A_0$ and $A_1$ so that interpolation spaces of this couple are strictly intermediate spaces between $A_0+A_1$ and $A_0\cap A_1$. This result, together with a reiteration theorem, gives a partial solution to Lions problem for quasi-Banach couples. We then apply our interpolation result to (partially) answer a question posed by Pietsch. More precisely, we show that if $p\neq p^*$ the operator ideals $\mathcal{L}^{(a)}_{p,q}(X,Y)$, $\mathcal{L}^{(a)}_{p^*,q^*}(X,Y)$ generated by approximation numbers are distinct. Moreover, for any fixed $p$, either all operator ideals $\mathcal{L}^{(a)}_{p,q}(X,Y)$ collapse into a unique space or they are pairwise distinct. We cite counterexamples which show that using interpolation spaces is not appropriate to solve Pietsch's problem for operator ideals based on general $s$-numbers. However, the BCT can be used to prove a lethargy result for arbitrary $s$-numbers which guarantees that, under very minimal conditions on $X,Y$, the space $\mathcal{L}^{(s)}_{p,q}(X,Y)$ is strictly embedded into $\mathcal{L}^{\mathcal{A}}(X,Y)$. The paper is dedicated to the memory of Prof. A. Pietsch, who passed away recently.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of weak R-duality and its application to Gabor frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak R-duals, a generalization of R-duals, were recently introduced; for which duality relations were established. In this paper, we consider the problem of characterizing a given frame sequence to be a weak R-dual of a given frame. Further, we apply these characterization results to the Gabor frame setting and prove that the weak R-duality of the adjoint Gabor system leads to the R-duality of the same, thereby indicating an approach to answer the famous problem of the adjoint Gabor system being an R-dual of a given Gabor frame.</description>

      <title>A note about dual representations of group actions on Lipschitz-free spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}(M)$ be the Lipschitz-free space of a pointed metric space $M$. For every isometric continuous group action of $G$ we have an induced continuous dual action on the weak-star compact unit ball $B_{\mathcal{F}(M)^*}$ of the dual space $\mathrm{Lip_0} (M)=\mathcal{F}(M)^*$. We pose the question when a given abstract continuous action of $G$ on a topological space $X$ can be represented through a $G$-subspace of $B_{\mathcal{F}(M)^*}$. One of such natural examples is the so-called metric compactification (of isometric $G$-spaces) for a pointed metric space. As well as the Gromov $G$-compactification of a bounded metric $G$-space. Note that there are sufficiently many representations of compact $G$-spaces on Lipschitz-free spaces.</description>

      <title>The ideal separation property for reduced group $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We say that an inclusion of a $*$-algebra $A$ into a $C^*$-algebra $B$ has the ideal separation property if closed ideals in $B$ can be recovered by their intersection with $A$. Such inclusions have attractive properties from the point of view of harmonic analysis and noncommutative geometry. We establish several permanence properties of locally compact groups for which $L^1(G) \subseteq C^*_{\mathrm{red}}(G)$ has the ideal separation property.</description>

      <title>Sobolev spaces via chains in metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the chain Sobolev space on a possibly non-complete metric measure space in terms of chain upper gradients. In this context, $\varepsilon$-chains are a finite collection of points with distance at most $\varepsilon$ between consecutive points. They play the role of discrete versions of curves. Chain upper gradients are defined accordingly and the chain Sobolev space is defined by letting the size parameter $\varepsilon$ going to zero. In the complete setting, we prove that the chain Sobolev space is equal to the classical notions of Sobolev spaces in terms of relaxation of upper gradients or of the local Lipschitz constant of Lipschitz functions. The proof of this fact is inspired by a recent technique developed by Eriksson-Bique. In the possible non-complete setting, we prove that the chain Sobolev space is equal to the one defined via relaxation of the local Lipschitz constant of Lipschitz functions, while in general they are different from the one defined via upper gradients along curves. We apply the theory developed in the paper to prove equivalent formulations of the Poincar\'{e} inequality in terms of pointwise estimates involving $\varepsilon$-upper gradients, lower bounds on modulus of chains connecting points and size of separating sets measured with the Minkowski content in the non-complete setting. Along the way, we discuss the notion of weak $\varepsilon$-upper gradients and asymmetric notions of integral along chains.</description>

      <title>Kernels of operators on Banach spaces induced by almost disjoint families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let~$\mathcal{A}$ be an almost disjoint family of subsets of an infinite set~$\Gamma$, and denote by~$X_{\mathcal{A}}$ the closed subspace of~$\ell_\infty(\Gamma)$ spanned by the indicator functions of intersections of finitely many sets in~$\mathcal{A}$. We show that if~$\mathcal{A}$ has cardinality greater than~$\Gamma$, then the closed subspace of~$X_{\mathcal{A}}$ spanned by the indicator functions of sets of the form $\bigcap_{j=1}^{n+1}A_j$, where $n\in\N$ and $A_1,\ldots,A_{n+1}\in\mathcal{A}$ are distinct, cannot be the kernel of any bounded operator \mbox{$X_{\mathcal{A}}\rightarrow \ell_{\infty}(\Gamma)$}. As a consequence, we deduce that the subspace \[ \bigl\{ x\in \ell_{\infty}(\Gamma) : \text{the set}\ \{\gamma \in \Gamma : \lvert x(\gamma)\rvert &gt; \varepsilon \}\ \text{has cardinality smaller than}\ \Gamma\ \text{for every}\ \varepsilon&gt;0\bigr\} \] of~$\ell_\infty(\Gamma)$ is not the kernel of any bounded operator on~$\ell_\infty(\Gamma)$; this generalises results of Kalton and of Pe\l{}czy\'{n}ski and Sudakov.
  The situation is more complex for the Banach space~$\ell_\infty^c(\Gamma)$ of countably supported, bounded functions defined on an uncountable set~$\Gamma$. We show that it is undecidable in \textsf{ZFC} whether every bounded operator on~$\ell_\infty^c(\omega_1)$ which vanishes on~$c_0(\omega_1)$ must vanish on a subspace of the form~$\ell_\infty^c(A)$ for some uncountable subset~$A$ of~$\omega_1$.</description>

      <title>On the complete separation of unique $\ell_{1}$ spreading models and the Lebesgue property of Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a reflexive Banach space $X_\mathcal{D}$ with an unconditional basis such that all spreading models admitted by normalized block sequences in $X_\mathcal{D}$ are uniformly equivalent to the unit vector basis of $\ell_1$, yet every infinite-dimensional closed subspace of $X_\mathcal{D}$ fails the Lebesgue property. This is a new result in a program initiated by Odell in 2002 concerning the strong separation of asymptotic properties in Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Order isomorphisms of sup-stable function spaces: continuous, Lipschitz, c-convex, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There have been many parallel streams of research studying order isomorphisms of some specific sets $\mathcal{G}$ of functions from a set $\mathcal{X}$ to $\mathbb{R}\cup\{\pm\infty\}$, such as the sets of convex or Lipschitz functions. We provide in this article a unified abstract approach inspired by $c$-convex functions. Our results are obtained highlighting the role of inf and sup-irreducible elements of $\mathcal{G}$ and the usefulness of characterizing them, to subsequently derive the structure of order isomorphisms, and in particular of those commuting with the addition of scalars. We show that in many cases all these isomorphisms $J:\mathcal{G}\to\mathcal{G}$ are of the form $Jf=g+f\circ \phi$ for a translation $g:\mathcal{X}\to\mathbb{R}$ and a bijective reparametrization $\phi:\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}$. Given a reference anti-isomorphism, this characterization then allows to recover all the other anti-isomorphisms. We apply our theory to the sets of $c$-convex functions on compact Hausdorff spaces, to the set of lower semicontinuous (convex) functions on a Hausdorff topological vector space and to 1-Lipschitz functions of complete metric spaces. The latter application is obtained using properties of the horoboundary of a metric space.</description>

      <title>Sequences of multiple products and cohomology classes for foliations of complex curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The idea of transversality is explored in the construction of cohomology theory associated to regularized sequences of multiple products of rational functions associated to vertex algebra cohomology of codimension one foliations on complex curves. Explicit formulas for cohomology invariants results from consideration transversality conditions applied to sequences of multiple products for elements of chain-cochain transversal complexes defined for codimension one foliations.</description>
