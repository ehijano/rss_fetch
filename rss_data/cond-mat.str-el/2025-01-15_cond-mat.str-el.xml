      <title>TeNeS-v2: Enhancement for Real-Time and Finite Temperature Simulations of Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems are challenging targets for computational physics due to their large degrees of freedom. The tensor networks, particularly Tensor Product States (TPS) and Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), effectively represent these systems on two-dimensional lattices. However, the technical complexity of TPS/PEPS-based coding is often too much for researchers to handle. To reduce this problem, we developed TeNeS (Tensor Network Solver). This paper introduces TeNeS-v2, which extends TeNeS with real-time and finite temperature simulations, providing deeper insights into quantum many-body systems. We detail the new algorithms, input/output design, and application examples, demonstrating TeNeS-v2's applicability to various quantum spin and Bose models on two-dimensional lattices.</description>

      <title>Origin of dimensional crossover in quasi-one-dimensional hollandite K$_{2}$Ru$_{8}$O$_{16}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intriguing phenomenon of dimensional crossover is comprehensively studied by experimental and theoretical investigation of electronic structure in quasi-one-dimensional hollandite K$_{2}$Ru$_{8}$O$_{16}$. Valence band photoemission spectra in conjunction with density functional theory within local density approximation combined with dynamical mean field theory (LDA+DMFT) reveal moderately correlated electronic structure. Anomalous temperature dependence of high-resolution spectra in the vicinity of Fermi level suggests Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid state down to 150 K, below which it undergoes a dimensional crossover from one-dimensional to three-dimensional electronic behaviour. Monotonously decreasing spectral intensity at the Fermi level along with Fermi cut-off at low temperature suggests non-Fermi liquid like behaviour. Many body effects captured within LDA+DMFT reveal increased warping of the Fermi surface with lowering temperature. A simple analysis suggests that the warping dominates the thermal energy induced momentum broadening at low temperature, leading to the 3D electronic behaviour. Our results offer valuable insight in understanding the interplay of dimensionality, electron correlation and thermal energy governing various exotic phenomena in quasi-one-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Robust triple-q magnetic order with trainable spin vorticity in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the candidate Kitaev magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ possesses novel triple-$\mathbf{q}$ magnetic order instead of conventional single-$\mathbf{q}$ zigzag order. Here we present dedicated experiments in search for distinct properties expected of the triple-$\mathbf{q}$ order, namely, insensitivity of the magnetic domains to weak $C_3$ symmetry-breaking fields and fictitious magnetic fields generated by the spin vorticity. In structurally pristine single crystals, we show that $C_3$ symmetry-breaking in-plane uniaxial strains do not affect the order's magnetic neutron diffraction signals. We further show that $\mathbf{c}$-axis propagating light exhibits large Faraday rotations in the ordered state due to the spin vorticity, the sign of which can be trained via the system's ferrimagnetic moment. These results are in favor of the triple-$\mathbf{q}$ order in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ and reveal its unique emerging behavior.</description>

      <title>Structural and Physical Properties of the Heavy Fermion Metal Ce$_2$NiAl$_6$Si$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly correlated electrons at the verge of quantum criticality give rise to unconventional phases of matter and behaviors, with the discovery of new quantum critical materials driving synergistic advances in both experiments and theory. In this work, we report the structural and physical properties of a new quaternary Ce-based heavy fermion compound, Ce$_2$NiAl$_6$Si$_5$, synthesized using the self-flux method. This compound forms a layered tetragonal structure (space group $P4/nmm$), with square nets of Ce atoms separated by Si-Al or Ni-Si-Ge layers. Specific heat measurements show a low temperature Sommerfeld coefficient of 1.4 J/mol-Ce K$^{2}$, with a reduced entropy indicative of significant Kondo interactions. Below 0.6 K, an upturn in resistivity and a deviation in magnetic susceptibility suggest the appearance of magnetic ordering or the development of dynamic magnetic correlations, which is further supported by a bulge in specific heat around 0.4 K. These results suggest that Ce$_2$NiAl$_6$Si$_5$ is a layered heavy fermion metal, naturally located in proximity to a spin-density-wave quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Interactions in the Polar Ferrimagnet with a Bipartite Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polar magnets A$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$ (A=Fe, Mn, Co, and Ni) feature a bipartite structure, where the magnetic A$^{2+}$ ions occupy two different sites with octahedral and tetrahedral oxygen coordinations. This bipartite structure provides a platform for the emergence of nontrivial magnetoelectric (ME) effects and intriguing excitation behaviors, and thus creates significant research interest. In this study, we conduct inelastic neutron scattering measurements on single crystals of Mn$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$, an L-type ferrimagnet in the A$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$ family, to investigate its spin dynamics. The obtained magnetic excitation spectra reveal two distinct magnon dispersions corresponding to the octahedral and tetrahedral spins in Mn$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$. These magnon bands can be well described by a spin Hamiltonian including Heisenberg and single-ion anisotropy terms. Employing our effective spin model, we successfully reproduce the unusual temperature dependence of the L-type ferrimagnetic susceptibility through self-consistent mean-field theory. This research reveals the significance of the bipartite structure in determining the excitation properties of the polar magnets $\rm{A_{2}Mo_{3}O_{8}}$ and provides valuable insights into the spin dynamics of L-type ferrimagnets.</description>

      <title>Intricately Entangled Spin and Charge Diffusion and the Coherence-Incoherence Crossover in the High-Dimensional Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlation-driven metal-insulator transitions and temperature-driven quantum-coherent-to-incoherent crossovers in correlated electron systems underpin the doping, temperature and frequency-resolved evolution of physical responses. Motivated by recent experimental studies that investigate the evolution of dynamical spin and charge responses, we analyze the spin and charge diffusion spectra in both half-filled and doped one-band Hubbard model using Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) combined with the Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG). We compare the relative strengths and limitations of Density Matrix NRG (DMNRG) and Full Density Matrix NRG (FDM-NRG) in capturing low-frequency spectral features and their evolution with temperature, interaction strength and band-filling. Key measures, including characteristic frequency scales, Kullback-Leibler divergence, diffusion constants, and kurtosis provide complementary but internally consistent picture for the evolution of spin and charge excitations across bandwidth as well as the band-filling driven Mott transitions and the coherent-incoherent crossover. We find that spin and charge fluctuations cross over from quantum-coherent-to-quantum-incoherent at distinct temperatures, providing a microscopic insight into the complex, two-stage, Fermi-to-non-Fermi liquid-to-bad metal crossovers seen in transport data, in particular in the $dc$ resistivity.</description>

      <title>Two-Peak Heat Capacity Accounts for $R\ln(2)$ Entropy and Ground State Access in the Dipole-Octupole Pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report new magnetic heat capacity measurements of a high quality single crystal of the dipole-octupole pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ down to a temperature of $T = 0.02$ K, a factor of three lower than those previously reported. These show a two-peaked structure, with a Schottky-like peak at $T_1 \sim 0.065$ K, similar to what is observed in its sister Ce-pyrochlores Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. However a second, sharper peak is observed at $T_2 \sim 0.025$ K, which signifies the entrance to its ground state, as even the most abrupt low-temperature extrapolation to $C_P=0$ at $T = 0$ K gives a full accounting of $R\ln(2)$ in entropy, associated with the well isolated pseudospin-1/2 doublet for Ce$^{3+}$ in this environment. The ground state could be conventionally ordered, although theory predicts a much larger anomaly in $C_P$, at much higher temperatures than the measured $T_2$, for expectations from an all-in all-out ground state of the nearest-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian for Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. The sharp low-temperature peak could also signify a cross-over from a classical to a quantum spin liquid regime. The diffuse magnetic neutron scattering observed from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures between $T_2$ and $T_1$ resembles that observed from Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, which is well established as a $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice.</description>

      <title>SymSETs and self-dualities under gauging non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-duality defects under discrete gauging in a categorical symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ can be classified by inequivalent ways of enriching the bulk SymTFT of $\mathcal{C}$ with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ 0-form symmetry. The resulting Symmetry Enriched Topological (SET) orders will be referred to as $\textit{SymSETs}$ and are parameterized by choices of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, as well as symmetry fractionalization classes and discrete torsions. In this work, we consider self-dualities under gauging $\textit{non-invertible}$ $0$-form symmetries in $2$-dim QFTs and explore their SymSETs. Unlike the simpler case of self-dualities under gauging finite Abelian groups, the SymSETs here generally admit multiple choices of fractionalization classes. We provide a direct construction of the SymSET from a given duality defect using its $\textit{relative center}$. Using the SymSET, we show explicitly that changing fractionalization classes can change fusion rules of the duality defect besides its $F$-symbols. We consider three concrete examples: the maximal gauging of $\operatorname{Rep} H_8$, the non-maximal gauging of the duality defect $\mathcal{N}$ in $\operatorname{Rep} H_8$ and $\operatorname{Rep} D_8$ respectively. The latter two cases each result in 6 fusion categories with two types of fusion rules related by changing fractionalization class. In particular, two self-dualities of $\operatorname{Rep} D_8$ related by changing the fractionalization class lead to $\operatorname{Rep} D_{16}$ and $\operatorname{Rep} SD_{16}$ respectively. Finally, we study the physical implications such as the spin selection rules and the SPT phases for the aforementioned categories.</description>

      <title>Richardson-Gaudin states of non-zero seniority I: matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seniority-zero wavefunctions describe bond-breaking processes qualitatively. As eigenvectors of a model Hamiltonian, Richardson-Gaudin states provide a clear physical picture and allow for systematic improvement via standard single reference approaches. Until now, this treatment has been done in the seniority-zero channel. In this manuscript, the corresponding states with higher seniorities are identified, and their couplings through the Coulomb Hamiltonian are computed. In every case, the couplings between the states are computed from the cofactors of their effective overlap matrix. Proof of principle calculations demonstrate that a single reference configuration interaction is comparable with seniority-based configuration interaction computations at a substantially reduced cost. The next manuscript in this series will identify the corresponding Slater-Condon rules and make the computations feasible.</description>

      <title>Exotic massive fermionic systems with huge vacuum degeneracy at boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a massive non-relativistic fermionic system exhibiting exotic features. When the mass parameter is set to zero, the system acquires the fermionic subsystem symmetry. Introducing the mass term explicitly breaks this symmetry, resulting in a trivially gapped system in the absence of boundaries. We demonstrate that with the introduction of boundaries, the system remains gapped, but it has a huge vacuum degeneracy. The residual entropy is proportional to the area of the boundary.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle Fermi surfaces of niobium and niobium-titanium alloys at high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic structure of pure niobium and the niobium-titanium alloy Nb$_{0.44}$Ti$_{0.56}$ in the bcc-phase at pressures up to $250$ GPa is investigated, to reveal possible factors conducing toward the robust superconductivity reported for Ti-doped niobium upon a considerable volume reduction. We model the structural disorder using the coherent potential approximation, and the electronic correlations are taken into account using dynamical mean-field theory. At high pressure, a significant change in the topology of the Fermi surface is observed, while electronic correlations weaken with increasing pressure. Thus, the normal state of Nb$_{0.44}$Ti$_{0.56}$ is found to be a Fermi liquid with a well-defined Fermi surface, and well-defined quasiparticles near it. The systematic study of the impact of disorder upon the Fermi surface at such ultra high pressures allows notable insights into the nature of the electronic states near the Fermi level, i.e., within the energy scale relevant for superconducting pairing. Furthermore, our results clearly indicate the necessity of further experimental Fermi surface explorations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Dichroism in Rutile NiF$_2$: Separating Altermagnetic and Ferromagnetic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present numerical simulations of x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the L$_{2,3}$ edge of Ni in the weakly ferromagnetic altermagnet NiF$_2$. Our results predict a significant XMCD signal for light propagating perpendicular to the magnetic moments, which are approximately aligned along the [100] easy-axis direction. The analysis shows that the altermagnetic and ferromagnetic contributions to the XMCD signal can be uniquely distinguished by their dependence on an applied magnetic field. By varying the angle of the field relative to the easy axis, the in-plane orientation of both the N\'eel vector and the net magnetization can be systematically controlled. We further demonstrate that the XMCD signal, even under fields as strong as 40 T and for any in-plane orientation, can be accurately described as a linear combination of two spectral components, with geometrical prefactors determined by the field magnitude and direction. This insight enables experimental validation of the distinctive relationship between the N\'eel vector orientation and the x-ray Hall vector in the rutile structure. Quantitative simulations supporting these findings are provided.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon coupling and phonon dynamics in single-layer NbSe$_2$ on graphene: the role of moir\'e phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between substrate interactions and electron-phonon coupling in two-dimensional (2D) materials presents a significant challenge in understanding and controlling their electronic properties. Here, we present a comparative study of the structural characteristics, phonon dynamics, and electron-phonon interactions in bulk and monolayer NbSe$_2$ on epitaxial bilayer graphene (BLG) using helium atom scattering (HAS). High-resolution helium diffraction reveals a (9x9)0$^{\circ}$ superstructure within the NbSe$_2$ monolayer, commensurate with the BLG lattice, while out-of-plane HAS diffraction spectra indicate a low-corrugated (3$\sqrt{3}$x3$\sqrt{3}$)30$^{\circ}$ substructure. By monitoring the thermal attenuation of the specular peak across a temperature range of 100 K to 300 K, we determined the electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda_{HAS}$ as 0.76 for bulk 2H-NbSe$_2$. In contrast, the NbSe$_2$ monolayer on graphene exhibits a reduced $\lambda_{HAS}$ of 0.55, corresponding to a superconducting critical temperature (T$_C$) of 1.56 K according to the MacMillan formula, consistent with transport measurement findings. Inelastic HAS data provide, besides a set of dispersion curves of acoustic and lower optical phonons, a soft, dispersionless branch of phonons at 1.7 meV, attributed to the interface localized defects distributed with the superstructure period, and thus termed moir\'e phonons. Our data show that moir\'e phonons contribute significantly to the electron-phonon coupling in monolayer NbSe$_2$. These results highlight the crucial role of the BLG on the electron-phonon coupling in monolayer NbSe$_2$, attributed to enhanced charge transfer effects, providing valuable insights into substrate-dependent electronic interactions in 2D superconductors.</description>

      <title>Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid Behavior in a Rydberg-encoded Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations can disrupt long-range order in one-dimensional systems, and replace it with the universal paradigm of the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL), a critical phase of matter characterized by power-law decaying correlations and linearly dispersing excitations. Using a Rydberg quantum simulator, we study how TLL physics manifests in the low-energy properties of a spin chain, interacting under either the ferromagnetic or the antiferromagnetic dipolar XY Hamiltonian. Following quasi-adiabatic preparation, we directly observe the power-law decay of spin-spin correlations in real-space, allowing us to extract the Luttinger parameter. In the presence of an impurity, the chain exhibits tunable Friedel oscillations of the local magnetization. Moreover, by utilizing a quantum quench, we directly probe the propagation of correlations, which exhibit a light-cone structure related to the linear sound mode of the underlying TLL. Our measurements demonstrate the influence of the long-range dipolar interactions, renormalizing the parameters of TLL with respect to the case of nearest-neighbor interactions. Finally, comparison to numerical simulations exposes the high sensitivity of TLLs to doping and finite-size effects.</description>

      <title>Realization of a doped quantum antiferromagnet with dipolar tunnelings in a Rydberg tweezer array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doping an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator is central to our understanding of a variety of phenomena in strongly-correlated electrons, including high-temperature superconductors. To describe the competition between tunneling $t$ of hole dopants and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin interactions $J$, theoretical and numerical studies often focus on the paradigmatic $t$-$J$ model, and the direct analog quantum simulation of this model in the relevant regime of high-particle density has long been sought. Here, we realize a doped quantum antiferromagnet with next-nearest neighbour (NNN) tunnelings $t'$ and hard-core bosonic holes using a Rydberg tweezer platform. We utilize coherent dynamics between three Rydberg levels, encoding spins and holes, to implement a tunable bosonic $t$-$J$-$V$ model allowing us to study previously inaccessible parameter regimes. We observe dynamical phase separation between hole and spin domains for $|t/J|\ll 1$, and demonstrate the formation of repulsively bound hole pairs in a variety of spin backgrounds. The interference between NNN tunnelings $t'$ and perturbative pair tunneling gives rise to light and heavy pairs depending on the sign of $t$. Using the single-site control allows us to study the dynamics of a single hole in 2D square lattice (anti)ferromagnets. The model we implement extends the toolbox of Rydberg tweezer experiments beyond spin-1/2 models to a larger class of $t$-$J$ and spin-$1$ models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a tensor network method for approximating thermal equilibrium states of quantum many-body systems at low temperatures. In contrast to standard (thermofield double matrix product state) algorithms, our ansatz is constructed from the zero-temperature limit, the ground state, which can be simply found with a standard tensor network approach. This method allows us to efficiently compute thermodynamic quantities and entanglement properties. We demonstrate our approach within a tree tensor network ansatz, although it can be extended to other tensor networks, and present results illustrating its effectiveness in capturing the finite-temperature properties in the $1\mathrm{D}$ and $2\mathrm{D}$ scenario.</description>

Abstract: We employ matrix product states (MPS) and tensor networks to study topological properties of the space of ground states of gapped many-body systems. We focus on families of states in one spatial dimension, where each state can be represented as an injective MPS of finite bond dimension. Such states are short-range entangled ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. To such parametrized families over $X$ we associate a gerbe, which generalizes the line bundle of ground states in zero-dimensional families (\emph{i.e.} in few-body quantum mechanics). The nontriviality of the gerbe is measured by a class in $H^3(X, \mathbb{Z})$, which is believed to classify one-dimensional parametrized systems. We show that when the gerbe is nontrivial, there is an obstruction to representing the family of ground states with an MPS tensor that is continuous everywhere on $X$. We illustrate our construction with two examples of nontrivial parametrized systems over $X=S^3$ and $X = \mathbb{R} P^2 \times S^1$. Finally, we sketch using tensor network methods how the construction extends to higher dimensional parametrized systems, with an example of a two-dimensional parametrized system that gives rise to a nontrivial 2-gerbe over $X = S^4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified mathematical theory of defect condensations for topological orders in all dimensions based on higher categories, higher algebras and higher representations. A k-codimensional topological defect $A$ in an n+1D (potentially anomalous) topological order $C^{n+1}$ is condensable if it is equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_k$-algebra. Condensing such a defect $A$ amounts to a k-step process. In the first step, we condense the defect $A$ along one of its transversal directions, thus obtaining a (k-1)-codimensional defect $\Sigma A$, which is naturally equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_{k-1}$-algebra. In the second step, we condense the defect $\Sigma A$ in one of the remaining transversal directions, thus obtaining a (k-2)-codimensional defect $\Sigma^2 A$, so on and so forth. In the k-th step, we condense the 1-codimensional defect $\Sigma^{k-1}A$ along the only transversal direction, thus defining a phase transition from $C^{n+1}$ to a new n+1D topological order $D^{n+1}$. We give precise mathematical descriptions of each step in above process, including the precise mathematical characterization of the condensed phase $D^{n+1}$. When $C^{n+1}$ is anomaly-free, the same phase transition can be alternatively defined by replacing the last two steps by a single step of condensing the $E_2$-algebra $\Sigma^{k-2}A$ directly along the remaining two transversal directions. When n=2, this modified last step is precisely a usual anyon condensation in a 2+1D topological order. We derive many new mathematical results physically along the way. Some of them will be proved in a mathematical companion of this paper. We also briefly discuss questions, generalizations and applications that naturally arise from our theory, including higher Morita theory, a theory of integrals and the condensations of liquid-like gapless defects in topological orders.</description>

      <title>Low-energy spin excitations in field-induced phases of the spin-ladder antiferromagnet BiCu$_2$PO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on terahertz spectroscopic measurements of quantum spin dynamics on single crystals of a spin-1/2 frustrated spin-ladder antiferromagnet BiCu$_2$PO$_6$ as a function of temperature, polarization, and applied external magnetic fields. Spin triplon excitations are observed at zero field and split in applied magnetic fields. For magnetic fields applied along the crystallographic $a$ axis, a quantum phase transition at $B_{c1}=21.4 \mathrm{T}$ is featured by a low-energy excitation mode emerging above $B_{c1}$ which indicates a gap reopening. For fields along the $b$ axis and the $c$ axis, different field dependencies are observed for the spin triplon excitations, whereas no low-lying modes could be resolved at field-induced phase transitions. We perform a theoretical analysis of the magnetic field dependence of the spin triplon modes by using continuous unitary transformations to determine an effective low energy Hamiltonian. Through an exhaustive parameter search we find numerically optimized parameters to very well describe the experimentally observed modes, which corroborate the importance of significant magnetic anisotropy in the system.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic linear Edelstein effect in non-collinear EuIn2As2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the ongoing interest in understanding the actual magnetic ground state of the promising axion insulator candidate EuIn2As2, we present here a spin symmetry analysis and ab-initio calculations, aiming to identify specific exchange-dominated physics that could offer insights into the current debate. We investigate two non-collinear coplanar magnetic orders reported in this compound: the helical and broken helical phases. Our symmetry analysis shows that magnetic-exchange alone results in the formation of an out-of-plane odd-wave order in momentum space with a single un-polarized nodal plane in both phases. Additionally, we identified an in-plane g-wave order that emerges exclusively in the broken helical phase, providing a distinguishing feature for this phase. Furthermore, we report a non-relativistic Edelstein effect with a distinct out-of-plane polarized spin density that dominates over spin-orbit coupling effects. Our ab-initio calculations reveal a significant contrast in the magnitude of this effect between both phases, which could serve as a means to identify the magnetic transition and distinguish them from other magnetic ground states proposed for this compound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a formalism based on colour symmetry to analyse the momentum-space spin textures of non-collinear magnets. We show that, out of the spin textures allowed by the magnetic point group, one can extract an `altermagnetic' component that is invariant by general rotations in spin space, and can exist in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate this approach in the case of three complex, non-collinear magnets, Mn$_3$Ir(Ge,Si), Pb$_2$MnO$_4$ and Mn$_3$GaN. For Mn$_3$GaN, we also show that the predictions of colour-symmetry analysis are consistent with density functional theory calculations performed on the same system both with and without spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06661v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among various classes of quantum error correcting codes (QECCs), non-stabilizer codes have rich properties and are of theoretical and practical interest. Decoding non-stabilizer codes is, however, a highly non-trivial task. In this paper, we show that a decoding circuit for Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes can be straightforwardly extended to handle general QECCs. The key to the extension lies in the use of a pair of classical-quantum (CQ) codes associated with the QECC to be decoded. The decoding error of the proposed decoding circuit depends on the classical decoding errors of the CQ codes and their degree of complementarity. We demonstrate the power of the decoding circuit in a toy model of the black hole information paradox, improving decoding errors compared to previous results. In addition, we reveal that black hole dynamics may optimally encode quantum information but poorly encode classical information.</description>

Abstract: The Rydberg blockade mechanism is an important ingredient in quantum simulators based on neutral atom arrays. It enables the emergence of a rich variety of quantum phases of matter, such as topological spin liquids. The typically isotropic nature of the blockade effect, however, restricts the range of natively accessible models and quantum states. In this work, we propose a method to systematically overcome this limitation, by developing gadgets, i.e., specific arrangements of atoms, that transform the underlying Rydberg blockade into more general constraints. We apply this technique to realize dimer models on square and triangular geometries. In these setups, we study the role of the quantum fluctuations induced by a coherent drive of the atoms and find signatures of $U(1)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid states in the respective ground states. Finally, we show that these states can be dynamically prepared with high fidelity, paving the way for the quantum simulation of a broader class of constrained models and topological matter in experiments with Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space Diffusion in Systems with Approximate Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19260v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory (RMT) universality is the defining property of quantum mechanical chaotic systems, and can be probed by observables like the spectral form factor (SFF). In this paper, we describe systematic deviations from RMT behaviour at intermediate time scales in systems with approximate symmetries. At early times, the symmetries allow us to organize the Hilbert space into approximately decoupled sectors, each of which contributes independently to the SFF. At late times, the SFF transitions into the final ramp of the fully mixed chaotic Hamiltonian. For approximate continuous symmetries, the transitional behaviour is governed by a universal process that we call Hilbert space diffusion. The diffusion constant corresponding to this process is related to the relaxation rate of the associated nearly conserved charge. By implementing a chaotic sigma model for Hilbert-space diffusion, we formulate an analytic theory of this process which agrees quantitatively with our numerical results for different examples.</description>

      <title>Quantized axial charge of staggered fermions and the chiral anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12220v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1+1D ultra-local lattice Hamiltonian for staggered fermions with a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, there are two conserved, integer-valued charges that flow in the continuum limit to the vector and axial charges of a massless Dirac fermion with a perturbative anomaly. Each of the two lattice charges generates an ordinary U(1) global symmetry that acts locally on operators and can be gauged individually. Interestingly, they do not commute on a finite lattice and generate the Onsager algebra, but their commutator goes to zero in the continuum limit. The chiral anomaly is matched by this non-abelian algebra, which is consistent with the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We further prove that the presence of these two conserved lattice charges forces the low-energy phase to be gapless, reminiscent of the consequence from perturbative anomalies of continuous global symmetries in continuum field theory. Upon bosonization, these two charges lead to two exact U(1) symmetries in the XX model that flow to the momentum and winding symmetries in the free boson conformal field theory.</description>
