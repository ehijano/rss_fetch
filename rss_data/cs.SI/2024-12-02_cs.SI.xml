      <title>Know Your Account: Double Graph Inference-based Account De-anonymization on Ethereum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaled Web 3.0 digital economy, represented by decentralized finance (DeFi), has sparked increasing interest in the past few years, which usually relies on blockchain for token transfer and diverse transaction logic. However, illegal behaviors, such as financial fraud, hacker attacks, and money laundering, are rampant in the blockchain ecosystem and seriously threaten its integrity and security. In this paper, we propose a novel double graph-based Ethereum account de-anonymization inference method, dubbed DBG4ETH, which aims to capture the behavioral patterns of accounts comprehensively and has more robust analytical and judgment capabilities for current complex and continuously generated transaction behaviors. Specifically, we first construct a global static graph to build complex interactions between the various account nodes for all transaction data. Then, we also construct a local dynamic graph to learn about the gradual evolution of transactions over different periods. Different graphs focus on information from different perspectives, and features of global and local, static and dynamic transaction graphs are available through DBG4ETH. In addition, we propose an adaptive confidence calibration method to predict the results by feeding the calibrated weighted prediction values into the classifier. Experimental results show that DBG4ETH achieves state-of-the-art results in the account identification task, improving the F1-score by at least 3.75% and up to 40.52% compared to processing each graph type individually and outperforming similar account identity inference methods by 5.23% to 12.91%.</description>

      <title>Build An Influential Bot In Social Media Simulations With Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of public opinion evolution on online social platforms is critical for analyzing influence mechanisms. Traditional approaches to influencer analysis are typically divided into qualitative assessments of personal attributes and quantitative evaluations of influence power. In this study, we introduce a novel simulated environment that combines Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) with Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling agents to generate posts, form opinions, and update follower networks. This simulation allows for more detailed observations of how opinion leaders emerge. Additionally, we present an innovative application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to replicate the process of opinion leader formation. Our findings reveal that limiting the action space and incorporating self-observation are key factors for achieving stable opinion leader generation. The learning curves demonstrate the model's capacity to identify optimal strategies and adapt to complex, unpredictable dynamics.</description>

      <title>Misinformation Dissemination: Effects of Network Density in Segregated Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between network features and misinformation propagation is crucial for mitigating the spread of false information. Here, we investigate how network density and segregation affect the dissemination of misinformation using a susceptible-infectious-recovered framework. We find that a higher density consistently increases the proportion of misinformation believers. In segregated networks, our results reveal that minorities affect the majority: denser minority groups increase the number of believers in the majority, demonstrating how the structure of a segregated minority can influence misinformation dynamics within the majority group.</description>

      <title>Federated Continual Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of big data, managing evolving graph data poses substantial challenges due to storage costs and privacy issues. Training graph neural networks (GNNs) on such evolving data usually causes catastrophic forgetting, impairing performance on earlier tasks. Despite existing continual graph learning (CGL) methods mitigating this to some extent, they predominantly operate in centralized architectures and overlook the potential of distributed graph databases to harness collective intelligence for enhanced performance optimization. To address these challenges, we present a pioneering study on Federated Continual Graph Learning (FCGL), which adapts GNNs to multiple evolving graphs within decentralized settings while adhering to storage and privacy constraints. Our work begins with a comprehensive empirical analysis of FCGL, assessing its data characteristics, feasibility, and effectiveness, and reveals two principal challenges: local graph forgetting (LGF), where local GNNs forget prior knowledge when adapting to new tasks, and global expertise conflict (GEC), where the global GNN exhibits sub-optimal performance in both adapting to new tasks and retaining old ones, arising from inconsistent client expertise during server-side parameter aggregation. To tackle these, we propose the POWER framework, which mitigates LGF by preserving and replaying experience nodes with maximum local-global coverage at each client and addresses GEC by using a pseudo prototype reconstruction strategy and trajectory-aware knowledge transfer at the central server. Extensive evaluations across multiple graph datasets demonstrate POWER's superior performance over straightforward federated extensions of the centralized CGL algorithms and vision-focused federated continual learning algorithms.

      <title>Updating Katz centrality by counting walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop efficient and effective strategies for the update of Katz centralities after node and edge removal in simple graphs. We provide explicit formulas for the ``loss of walks" a network suffers when nodes/edges are removed, and use these to inform our algorithms. The theory builds on the newly introduced concept of $\cF$-avoiding first-passage walks. Further, bounds on the change of total network communicability are also derived. Extensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world networks complement our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Memory Efficient GPU-based Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) for Community Detection on Large Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection involves grouping nodes in a graph with dense connections within groups, than between them. We previously proposed efficient multicore (GVE-LPA) and GPU-based ($\nu$-LPA) implementations of Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) for community detection. However, these methods incur high memory overhead due to their per-thread/per-vertex hashtables. This makes it challenging to process large graphs on shared memory systems. In this report, we introduce memory-efficient GPU-based LPA implementations, using weighted Boyer-Moore (BM) and Misra-Gries (MG) sketches. Our new implementation, $\nu$MG8-LPA, using an 8-slot MG sketch, reduces memory usage by 98x and 44x compared to GVE-LPA and $\nu$-LPA, respectively. It is also 2.4x faster than GVE-LPA and only 1.1x slower than $\nu$-LPA, with minimal quality loss (4.7%/2.9% drop compared to GVE-LPA/$\nu$-LPA).</description>

      <title>A Matrix Factorization Based Network Embedding Method for DNS Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, I explore the potential of network embedding (a.k.a. graph representation learning) to characterize DNS entities in passive network traffic logs. I propose an MF-DNS-E (\underline{M}atrix-\underline{F}actorization-based \underline{DNS} \underline{E}mbedding) method to represent DNS entities (e.g., domain names and IP addresses), where a random-walk-based matrix factorization objective is applied to learn the corresponding low-dimensional embeddings.</description>

      <title>Model, Analyze, and Comprehend User Interactions within a Social Media Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel graph-based approach to model, analyze and comprehend user interactions within a social media platform based on post-comment relationship. We construct a user interaction graph from social media data and analyze it to gain insights into community dynamics, user behavior, and content preferences. Our investigation reveals that while 56.05% of the active users are strongly connected within the community, only 0.8% of them significantly contribute to its dynamics. Moreover, we observe temporal variations in community activity, with certain periods experiencing heightened engagement. Additionally, our findings highlight a correlation between user activity and popularity showing that more active users are generally more popular. Alongside these, a preference for positive and informative content is also observed where 82.41% users preferred positive and informative content. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and managing online communities, leveraging graph-based techniques to gain valuable insights into user behavior and community dynamics.</description>
