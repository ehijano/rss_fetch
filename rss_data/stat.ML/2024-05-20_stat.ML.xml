      <title>A note on continuous-time online learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In online learning, the data is provided in a sequential order, and the goal of the learner is to make online decisions to minimize overall regrets. This note is concerned with continuous-time models and algorithms for several online learning problems: online linear optimization, adversarial bandit, and adversarial linear bandit. For each problem, we extend the discrete-time algorithm to the continuous-time setting and provide a concise proof of the optimal regret bound.</description>

      <title>Data Science Principles for Interpretable and Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Society's capacity for algorithmic problem-solving has never been greater. Artificial Intelligence is now applied across more domains than ever, a consequence of powerful abstractions, abundant data, and accessible software. As capabilities have expanded, so have risks, with models often deployed without fully understanding their potential impacts. Interpretable and interactive machine learning aims to make complex models more transparent and controllable, enhancing user agency. This review synthesizes key principles from the growing literature in this field.
  We first introduce precise vocabulary for discussing interpretability, like the distinction between glass box and explainable algorithms. We then explore connections to classical statistical and design principles, like parsimony and the gulfs of interaction. Basic explainability techniques -- including learned embeddings, integrated gradients, and concept bottlenecks -- are illustrated with a simple case study. We also review criteria for objectively evaluating interpretability approaches. Throughout, we underscore the importance of considering audience goals when designing interactive algorithmic systems. Finally, we outline open challenges and discuss the potential role of data science in addressing them. Code to reproduce all examples can be found at https://go.wisc.edu/3k1ewe.</description>

      <title>Restless Linear Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A more general formulation of the linear bandit problem is considered to allow for dependencies over time. Specifically, it is assumed that there exists an unknown $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued stationary $\varphi$-mixing sequence of parameters $(\theta_t,~t \in \mathbb{N})$ which gives rise to pay-offs. This instance of the problem can be viewed as a generalization of both the classical linear bandits with iid noise, and the finite-armed restless bandits. In light of the well-known computational hardness of optimal policies for restless bandits, an approximation is proposed whose error is shown to be controlled by the $\varphi$-dependence between consecutive $\theta_t$. An optimistic algorithm, called LinMix-UCB, is proposed for the case where $\theta_t$ has an exponential mixing rate. The proposed algorithm is shown to incur a sub-linear regret of $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{d n\mathrm{polylog}(n) }\right)$ with respect to an oracle that always plays a multiple of $\mathbb{E}\theta_t$. The main challenge in this setting is to ensure that the exploration-exploitation strategy is robust against long-range dependencies. The proposed method relies on Berbee's coupling lemma to carefully select near-independent samples and construct confidence ellipsoids around empirical estimates of $\mathbb{E}\theta_t$.</description>

      <title>Submodular Information Selection for Hypothesis Testing with Misclassification Penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of selecting an optimal subset of information sources for a hypothesis testing/classification task where the goal is to identify the true state of the world from a finite set of hypotheses, based on finite observation samples from the sources. In order to characterize the learning performance, we propose a misclassification penalty framework, which enables non-uniform treatment of different misclassification errors. In a centralized Bayesian learning setting, we study two variants of the subset selection problem: (i) selecting a minimum cost information set to ensure that the maximum penalty of misclassifying the true hypothesis remains bounded and (ii) selecting an optimal information set under a limited budget to minimize the maximum penalty of misclassifying the true hypothesis. Under mild assumptions, we prove that the objective (or constraints) of these combinatorial optimization problems are weak (or approximate) submodular, and establish high-probability performance guarantees for greedy algorithms. Further, we propose an alternate metric for information set selection which is based on the total penalty of misclassification. We prove that this metric is submodular and establish near-optimal guarantees for the greedy algorithms for both the information set selection problems. Finally, we present numerical simulations to validate our theoretical results over several randomly generated instances.</description>

      <title>The fast committor machine: Interpretable prediction with kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of stochastic dynamics, the committor function describes the probability that a process starting from an initial configuration $x$ will reach set $A$ before set $B$. This paper introduces a fast and interpretable method for approximating the committor, called the "fast committor machine" (FCM). The FCM is based on simulated trajectory data, and it uses this data to train a kernel model. The FCM identifies low-dimensional subspaces that optimally describe the $A$ to $B$ transitions, and the subspaces are emphasized in the kernel model. The FCM uses randomized numerical linear algebra to train the model with runtime that scales linearly in the number of data points. This paper applies the FCM to example systems including the alanine dipeptide miniprotein: in these experiments, the FCM is generally more accurate and trains more quickly than a neural network with a similar number of parameters.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Benchmarking of Reinforcement Learning Agents for Personalized Retail Promotions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of open benchmarking platforms could greatly accelerate the adoption of AI agents in retail. This paper presents comprehensive simulations of customer shopping behaviors for the purpose of benchmarking reinforcement learning (RL) agents that optimize coupon targeting. The difficulty of this learning problem is largely driven by the sparsity of customer purchase events. We trained agents using offline batch data comprising summarized customer purchase histories to help mitigate this effect. Our experiments revealed that contextual bandit and deep RL methods that are less prone to over-fitting the sparse reward distributions significantly outperform static policies. This study offers a practical framework for simulating AI agents that optimize the entire retail customer journey. It aims to inspire the further development of simulation tools for retail AI systems.</description>

      <title>Distributed Event-Based Learning via ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a distributed learning problem, where agents minimize a global objective function by exchanging information over a network. Our approach has two distinct features: (i) It substantially reduces communication by triggering communication only when necessary, and (ii) it is agnostic to the data-distribution among the different agents. We can therefore guarantee convergence even if the local data-distributions of the agents are arbitrarily distinct. We analyze the convergence rate of the algorithm and derive accelerated convergence rates in a convex setting. We also characterize the effect of communication drops and demonstrate that our algorithm is robust to communication failures. The article concludes by presenting numerical results from a distributed LASSO problem, and distributed learning tasks on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The experiments underline communication savings of 50% or more due to the event-based communication strategy, show resilience towards heterogeneous data-distributions, and highlight that our approach outperforms common baselines such as FedAvg, FedProx, and FedADMM.</description>

      <title>$\ell_1$-Regularized Generalized Least Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose an $\ell_1$-regularized GLS estimator for high-dimensional regressions with potentially autocorrelated errors. We establish non-asymptotic oracle inequalities for estimation accuracy in a framework that allows for highly persistent autoregressive errors. In practice, the Whitening matrix required to implement the GLS is unkown, we present a feasible estimator for this matrix, derive consistency results and ultimately show how our proposed feasible GLS can recover closely the optimal performance (as if the errors were a white noise) of the LASSO. A simulation study verifies the performance of the proposed method, demonstrating that the penalized (feasible) GLS-LASSO estimator performs on par with the LASSO in the case of white noise errors, whilst outperforming it in terms of sign-recovery and estimation error when the errors exhibit significant correlation.</description>

      <title>A Functional Model Method for Nonconvex Nonsmooth Conditional Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider stochastic optimization problems involving an expected value of a nonlinear function of a base random vector and a conditional expectation of another function depending on the base random vector, a dependent random vector, and the decision variables. We call such problems conditional stochastic optimization problems. They arise in many applications, such as uplift modeling, reinforcement learning, and contextual optimization. We propose a specialized single time-scale stochastic method for nonconvex constrained conditional stochastic optimization problems with a Lipschitz smooth outer function and a generalized differentiable inner function. In the method, we approximate the inner conditional expectation with a rich parametric model whose mean squared error satisfies a stochastic version of a {\L}ojasiewicz condition. The model is used by an inner learning algorithm. The main feature of our approach is that unbiased stochastic estimates of the directions used by the method can be generated with one observation from the joint distribution per iteration, which makes it applicable to real-time learning. The directions, however, are not gradients or subgradients of any overall objective function. We prove the convergence of the method with probability one, using the method of differential inclusions and a specially designed Lyapunov function, involving a stochastic generalization of the Bregman distance. Finally, a numerical illustration demonstrates the viability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Model orthogonalization and Bayesian forecast mixing via Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One can improve predictability in the unknown domain by combining forecasts of imperfect complex computational models using a Bayesian statistical machine learning framework. In many cases, however, the models used in the mixing process are similar. In addition to contaminating the model space, the existence of such similar, or even redundant, models during the multimodeling process can result in misinterpretation of results and deterioration of predictive performance. In this work we describe a method based on the Principal Component Analysis that eliminates model redundancy. We show that by adding model orthogonalization to the proposed Bayesian Model Combination framework, one can arrive at better prediction accuracy and reach excellent uncertainty quantification performance.</description>

      <title>Recursively Feasible Shrinking-Horizon MPC in Dynamic Environments with Conformal Prediction Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the problem of shrinking-horizon Model Predictive Control (MPC) in uncertain dynamic environments. We consider controlling a deterministic autonomous system that interacts with uncontrollable stochastic agents during its mission. Employing tools from conformal prediction, existing works derive high-confidence prediction regions for the unknown agent trajectories, and integrate these regions in the design of suitable safety constraints for MPC. Despite guaranteeing probabilistic safety of the closed-loop trajectories, these constraints do not ensure feasibility of the respective MPC schemes for the entire duration of the mission. We propose a shrinking-horizon MPC that guarantees recursive feasibility via a gradual relaxation of the safety constraints as new prediction regions become available online. This relaxation enforces the safety constraints to hold over the least restrictive prediction region from the set of all available prediction regions. In a comparative case study with the state of the art, we empirically show that our approach results in tighter prediction regions and verify recursive feasibility of our MPC scheme.</description>

      <title>Observational Scaling Laws and the Predictability of Language Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how language model performance varies with scale is critical to benchmark and algorithm development. Scaling laws are one approach to building this understanding, but the requirement of training models across many different scales has limited their use. We propose an alternative, observational approach that bypasses model training and instead builds scaling laws from ~80 publically available models. Building a single scaling law from multiple model families is challenging due to large variations in their training compute efficiencies and capabilities. However, we show that these variations are consistent with a simple, generalized scaling law where language model performance is a function of a low-dimensional capability space, and model families only vary in their efficiency in converting training compute to capabilities. Using this approach, we show the surprising predictability of complex scaling phenomena: we show that several emergent phenomena follow a smooth, sigmoidal behavior and are predictable from small models; we show that the agent performance of models such as GPT-4 can be precisely predicted from simpler non-agentic benchmarks; and we show how to predict the impact of post-training interventions like Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency as language model capabilities continue to improve.</description>

      <title>How Spurious Features Are Memorized: Precise Analysis for Random and NTK Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning models are known to overfit and memorize spurious features in the training dataset. While numerous empirical studies have aimed at understanding this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical framework to quantify it is still missing. In this paper, we consider spurious features that are uncorrelated with the learning task, and we provide a precise characterization of how they are memorized via two separate terms: (i) the stability of the model with respect to individual training samples, and (ii) the feature alignment between the spurious feature and the full sample. While the first term is well established in learning theory and it is connected to the generalization error in classical work, the second one is, to the best of our knowledge, novel. Our key technical result gives a precise characterization of the feature alignment for the two prototypical settings of random features (RF) and neural tangent kernel (NTK) regression. We prove that the memorization of spurious features weakens as the generalization capability increases and, through the analysis of the feature alignment, we unveil the role of the model and of its activation function. Numerical experiments show the predictive power of our theory on standard datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10).</description>

      <title>Convergence of flow-based generative models via proximal gradient descent in Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow-based generative models enjoy certain advantages in computing the data generation and the likelihood, and have recently shown competitive empirical performance. Compared to the accumulating theoretical studies on related score-based diffusion models, analysis of flow-based models, which are deterministic in both forward (data-to-noise) and reverse (noise-to-data) directions, remain sparse. In this paper, we provide a theoretical guarantee of generating data distribution by a progressive flow model, the so-called JKO flow model, which implements the Jordan-Kinderleherer-Otto (JKO) scheme in a normalizing flow network. Leveraging the exponential convergence of the proximal gradient descent (GD) in Wasserstein space, we prove the Kullback-Leibler (KL) guarantee of data generation by a JKO flow model to be $O(\varepsilon^2)$ when using $N \lesssim \log (1/\varepsilon)$ many JKO steps ($N$ Residual Blocks in the flow) where $\varepsilon $ is the error in the per-step first-order condition. The assumption on data density is merely a finite second moment, and the theory extends to data distributions without density and when there are inversion errors in the reverse process where we obtain KL-$W_2$ mixed error guarantees. The non-asymptotic convergence rate of the JKO-type $W_2$-proximal GD is proved for a general class of convex objective functionals that includes the KL divergence as a special case, which can be of independent interest. The analysis framework can extend to other first-order Wasserstein optimization schemes applied to flow-based generative models.</description>

      <title>Unified Binary and Multiclass Margin-Based Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of margin loss has been central to the development and analysis of algorithms for binary classification. To date, however, there remains no consensus as to the analogue of the margin loss for multiclass classification. In this work, we show that a broad range of multiclass loss functions, including many popular ones, can be expressed in the relative margin form, a generalization of the margin form of binary losses. The relative margin form is broadly useful for understanding and analyzing multiclass losses as shown by our prior work (Wang and Scott, 2020, 2021). To further demonstrate the utility of this way of expressing multiclass losses, we use it to extend the seminal result of Bartlett et al. (2006) on classification-calibration of binary margin losses to multiclass. We then analyze the class of Fenchel-Young losses, and expand the set of these losses that are known to be classification-calibrated.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding the Word Sensitivity of Attention Layers: A Study via Random Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the reasons behind the exceptional success of transformers requires a better analysis of why attention layers are suitable for NLP tasks. In particular, such tasks require predictive models to capture contextual meaning which often depends on one or few words, even if the sentence is long. Our work studies this key property, dubbed word sensitivity (WS), in the prototypical setting of random features. We show that attention layers enjoy high WS, namely, there exists a vector in the space of embeddings that largely perturbs the random attention features map. The argument critically exploits the role of the softmax in the attention layer, highlighting its benefit compared to other activations (e.g., ReLU). In contrast, the WS of standard random features is of order $1/\sqrt{n}$, $n$ being the number of words in the textual sample, and thus it decays with the length of the context. We then translate these results on the word sensitivity into generalization bounds: due to their low WS, random features provably cannot learn to distinguish between two sentences that differ only in a single word; in contrast, due to their high WS, random attention features have higher generalization capabilities. We validate our theoretical results with experimental evidence over the BERT-Base word embeddings of the imdb review dataset.</description>

      <title>Thompson Sampling for Infinite-Horizon Discounted Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model a Markov decision process, parametrized by an unknown parameter, and study the asymptotic behavior of a sampling-based algorithm, called Thompson sampling. The standard definition of regret is not always suitable to evaluate a policy, especially when the underlying chain structure is general. We show that the standard (expected) regret can grow (super-)linearly and fails to capture the notion of learning in realistic settings with non-trivial state evolution. By decomposing the standard (expected) regret, we develop a new metric, called the expected residual regret, which forgets the immutable consequences of past actions. Instead, it measures regret against the optimal reward moving forward from the current period. We show that the expected residual regret of the Thompson sampling algorithm is upper bounded by a term which converges exponentially fast to 0. We present conditions under which the posterior sampling error of Thompson sampling converges to 0 almost surely. We then introduce the probabilistic version of the expected residual regret and present conditions under which it converges to 0 almost surely. Thus, we provide a viable concept of learning for sampling algorithms which will serve useful in broader settings than had been considered previously.</description>

      <title>Leave-one-out least squares Monte Carlo algorithm for pricing Bermudan options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02071</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.02071v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The least squares Monte Carlo (LSM) algorithm proposed by Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) is widely used for pricing Bermudan options. The LSM estimator contains undesirable look-ahead bias, and the conventional technique of avoiding it requires additional simulation paths. We present the leave-one-out LSM (LOOLSM) algorithm to eliminate look-ahead bias without doubling simulations. We also show that look-ahead bias is asymptotically proportional to the regressors-to-paths ratio. Our findings are demonstrated with several option examples in which the LSM algorithm overvalues the options. The LOOLSM method can be extended to other regression-based algorithms that improve the LSM method.</description>

      <title>Uniform Pessimistic Risk and its Optimal Portfolio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal allocation of assets has been widely discussed with the theoretical analysis of risk measures, and pessimism is one of the most attractive approaches beyond the conventional optimal portfolio model. The $\alpha$-risk plays a crucial role in deriving a broad class of pessimistic optimal portfolios. However, estimating an optimal portfolio assessed by a pessimistic risk is still challenging due to the absence of a computationally tractable model. In this study, we propose an integral of $\alpha$-risk called the \textit{uniform pessimistic risk} and the computational algorithm to obtain an optimal portfolio based on the risk. Further, we investigate the theoretical properties of the proposed risk in view of three different approaches: multiple quantile regression, the proper scoring rule, and distributionally robust optimization. Real data analysis of three stock datasets (S\&amp;P500, CSI500, KOSPI200) demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed risk and portfolio model.</description>

      <title>Geometric-Based Pruning Rules For Change Point Detection in Multiple Independent Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of detecting multiple changes in multiple independent time series. The search for the best segmentation can be expressed as a minimization problem over a given cost function. We focus on dynamic programming algorithms that solve this problem exactly. When the number of changes is proportional to data length, an inequality-based pruning rule encoded in the PELT algorithm leads to a linear time complexity. Another type of pruning, called functional pruning, gives a close-to-linear time complexity whatever the number of changes, but only for the analysis of univariate time series.
  We propose a few extensions of functional pruning for multiple independent time series based on the use of simple geometric shapes (balls and hyperrectangles). We focus on the Gaussian case, but some of our rules can be easily extended to the exponential family. In a simulation study we compare the computational efficiency of different geometric-based pruning rules. We show that for small dimensions (2, 3, 4) some of them ran significantly faster than inequality-based approaches in particular when the underlying number of changes is small compared to the data length.</description>

      <title>On Computational Modeling of Sleep-Wake Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Why do mammals need to sleep? Neuroscience treats sleep and wake as default and perturbation modes of the brain. It is hypothesized that the brain self-organizes neural activities without environmental inputs. This paper presents a new computational model of the sleep-wake cycle (SWC) for learning and memory. During the sleep mode, the memory consolidation by the thalamocortical system is abstracted by a disentangling operator that maps context-dependent representations (CDR) to context-independent representations (CIR) for generalization. Such a disentangling operator can be mathematically formalized by an integral transform that integrates the context variable from CDR. During the wake mode, the memory formation by the hippocampal-neocortical system is abstracted by an entangling operator from CIR to CDR where the context is introduced by physical motion. When designed as inductive bias, entangled CDR linearizes the problem of unsupervised learning for sensory memory by direct-fit. The concatenation of disentangling and entangling operators forms a disentangling-entangling cycle (DEC) as the building block for sensorimotor learning. We also discuss the relationship of DEC and SWC to the perception-action cycle (PAC) for internal model learning and perceptual control theory for the ecological origin of natural languages.</description>
