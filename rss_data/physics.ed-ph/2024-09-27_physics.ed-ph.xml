      <title>Exploring the mechanisms of qubit representations and introducing a new category system for visual representations: Results from expert ratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum physics (QP) education, the use of representations such as diagrams and visual aids that connect to mathematical concepts is crucial. Research in representation theory indicates that combining symbolic-mathematical elements (e.g. formulae) with visual-graphical representations enhances conceptual understanding more effectively than representations that merely depict phenomena. However, common representations vary widely, and existing categorisation systems do not adequately distinguish between them in QP. To address this, we developed a new set of differentiation criteria based on insights from representation research, QP education, and specific aspects of the quantum sciences. We created a comprehensive category system for evaluating visual QP representations for educational use, grounded in Ainsworths (2006) DeFT Framework. Twenty-one experts from four countries evaluated this category system using four qubit representations: the Bloch sphere, Circle Notation, Quantum Bead, and the pie chart (Qake) model. This evaluation enabled us to assess the discriminative power of our criteria and the effectiveness of each representation in supporting the learning of QP concepts. It evaluated how well each representation conveyed quantum concepts such as quantum state, measurement, superposition, entanglement, and quantum technologies (X-, Z-, and H-gates) across 16 criteria. The results showed significant differences in the effectiveness of these representations, particularly in conveying key concepts like superposition and measurement. Additionally, expert ratings indicated notable variations in the potential of each representation to induce misconceptions, linked to differences in shape, measurement behaviour, and requirements for understanding entanglement. We also discuss considerations for developing new representations and suggest directions for future empirical studies.</description>

      <title>Efficacy of a hybrid take home and in class summative assessment for the postsecondary physics classroom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assigning course grades to students requires obtaining accurate measures of the students' understanding and knowledge of the topic. The induced stress from a traditional summative assessment is known to negatively impact student grades, confounding the connection between knowledge and test grades. Documented approaches to reduce stress during examinations can lead to a distracting testing environment (two-stage tests) or are subject to cheating (take-home tests). We have developed a hybrid take-home/in-class exam that avoids such difficulties. We present herein the responses from student surveys conducted after each exam. The results of the surveys indicate that the hybrid exam method reduces test anxiety while improving students' self-reported mastery of physics, as compared to traditional in-class summative assessments. These findings are significant at the p &lt; 0.05 level. Lastly, we discuss the difficulties encountered in applying this test approach.</description>

      <title>How Do Observational Astronomers Learn to Inspect Imaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomy is entering an unprecedented era of data collection. Upcoming large surveys will gather more data than ever before, generated at rates requiring real-time decision making. Looking ahead, it is inevitable that astronomers will need to rely more heavily on automated processes. Indeed, some instances have already arisen wherein the majority of the inspection process is automated. Visual discovery, performed traditionally by humans, is one key area where automation is now being integrated rapidly. Visual discovery comprises two aspects: (1) visual inspection, the skill associated with examining an image to identify areas or objects of interest; and (2) visual interpretation, the knowledge associated with the classification of the objects or features. Both skills and knowledge are vital for humans to perform visual discovery, however, there appears to have been limited investigation into how the skill of visual inspection in astronomy is acquired. We report on a survey of 70 professional observational astronomers, at various career stages and from different geographical regions. We found that between 63% and 73% of the astronomers surveyed had received formal and$/$or informal training in visual inspection of images, although formal training (21%) was less common than informal training (60%). Surprisingly, out of the 37% who did not recall having received training in visual inspection, 29% (20 astronomers) indicated that they provided training to others. This suggests the emergence of `expertise without precedent' where a first expert in the field provides a new way of achieving a task. These results, paired with a set of three pilot interviews, present a touchstone against which the training of future observational astronomers can be compared.</description>
