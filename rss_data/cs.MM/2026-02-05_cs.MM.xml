      <title>Sounding Highlights: Dual-Pathway Audio Encoders for Audio-Visual Video Highlight Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual video highlight detection aims to automatically identify the most salient moments in videos by leveraging both visual and auditory cues. However, existing models often underutilize the audio modality, focusing on high-level semantic features while failing to fully leverage the rich, dynamic characteristics of sound. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, Dual-Pathway Audio Encoders for Video Highlight Detection (DAViHD). The dual-pathway audio encoder is composed of a semantic pathway for content understanding and a dynamic pathway that captures spectro-temporal dynamics. The semantic pathway extracts high-level information by identifying the content within the audio, such as speech, music, or specific sound events. The dynamic pathway employs a frequency-adaptive mechanism as time evolves to jointly model these dynamics, enabling it to identify transient acoustic events via salient spectral bands and rapid energy changes. We integrate the novel audio encoder into a full audio-visual framework and achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Mr.HiSum benchmark. Our results demonstrate that a sophisticated, dual-faceted audio representation is key to advancing the field of highlight detection.</description>

      <title>Audit After Segmentation: Reference-Free Mask Quality Assessment for Language-Referred Audio-Visual Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language-referred audio-visual segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects described by natural language by jointly reasoning over video, audio, and text. Beyond generating segmentation masks, providing rich and interpretable diagnoses of mask quality remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Mask Quality Assessment in the Ref-AVS context (MQA-RefAVS), a new task that evaluates the quality of candidate segmentation masks without relying on ground-truth annotations as references at inference time. Given audio-visual-language inputs and each provided segmentation mask, the task requires estimating its IoU with the unobserved ground truth, identifying the corresponding error type, and recommending an actionable quality-control decision. To support this task, we construct MQ-RAVSBench, a benchmark featuring diverse and representative mask error modes that span both geometric and semantic issues. We further propose MQ-Auditor, a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based auditor that explicitly reasons over multimodal cues and mask information to produce quantitative and qualitative mask quality assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MQ-Auditor outperforms strong open-source and commercial MLLMs and can be integrated with existing Ref-AVS systems to detect segmentation failures and support downstream segmentation improvement. Data and codes will be released at https://github.com/jasongief/MQA-RefAVS.</description>

      <title>MS-SCANet: A Multiscale Transformer-Based Architecture with Dual Attention for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Multi-Scale Spatial Channel Attention Network (MS-SCANet), a transformer-based architecture designed for no-reference image quality assessment (IQA). MS-SCANet features a dual-branch structure that processes images at multiple scales, effectively capturing both fine and coarse details, an improvement over traditional single-scale methods. By integrating tailored spatial and channel attention mechanisms, our model emphasizes essential features while minimizing computational complexity. A key component of MS-SCANet is its cross-branch attention mechanism, which enhances the integration of features across different scales, addressing limitations in previous approaches. We also introduce two new consistency loss functions, Cross-Branch Consistency Loss and Adaptive Pooling Consistency Loss, which maintain spatial integrity during feature scaling, outperforming conventional linear and bilinear techniques. Extensive evaluations on datasets like KonIQ-10k, LIVE, LIVE Challenge, and CSIQ show that MS-SCANet consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, offering a robust framework with stronger correlations with subjective human scores.</description>

      <title>Training Data Efficiency in Multimodal Process Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Process Reward Models (MPRMs) are central to step-level supervision for visual reasoning in MLLMs. Training MPRMs typically requires large-scale Monte Carlo (MC)-annotated corpora, incurring substantial training cost. This paper studies the data efficiency for MPRM training.Our preliminary experiments reveal that MPRM training quickly saturates under random subsampling of the training data, indicating substantial redundancy within existing MC-annotated corpora.To explain this, we formalize a theoretical framework and reveal that informative gradient updates depend on two factors: label mixtures of positive/negative steps and label reliability (average MC scores of positive steps). Guided by these insights, we propose the Balanced-Information Score (BIS), which prioritizes both mixture and reliability based on existing MC signals at the rollout level, without incurring any additional cost. Across two backbones (InternVL2.5-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B) on VisualProcessBench, BIS-selected subsets consistently match and even surpass the full-data performance at small fractions. Notably, the BIS subset reaches full-data performance using only 10% of the training data, improving over random subsampling by a relative 4.1%.</description>

      <title>Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion Mamba for Multi-Modal Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Modal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to combine images from different modalities to produce fused images, retaining texture details and preserving significant information. Recently, some MMIF methods incorporate frequency domain information to enhance spatial features. However, these methods typically rely on simple serial or parallel spatial-frequency fusion without interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion Mamba (ISFM) framework for MMIF. Specifically, we begin with a Modality-Specific Extractor (MSE) to extract features from different modalities. It models long-range dependencies across the image with linear computational complexity. To effectively leverage frequency information, we then propose a Multi-scale Frequency Fusion (MFF). It adaptively integrates low-frequency and high-frequency components across multiple scales, enabling robust representations of frequency features. More importantly, we further propose an Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion (ISF). It incorporates frequency features to guide spatial features across modalities, enhancing complementary representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on six MMIF datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our ISFM can achieve better performances than other state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/Namn23/ISFM.</description>

      <title>History-Guided Iterative Visual Reasoning with Self-Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-consistency methods are the core technique for improving the reasoning reliability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By generating multiple reasoning results through repeated sampling and selecting the best answer via voting, they play an important role in cross-modal tasks. However, most existing self-consistency methods are limited to a fixed ``repeated sampling and voting'' paradigm and do not reuse historical reasoning information. As a result, models struggle to actively correct visual understanding errors and dynamically adjust their reasoning during iteration. Inspired by the human reasoning behavior of repeated verification and dynamic error correction, we propose the H-GIVR framework. During iterative reasoning, the MLLM observes the image multiple times and uses previously generated answers as references for subsequent steps, enabling dynamic correction of errors and improving answer accuracy. We conduct comprehensive experiments on five datasets and three models. The results show that the H-GIVR framework can significantly improve cross-modal reasoning accuracy while maintaining low computational cost. For instance, using \texttt{Llama3.2-vision:11b} on the ScienceQA dataset, the model requires an average of 2.57 responses per question to achieve an accuracy of 78.90\%, representing a 107\% improvement over the baseline.</description>

      <title>Audio ControlNet for Fine-Grained Audio Generation and Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fine-grained text-to-audio (T2A) generation task. While recent models can synthesize high-quality audio from text descriptions, they often lack precise control over attributes such as loudness, pitch, and sound events. Unlike prior approaches that retrain models for specific control types, we propose to train ControlNet models on top of pre-trained T2A backbones to achieve controllable generation over loudness, pitch, and event roll. We introduce two designs, T2A-ControlNet and T2A-Adapter, and show that the T2A-Adapter model offers a more efficient structure with strong control ability. With only 38M additional parameters, T2A-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AudioSet-Strong in both event-level and segment-level F1 scores. We further extend this framework to audio editing, proposing T2A-Editor for removing and inserting audio events at time locations specified by instructions. Models, code, dataset pipelines, and benchmarks will be released to support future research on controllable audio generation and editing.</description>

      <title>Integrating Fine-Grained Audio-Visual Evidence for Robust Multimodal Emotion Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal emotion analysis is shifting from static classification to generative reasoning. Beyond simple label prediction, robust affective reasoning must synthesize fine-grained signals such as facial micro-expressions and prosodic which shifts to decode the latent causality within complex social contexts. However, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face significant limitations in fine-grained perception, primarily due to data scarcity and insufficient cross-modal fusion. As a result, these models often exhibit unimodal dominance which leads to hallucinations in complex multimodal interactions, particularly when visual and acoustic cues are subtle, ambiguous, or even contradictory (e.g., in sarcastic scenery). To address this, we introduce SABER-LLM, a framework designed for robust multimodal reasoning. First, we construct SABER, a large-scale emotion reasoning dataset comprising 600K video clips, annotated with a novel six-dimensional schema that jointly captures audiovisual cues and causal logic. Second, we propose the structured evidence decomposition paradigm, which enforces a "perceive-then-reason" separation between evidence extraction and reasoning to alleviate unimodal dominance. The ability to perceive complex scenes is further reinforced by consistency-aware direct preference optimization, which explicitly encourages alignment among modalities under ambiguous or conflicting perceptual conditions. Experiments on EMER, EmoBench-M, and SABER-Test demonstrate that SABER-LLM significantly outperforms open-source baselines and achieves robustness competitive with closed-source models in decoding complex emotional dynamics. The dataset and model are available at https://github.com/zxzhao0/SABER-LLM.</description>

      <title>SAVGBench: Benchmarking Spatially Aligned Audio-Video Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the lack of multimodal generative models capable of producing high-quality videos with spatially aligned audio. While recent advancements in generative models have been successful in video generation, they often overlook the spatial alignment between audio and visuals, which is essential for immersive experiences. To tackle this problem, we establish a new research direction in benchmarking the Spatially Aligned Audio-Video Generation (SAVG) task. We introduce a spatially aligned audio-visual dataset, whose audio and video data are curated based on whether sound events are onscreen or not. We also propose a new alignment metric that aims to evaluate the spatial alignment between audio and video. Then, using the dataset and metric, we benchmark two types of baseline methods: one is based on a joint audio-video generation model, and the other is a two-stage method that combines a video generation model and a video-to-audio generation model. Our experimental results demonstrate that gaps exist between the baseline methods and the ground truth in terms of video and audio quality, as well as spatial alignment between the two modalities.</description>

      <title>Noise-Conditioned Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Robust Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust speaker verification under noisy conditions remains an open challenge. Conventional deep learning methods learn a robust unified speaker representation space against diverse background noise and achieve significant improvement. In contrast, this paper presents a noise-conditioned mixture-ofexperts framework that decomposes the feature space into specialized noise-aware subspaces for speaker verification. Specifically, we propose a noise-conditioned expert routing mechanism, a universal model based expert specialization strategy, and an SNR-decaying curriculum learning protocol, collectively improving model robustness and generalization under diverse noise conditions. The proposed method can automatically route inputs to expert networks based on noise information derived from the inputs, where each expert targets distinct noise characteristics while preserving speaker identity information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate consistent superiority over baselines, confirming that explicit noise-dependent feature modeling significantly enhances robustness without sacrificing verification accuracy.</description>

      <title>VidTune: Creating Video Soundtracks with Generative Music and Contextual Thumbnails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music shapes the tone of videos, yet creators often struggle to find soundtracks that match their video's mood and narrative. Recent text-to-music models let creators generate music from text prompts, but our formative study (N=8) shows creators struggle to construct diverse prompts, quickly review and compare tracks, and understand their impact on the video. We present VidTune, a system that supports soundtrack creation by generating diverse music options from a creator's prompt and producing contextual thumbnails for rapid review. VidTune extracts representative video subjects to ground thumbnails in context, maps each track's valence and energy onto visual cues like color and brightness, and depicts prominent genres and instruments. Creators can refine tracks through natural language edits, which VidTune expands into new generations. In a controlled user study (N=12) and an exploratory case study (N=6), participants found VidTune helpful for efficiently reviewing and comparing music options and described the process as playful and enriching.</description>
