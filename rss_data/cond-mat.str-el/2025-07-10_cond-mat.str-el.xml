      <title>Entanglement switching via mobility edges in a quasiperiodic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose quasiperiodic chains with tunable mobility edge physics, as a promising platform for engineering long-range quantum entanglement. Using the generalized Aubry-Andr\'e model, we show that the mobility edges play a key role in manipulating long-range indirect interactions in these systems. Near the mobility edge, critical states exhibit unexpectedly strong correlations between sites that share similar local structures, regardless of their spatial separation. Remarkably, by tuning the mobility edge across the Fermi level, one can induce both adiabatic transport and abrupt switching of entanglement between distant sites. These results highlight the potential of aperiodic structures for controlling nonlocal quantum correlations, opening new avenues for entanglement-based applications in quasiperiodic systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbital magnetism in moir\'e Wigner molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of spin and orbital degrees of freedom offers a versatile playground for the realization of a variety of correlated phases of matter. However, the types of spin-orbital interactions are often limited and challenging to tune. Here, we propose and analyze a new platform for spin-orbital interactions based upon a lattice of Wigner molecules in moire transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Leveraging the spin-orbital degeneracy of the low-energy Hilbert space of each Wigner molecule, we demonstrate that TMD materials can host a general spin-orbital Hamiltonian that is tunable via the moir\'e superlattice spacing and dielectric environments. We study the phase diagram for this model, revealing a rich landscape of phases driven by spin-orbital interactions, ranging from ferri-electric valence bond solids to a helical spin liquid. Our work establishes moir\'e Wigner molecules in TMD materials as a prominent platform for correlated spin-orbital phenomena</description>

      <title>Strange metal and Fermi arcs from disordering spin stripes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the effective theory for fluctuating spin stripes coupled to a Fermi surface, and consider the parameter regime where a spin nematic phase intervenes between the spin density wave state and the symmetric state. It is shown that adding potential disorder to this theory, which acts as an unconventional type of random-field disorder, naturally gives rise to the universal theory of strange metals with spatial disorder in both the magnitude and sign of the electron-boson coupling term [A.A. Patel, H. Guo, I. Esterlis and S. Sachdev, Science 381, 790 (2023)]. One difference compared to the original theory, however, is that at non-zero temperatures the disordered spin-stripe model automatically self-averages over the sign of the coupling. We also study the effects of thermal fluctuations in a phenomenological model for the disordered spin density wave state, and find from Monte Carlo simulations that a short anti-ferromagnetic correlation length (order 4-5 lattice constants) already leads to pronounced Fermi arcs in the electronic spectral weight.</description>

      <title>Observation of Macroscopic Nonlocal Voltage and Hydrodynamic Electron Flow at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imagine three resistors connected in series. Normally when a battery is connected across the center resistor, the side resistors remain silent with no current flow and no voltage across. Nonlocal voltage is the exceptional potential difference observed at the side resistors. Here, we report sub-V level nonlocal voltages at room temperature, from mm-scale devices comprised of nominal Bi2Se3 on YBa2Cu3O7. They also display extremely nonlinear current-voltage characteristics, potential peaks at current contacts, and negative resistances, suggesting the macroscopic electron hydrodynamics as the origin of nonlocal voltages. Similar observations in Bi2Te3 on YBa2Cu3O7 suggest an unprecedented quantum phase in chemically-modified topological insulators. Vanishing differential resistance may find applications in energy saving transport.</description>

      <title>Robustness of the flux-free sector of the Kitaev honeycomb against environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kitaev honeycomb model (KHM) consists of spin-$1/2$ particles on a honeycomb lattice with direction-dependent Ising-like interactions. It can alternatively be described in terms of non-interacting Majorana fermions, can be solved exactly, and has a quantum spin-liquid ground state. Open boundaries then host Majorana zero modes (MZMs) that are robust against some types of disorder. We analyze the fate of the MZMs when they couple to an environment via a Lindblad master equation. By computing the time evolution of the density matrix, we find that when decoherence occurs, the steady state is mostly the maximally mixed state. Among the few exceptions is a parameter regime that realizes the superconducting Kitaev chain model with periodic boundary conditions. We consistently observe a quantum Zeno effect in the density matrix as well as in the entropy and fidelity, while it is not found in the energy gap of some gapped spin liquids. We thus present a comprehensive overview over MZMs coupled to a spin bath that is relevant to proposals to detect MZMs of Kitaev layers on surfaces using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).</description>

      <title>On the T-linear resistivity of cuprates: theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By partitioning the electronic system of the optimally doped cuprates in two electronic components: (1) mobile electrons on oxygen sub-lattice; and (2) localized spins on copper sub-lattice, and considering the scattering of mobile electrons (on oxygen sub-lattice) via generation of paramagnons in the localized sub-system (copper spins), we ask what should be the electron-paramagnon coupling matrix element $M_q$ so that T-linear resistivity results. This 'reverse engineering approach' leads to $|M_q|^2 \sim \frac{1}{q^2+\xi(T)^{-2}}$. We comment how can such exotic coupling emerge in 2D systems where short range magnetic fluctuations resides. In other words, the role of quantum criticality is found to be crucial. And the T-linear behaviour of resistivity demands that the magnetic correlation length scales as $\xi(T)\propto\frac{1}{T}$, which seems to be a reasonable assumption in the quantum critical regime of cuprates (that is, near optimal doping where T-linear resistivity is observed).</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the Simplest Deconfined Quantum Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $N=3$ case of the $CP^{N-1}$ model, which is a field theory of $N$ complex scalars in $3d$ coupled to an Abelian gauge field with $SU(N) \times U(1)$ global symmetry. Recent evidence suggests the $N=2$ theory is not critical, which makes the $N=3$ theory the simplest possibility of deconfined quantum criticality. We apply the conformal bootstrap to correlators of charge $q=0,1,2$ scalar operators under the $U(1)$ symmetry, which gives us access also to $q=3,4$ operators. After imposing that only the lowest $q=0,1,2$ scalar operators are relevant, we find that the bootstrap bounds are saturated by the large $N$ prediction for $q=1,2,3,4$ scalar monopole operator scaling dimensions, which were shown earlier to be accurate even for small $N$, as well as a lattice prediction for the $q=0$ non-monopole scalar operator. We also predict the scaling dimensions of the lowest spinning monopole operators, which we match to the large charge prediction for spinning operators. This suggests that the critical $CP^{2}$ model is described by this bootstrap bound.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and review a new complexity measure, called `Krylov complexity', which takes its origins in the field of quantum-chaotic dynamics, serving as a canonical measure of operator growth and spreading. Krylov complexity, underpinned by the Lanczos algorithm, has since evolved into a highly diverse field of its own right, both because of its attractive features as a complexity, whose definition does not depend on arbitrary control parameters, and whose phenomenology serves as a rich and sensitive probe of chaotic dynamics up to exponentially late times, but also because of its relevance to seemingly far-afield subjects such as holographic dualities and the quantum physics of black holes. In this review we give a unified perspective on these topics, emphasizing the robust and most general features of K-complexity, both in chaotic and integrable systems, state and prove theorems on its generic features and describe how it is geometrised in the context of (dual) gravitational dynamics. We hope that this review will serve both as a source of intuition about K-complexity in and of itself, as well as a resource for researchers trying to gain an overview over what is by now a rather large and multi-faceted literature. We also mention and discuss a number of open problems related to K-complexity, underlining its currently very active status as a field of research.</description>

      <title>Mutual Influence of Symmetries and Topological Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the fusion 2-category symmetry of a fermionic (2+1)d QFT can be affected when one allows for stacking with TQFTs to be an equivalence relation for QFTs. Focusing on a simple kind of fermionic fusion 2-category described purely by group theoretical data, our results reveal that by allowing for stacking with $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_1$ as an equivalence relation enables a finite set of inequivalent modifications to the original fusion 2-categorical-symmetry. To put our results in a broader context, we relate the order of the symmetry modifications to the image of a map between groups of minimal nondegenerate extensions, and to the tangential structure set by the initial categorical symmetry on the background manifold for the QFT.</description>

      <title>Terahertz field-induced metastable magnetization near criticality in FePS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the functional properties of quantum materials with light has emerged as a frontier of condensed-matter physics, leading to the discovery of various light-induced phases of matter, such as superconductivity, ferroelectricity, magnetism and charge density waves. However, in most cases, the photoinduced phases return to equilibrium on ultrafast timescales after the light is turned off, limiting their practical applications. Here we use intense terahertz pulses to induce a metastable magnetization with a remarkably long lifetime of more than 2.5 milliseconds in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS3. The metastable state becomes increasingly robust as the temperature approaches the antiferromagnetic transition point, suggesting that critical order parameter fluctuations play an important part in facilitating the extended lifetime. By combining first-principles calculations with classical Monte Carlo and spin dynamics simulations, we find that the displacement of a specific phonon mode modulates the exchange couplings in a manner that favours a ground state with finite magnetization near the N\'eel temperature. This analysis also clarifies how the critical fluctuations of the dominant antiferromagnetic order can amplify both the magnitude and the lifetime of the new magnetic state. Our discovery demonstrates the efficient manipulation of the magnetic ground state in layered magnets through non-thermal pathways using terahertz light and establishes regions near critical points with enhanced order parameter fluctuations as promising areas to search for metastable hidden quantum states.</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconductivity via layer differentiation in trilayer Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the highest superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in multilayer cuprates,we investigated the trilayer Hubbard model by adopting the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Focusing on the systems with higher hole dopings within the two outer layers (OL) than the inner layer (IL), which is believed to be relevant to the realistic multilayer cuprates, our exploration discovered that the IL and OL manifest strong differentiation in a wide range of hole doping combinations. Specifically, the OLs remain metallic while the IL shows a distinct transition from the pseudogap to superconducting state. More importantly, the highest $T_c$ of the composite trilayer system can be largely enhanced compared to the single layer model and the imbalanced hole dopings between IL and OL is beneficial to the global SC. We further provide strong numerical evidence on the picture that the IL itself can drive the $d$-wave superconductivity while the OLs only serve as the charge reservoir. Our investigation provides new insight into the origin of highest $T_c$ in multilayer cuprates.</description>

      <title>Fractionalized Prethermalization in the One-Dimensional Hubbard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prethermalization phenomena in driven systems are generally understood via a local Floquet Hamiltonian obtained from a high-frequency expansion. Remarkably, recently it has been shown that a driven Kitaev spin liquid with fractionalized excitations can realize a quasi-stationary state that is not captured by this paradigm. Instead distinct types of fractionalized excitations are characterized by vastly different temperatures-a phenomenon dubbed "fractionalized prethermalization". In our work, we analyze fractionalized prethermalization in a driven one-dimensional Hubbard model at strong coupling which hosts spin-charge fractionalization. At intermediate frequencies quasi-steady states emerge which are characterized by a low spin and high charge temperature with lifetimes set by two competing processes: the lifetime of the quasiparticles determined by Fermi's Golden rule and the exponential lifetime of the Floquet prethermal plateau. We classify drives into three categories, each giving rise to distinct (fractional) prethermalization dynamics. Resorting to a time-dependent variant of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we systematically analyze how these drive categories are linked to the underlying driven Hubbard model, thereby providing a general understanding of the emergent thermalization dynamics. We discuss routes towards an experimental realization of this phenomenon in quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Detection of 2D SPT Order with Partial Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method of using partial symmetries to distinguish two dimensional symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of on-site, unitary symmetries is proposed. This novel order parameter takes a wavefunction, such as a ground state of a lattice model, and detects its SPT invariants as expectation values of finitely supported operators, without the need for flux insertion. The construction exploits the rotational symmetry of the lattice to extract on-site SPT invariants, building upon prior work on probing crystalline SPT phases with partial rotations. The method is demonstrated by computing the order parameter analytically on group cohomology models and numerically on a family of states interpolating between the CZX state and a trivial state. Its robustness is suggested by interpreting partial symmetries as generating the topological partition functions of lens spaces.</description>

      <title>Is Herbertsmithite far from an ideal antiferromagnet? Ab-initio answer including in-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and coupling with extra-plane impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Herbertsmithite is known as the archetype of a S=1/2 first-neighbor Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagom\'e lattice, theoretically presumed to be a quantum gapless spin liquid. However, more and more experiments reveal that the model suffers from deviations from the ideal one, evidenced at very low temperatures. This detailed ab initio study focuses on two such deviations that have never been quantitatively calculated: the anisotropic exchange interactions and the Heisenberg exchange with extra-plane magnetic impurities. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is found to have an in-plane component almost three times larger than the out-of-plane component, but typically obviated in theoretical studies. Moreover, it is shown that the extra-plane magnetic impurities have a strong ferromagnetic interaction (minus half the main exchange $J_1$ ) with the kagom\'e magnetic sites. Combined with an estimated occurrence of these magnetic impurities of $\sim15\%$, the present results indicate that two-dimensional magnetic models only describe part of the physics.</description>

Abstract: The dc conductivity tensor of two-dimensional one-band metals with weak pointlike disorder and magnetic field is studied in the self-consistent Born approximation, with special emphasis on the regime of low carrier density. In this theory, the Kubo conductivity is a functional of the electron dispersion and local (momentum-independent) electron self-energy, which is itself a causal functional of the dispersion and disorder strength. We obtain exact closed expressions for the asymptotic low-density conductivities at zero temperature in the form of power laws of the density and disorder strength with universal exponents. The crossover to the semiclassical regime of high density is studied numerically, as well as the temperature dependence. Our model and results may be relevant to interpret linear magneto-transport experiments performed in the metallic regime of gated two-dimensional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Switching of an antiferromagnet controlled by spin canting in a laser-induced hidden phase</title>

Abstract: During laser-induced phase transitions, fast transformations of electronic, atomic, and spin configurations often involve emergence of hidden and metastable phases. Being inaccessible under any other stimuli, such phases are indispensable for unveiling mechanisms and controlling the transitions. We experimentally explore spin kinetics during ultrafast first-order 90$^{\circ}$ spin-reorientation (SR) transition in a canted antiferromagnet Fe$_3$BO$_6$, and reveal that the transition is controlled by the canting between the magnetic sublattices. Laser-induced perturbation of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction results in a change of the intersublattice canting within first picoseconds, bringing Fe$_3$BO$_6$ to a hidden phase. Once this phase emerges, laser-induced heating activates precessional 90$^\circ$ spin switching. Combination of the spin canting and heating controls the final spin configuration comprising coexisting initial and switched phases. Extended phase coexistence range is in a striking contrast to the narrow SR transition in Fe$_3$BO$_6$ induced by conventional heating.</description>

      <title>Emergent magnetism and spin liquids in an extended Hubbard description of moir\'e bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we study an extended Hubbard model with both on-site and off-site repulsive interactions, in which Mott insulating states with concomitant charge order occur at fractional fillings. To resolve the charge ordering as well as the fate of the local moments formed thereby, we perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on cylindrical geometries for several filling fractions and ranges of interaction strength. Depending on the precise parameter regime, both antiferromagnetically ordered as well as quantum-disordered states are found, with a particularly prominent example being a quantum spin liquid-type ground state on top of charge-ordering with effective Kagom\'e geometry. We discuss the different mechanisms at play in stabilizing various electronic and magnetic states. The results suggest that moir\'e TMDs are a promising venue for emergent quantum magnetism of strongly interacting electrons.</description>

      <title>Spin-charge bound states and emerging fermions in a quantum spin liquid</title>

Abstract: The complex interplay between charge and spin dynamics lies at the heart of strongly correlated quantum materials, and it is a fundamental topic in basic research with far reaching technological perspectives. We explore in this paper the dynamics of holes in a single band extended $t-J$ model where the background spins form a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid (QSL). Using a field theory approach based on a parton construction, we show that while the electrons for most momenta fractionalize into uncorrelated charge carrying holons and spin carrying spinons as generally expected for a QSL, the spinon-holon scattering cross-section diverges for certain momenta signalling strong correlations. By deriving an effective low-energy Hamiltonian describing this dynamics, we demonstrate that these divergencies are due to the formation of long lived spinon-holon bound states. We then show that quantum gas microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides an excellent platform for verifying and probing the internal spatial structure of these emergent fermions. The fermions will furthermore show up as clear quasiparticle peaks in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with an intensity determined by their internal structure. For a non-zero hole concentration, the fermions form hole pockets with qualitatively the same location, shape, and intensity variation in the Brillouin zone as the so-called Fermi arcs observed in the pseudogap phase. Such agreement is remarkable since the Fermi arcs arise from the delicate interplay between the symmetry of the QSL and the internal structure of the emerging fermions in a minimal single band model with no extra degrees of freedom added. Our results, therefore, provide a microscopic mechanism for the conjectured fractionalized Fermi liquid and open up new pathways for exploring the pseudogap phase and high temperature superconductivity as arising from a QSL.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal magnon transport properties in the easy-axis XXZ Heisenberg ferromagnet on the face-centered cubic lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of longitudinal magneto-thermal transport in the $S=1/2$ ferromagnetic XXZ model with easy-axis exchange anisotropy ($\Delta&gt;1$) on a face-centered cubic lattice consisting of four sublattices. We employ linear spin-wave theory and the Kubo formalism to evaluate the longitudinal spin and thermal conductivities, both of which exhibit activated temperature dependence in the low-temperature regime, and to determine their magnetic-field dependence. Our analysis indicates that a magnon gap is crucial for ensuring the convergence of these conductivities. Furthermore, by examining the ratio of thermal conductivity to spin conductivity, we identify an analog of the Wiedemann-Franz law for magnon transport at low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that these results can be generalized to systems with arbitrary spin.</description>

      <title>Mass-Assisted Local Deconfinement in a Confined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confinement is a prominent phenomenon in condensed matter and high-energy physics that has recently become the focus of quantum-simulation experiments of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). As such, a theoretical understanding of the effect of confinement on LGT dynamics is not only of fundamental importance, but can lend itself to upcoming experiments. Here, we show how confinement in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT can be locally avoided by proximity to a resonance between the fermion mass and the electric field strength. Furthermore, we show that this local deconfinement can become global for certain initial conditions, where information transport occurs over the entire chain. In addition, we show how this can lead to strong quantum many-body scarring starting in different initial states. Our findings provide deeper insights into the nature of confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs and can be tested on current and near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Nodeless superconducting gap and electron-boson coupling in (La,Pr,Sm)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) bilayer nickelate films under ambient pressure provides an unprecedented opportunity to directly investigate electronic energy scales of the superconducting state and the pairing mechanism. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements of superconducting (La,Pr,Sm)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films epitaxially grown on SrLaAlO$_4$ substrates by developing an ultra-high vacuum low-temperature quenching and transfer technique. A finite superconducting gap of ~18 meV with pronounced coherence peak is observed along the Brillouin zone diagonal direction. Remarkably, the finite superconducting gap persists across the entire Brillouin zone of the underlying Fermi surfaces, revealing the absence of gap nodes. An abrupt band renormalization, manifested as a kink in the energy-momentum dispersion at ~70 meV below the Fermi level, indicates an electron-boson coupling in the system. The simultaneous observation of a nodeless superconducting gap and electron-boson coupling provides crucial insights into the pairing symmetry and gluing mechanism in high-T$_c$ RP bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Variational Transformer Ansatz for the Density Operator of Steady States in Dissipative Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transformer architecture, known for capturing long-range dependencies and intricate patterns, has extended beyond natural language processing. Recently, it has attracted significant attention in quantum information and condensed matter physics. In this work, we propose the \textit{transformer density operator ansatz} for determining the steady states of dissipative quantum many-body systems. By vectorizing the density operator as a many-body state in a doubled Hilbert space, the transformer encodes the amplitude and phase of the state's coefficients, with its parameters serving as variational variables. Our design preserves translation invariance while leveraging attention mechanisms to capture diverse long-range correlations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by numerically calculating the steady states of dissipative Ising and Heisenberg spin chain models, showing that our method achieves excellent accuracy in predicting mixed steady states.</description>

      <title>Pressure Induced Altermagnetism in Layered Ternary Iron-Selenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing first-principles based calculations, we reexamined the high-pressure phases of the vacancy-ordered iron-selenides, i.e. A2Fe4Se5 phase. A magnetic transition from the block-spin antiferromagnetic phase to Neel-AM phase is observed under high pressure when the iron-vacancy order is preserved. The transition is first-order, driven by the collapse of c-axis and accompanied by an insulator-metal transition. In addition, the Neel-AM phase is a rare example of intrinsic altermagnetism that does not require ligand atoms nor supercell construction to break the spatial inversion or translational symmetry between the two spin sublattices, with a spin-splitting of the band structure as large as 300 meV. If the re-entrant superconducting phase of KyFe2-xSe2 under high pressure emerges from the Neel-AM normal state, an equal-spin triplet pairing would be naturally favored.</description>

      <title>Double Supersolid Phase in a Bosonic t-J-V Model with Rydberg Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Rydberg tweezer arrays bring novel opportunities for programmable quantum simulations beyond previous capabilities. In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Pairing symmetry and superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity with a transition temperature $T_c$ over 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure marks an important step in the field of nickelate superconductors. Here, we perform a renormalized mean-field theory study of the superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ thin films, using a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model. Our result reveals an $s_\pm$-wave pairing symmetry driven by the strong interlayer superexchange coupling of $d_{z^2}$ orbital, resembling the pressurized bulk case. Also, we roughly reproduce the experimentally observed nodeless shape of the superconducting gap at the $\beta$ pocket and the superconducting $T_c$. In addition, by analysing the orbital-resolved pairing configurations and their projections onto Fermi surface, we find that the nodeless feature of $\beta$ pocket is related to the interlayer pairing within both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Moreover, we identify a formation of the inplane inter-orbital $d$-wave pairing between $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, which can even enhance the dominated interlayer $s_\pm$-wave.</description>
