      <title>3D Modelling to Address Pandemic Challenges: A Project-Based Learning Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of 3D modelling in medical education is a revolutionary tool during the learning process. In fact, this type of technology enables a more interactive teaching approach, making information retention more effective and enhancing students' understanding. 3D modelling allows for the creation of precise representations of the human body, as well as interaction with three-dimensional models, giving students a better spatial understanding of the different organs and systems and enabling simulations of surgical and technical procedures. This way, medical education is enriched with a more realistic and safe educational experience. The goal is to understand whether, when students and schools are challenged, they play an important role in addressing health issues in their community. School-led projects are directed towards educational scenarios that emphasize STEM education, tackling relevant public health problems through open-school initiatives. By implementing an educational scenario focused on 3D modelling and leveraging technology, we aim to raise community awareness on public health issues.</description>

      <title>PerceiverS: A Multi-Scale Perceiver with Effective Segmentation for Long-Term Expressive Symbolic Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music generation has progressed significantly, especially in the domain of audio generation. However, generating symbolic music that is both long-structured and expressive remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose PerceiverS (Segmentation and Scale), a novel architecture designed to address this issue by leveraging both Effective Segmentation and Multi-Scale attention mechanisms. Our approach enhances symbolic music generation by simultaneously learning long-term structural dependencies and short-term expressive details. By combining cross-attention and self-attention in a Multi-Scale setting, PerceiverS captures long-range musical structure while preserving performance nuances. The proposed model, evaluated on datasets like Maestro, demonstrates improvements in generating coherent and diverse music with both structural consistency and expressive variation. The project demos and the generated music samples can be accessed through the link: https://perceivers.github.io.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multimodal Query Representation via Visual Dialogues for End-to-End Knowledge Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing multimodal retrieval systems often rely on disjointed models for image comprehension, such as object detectors and caption generators, leading to cumbersome implementations and training processes. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end retrieval system, Ret-XKnow, to endow a text retriever with the ability to understand multimodal queries via dynamic modality interaction. Ret-XKnow leverages a partial convolution mechanism to focus on visual information relevant to the given textual query, thereby enhancing multimodal query representations. To effectively learn multimodal interaction, we also introduce the Visual Dialogue-to-Retrieval (ViD2R) dataset automatically constructed from visual dialogue datasets. Our dataset construction process ensures that the dialogues are transformed into suitable information retrieval tasks using a text retriever. We demonstrate that our approach not only significantly improves retrieval performance in zero-shot settings but also achieves substantial improvements in fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available: https://github.com/yeongjoonJu/Ret_XKnow.</description>

      <title>DiVR: incorporating context from diverse VR scenes for human trajectory prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual environments provide a rich and controlled setting for collecting detailed data on human behavior, offering unique opportunities for predicting human trajectories in dynamic scenes. However, most existing approaches have overlooked the potential of these environments, focusing instead on static contexts without considering userspecific factors. Employing the CREATTIVE3D dataset, our work models trajectories recorded in virtual reality (VR) scenes for diverse situations including road-crossing tasks with user interactions and simulated visual impairments. We propose Diverse Context VR Human Motion Prediction (DiVR), a cross-modal transformer based on the Perceiver architecture that integrates both static and dynamic scene context using a heterogeneous graph convolution network. We conduct extensive experiments comparing DiVR against existing architectures including MLP, LSTM, and transformers with gaze and point cloud context. Additionally, we also stress test our model's generalizability across different users, tasks, and scenes. Results show that DiVR achieves higher accuracy and adaptability compared to other models and to static graphs. This work highlights the advantages of using VR datasets for context-aware human trajectory modeling, with potential applications in enhancing user experiences in the metaverse. Our source code is publicly available at https://gitlab.inria.fr/ffrancog/creattive3d-divr-model.</description>
