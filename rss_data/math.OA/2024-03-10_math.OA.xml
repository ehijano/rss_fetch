      <title>Generalized Choi-Davis-Jensen's Operator Inequalities and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original Choi-Davis-Jensen's inequality, with its wide-ranging applications in diverse scientific and engineering fields, has motivated researchers to explore generalizations. In this study, we extend Davis-Choi-Jensen's inequality by considering a nonlinear map instead of a normalized linear map and generalize operator convex function to any continuous function defined in a compact region. The Stone-Weierstrass theorem and Kantorovich function are instrumental in formulating and proving generalized Choi-Davis-Jensen's inequalities. Additionally, we present an application of this generalized inequality in the context of statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Inverse semigroups of separated graphs and associated algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce an inverse semigroup $\mathcal{S}(E,C)$ associated to a separated graph $(E,C)$ and describe its internal structure. In particular we show that it is strongly $E^*$-unitary and can be realized as a partial semidirect product of the form $\mathcal{Y}\rtimes\mathbb{F}$ for a certain partial action of the free group $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{F}(E^1)$ on the edges of $E$ on a semilattice $\mathcal{Y}$ realizing the idempotents of $\mathcal{S}(E,C)$. In addition we also describe the spectrum as well as the tight spectrum of $\mathcal{Y}$.
  We then use the inverse semigroup $\mathcal{S}(E,C)$ to describe several ''tame'' algebras associated to $(E,C)$, including its Cohn algebra, its Leavitt-path algebra, and analogues in the realm of $C^*$-algebras, like the tame $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{O}(E,C)$ and its Toeplitz extension $\mathcal{T}(E,C)$, proving that these algebras are canonically isomorphic to certain algebras attached to $\mathcal{S}(E,C)$. Our structural results on $\mathcal{S}(E,C)$ will then imply certain natural structure results for these algebras, like their description as partial crossed products.</description>

      <title>Free Integral Calculus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of conditional expectations in free random variables and provide closed formulas for the conditional expectation of resolvents of arbitrary non-commutative polynomials in free random variables onto the subalgebra of an arbitray subset of the variables. More precisely, given a linearization of the resolvent we compute a linearization of its conditional expectation. The coefficients of the expressions obtained in this process involve certain Boolean cumulant functionals which can be computed by solving a system of equations. On the way towards the main result we introduce a non-commutative differential calculus which allows to evaluate conditional expectations and the said Boolean cumulant functionals. We conclude the paper with several known and new examples which illustrate the working of the developed machinery and two appendices. The first appendix contains a purely algebraic approach to Boolean cumulants and the second appendix provides a crash course on linearizations of rational series.</description>

      <title>Polynomial growth and functional calculus in algebras of integrable cross-sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let ${\sf G}$ be a locally compact group with polynomial growth of order $d$, a polynomial weight $\nu$ on ${\sf G}$ and a Fell bundle $\mathscr C\overset{q}{\to}{\sf G}$. We study the Banach $^*$-algebras $L^1({\sf G}\,\vert\,\mathscr C)$ and $L^{1,\nu}({\sf G}\,\vert\,\mathscr C)$, consisting of integrable cross-sections with respect to ${\rm d} x$ and $\nu(x){\rm d} x$, respectively. By exploring new relations between the $L^p$-norms and the norm of the Hilbert $C^*$-module $L^2_{\sf e}({\sf G}\,\vert\,\mathscr C)$, we are able to develop a smooth functional calculus for the self-adjoint, compactly-supported, continuous cross-sections and estimate the growth of the semigroups they generate by $$\| e^{it\Phi} \|=O(|t|^{2d+2}),\quad\text{ as }|t|\to\infty.$$ We also give some sufficient conditions for these algebras to be symmetric. As consequences, we show that these algebras are locally regular, $^*$-regular and have the Wiener property (when symmetric), among other results.
  Our results are already new for convolution algebras $L_\alpha^1({\sf G},{\mathfrak A})$ associated with a $C^*$-dynamical system $({\sf G},\mathfrak A,\alpha)$. As an application, we show that Hahn algebras of transformation groupoids where the acting group has polynomial growth are $^*$-regular. On an appendix, we also use our techniques to compute the spectral radius of some cross-sections associated with groups of subexponential growth and show that compact groups are hypersymmetric.</description>

      <title>$E$-theory is compactly assembled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the equivariant $E$-theory category $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{sep}}^{G}$ for separable $C^{*}$-algebras is a compactly assembled stable $\infty$-category. We derive this result as a consequence of the shape theory for $C^{*}$-algebras developed by Blackadar and Dardarlat and a new construction of $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{sep}}^{G}$. As an application we investigate a topological enrichment of the homotopy category of a compactly assembled $\infty$-category in general and argue that the results of Carri\'on and Schafhauser on the enrichment of the classical $E$-theory category can be derived by specialization.</description>
