      <title>Stable and Fault-Tolerant Decentralized Traffic Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud providers have recently decentralized their wide-area network traffic engineering (TE) systems to contain the impact of TE controller failures. In the decentralized design, a controller fault only impacts its slice of the network, limiting the blast radius to a fraction of the network. However, we find that autonomous slice controllers can arrive at divergent traffic allocations that overload links by 30% beyond their capacity. We present Symphony, a decentralized TE system that addresses the challenge of divergence-induced congestion while preserving the fault-isolation benefits of decentralization. By augmenting TE objectives with quadratic regularization, Symphony makes traffic allocations robust to demand perturbations, ensuring TE controllers naturally converge to compatible allocations without coordination. In parallel, Symphony's randomized slicing algorithm partitions the network to minimize blast radius by distributing critical traffic sources across slices, preventing any single failure from becoming catastrophic. These innovations work in tandem: regularization ensures algorithmic stability to traffic allocations while intelligent slicing provides architectural resilience in the network. Through extensive evaluation on cloud provider WANs, we show Symphony reduces divergence-induced congestion by 14x and blast radius by 79% compared to current practice.</description>

      <title>GeoPipe: a Geo-distributed LLM Training Framework with enhanced Pipeline Parallelism in a Lossless RDMA-enabled Datacenter Optical Transport Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) with exponentially growing parameters is making cross-data center (DC) training an inevitable trend. However, viable strategies for extending single-DC training frameworks to multi-DC environments remain underdeveloped. We experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, a high-performance geo-distributed LLMs training framework across multiple DCs interconnected by a lossless, remote direct memory access (RDMA) enabled Datacenter Optical Transport Network (DC-OTN). An enhanced pipeline parallelism scheme is implemented within the Ascend full-stack environment of Huawei, which effectively eliminates the impact of cross-DC communication overhead on training efficiency. The overlapped computation and cross-DC communication is achieved with constraint cross-DC bandwidth and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), reducing computation bubble ratio by up to 78.91%.</description>

      <title>A Network Digital Twin of a 5G Private Network: Designing a Proof-of-Concept from Theory to Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network Digital Twins represent a key technology in future networks, expected to provide the capability to perform accurate analysis and predictions about the behaviour of 6G mobile networks. However, despite the availability of several theoretical works on the subject, still very few examples of actual implementations of Network Digital Twin are available. This paper provides a detailed description about the characteristics of Network Digital Twin and provides a practical example about real deployment of the technology. The considered network infrastructure is a real 5G private network running in a lab. The Network Digital Twin is built based on open source network emulation software and is available to the community as open source. Measurements on both the physical infrastructure and the related Digital Twin demonstrate a high accuracy in reproducing the state and behavior of the actual 5G system.</description>

      <title>Over-Threshold Multiparty Private Set Intersection for Collaborative Network Intrusion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important function of collaborative network intrusion detection is to analyze the network logs of the collaborators for joint IP addresses. However, sharing IP addresses in plain is sensitive and may be even subject to privacy legislation as it is personally identifiable information. In this paper, we present the privacy-preserving collection of IP addresses. We propose a single collector, over-threshold private set intersection protocol. In this protocol $N$ participants identify the IP addresses that appear in at least $t$ participant's sets without revealing any information about other IP addresses. Using a novel hashing scheme, we reduce the computational complexity of the previous state-of-the-art solution from $O(M(N \log{M}/t)^{2t})$ to $O(t^2M\binom{N}{t})$, where $M$ denotes the dataset size. This reduction makes it practically feasible to apply our protocol to real network logs. We test our protocol using joint networks logs of multiple institutions. Additionally, we present two deployment options: a collusion-safe deployment, which provides stronger security guarantees at the cost of increased communication overhead, and a non-interactive deployment, which assumes a non-colluding collector but offers significantly lower communication costs and applicable to many use cases of collaborative network intrusion detection similar to ours.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-Loop Bandwidth Estimation for Quality of Experience Optimization in Real-Time Video Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quality of experience (QoE) delivered by video conferencing systems is significantly influenced by accurately estimating the time-varying available bandwidth between the sender and receiver. Bandwidth estimation for real-time communications remains an open challenge due to rapidly evolving network architectures, increasingly complex protocol stacks, and the difficulty of defining QoE metrics that reliably improve user experience. In this work, we propose a deployed, human-in-the-loop, data-driven framework for bandwidth estimation to address these challenges. Our approach begins with training objective QoE reward models derived from subjective user evaluations to measure audio and video quality in real-time video conferencing systems. Subsequently, we collect roughly $1$M network traces with objective QoE rewards from real-world Microsoft Teams calls to curate a bandwidth estimation training dataset. We then introduce a novel distributional offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to train a neural-network-based bandwidth estimator aimed at improving QoE for users. Our real-world A/B test demonstrates that the proposed approach reduces the subjective poor call ratio by $11.41\%$ compared to the baseline bandwidth estimator. Furthermore, the proposed offline RL algorithm is benchmarked on D4RL tasks to demonstrate its generalization beyond bandwidth estimation.</description>

      <title>Noisy Neighbor: Exploiting RDMA for Resource Exhaustion Attacks in Containerized Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern containerized cloud environments, the adoption of RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) has expanded to reduce CPU overhead and enable high-performance data exchange. Achieving this requires strong performance isolation to ensure that one container's RDMA workload does not degrade the performance of others, thereby maintaining critical security assurances. However, existing isolation techniques are difficult to apply effectively due to the complexity of microarchitectural resource management within RDMA NICs (RNICs). This paper experimentally analyzes two types of resource exhaustion attacks on NVIDIA BlueField-3: (i) state saturation attacks and (ii) pipeline saturation attacks. Our results show that state saturation attacks can cause up to a 93.9% loss in bandwidth, a 1,117x increase in latency, and a 115% rise in cache misses for victim containers, while pipeline saturation attacks lead to severe link-level congestion and significant amplification, where small verb requests result in disproportionately high resource consumption. To mitigate these threats and restore predictable security assurances, we propose HT-Verbs, a threshold-driven framework based on real-time per-container RDMA verb telemetry and adaptive resource classification that partitions RNIC resources into hot, warm, and cold tiers and throttles abusive workloads without requiring hardware modifications.</description>

      <title>CAMNet: Leveraging Cooperative Awareness Messages for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network, Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.</description>

      <title>Chronicles of Jockeying in Queuing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11061v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging trends in communication systems, such as network softwarization, functional disaggregation, and multi-access edge computing (MEC), are reshaping both the infrastructural landscape and the application ecosystem. These transformations introduce new challenges for packet transmission, task offloading, and resource allocation under stringent service-level requirements. A key factor in this context is queue impatience, where waiting entities alter their behavior in response to delay. While balking and reneging have been widely studied, this survey focuses on the less explored but operationally significant phenomenon of jockeying, i.e. the switching of jobs or users between queues. Although a substantial body of literature models jockeying behavior, the diversity of approaches raises questions about their practical applicability in dynamic, distributed environments such as 5G and Beyond. This chronicle reviews and classifies these studies with respect to their methodologies, modeling assumptions, and use cases, with particular emphasis on communication systems and MEC scenarios. We argue that forthcoming architectural transformations in next-generation networks will render many existing jockeying models inapplicable. By highlighting emerging paradigms such as MEC, network slicing, and network function virtualization, we identify open challenges, including state dissemination, migration cost, and stability, that undermine classical assumptions. We further outline design principles and research directions, emphasizing hybrid architectures and decentralized decision making as foundations for re-conceptualizing impatience in next-generation communication systems.</description>

      <title>ALLSTaR: Automated LLM-Driven Scheduler Generation and Testing for Intent-Based RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18389v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution toward open, programmable O-RAN and AI-RAN 6G networks creates unprecedented opportunities for Intent-Based Networking (IBN) to dynamically optimize RAN[...]. However, applying IBN effectively to the RAN scheduler [...] remains a significant challenge. Current approaches predominantly rely on coarse-grained network slicing, lacking the granularity for dynamic adaptation to individual user conditions and traffic patterns. Despite the existence of a vast body of scheduling algorithms [...], their practical utilization is hindered by implementation heterogeneity, insufficient systematic evaluation in production environments, and the complexity of developing high-performance scheduler implementations.[...] To address these limitations, we propose ALLSTaR (Automated LLm-driven Scheduler generation and Testing for intent-based RAN), a novel framework leveraging LLMs for automated, intent-driven scheduler design, implementation, and evaluation. ALLSTaR interprets NL intents, automatically generates functional scheduler code from the research literature using OCR and LLMs, and intelligently matches operator intents to the most suitable scheduler(s). Our implementation deploys these schedulers as O-RAN dApps, enabling on-the-fly deployment and testing on a production-grade, 5G-compliant testbed. This approach has enabled the largest-scale OTA experimental comparison of 18 scheduling algorithms automatically synthesized from the academic literature. The resulting performance profiles serve as the input for our Intent-Based Scheduling (IBS) framework, which dynamically selects and deploys appropriate schedulers that optimally satisfy operator intents. We validate our approach through multiple use cases unattainable with current slicing-based optimization techniques, demonstrating fine-grained control based on buffer status, physical layer conditions, and heterogeneous traffic types</description>

      <title>Generative Resource Allocation for 6G O-RAN with Diffusion Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation in O-RAN is critical for managing the conflicting QoS requirements of 6G network slices. Conventional reinforcement learning agents often fail in this domain, as their unimodal policy structures cannot model the multi-modal nature of optimal allocation strategies. This paper introduces Diffusion Q-Learning (Diffusion-QL), a novel framework that represents the policy as a conditional diffusion model. Our approach generates resource allocation actions by iteratively reversing a noising process, with each step guided by the gradient of a learned Q-function. This method enables the policy to learn and sample from the complex distribution of near-optimal actions. Simulations demonstrate that the Diffusion-QL approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DRL baselines, offering a robust solution for the intricate resource management challenges in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>FENIX: Enabling In-Network DNN Inference with FPGA-Enhanced Programmable Switches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is increasingly used in network data planes for advanced traffic analysis, but existing solutions (such as FlowLens, N3IC, BoS) still struggle to simultaneously achieve low latency, high throughput, and high accuracy. To address these challenges, we present FENIX, a hybrid in-network ML system that performs feature extraction on programmable switch ASICs and deep neural network inference on FPGAs. FENIX introduces a Data Engine that leverages a probabilistic token bucket algorithm to control the sending rate of feature streams, effectively addressing the throughput gap between programmable switch ASICs and FPGAs. In addition, FENIX designs a Model Engine to enable high-accuracy deep neural network inference in the network, overcoming the difficulty of deploying complex models on resource-constrained switch chips. We implement FENIX on a programmable switch platform that integrates a Tofino ASIC and a ZU19EG FPGA directly, and evaluate it on real-world network traffic datasets. Our results show that FENIX achieves microsecond-level inference latency and multi-terabit throughput with low hardware overhead, and delivers over 90% accuracy on mainstream network traffic classification tasks, outperforming the state of the art.</description>

      <title>DSNS: The Deep Space Network Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation tools are commonly used in the development and testing of new protocols or new networks. However, as satellite networks start to grow to encompass thousands of nodes, and as companies and space agencies begin to realize the interplanetary internet, existing satellite and network simulation tools have become impractical for use in this context.
  We therefore present the Deep Space Network Simulator (DSNS): a new network simulator with a focus on large-scale satellite networks. We demonstrate its improved capabilities compared to existing offerings, showcase its flexibility and extensibility through an implementation of existing protocols and the DTN simulation reference scenarios recommended by CCSDS, and evaluate its scalability, showing that it exceeds existing tools while providing better fidelity.
  DSNS provides concrete usefulness to both standards bodies and satellite operators, enabling fast iteration on protocol development and testing of parameters under highly realistic conditions. By removing roadblocks to research and innovation, we can accelerate the development of upcoming satellite networks and ensure that their communication is both fast and secure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14731v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of 1Q, the first wireless generation of integrated classical and quantum communication. 1Q features quantum base stations (QBSs) that support entanglement distribution via free-space optical links alongside traditional radio communications. Key new components include quantum cells, quantum user equipment (QUEs), and hybrid resource allocation spanning classical time-frequency and quantum entanglement domains. Several application scenarios are discussed and illustrated through system design requirements for quantum key distribution, blind quantum computing, and distributed quantum sensing. A range of unique quantum constraints are identified, including decoherence timing, fidelity requirements, and the interplay between quantum and classical error probabilities. Protocol adaptations extend cellular connection management to incorporate entanglement generation, distribution, and handover procedures, expanding the Quantum Internet to the cellular wireless.</description>

      <title>QUICstep: Evaluating connection migration based QUIC censorship circumvention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Internet censors often rely on information in the first few packets of a connection to censor unwanted traffic. With the rise of the QUIC transport protocol, prior work has suggested the method of using QUIC connection migration to conceal the first few handshake packets using a different network path (e.g., an encrypted proxy channel). However, the use of connection migration for censorship circumvention has not been explored or validated in terms of feasibility or performance. We bridge this gap by providing a rigorous quantitative evaluation of this approach that we name QUICstep. We develop a lightweight, application-agnostic prototype of QUICstep and demonstrate that QUICstep is able to circumvent a real-world QUIC SNI censor. We find that not only does QUICstep outperform a fully encrypted channel in diverse settings, but also that it can significantly reduce traffic load for encrypted channel providers. We also propose using QUICstep as a tool for measuring QUIC connection migration support in the wild and show that support for connection migration is on the rise. While as of now QUIC and connection migration support is limited, we envision that QUICstep can be a useful tool for the future where QUIC is the de facto norm for the Internet.</description>

Abstract: As sixth generation (6G) wireless networks evolve, accurate signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) maps are becoming increasingly critical for effective resource management and optimization. However, acquiring such maps at high resolution is often cost-prohibitive, creating a severe data scarcity challenge. This necessitates machine learning (ML) approaches capable of robustly reconstructing the full map from extremely sparse measurements. To address this, we introduce a novel reconstruction framework based on Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs). Unlike data-hungry ML models, GENEOs are low-complexity operators that embed domain-specific geometric priors, such as translation invariance, directly into their structure. This provides a strong inductive bias, enabling effective reconstruction from very few samples. Our key insight is that for network management, preserving the topological structure of the SINR map, such as the geometry of coverage holes and interference patterns, is often more critical than minimizing pixel-wise error. We validate our approach on realistic ray-tracing-based urban scenarios, evaluating performance with both traditional statistical metrics (mean squared error (MSE)) and, crucially, a topological metric (1-Wasserstein distance). Results show that while maintaining competitive MSE, our method dramatically outperforms established ML baselines in topological fidelity. This demonstrates the practical advantage of GENEOs for creating structurally accurate SINR maps that are more reliable for downstream network optimization tasks.</description>
