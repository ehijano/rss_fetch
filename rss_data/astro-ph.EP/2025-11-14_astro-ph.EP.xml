      <title>A Submillimeter Survey of CS Excitation in Protoplanetary Disks: Evidence of X-ray-Driven Sulfur Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sulfur chemistry in protoplanetary disks influences the properties of nascent planets, including potential habitability. Although the inventory of sulfur molecules in disks has gradually increased over the last decade, CS is still the most commonly-observed sulfur-bearing species and it is expected to be the dominant gas-phase sulfur carrier beyond the water snowline. Despite this, few dedicated multi-line observations exist, and thus the typical disk CS chemistry is not well constrained. Moreover, it is unclear how that chemistry - and in turn, the bulk volatile sulfur reservoir - varies with stellar and disk properties. Here, we present the largest survey of CS to date, combining both new and archival observations from ALMA, SMA, and NOEMA of 12 planet-forming disks, covering a range of stellar spectral types and dust morphologies. Using these data, we derived disk-integrated CS gas excitation conditions in each source. Overall, CS chemistry appears similar across our sample with rotational temperatures of ${\approx}$10-40 K and column densities between 10$^{12}$-10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. CS column densities do not show strong trends with most source properties, which broadly suggests that CS chemistry is not highly sensitive to disk structure or stellar characteristics. We do, however, identify a positive correlation between stellar X-ray luminosity and CS column density, which indicates that the dominant CS formation pathway is likely via ion-neutral reactions in the upper disk layers, where X-ray-enhanced S$^+$ and C$^+$ drive abundant CS production. Thus, using CS as a tracer of gas-phase sulfur abundance requires a nuanced approach that accounts for its emitting region and dependence on X-ray luminosity.</description>

      <title>Prebiotic Chemistry Insights for Dragonfly: Thermodynamics of Amino Acid Synthesis in Selk Crater on Titan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Saturnian moon Titan presents a compelling testbed for probing prebiotic chemistry beyond early Earth. Impact-generated melt pools provide transient aqueous habitats in an otherwise cryogenic environment. We use Cantera equilibrium models to assess whether mixtures of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), acetylene (C2H2), and ammonia (NH3) can drive amino acid synthesis in Selk-sized craters. Across twenty-one amino acids (twenty proteinogenic plus beta-alanine), NH3-free systems yield only proline, alanine, and beta-alanine, whereas adding as little as 1% NH3 (relative to H2O) renders almost the full suite accessible, with yields peaking at 2% and tapering thereafter. The NH3-free alanine result implies alternative pathways beyond classical Strecker or aminonitrile hydrolysis, suggesting acetylene, abundant on Titan but scarce on early Earth, as a plausible feedstock. We identify acrylonitrile (detected on Titan) as a thermodynamically favorable intermediate that can convert to alanine under aqueous conditions in an NH3-free pathway. For glycine and alanine production from nitrile hydrolysis, comparison with laboratory kinetics shows that our equilibrium models predict near-complete conversion, while observed rates yield only partial products over weeks. Yet estimated chemical equilibration times (years-centuries) are far shorter than melt lifetimes, supporting plausibility of equilibrium in situ. These predictions are directly testable with Dragonfly mass spectrometer (DraMS), for which we recommend pre-flight standards to test proline, alanine, beta-alanine, cysteine, and methionine. The first three offer the best chances for amino acid detection regardless of ammonia availability; the latter two offer diagnostic tools for determining the presence of reactive sulfur in post-impact Titan ponds.</description>

      <title>glitterin: Towards Replacing the Role of Lorenz-Mie Theory in Astronomy Using Neural Networks Trained on Light Scattering of Irregularly Shaped Grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light scattering by dust particles is often modeled assuming the dust is spherical for numerical simplicity and speed. However, real dust particles have highly irregular morphologies that significantly affect their scattering properties. We have developed glitterin, a neural network trained to predict light scattering from irregularly shaped dust grains, offering a computationally efficient alternative to Lorenz-Mie theory. We computed scattering properties using the Discrete Dipole Approximation code ADDA for irregularly shaped particles across size parameters x from 0.1 to 65, covering a range in complex refractive index m that includes astrosilicates, pyroxene, enstatite, water-ice, etc. The neural network operates at millisecond timescales while maintaining superior accuracy compared to linear interpolation. Irregular grains exhibit x-dependent deviations from spherical predictions. At small x, cross-sections approach volume-equivalent spheres for low m. At large x, irregular grains show enhanced cross-sections due to greater geometric extension. Increasing m also enhances the absorption cross-section relative to the volume-equivalent spheres. This differential x and m dependence creates mid-IR solid-state features distinct from predictions from spherical grains. Validation against laboratory measurements of forsterite and hematite demonstrates that our neural network captures both qualitative and quantitative behaviors more accurately than spherical models. Millimeter-wavelength applications reveal that spherical grains produce opposite polarization signatures compared to irregular grains, potentially relaxing stringent ~100um grain size constraints in protoplanetary disks. glitterin is publicly available and alleviates the computational barriers to incorporating emission and scattering of realistic grain morphologies.</description>

      <title>Planetary architectures under the influence of a stellar binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The presence of a stellar companion can strongly influence the architecture and long-term stability of planetary systems. Motivated by the discovery of exoplanets exhibiting extremely high eccentricities (e &gt;= 0.8) in systems with a binary companion, we investigate how planetary orbits around one star (S-type configuration) evolve under the gravitational perturbations of the companion. Aims. We aim to assess the role of a stellar companion in shaping the orbital evolution of S-type planets and to explore whether dynamical interactions in such environments can account for the formation of highly eccentric planets. Methods. We performed a suite of N-body simulations, modeling systems initially composed of three Jupiter-mass planets on nearly circular, coplanar orbits around the primary star. We systematically varied the semi-major axis, eccentricity, and inclination of the stellar companion, to characterize the conditions under which extreme eccentricities can be excited. Results. Our results show that dynamical processes such as planet-planet scattering and secular mechanisms--including the von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov effect induced by the binary--often act together to produce abrupt and significant changes in planetary orbital evolution, with the outcome strongly dependent on the binary separation. The binary's eccentricity primarily dictates the number of surviving planets, while its inclination not only governs the final eccentricities of those survivors but also drives their orbits to align with the binary plane. Our simulations successfully reproduce the high eccentricities and compact orbits observed in four observed systems, showing close agreement between the modeled configurations and the actual systems.</description>

      <title>PEPSI Investigation, Retrieval, and Atlas of Numerous Giant Atmospheres (PIRANGA). IV. High-Resolution Phased-Resolved Spectroscopy of The Ultra Hot Jupiter KELT-20 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present five datasets of high-resolution optical emission spectra of the ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-20 b with the PEPSI spectrograph. Using a Bayesian retrieval framework, we constrain its dayside pressure-temperature profile and abundances of Fe, Ni, and Ca, providing the first measurements for Ni and Ca for KELT-20 b in emission. We retrieve the pre- and post-eclipse datasets separately (corresponding to the evening and morning sides, respectively), and compare the constraints on their thermal structures and chemical abundances. We constrain lower abundances in the pre-eclipse datasets compared to the post-eclipse datasets. We interpret these results with an equilibrium chemistry model which suggests ~10-30x supersolar refractory abundances. Due to the well-known degeneracy between absolute abundances and continuum opacities, the abundance ratios are more precise probes of the planetary abundances. Therefore we measure the abundance ratios [Ni/Fe] and [Ca/Fe] across these datasets and find they agree within 1-sigma. We constrain [Ni/Fe] to be consistent with solar within 2-sigma, and [Ca/Fe] to be 0.001-0.01x solar, not accounting for ionization. We compare these abundance ratios with literature results for KELT-20 b in transmission, and find they agree within 2-sigma, suggesting that even though the abundances vary significantly as a function of phase, the abundance ratios of these species remain relatively constant. We find a ~100 K difference in temperature at the top of the thermal inversion, suggesting a hotter evening side than morning side and underscoring the importance of considering 3D effects when studying ultra-hot Jupiters.</description>

      <title>Seasonal and Diurnal Variability of Atmospheric Pressure in Jezero Crater, Mars, from MEDA Measurements on the Perseverance Rover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of atmospheric pressure variability inside Jezero Crater on Mars based on measurements from the MEDA meteorological station aboard NASA's Perseverance rover. Pressure data from Sols 182, 361, 504, and 658 reveal seasonal and diurnal fluctuations linked to solar insolation, CO2 condensation and sublimation cycles, and local geomorphology. During Sol 504, an unexpected pressure increase was recorded despite coinciding with the onset of northern winter, suggesting the influence of perihelion and dust-related thermal tides. Statistical parameters such as mean, standard deviation, and amplitude show that Jezero exhibits larger diurnal pressure swings than Gale Crater, mainly due to its lower latitude and topographic confinement. These results demonstrate the strong coupling between Martian atmospheric dynamics, orbital configuration, and local topography, and illustrate the value of MEDA data for characterizing short-term and seasonal variations in the Martian boundary layer.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Contact Surfaces Formed by Pebble Collisions: Application to Formation of Comet 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the contact surfaces formed by pebble collisions is crucial to understanding the formation process of comets, which are thought to be composed of pebbles. In this paper, we develop a new model to estimate the contact surface radius and the number of contact points as functions of collision velocity, and examine the formation process of comet 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko. Our model is based on the compressive strength of dust aggregates obtained from numerical simulations and assumes that all the impact energy of the pebbles is used for their mutual compression. We compare our model with numerical simulations of pebble collisions, in which we prepare the initial pebbles in the form of compressed dust aggregate spheres and measure the contact surface and pebble radii using two- and three-dimensional characteristic radii, respectively. We also apply our model to the formation scenario of comet 67P, whose tensile strength and bulk density have already been estimated in the literature. We find that its low tensile strength points to formation via pebble collisions at velocities below $\sim10\mathrm{\ cm\ s^{-1}}$ when a microscopic filling factor of pebbles is lower than 0.6, suggesting that inelastic bouncing collisions played a role in damping the collision velocities. By assuming that the pebble collision velocity is determined by the transition velocity between bouncing and sticking, we estimate the pebble radius inside comet 67P to be 130 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ or smaller.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of interior modelling and challenges in the interpretation of observed rocky exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most our knowledge about rocky exoplanets is based on their measure of mass and radius. These two parameters are routinely measured and are used to categorise different populations of observed exoplanets. They are also tightly linked to the planet's properties, in particular those of the interior. As such they offer the unique opportunity to interpret the observations and potentially infer the planet's chemistry and structure. Required for the interpretation are models of planetary interiors, calculated a priori, constrained using other available data, and based on the physiochemical properties of mineralogical phases. This article offers an overview of the current knowledge about exoplanet interiors, the fundamental aspects and tools for interior modelling and how to improve the contraints on the models, along with a discussion on the sources of uncertainty. The origin and fate of volatiles, and their role in planetary evolution is discussed. The chemistry and structure of planetary interiors have a pivotal role in the thermal evolution of planets and the development of large scale properties that might become observables with future space missions and ground-based surveys. As such, having reliable and well constrained interior models is of the utmost importance for the advancement of the field.</description>

      <title>True spin-orbit obliquities distribution: data-driven confirmation of no clustering of misaligned planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. True spin-orbit obliquities {\Psi} offer valuable insights into the evolutionary history of exoplanetary systems. Previous studies have suggested that exoplanets tend to occupy either aligned or perpendicular orbits. However, recent research has indicated potential biases caused by the low sample, questioning whether this dichotomy would persist with a larger dataset. Simultaneously, a similar dichotomous behavior has been suggested for Neptune-sized planets. Aims. We aim to investigate the distribution of true spin-orbit obliquities {\Psi} with an enlarged sample, looking for confirmation of the disputed dichotomy previously found, with a focus also on the obliquities of Neptunes. Methods. Starting from a sample of 264 projected obliquities {\lambda}, we homogeneously compute true obliquities {\Psi} for 116 planets using the rotation period method. We combine them with 4 further values gathered from literature and we then study their distribution, also as a function of various star-planet system parameters. Results. Our data-driven work based on 120 true obliquities {\Psi} - the largest sample to date - strongly confirms the presence of a single cluster of aligned planets, followed by an isotropic distribution of misaligned planets with no preferred misalignment. This result is based on a uniform distribution of stellar inclinations {i_\star} , for which non-uniformity could have biased previous interpretations of the arrangement of true obliquities. We confirm that Neptunians show a tentative dichotomous distribution with data available today, but its veracity needs confirmation with an enlarged sample, also because an anisotropic distribution of stellar inclination may be one of the factors hindering the real distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we describe a Jupyter notebook demonstrating methods for the reduction and analysis of exoplanet transit observations taken with the WFC3/UVIS G280 grism. Released on Space Telescope's hst_notebooks GitHub repository, this notebook presents an example workflow for processing time-series observations taken with the G280 grism - from the calibrated flat-fielded spectra to transit light curves ready for fitting. The specific routines presented in the notebook are explained here, and are meant to highlight data reduction steps that users will typically apply to extract transit light curves. The steps include background subtraction, spatial and temporal cosmic ray correction, spectral trace fitting, spectral extraction, and light curve generation. The end products of the routines in the Jupyter notebook are the raw broadband and spectroscopic light curves, which can be ingested into publicly available light curve fitting tools to extract planetary transmission spectra.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: CPI-C -- Targets for High Contrast Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce CPISM, a simulation program developed for the Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C) on the China Space Station Telescope (CSST). CPISM supports high-contrast exoplanet imaging by simulating observational conditions and instrumental effects to optimize target selection and observation strategies. The modular design includes target modeling, imaging simulation, observational effects, detector response, and data product generation modules, enabling flexible and realistic synthetic observations. Validation through simulations of a bright star shows strong agreement with theoretical expectations, confirming the program's accuracy. CPISM's modular design allows flexibility, accommodating different stellar and planetary models, and can simulate instrumental noise, cosmic rays, and other observational effects. This tool aids in data processing, signal-to-noise ratio analysis, and high-contrast photometry, contributing to future exoplanet discovery and characterization efforts. The program's outputs will enhance observation planning and scientific return for the CPI-C mission, providing critical insights into exoplanetary systems.</description>

      <title>Electron Heat Flux and Whistler Instability in the Earth's Magnetosheath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite heat flux's role in regulating energy conversion in collisionless plasmas, its properties and evolution in the magnetosheath downstream of the Earth's bow shock are scarcely explored. We use MMS in situ measurements to quantify and characterize the electron heat flux in the magnetosheath. We find that the heat flux is shaped by the magnetosheath magnetic field as it drapes around the magnetosphere. While it is affected by solar wind upstream conditions and increases with magnetic field strength, it is not substantially changed by local magnetosheath processes. Also, the heat flux is limited by whistler instability thresholds.</description>

      <title>MOA-2010-BLG-328: Keck and HST Expose the Limits of Occams Razor in Microlensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high resolution follow-up data of the planetary microlensing event MOA-2010-BLG-328, using Keck and the Hubble. Keck data, taken 8 years after the event, reveal a strong lens detection enabling a direct measurement of lens flux and source-lens relative proper motion. We find the relative source-lens proper motion to be $\mu_{\rm rel, Hel} = 4.07 \pm 0.34\ \rm mas\ yr^{-1}$, with the lens being $\sim10$ times fainter than the source. The lens was very faint in the Hubble passbands, and the small lens-source separation of $\sim$35 mas made its detection difficult. However, we obtained estimates of the lens magnitudes in Hubble bands by constraining its location to match the Keck K-band detection. The original analysis by \citet{Furusawa2013} reports a degenerate light curve, with several viable models depending on higher-order effects. We attempt to break the degeneracy by remodeling the event using constraints from follow-up data. Our best fit model includes parallax, orbital motion, xallarap and the magnification of a source companion. Models omitting any of these are excluded. However, even with a lens detection the solution remains unclear, as the degeneracy between a nearby late M dwarf and a distant early M dwarf in the disk persists, and cannot be broken with NIR data alone. We conclude the lens is either a $\sim0.2\ M_{\odot}$ star at $2-3$kpc, or a $\sim0.5\ M_{\odot}$ star at $4-5$kpc. This study highlights the importance of multi-band data and comprehensive modeling to resolve microlensing degeneracies.</description>

      <title>ASASSN-24fw: Candidate circumplanetary disk occultation of a main-sequence star</title>

Abstract: Dusty disks around planetary and substellar companions in outer reaches of exo-planetary systems can be detected as long-lasting occultations, provided the observer is close to the secondary's orbital plane. Here we report optical spectroscopy with KOSMOS (APO), MagE (Magellan) and GHOST (Gemini-S) of ASASSN-24fw (Gaia 07:05:18.97+06:12:19.4), a 4-magnitude dimming event of a main-sequence star which lasted 8.5 months. We discover multiple low-ionization metal emission lines with velocity dispersion $\lesssim 10$ km/s blue-shifted by 27 km/s with respect to the star, as well as kinematically complex Na D absorption. If associated with the occulter, these detections suggest that the occulter is gas-rich. Further, we detect blue-shifted and broad ($\sim 200$ km/s) H$\alpha$ line, which likely originates in the inner circumstellar disk. We confirm the previously reported occultations in 1981 and 1937 seen in historic data, yielding a semi-major axis of the occulter's orbital motion around the star of 14 AU. If the occulter is a circumsecondary disk filling 30-100% of the Hill radius, we estimate the minimum mass of the secondary to be a few Jupiter masses and a disk mass of 1% of the mass of the Moon. Given the age of the star ($&gt;2$ Gyr), the disk is unlikely to be a survivor of the planet formation stage and may be a result of a planetary collision. If Na D absorption and/or metal emission lines originate in the disk, the observations presented here are the first discovery of a circumsecondary disk wind or rotation.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Cometary Anti-tails as Observed in 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS at 3.8 au show an elongated coma similar to a cometary tail but pointing in the direction of the Sun, possibly the first instance of this type of anti-tail which is not a result of perspective. We explain the anti-tail as an anisotropic extension of the snow line, or survival radius of a sublimating ice grain, in the direction of the Sun. The anisotropy is due to the difference in the sublimation mass flux in the solar and perpendicular directions caused by the change in the illumination angle of the cometary surface. The stronger sublimation mass flux in the solar direction results in ice grains with larger sizes, longer sublimation lifetimes, and a snow line at a larger radial distance with respect to other directions. The observed radial surface brightness profiles as a function of illumination angle are well reproduced by a Haser-type radial outflow with constant velocity and sublimating ice grains with angularly dependent survival lengths.</description>

      <title>Adsorption of volatiles on dust grains in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The adsorption of volatile molecules onto dust grain surfaces fundamentally influences dust-related processes, including condensation of gas-phase molecules, dust coagulation, and planet formation in protoplanetary disks. Using advanced ab-initio density functional theory with r$^2$SCAN+rVV10 van der Waals functionals, we calculate adsorption energies of H$_2$, H$_2$O, and CO on carbonaceous (graphene, amorphous carbon) and silicate (MgSiO$_3$) surfaces. Results reveal fundamentally different adsorption mechanisms: weak physisorption on carbonaceous surfaces ($|\Delta\epsilon_{\rm ad}|\sim 0.1-0.2~{\rm eV}$) versus strong chemisorption on silicates ($|\Delta\epsilon_{\rm ad}|\sim 0.5-1.5~{\rm eV}$) via coordination bonds. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations incorporating these energies demonstrate divergent surface evolution: carbonaceous grains exhibit distinct condensation radius compared to silicates, while the cocrystal of H$_2$O and CO significantly increases the desorption temperature of CO. The actual radii of gas-phase molecule depletion could thus be a comprehensive result of temperatures, chemical compositions, and even evolution tracks. Meanwhile, silicates maintain chemisorbed molecular coatings throughout most disk regions. Such dichotomy in surface coverage could also provide a natural mechanism for carbon depletion in inner planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: CPI-C -- Instrument Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08886</link>

Abstract: To support the development of the data processing pipeline and the scientific performance assessment for the Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C) on the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST), we have developed the end-to-end instrument simulation program, CPISM. This paper details the core modules of CPISM that simulate the CPI-C instrument, focusing on the simulation of the high-contrast imaging optical system and the visible-band science camera. We modeled key optical components, such as the transmission apodizing filter, the wavefront corrector, and the focal plane mask using the HCIPy package. A $10^{-8}$ contrast dark hole region, consistent with design specifications, was simulated using the Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) optimization method, and broadband observation effects were considered. For the science camera, which is an electron multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD), we established a detailed model encompassing photon collection, charge transfer, electron multiplication (EM), and readout processes, based on test data. This model simulates complex instrumental features including dark current, charge transfer efficiency, clock-induced charge, multiplication noise factor, and various readout effects like striping and drift. We also proposed and validated an improved statistical model for the EM process to enhance simulation efficiency. CPISM can generate simulated images containing rich instrumental details, closely similar to the expected real observational data, thus laying the foundation for the development and verification of CPI-C data processing algorithms and preparations for future scientific research.</description>
