      <title>Bifurcations and synchronization of coupled translational-rotational stick-slip oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents mathematical modeling and numerical analysis of bifurcation and synchronization phenomena in a system of coupled oscillators driven by a finite-power energy source and generating two-dimensional stick-slip translational-rotational vibrations. The mechanical system consists of rigid disks placed on moving belts and asymmetrically connected to a support via springs, with each disk simultaneously performing translational and rotational motion. The belts are driven by a common DC motor. The disk contacts the belt over a finite contact area, resulting in mutually coupled frictional force and torque through their dependence on the linear and angular slip velocity. The paper utilizes special approximations of the resultant frictional forces and torques based on generalizations of Pad\'e's developements, in which special smoothing elements are introduced to avoid singularities when the relative motion between the disk and belt disappears. Furthermore, the model also provides a smooth approximation of the friction model, in which static friction is greater than kinetic friction. Numerical analysis was conducted based on direct numerical simulations, Poincare maps, and bifurcation diagrams. It was shown that the system can exhibit a two-dimensional stick-slip phenomenon, and the system exhibits predominantly periodic dynamics, sometimes with a very long period. In this work, a system of two oscillators driven by a common, limited-power motor was studied, which can synchronize and oscillate in phase or in counterphase.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of small bubbles in turbulence in non-dilute conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent flows laden with small bubbles are ubiquitous in many natural and industrial environments. From the point of view of numerical modeling, to be able to handle a very large number of small bubbles in direct numerical simulations, one traditionally relies on the one-way coupling paradigm. There, bubbles are passively advected and are non-interacting, implicitly assuming dilute conditions. Here, we study bubbles that are four-way coupled, where both the feedback on the fluid and excluded-volume interactions between bubbles are taken into account. We find that, while the back-reaction from the bubble phase onto the fluid phase remains energetically small under most circumstances, the excluded-volume interactions between bubbles can have a significant influence on the Lagrangian statistics of the bubble dynamics. We show that as the volume fraction of bubbles increases, the preferential concentration of bubbles in filamentary high-vorticity regions decreases as these strong vortical structures get filled up; this happens at a volume fraction of around one percent for $\textrm{Re}_\lambda=O(10^2)$. We furthermore study the influence on the Lagrangian velocity structure function as well as pair dispersion, and find that, while the mean dispersive behavior remains close to that obtained from one-way coupling simulations, some evident signatures of bubble collisions can be retrieved from the structure functions and the distribution of the dispersion, even at very small volume fractions. This work not only teaches us about the circumstances under which four-way coupling becomes important, but also opens up new directions towards probing and ultimately manipulating coherent vortical structures in small-scale turbulence using bubbles.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Multivariate Consistency in ML-Based Weather Forecasting with Latent-space Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven machine learning (ML) models have recently shown promise in surpassing traditional physics-based approaches for weather forecasting, leading to a so-called second revolution in weather forecasting. However, most ML-based forecast models treat reanalysis as the truth and are trained under variable-specific loss weighting, ignoring their physical coupling and spatial structure. Over long time horizons, the forecasts become blurry and physically unrealistic under rollout training. To address this, we reinterpret model training as a weak-constraint four-dimensional variational data assimilation (WC-4DVar) problem, treating reanalysis data as imperfect observations. This allows the loss function to incorporate reanalysis error covariance and capture multivariate dependencies. In practice, we compute the loss in a latent space learned by an autoencoder (AE), where the reanalysis error covariance becomes approximately diagonal, thus avoiding the need to explicitly model it in the high-dimensional model space. We show that rollout training with latent-space constraints improves long-term forecast skill and better preserves fine-scale structures and physical realism compared to training with model-space loss. Finally, we extend this framework to accommodate heterogeneous data sources, enabling the forecast model to be trained jointly on reanalysis and multi-source observations within a unified theoretical formulation.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of the spectral form factor to short-range level statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.02249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral form factor is a dynamical probe for level statistics of quantum systems. The early-time behaviour is commonly interpreted as a characterization of two-point correlations at large separation. We argue that this interpretation can be too restrictive by indicating that the self-correlation imposes a constraint on the spectral form factor integrated over time. More generally, we indicate that each expansion coefficient of the two-point correlation function imposes a constraint on the properly weighted time-integrated spectral form factor. We discuss how these constraints can affect the interpretation of the spectral form factor as a probe for ergodicity. We propose a new probe, which eliminates the effect of the constraint imposed by the self-correlation. The use of this probe is demonstrated for a model of randomly incomplete spectra and a Floquet model supporting many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Chaotic advection in a steady three-dimensional MHD flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the 3D stationary flow of a weakly conducting fluid in a cubic cavity, driven by the Lorentz force created by two permanent magnets and a weak constant current. Our goal is to determine the conditions leading to efficient mixing within the cavity. The flow is composed of a large recirculation cell created by one side magnet, superposed to two recirculation cells created by a central magnet perpendicular to the first one. The overall structure of this flow, obtained here by solving the Stokes equations with Lorentz forcing, is similar to the tri-cellular model flow studied by Toussaint et. al. (Phys. Fluids. 7, 1995). Chaotic advection in this flow is analyzed by means of Poincar\'e sections, Lyapunov exponents and expansion entropies. In addition, we quantify the quality of mixing by computing contamination rates, homogeneity, as well as mixing times. Though individual vortices have poor mixing properties, the superposition of both flows creates chaotic streamlines and efficient mixing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos in Non-Markovian Open Quantum Systems: Interferometric OTOC, Loschmidt Echo and Commutator Operator Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs) are crucial tools for studying quantum chaos as they show distinct scrambling behavior for chaotic Hamiltonians. We calculate OTOC and analyze the quantum information scrambling in atom-field and spin-spin interaction models, which are open-system models and exhibit non-Markovian behavior. We also examine the Loschmidt echo for these models and comment on their chaotic nature. The commutator growth of two local operators, which is upper bounded by the Lieb-Robinson bound, is studied for these models, and the patterns of scrambling are investigated.</description>
