      <title>On the Local equivalence of the Black Scholes and the Merton Garman equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was demonstrated previously that the stochastic volatility emerges as the gauge field necessary for restoring the local symmetry under changes of the prices of the stocks inside the Black-Scholes (BS) equation. When this occurs, then a Merton-Garman-like equation emerges. From the perspective of manifolds, this means that the Black-Scholes equation and the Merton-Garman (MG) one can be considered as locally equivalent. In this scenario, the MG Hamiltonian is a special case of a more general Hamiltonian, here called gauge-Hamiltonian. We then show that the gauge character of the volatility implies some specific functional relation between the prices of the stock and the volatility. The connection between the prices of the stocks and the volatility, is a powerful tool for improving the volatility estimations in the stock market, which is a key ingredient for the investors to make good decisions. Finally, we define an extended version of the martingale condition, defined for the gauge-Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Mean field equilibrium asset pricing model under partial observation: An exponential quadratic Gaussian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies an asset pricing model in a partially observable market with a large number of heterogeneous agents using the mean field game theory. In this model, we assume that investors can only observe stock prices and must infer the risk premium from these observations when determining trading strategies. We characterize the equilibrium risk premium in such a market through a solution to the mean field backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE). Specifically, the solution to the mean field BSDE can be expressed semi-analytically by employing an exponential quadratic Gaussian framework. We then construct the risk premium process, which cannot be observed directly by investors, endogenously using the Kalman-Bucy filtering theory. In addition, we include a simple numerical simulation to visualize the dynamics of our market model.</description>

      <title>Neural Term Structure of Additive Process for Option Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The additive process generalizes the L\'evy process by relaxing its assumption of time-homogeneous increments and hence covers a larger family of stochastic processes. Recent research in option pricing shows that modeling the underlying log price with an additive process has advantages in easier construction of the risk-neural measure, an explicit option pricing formula and characteristic function, and more flexibility to fit the implied volatility surface. Still, the challenge of calibrating an additive model arises from its time-dependent parameterization, for which one has to prescribe parametric functions for the term structure. For this, we propose the neural term structure model to utilize feedforward neural networks to represent the term structure, which alleviates the difficulty of designing parametric functions and thus attenuates the misspecification risk. Numerical studies with S\&amp;P 500 option data are conducted to evaluate the performance of the neural term structure.</description>
