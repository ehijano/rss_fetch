      <title>Ion solvation in atomic baths: from snowballs to polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solvation, the result of the complicated interplay between solvent-solute and solvent-internal interactions, is one of the most important chemical processes. Consequently, a complete theoretical understanding of solvation seems a heroic task. However, it is possible to elucidate fundamental solvation mechanisms by looking into simpler systems, such as ion solvation in atomic baths. In this work, we study ion solvation by calculating the ground state properties of a single ion in a neutral bath from the high-density regime to the low-density regime, finding common ground for these two, in principle, disparate regimes. Our results indicate that a single $^{174}$Yb$^+$ ion in a bath of $^{7}$Li atoms forms a coordination complex at high densities with a coordination number of 8, with strong electrostriction, characteristic of the snowball effect. On the contrary, treating the atomic bath as a dilute quantum gas at low densities, we find that the ion-atom interaction's short-range plays a significant role in the physics of many-body bound states and polarons. Furthermore, in this regime, we explore the role of a putative ion trap, which drastically affects the binding mechanism of the ion and atoms from a quantum gas. Therefore, our results give a novel insight into the universality of ion-neutral systems in the ultracold regime and the possibilities of observing exotic many-body effects.</description>

      <title>Expansion of strongly interacting dipolar bosons in 1D optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study the expansion dynamics of initially localized dipolar bosons in a homogeneous 1D optical lattice for different initial states. Comparison is made to interacting bosons with contact interaction. For shallow lattices the expansion is unimodal and ballistic, while strong lattices suppress tunneling. However for intermediate lattice depths a strong interplay between dipolar interaction and lattice depth occurs. The expansion is found to be bimodal, the central cloud expansion can be distinguished from the outer halo structure. In the regime of strongly interactions dipolar bosons exhibit two time scales, with an initial diffusion and then arrested transport in the long time; while strongly interacting bosons in the fermionized limit exhibit ballistic expansion. Our study highlights how different lattice depths and initial states can be manipulated to control tunneling dynamics.</description>

      <title>Numerical Realization of Dynamical Fermionization and Bethe Rapidities in a cold quenched Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this numerical investigation, we explore the non-equilibrium dynamics of a cold Lieb-Liniger (LL) Bose gas -- a well established integrable quantum system in one dimension exhibiting repulsive interactions. Our study involves the presence of a hard wall potential during the ballistic expansion of the Bose gas from its ground state within an infinite deep box of length L0 to a final length L. The Quantum Monte Carlo method, based on the Generalized Feynman-Kac approach, serves as our computational tool. Given the integrability of the Lieb-Liniger model, strongly correlated systems resist thermalization. To capture the intricate dynamics we employ the concept of Bethe Rapidities(BRs), a holistic function that extends beyond atomic or energy density considerations. Our thought experiment involves a box-to-box expansion, providing a unique opportunity for direct numerical observation of Bethe Rapidities and the phenomenon of Dynamical Fermionization(DF). This investigation aims to contribute insights into the behavior of strongly correlated quantum systems during non-equilibrium processes, offering a detailed examination of Bethe Rapidities and the dynamic evolution of Fermionization throughout the expansion.</description>

      <title>Coherent insulator at arbitrary frequency in a driven atomtronic transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use numerical approach to study non-equilibrium transport of atomic gas in a driven optical lattice atomtronic transistor. The shaken optical lattice transistor displays a property of insulator within some regions of shaking frequency and shaking strength. It is proved that appearance of the insulation is directly connected to coherence of the system. Coherence of the system is accompanied by coherent trapping of non-equilibrium atomic gas in one of the optical wells, which stops atomic currents. Comparing with the effective Hamiltonian approach in Floquet engineering, the time-dependent Hamiltonian approach could be used in any frequency regime of periodically driven quantum system.</description>

      <title>Ultracold dipolar bosons trapped in atomtronic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a ring-shaped triple-well potential with few polar bosons with in-plane dipole orientation. By diagonalizing the extended Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, we investigate the ground state properties of the system as we rotate the dipole angle and vary the on-site and dipole-dipole interaction strengths. We find that the anisotropic character of the dipolar interactions, as well as the competition between dipole and on-site interactions lead to different ground states and that the entanglement between sites also depends on the number of particles. We further characterize the system by studying the condensed fraction and coherence properties, highlighting the possible effect of the dipolar interaction as manipulation tool.</description>

      <title>Suppression of the superfluid Kelvin-Helmholtz instability due to massive vortex cores, friction and confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the dynamical instability responsible for the breakdown of regular rows and necklaces of quantized vortices that appear at the interface between two superfluids in relative motion. Making use of a generalized point-vortex model, we identify several mechanisms leading to the suppression of this instability. They include a non-zero mass of the vortex cores, dissipative processes resulting from the interaction between the vortices and the excitations of the superfluid, and the proximity of the vortex array to the sample boundaries. We show that massive vortex cores not only have a mitigating effect on the dynamical instability, but also change the associated scaling law and affect the direction along which it develops. The predictions of our massive and dissipative point-vortex model are eventually compared against recent experimental measurements of the maximum instability growth rate relevant to vortex necklaces in a cold-atom platform.</description>

Abstract: Due to the hybridization of charged excitons with cavity photons, trion-polaritons (TP) in microcavity semiconductors are a promising avenue for realizing strong polariton interactions and many-body polariton phases. We develop a quantum field theoretical formalism to study the formation of trion-polaritons in a microcavity semiconductor doped with itinerant electrons within the ultra-strong light-matter coupling regime. We predict a new class of many-body states resulting from the intriguing interplay of polarons and virtual photons in an uncharted territory of light-matter interactions and Feshbach physics.</description>

      <title>Probing Site-Resolved Current in Strongly Interacting Superconducting Circuit Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transport measurements are fundamental for understanding condensed matter phenomena, from superconductivity to the fractional quantum Hall effect. Analogously, they can be powerful tools for probing synthetic quantum matter in quantum simulators. Here we demonstrate the measurement of in-situ particle current in a superconducting circuit lattice and apply it to study transport in both coherent and bath-coupled lattices. Our method utilizes controlled tunneling in a double-well potential to map current to on-site density, revealing site-resolved current and current statistics. We prepare a strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard lattice at different lattice fillings, and observe the change in current statistics as the many-body states transition from superfluid to Mott insulator. Furthermore, we explore non-equilibrium current dynamics by coupling the lattice to engineered driven-dissipative baths that serve as tunable particle source and drain. We observe steady-state current in discrete conduction channels and interaction-assisted transport. These results establish a versatile platform to investigate microscopic quantum transport in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>A tweezer array with 6100 highly coherent atomic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have had a transformative impact on atomic and molecular physics over the past years, and they now form the backbone for a wide range of leading experiments in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology. Underlying this development is the simplicity of single particle control and detection inherent to the technique. Typical experiments trap tens to hundreds of atomic qubits, and very recently systems with around one thousand atoms were realized without defining qubits or demonstrating coherent control. However, scaling to thousands of atomic qubits with long coherence times and low-loss, high-fidelity imaging is an outstanding challenge and critical for progress in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology, in particular, towards applications with quantum error correction. Here we experimentally realize an array of optical tweezers trapping over 6,100 neutral atoms in around 12,000 sites while simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art performance for several key metrics associated with fundamental limitations of the platform. Specifically, while scaling to such a large number of atoms, we also demonstrate a coherence time of 12.6(1) seconds, a record for hyperfine qubits in an optical tweezer array. Further, we show trapping lifetimes close to 23 minutes in a room-temperature apparatus, enabling record-high imaging survival of 99.98952(1)% in combination with an imaging fidelity of over 99.99%. Our results, together with other recent developments, indicate that universal quantum computing with ten thousand atomic qubits could be a near-term prospect. Furthermore, our work could pave the way for quantum simulation and metrology experiments with inherent single particle readout and positioning capabilities at a similar scale.</description>

      <title>Emergence of isotropy in rotating turbulence of Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study on the development of rotating turbulence in Bose-Einstein condensates with a dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii model. Turbulence is generated by driving the lattice of quantized vortices in a harmonic potential with a random forcing potential. As the turbulence progressed, the initial alignment of vortices underwent slight disruptions, thereby increasing the high-wavenumber components of the kinetic energy. In the turbulent state, the distribution of incompressible kinetic energy exhibits milder anisotropy than that in the initial lattice state and demonstrates a scaling behavior of $k_z^{-2.5}$ in the direction parallel to the rotation axis. In contrast, the compressible kinetic energy exhibits an isotropic scaling behavior at high wavenumbers.</description>

      <title>The Uhlmann Phase Winding in Bose-Einstein Condensates at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Uhlmann phase, a generalization of the celebrated Berry phase, for Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) at finite temperature. The Uhlmann phase characterizes topological properties of mixed states, in contrast to the Berry phase which is defined for pure states at zero temperature. Using the $SU(1,1)$ symmetry of the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian, we derive a general formula for the Uhlmann phase of BECs. Numerical calculations reveal that the Uhlmann phase can differ from the Berry phase in the zero-temperature limit, contrary to previous studies. As the temperature increases, the Uhlmann phase exhibits a winding behavior, and we relate the total winding degree to the Berry phase. This winding indicates that the Uhlmann phase takes values on a Riemann surface. Furthermore, we propose an experimental scheme to measure the Uhlmann phase of BECs by purifying the density matrix using an atomic interferometer.</description>

Abstract: We report on an experimental simulation of the spin-1 Heisenberg model with composite bosons in a one-dimensional chain based on the two-component Bose-Hubbard model. Exploiting our site-and spin-resolved quantum gas microscope, we observed faster superexchange dynamics of the spin-1 system compared to its spin-1/2 counterpart, which is attributed to the enhancement effect of multi-bosons. We further probed the non-equilibrium spin dynamics driven by the superexchange and single-ion anisotropy terms, unveiling the linear expansion of the spin-spin correlations, which is limited by the Lieb-Robinson bound. Based on the superexchange process, we prepared and verified the entangled qutrits pairs with these composite spin-1 bosons, potentially being applied in qutrit-based quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-range electrostatic interactions between molecules depend strongly on their relative orientation, which manifests as a rotational state dependence. Interactions between molecules in the same rotational quantum state are well-known attractive rotational van der Waals interactions. Interactions in rotational states that differ by one quantum show resonant dipole-dipole interactions. We show that where molecules are in rotational states that differ by more than one quantum, they exhibit repulsive van der Waals interactions. At temperatures below a millikelvin, this effect can reduce collisional loss by multiple orders of magnitude. These repulsive interactions lead to applications in quantum simulation and impurity physics with ultracold polar molecules.</description>

      <title>A scheme for deterministic loading of laser-cooled molecules into optical tweezers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to repeatedly load laser-cooled molecules into optical tweezers, and transfer them to storage states that are rotationally excited by two additional quanta. Collisional loss of molecules in these storage states is suppressed, and a dipolar blockade prevents the accumulation of more than one molecule. Applying three cycles loads tweezers with single molecules at an 80~\% success rate, limited by residual collisional loss. This improved loading efficiency reduces the time needed for rearrangement of tweezer arrays, which would otherwise limit the scalability of neutral molecule quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the emergence of quantum state designs in systems with symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state designs, by enabling an efficient sampling of random quantum states, play a quintessential role in devising and benchmarking various quantum protocols with broad applications ranging from circuit designs to black hole physics. Symmetries, on the other hand, are expected to reduce the randomness of a state. Despite being ubiquitous, the effects of symmetry on quantum state designs remain an outstanding question. The recently introduced projected ensemble framework generates efficient approximate state t-designs by hinging on projective measurements and many-body quantum chaos. In this work, we examine the emergence of state designs from the random generator states exhibiting symmetries. Leveraging on translation symmetry, we analytically establish a sufficient condition for the measurement basis leading to the state t-designs. Then, by making use of the trace distance measure, we numerically investigate the convergence to the designs. Subsequently, we inspect the violation of the sufficient condition to identify bases that fail to converge. We further demonstrate the emergence of state designs in a physical system by studying the dynamics of a chaotic tilted field Ising chain with periodic boundary conditions. We find faster convergence of the trace distance in the initial time, however, it saturates to a finite value deviating from random matrix prediction at a late time, in contrast to the case with open boundary condition. To delineate the general applicability of our results, we extend our analysis to other symmetries. We expect our findings to pave the way for further exploration of deep thermalization and equilibration of closed and open quantum many-body systems.</description>
