      <title>WTMAD-4: A Fair Weighting Scheme for GMTKN55</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GMTKN55 data set is a collection of standard benchmarks used in molecular quantum chemistry that spans small- and large-molecule thermochemistry, reaction barriers, and non-covalent interactions. Herein, we identify a flaw in the weighted mean absolute deviation (WTMAD) definitions commonly used to quantify performance of various electronic-structure methods for the GMTKN55 set, which under-weight some of its component benchmarks by orders of magnitude. A new WTMAD-4 metric is proposed, based on typical errors observed for well-behaved density-functional approximations (DFAs), ensuring fair treatment across all benchmarks. The performance of 135 dispersion-corrected DFAs is assessed by combining literature data with new results for 20 minimally empirical methods, primarily involving the exchange-hole dipole moment and many-body dispersion corrections, available in the FHI-aims code. Lastly, we highlight a literature example where a DFA parametrised by minimising WTMAD-2 underperforms for benchmarks marginalised by that metric.</description>

      <title>Neural Canonical Transformation for the Spectra of Fluxional Molecule CH5+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protonated methane, CH5+, is a highly fluxional molecule with large spatial motions of the hydrogen atoms. The molecule's anharmonic effects and the scrambling of the hydrogen atoms significantly affect the excitation spectrum of the molecule. The neural canonical transformation (NCT) approach, which we previously developed to solve the vibrational spectra of molecules and solids, is a powerful method that effectively treats nuclear quantum effects and anharmonicities. Using NCT with wavefunctions in atomic coordinates rather than normal coordinates, we successfully calculate the ground and excited states of CH5+. We found that the wavefunctions for the ground state, as well as for low- and high-energy excited states, show preferences for the three stationary points on the potential energy surface. Furthermore, the dynamics of all these states are characterized by continuous hydrogen swapping. This work extends the applicability of the NCT approach for calculating excited states to fluxional molecules without fixed geometry.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Energy Transfer in Red Algal Photosystem I Reveals an Evolutionary Bridge between Cyanobacteria and Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photosystem I converts light into chemical energy with near-unity quantum efficiency,yet its energy-transfer and charge-separation mechanisms remain debated. Evolution has diversified PSI architectures. The unicellular red algae Cyanidioschyzon merolae represents a key evolutionary intermediate,featuring a cyanobacterial-like monomeric core surrounded by three to five LHCR subunits. This hybrid organization provides a unique system to bridge mechanistic models across lineages. We applied two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy at ultralow temperatures to disentangle overlapping excitation pathways in C. merolae PSI. Cryogenic measurements suppressed thermal broadening, resolving five dynamical components: sub-picosecond equilibration acrossthe core-LHCR interface, subsequent population transfer into progressively lowerenergy manifolds, and slower feeding into red pools distributed across both core and antenna. On the longest timescales, a persistent ground-state bleach signifies excitons stabilised in terminal sinks. Notably, comparison of 8 K and 80 K spectra reveals that excitations are heterogeneously partitioned among multiple sinks at low disorder, whereas modest thermal activation promotes selective convergence into core-associated red chlorophylls. To interpret these dynamics, we employed atomistic excitonic Hamiltonians with time-nonlocal master equations, providing a quantitative framework for exciton migration and thermal redistribution. Together, these results demonstrate that C. merolae PSI broadens the kinetic funnel by distributing sinks across core and antenna, an evolutionary adaptation that extends spectral coverage whilst ensuring efficient trapping. These insights reconcile cyanobacterial and plant paradigms and illuminate how antenna expansion reshaped PSI function during the course of photosynthetic evolution.</description>

      <title>In-situ X-ray imaging of reduction-nitridation in ferric oxide under high Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of high-pressure chemical reaction dynamics has long been constrained by the absence of effective in-situ characterization methods. Here we performed the state-of-the-art synchrotron radiation in-situ X-ray imaging based on large-volume press (LVP) technology to uncover the crucial information on the dynamics of the underlying phenomena of the formation of iron-based spherical product in the high-pressure solid-state metathesis reaction (HSM). We successfully give access to the entire reduction-nitridation process of ferric oxide under the reaction conditions. By analyzing the variation of image intensity (Im) with temperature, two critical stages have been revealed, the formation of nitrogen-containing molten borate Fe[BO]+N[BO] melt and the phase separation of iron nitrides from molten borate. The experimental observation provides direct evidence for the existence of nitrogen-containing molten borate under high pressure, and the formation of molten borate plays a crucial role as a transport medium for nonmetallic ion exchange with metal elements. The M[BO]+N[BO] melt (M=other metals) represents a general pathway for the synthesis of metal nitrides under high pressure. The combination of LVP high-pressure experimental technology with X-ray radioscopy has resulted in a leap in the understanding of reaction dynamics and has opened new paths in the fields of high-pressure chemistry.</description>

      <title>Sinc Basis set for molecular orbitals calculation of cavity in 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a numerical approach based on the sinc basis set for first-principles electronic structure calculations in one-dimensional systems. The method exploits the inherent accuracy and non-local character of the sinc functions to handle long-range couplings effectively. As a proof of principle, we provide a computational study of a molecule in an optical cavity, with our code directly calculating the emergence of the energy level splitting in the spectrum.</description>

      <title>n-alkanoate + n-alkane mixtures: folding of hydrocarbon chains of n-alkanoates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mixtures CH$_3$(CH$_2$)$_{u-1}$COO(CH$_2$)$_{v-1}$CH$_3$ ($u=5-13$, $v=1,2$; $u=1,2,3$, $v=3,4$; $u=1,2,4$, $v=5$) + n-alkane have been investigated using experimental data (viscosity and excess molar functions: enthalpy, $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, volume, $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, isobaric heat capacity, and isochoric internal energy, $U_{V\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$) and models (Flory, Grunberg-Nissan, Bloomfield-Dewan). They are characterized by weak orientational effects. Large structural effects are found in some systems, like those containing pentane. Some considerations from standard enthalpies of vaporization, cohesive energy densities and $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ of heptane mixtures reveal the existence of structural changes in longer n-alkanoates, which lead to stronger interactions between them. The observed decrease of $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ for systems with a given n-alkane seems to be more related to the steric hindrance of the COO group than to interactional effects. The $U_{V\text{m}}^{\text{E}}(n)$ function ($n=$ number of C atoms in the n-alkane) shows a minimum for systems with esters with ($u\geq4$, $v=1$); ($u\geq7$, $v=2$), or ($u\geq 1$, $v=4,5$). A similar dependence was found for n-alkane mixtures involving cyclic molecules (cyclohexane, benzene). This result suggests that certain n-alkanoates, in an alkane medium, can form quasi-cyclic structures. Viscosities are well described by means of free volume effects only. For systems with butyl ethanoate or methyl decanoate, the variation of $\Delta \eta (n)$ (deviation of dynamic viscosity) is consistent with that of $U_{V\text{m}}^{\text{E}}(n)$, which supports the existence of cyclic structures in these esters. The Flory model provides poor results on $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ for systems with large structural effects. Results improve when the model is applied to $U_{V\text{m}}^{\text{E}}(n)$ data.</description>

      <title>Advancing Universal Deep Learning for Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction of Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19877v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigation on the formation of ethylene on a gold surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The targeted and efficient CO2 reduction remains an appealing option to capture CO2 from the atmosphere and transform it into value-added chemicals. The formation of methylene and subsequent dimerization to ethylene is one possible step in the rather complex pathway. These reactions typically occur on (catalytic) surfaces. It is therefore critical to gain a deeper understanding of the role of the surface. We study the reaction pathway of the dimerization on gold surfaces with varying layer thickness. The presence of support layers has a significant influence on the reaction coordinate, the energetic profile and finally on the adsorption energy of the product on the surface with interesting consequences for the role of nanostructured gold surfaces for CO2 upconversion.</description>

      <title>Correlative 3D Mapping of Structure, Composition, and Valence State Dynamics in Battery Cathodes via Simultaneous ADF-EDS-EELS Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding degradation in battery cathodes and other functional materials requires simultaneous knowledge of structural, chemical, and electronic changes in three dimensions (3D). Here, we present a simultaneous ADF-EDS-EELS tomography method that enables 3D mapping of atomic structure, composition, valence states, and transition metal inhomogeneity within a single, low-dose STEM tilt series acquisition. Applied to LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM111) particles at different electrochemical cycling stages, this method reveals nanoscale degradation processes with full spatial correlation. We observe that while chemical composition evolves uniformly throughout the entire primary particle, valence state changes and transition metal segregation are strongly depth-dependent and concentrated near the surface. This coexistence of bulk and surface-driven degradation dynamics reveals distinct mechanisms acting at different spatial scales. The evolution of inhomogeneity and valence states deviates from simple phase transition models, highlighting the roles of ion migration and dissolution-driven segregation. Our findings establish valence state gradients and nanoscale inhomogeneity as active contributors to cathode failure. More broadly, this correlative 3D platform opens new opportunities for studying redox-driven transformations in fields such as neuromorphic computing and heterogeneous catalysis, where composition-structure-function coupling is inherently three-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Geometric Frustration Directs the Self-Assembly of Nanoparticles with Crystallized Ligand Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymer-grafted nanoparticles are versatile building blocks that self-assemble into a rich diversity of mesostructures. Coarse-grained molecular simulations have commonly accompanied experiments by resolving structure formation pathways and predicting phase behavior. Past simulations represented nanoparticles as spheres and the ligands as flexible chains of beads, isotropically tethered to the nanoparticles. Here, we investigate a different minimal coarse-grained model. The model consists of an attractive rod tethered to a repulsive sphere. The motivation of this rod-sphere model is to describe nanospheres with a partially crystallized, stretched polymeric bundle, as well as other complex building blocks such as rigid surfactants and end-tethered nanorods. Varying the ratio of sphere size to rod radius stabilizes self-limited clusters and other mesostructures of reduced dimensionality. The complex phase behavior we observe is a consequence of geometric frustration.</description>

      <title>Quantum calculation of the collision-induced line-shape effects in antiprotonic helium and the new accurate ab initio $\bar{p}$He$^{+}$-He potential energy surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first fully ab initio calculations of collision-induced broadening and shift of spectral lines in antiprotonic helium ($\bar{p}$He$^{+}$) perturbed by atomic helium. To overcome critical limitations of previous studies, we construct a new highly accurate potential energy surface (PES) that spans a wide range of $\bar{p}$He$^{+}$-He geometries relevant to all metastable states of the exotic helium atom. Rigorous quantum scattering calculations performed using the new PES yield scattering $S$-matrices from which we extract pressure broadening and shift coefficients for 50 transitions in antiprotonic helium-4 ($\bar{p}^{4}$He$^{+}$). This dataset provides the first rigorous benchmark for earlier semiclassical calculations and establishes a robust theoretical reference for high-precision spectroscopy of antiprotonic helium, which is used to test the fundamental charge, parity, and time reversal (CPT) symmetry. The results extend to temperatures relevant to non-gaseous phases of helium, supporting a new class of precision measurements. This study introduces a methodological framework for future investigations of other exotic systems, such as pionic or kaonic helium atoms, enabling the development of reference data for high-precision spectroscopy of these species - an essential component for improving the determination of the pion and kaon masses.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium statistics of barrier crossings with competing pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biological, chemical, and physical systems are underpinned by stochastic transitions between equilibrium states in a potential energy. Here, we consider such transitions in a minimal model with two possible competing pathways, both starting from a local potential energy minimum and eventually finding the global minimum. There is competition between the distance to travel in state space and the height of the potential energy barriers to be surmounted, for the transition to occur. One pathway has a higher energy barrier to go over, but requires traversing a shorter distance, whereas the other pathway has a lower potential barrier but it is substantially further away in configuration space. The most likely pathway taken depends on the available time for the transition process; when only a relatively short time is available, the most likely path is the one over the higher barrier. We find that upon varying temperature the overall most likely pathway can switch from one to the other. We calculate the statistics of where the barrier crossing occurs and the distribution of times taken to reach the potential minimum. Interestingly, while the configuration space statistics is complex, the time of arrival statistics is rather simple, having an exponential probability density over most of the time range. Taken together, our results show that empirically observed rates in nonequilibrium systems should not be used to infer barrier heights.</description>

      <title>Extrapolation of Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials for Organic and Polymeric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) have surged in popularity due to their promise of expanding the spatiotemporal scales possible for simulating molecules with high fidelity. The accuracy of any MLIP is dependent on the data used for its training; thus, for large molecules, like polymers, where accurate training data is prohibitively difficult to obtain, it becomes necessary to pursue non-traditional methods to construct MLIPs, many of which are based on constructing MLIPs using smaller, analogous chemical systems. However, we have yet to understand the limits to which smaller molecules can be used as a proxy for extrapolating macromolecular energetics. Here, we provide a ``control study'' for such experiments, exploring the ability of MLIP approaches to extrapolate between n=1-8 n-polyalkanes at identical conditions. Through Principal Covariates Classification, we quantitatively demonstrate how convergence in chemical environments between training and testing datasets coincides with an MLIP's transferability. Additionally, we show how careful attention to the construction of an MLIP's neighbor list can promote greater transferability when considering various levels of the energetic hierarchy. Our results establish a roadmap for how one can create transferable MLIPs for macromolecular systems without the prohibitive cost of constructing system-specific training data.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Dust-Catalyzed Molecular Hydrogen Formation Enabled by Nuclear Quantum Effects</title>

Abstract: Molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) is one of the key chemical species that controls and shapes a wide spectrum of astrophysical processes ranging from galaxy evolution to planet formation. Although the catalyzation on dust grain surfaces is considered as the dominant formation channel of H$_2$ in the interstellar medium (ISM), which could nonetheless suffer from the Boltzmann factor suppression at low temperatures. Here we demonstrate that quantum tunneling can dominate the H$_2$ formation process, effectively resolving the long-standing efficiency problem across a wide range of temperatures. By employing the path integral method in hybrid Monte Carlo simulations to account for nuclear quantum effects (NQEs), we quantitatively identify that the tunneling of hydrogen atoms maintains relatively stable efficiencies even at temperatures below 50 K on both graphitic and silicate grain surfaces. The potential barriers associated with chemisorption/desorption and two-H association, rather than diffusion and hopping, are the dominant factors governing the actual reaction efficiency at low temperatures. These findings provide a solid physical foundation for molecule formation, which historically relied on ad-hoc formation rate multipliers to explain observed rates. The quantitative rates also offer new methodologies for observational constraints on H$_2$ formation and destruction, thereby enabling more accurate astrophysical models and interpretations on interstellar molecular materials.</description>

      <title>Insights into Ionic Diffusion in C-S-H Gel Pore from Molecular Dynamics Simulations: Spatial Distributions, Energy Barriers, and Structural Descriptor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding transport behavior in nanoconfined environments is critical to many natural and engineering systems, including cementitious materials, yet its molecular-level mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to investigate Na, Cl, and water diffusion inside a 4 nm calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) pore channel over temperatures ranging from 300 K to 360 K. Spatially resolved analysis revealed strong suppression of diffusivity near the solid-liquid interface and gradual recovery toward the pore center. Arrhenius analysis further quantified the spatial variation of activation energy barriers and intrinsic mobilities across the pore channel, showing distinct confinement effects. The spatially resolved structural analysis uncovers a mechanistic transition from structure-controlled to hydrodynamics-controlled transport regimes with increasing distance from the pore surface. A structural descriptor, total coordination strength (TCS), was introduced, providing a predictive link between local liquid structure and molecular mobility within approximately 1 nm of the interface. Beyond approximately 1 nm, suppressed diffusivities were well captured by an empirical model inspired by the Darcy-Brinkman framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MD study to comprehensively resolve the spatial heterogeneity of transport, thermal kinetics, and structure within cementitious nanopores. These findings deepen the fundamental understanding of nanoscale transport phenomena and suggest that tailoring the nanochannel structure and interfacial chemistry of cementitious gels, for example surface coordination environments, pore size distributions, and adsorption sites, may offer a promising strategy to suppress ionic ingress and enhance the durability of cement-based materials.</description>

      <title>A State-Specific Iterative Decoupling Scheme Based on Perturbation Theory for Low-Energy Electronic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a selective and scalable extension of the multi-step Rayleigh-Schrodinger and Brillouin-Wigner perturbative scheme (see arXiv:2408.16505), designed to efficiently access the low-energy spectrum of molecular systems. The method proceeds by combining successive effective Hamiltonian diagonalizations inspired by second-order Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation theory, with a Brillouin-Wigner correction applied to individually optimized states using an updated partitioning of the Hamiltonian. At each step, a zeroth-order state is identified and progressively decoupled from the remaining higher-lying states, thereby enabling a well-conditioned Brillouin-Wigner expansion for the energy correction. In contrast to previous approaches, the method selectively targets a small number of low-lying states, significantly reducing the numerical overhead while maintaining spectroscopic accuracy. The robustness of the method is demonstrated on the LiH and H4 molecules, where accurate excitation energies are obtained for the lowest singlet states using compact model spaces, confirming its potential for realistic applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dipole-dipole transition for scintillation quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A magnetic dipole-dipole interaction is proposed as a scintillation quenching mechanism. The interaction rate follows $R^{-6}$ as the electric dipole-dipole interaction in F$\mathrm{\ddot{o}}$ster resonance energy transfer theory. The proposed mechanism causes a long-range resonance energy transfer, and the resonance condition is that the spins of donor and acceptor electrons both flip, and the energy level differences are the same. The new mechanism is distinct to the known spin-orbit coupling induced intersystem crossing, and it can enhance the overall intersystem crossing rate. When oxygen or organic molecules including heavy elements are dissolved in a liquid scintillator, these requirements are possible to be satisfied. The proposal in the paper adds a new approach for scintillation quenching in liquid scintillators.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time multifarious systems -- Part I: equilibrium multifarious self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multifarious assembly models consider multiple structures assembled from a shared set of components, reflecting the efficient usage of components in biological self-assembly. These models are subject to a high-dimensional parameter space, with only a finite region of parameter space giving reliable self-assembly. Here we use a continuous-time Gillespie simulation method to study multifarious self-assembly and find that the region of parameter space in which reliable self-assembly can be achieved is smaller than what was obtained previously using a discrete-time Monte Carlo simulation method. We explain this discrepancy through a detailed analysis of the stability of assembled structures against chimera formation. We find that our continuous-time simulations of multifarious self-assembly can expose this instability in large systems even at moderate simulation times. In contrast, discrete-time simulations are slow to show this instability, particularly for large system sizes. For the remaining state space we find good agreement between the predictions of continuous- and discrete-time simulations. We present physical arguments that can help us predict the state boundaries in the parameter space, and gain a deeper understanding of multifarious self-assembly.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time multifarious systems -- Part II: non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of self-assembly, where complex structures can be assembled from smaller units, it is desirable to devise strategies towards disassembly and reassembly processes that reuse the constituent parts. A non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization strategy has been recently introduced, and shown to have the capacity to exhibit this complex property. In this work, we study the model using continuous-time Gillespie simulations, and compare the results against discrete-time Monte Carlo simulations investigated previously. Furthermore, using the continuous-time simulations we explore important features in our system, namely, the nucleation time and interface growth velocity, which comprise the timescale of shape-shifting. We develop analytical calculations for the associated timescales and compare the results to those measured in simulations, allowing us to pin down the key mechanisms behind the observed timescales at different parameter values.</description>

      <title>Rule-Based Gillespie Simulation of Chemical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The M{\O}D computational framework implements rule-based generative chemistries as explicit transformations of graphs representing chemical structural formulae. Here, we expand M{\O}D by a stochastic simulation module that simulates the time evolution of species concentrations using Gillespie's well-known stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA). This module distinguishes itself among competing implementations of rule-based stochastic simulation engines by its flexible network expansion mechanism and its functionality for defining custom reaction rate functions. It enables direct sampling from actual reactions instead of rules. We present methodology and implementation details followed by examples which demonstrate the capabilities of the stochastic simulation engine.</description>

      <title>Insertion space in repulsive active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For equilibrium hard spheres the stochastic geometry of the insertion space, the room to accommodate another sphere, relates exactly to the equation of state. We begin to extend this idea to active matter, analyzing insertion space for repulsive active particles in one and two dimensions using both on- and off-lattice models. In 1D we derive closed-form expressions for the mean insertion cavity size, cavity number, and total insertion volume, all in excellent agreement with simulations. Strikingly, activity increases the total insertion volume and tends to keep the insertion space more connected. These results provide the first quantitative foundation for the stochastic geometry of active matter, and opens up a new route to building a thermodynamics of active systems.</description>
