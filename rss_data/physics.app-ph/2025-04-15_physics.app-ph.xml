      <title>Modeling liquid-mediated interactions for close-to-substrate magnetic microparticle transport in dynamic magnetic field landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the on-chip motion of magnetic particles in a microfluidic environment is key to realizing magnetic particle-based Lab-on-a-chip systems for medical diagnostics. In this work, a simulation model is established to quantify the trajectory of a single particle moving close to a polymer surface in a quiescent liquid. The simulations include hydrodynamic, magnetostatic, and Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) interactions. They are applied to particle motion driven by a dynamically changing magnetic field landscape created by engineered parallel-stripe magnetic domains superposed by a homogeneous, time-varying external magnetic field. The simulation model is adapted to experiments in terms of fluid-particle interactions with the magnetic field landscape approximated by analytic equations under the assumption of surface charges. Varying simulation parameters, we especially clarify the impact of liquid-mediated DLVO interactions, which are essential for diagnostic applications, on the 3D trajectory of the particle. A comparison to experimental results validates our simulation approach.</description>

      <title>Engineering cm-scale true push-pull electro-optic modulators in a suspended GaAs photonic integrated circuit platform by exploiting the orientation induced asymmetry of the Pockels $r_{41}$ coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electro-optic modulators (EOMs) underpin a wide range of critical applications in both classical and quantum information processing. While traditionally the focus has been on building these devices in materials with large Pockels coefficient (mainly ferroelectric insulators like lithium niobate), there is a need to engineer EOMs in a semiconductor platform with a view towards device stability (in radiation-hard environments), manufacturability (wafer size and foundry compatibility) and integration (with active electronics and quantum confined structures). Here, we demonstrate true push-pull EOMs in a suspended GaAs photonic integrated circuit (PIC) platform by exploiting the orientation induced asymmetry of the Pockels $r_{41}$ coefficient, and folding the two arms of a cm-scale Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) modulator along two orthogonal crystal axes. Our work also shows the potential of incorporating ideas from micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) in integrated photonics by demonstrating high-performance active devices built around cm-scale suspended waveguides with sub-${\mu}$m optical mode confinement.</description>

      <title>Adjustable Molecular Cross-Linkage of MXene Layers for Tunable Charge Transport and VOC Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MXenes, two-dimensional transition metal carbides, nitrides or carbonitrides, are emerging as highly promising materials due to their remarkable charge transport characteristics and their versatile surface chemistry. Herein, we demonstrate the tunability of interfaces and the inter-layer spacing between Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_X$ MXene flakes through molecular cross-linking via ligand exchange with homologous diamines. Oleylamine was initially introduced as a ligand, to facilitate the delamination and stable dispersion of pristine Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_X$ flakes in chloroform. Subsequently, controlled cross-linkage of the flakes was achieved using diamine ligands with varying aliphatic chain lengths, enabling the precise tuning of the inter-layer spacing. Grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXRD / GIWAXS) confirmed the correlation between ligand chain length and inter-layer spacing, which was further supported by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, we investigated the charge transport properties of thin films consisting of these diamine cross-linked MXenes and observed a strong dependence of the conductivity on the interlayer spacing. Finally, we probed chemiresistive vapor sensing properties of the MXene composites and observed a pronounced sensitivity and selectivity towards water vapor, highlighting their potential for use in humidity sensors. Providing significant insights into molecular cross-linking of MXenes to form hybrid inorganic/organic composites and its consequences for charge transport, this study opens avenues for the development of next-generation MXene-based electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Field-effect detected magnetic resonance of NV centers in diamond based on all-carbon Schottky contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nitrogen vacancy (NV) center is a defect in diamond whose spin state can be read optically by exploiting its photoluminescence or electrically by exploiting its charge generation rate under illumination, both of which being spin-dependent. The latter method offers numerous opportunities in terms of integration and performance compared to conventional optical reading. Here, we investigate the physical properties of a graphitic-diamond-graphitic structure under illumination. We show how, for a type IIa diamond material, electron-hole pairs generated by an ensemble of NV centers lead to a p-type material upon illumination, making this all-carbon structure equivalent to two back-to-back Schottky diodes. We analyze how the reverse current flowing upon illumination changes as a function of bias voltage and radiofrequency-induced excitation of the NV ensemble spin resonances. Furthermore, we demonstrate how an additional field effect arising from the illumination scheme affects the reverse current, resulting in a photoelectrical signal that can exceed the optical signal under the same illumination conditions.</description>

      <title>Refractive Index Engineering: Insights from Biological Systems for Advanced Optical Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review explores the innovative design to achieve advanced optical functions in natural materials and intricate optical systems inspired by the unique refractive index profiles found in nature. By understanding the physical principles behind biological structures, we can develop materials with tailored optical properties that mimic these natural systems. One key area discussed is biomimetic materials design, where biological systems such as apple skin and the vision system inspire new materials. Another focus is on intricate optical systems based on refractive index contrast. These principles can be extended to design devices like waveguides, photonic crystals, and metamaterials, which manipulate light in novel ways. Additionally, the review covers optical scattering engineering, which is crucial for biomedical imaging. By adjusting the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index, we can control how much light is scattered and absorbed by tissues. This is particularly important for techniques like optical coherence tomography and multiphoton microscopy, where tailored scattering properties can improve imaging depth and resolution. The review also discusses various techniques for measuring the refractive index of biological tissues which provide comprehensive insights into the optical properties of biological materials, facilitating the development of advanced biomimetic designs. In conclusion, the manipulation of refractive index profiles in biological systems offers exciting opportunities for technological advancements. By drawing inspiration from nature and understanding the underlying physical principles, we can create materials and devices with enhanced performance and new functionalities. Future research should focus on further exploring these principles and translating them into practical applications to address real-world challenges.</description>

      <title>DeepWheel: Generating a 3D Synthetic Wheel Dataset for Design and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven design is emerging as a powerful strategy to accelerate engineering innovation. However, its application to vehicle wheel design remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets that include 3D geometry and physical performance metrics. To address this gap, this study proposes a synthetic design-performance dataset generation framework using generative AI. The proposed framework first generates 2D rendered images using Stable Diffusion, and then reconstructs the 3D geometry through 2.5D depth estimation. Structural simulations are subsequently performed to extract engineering performance data. To further expand the design and performance space, topology optimization is applied, enabling the generation of a more diverse set of wheel designs. The final dataset, named DeepWheel, consists of over 6,000 photo-realistic images and 900 structurally analyzed 3D models. This multi-modal dataset serves as a valuable resource for surrogate model training, data-driven inverse design, and design space exploration. The proposed methodology is also applicable to other complex design domains.

      <description>arXiv:2501.08980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The following article presents a multi-length-scale characterization approach for investigating doping chemistry and spatial distributions within semiconductors, as demonstrated using a state-of-the-art CMOS image sensor. With an intricate structural layout and varying doping types/concentration levels, this device is representative of the current challenges faced in measuring dopants within confined volumes using conventional techniques. Focused ion beam-secondary ion mass spectrometry is applied to produce large-area compositional maps with a sub-20 nm resolution, while atom probe tomography is used to extract atomic-scale quantitative dopant profiles. Leveraging the complementary capabilities of the two methods, this workflow is shown to be an effective approach for resolving nano- and micro- scale dopant information, crucial for optimizing the performance and reliability of advanced semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Duality Symmetry in Causality Constraints for Enhanced Acoustic Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a generalized causality constraint for acoustic reflection and transmission for a flat slab with finite thickness, via the duality transformation. It is known that achieving the upper limit of the causality constraint necessitates a critical coupling condition to optimize absorption bandwidth within a specified material thickness. However, the importance of duality symmetry has been overlooked in this context. Our analytical model demonstrates that optimal absorption in a 2-port setup not only relies on the well-established critical coupling but also requires duality symmetry, defined as the invariance under duality transformation. To verify our theoretical prediction, we have experimentally realized customized metamaterials that exhibit quasi-duality symmetry. This was achieved by inducing global degeneracy between the first-order monopole and dipole resonances, consequently realizing an exceptionally large sound absorption capacity as permitted by the proposed causality constraint. Our findings elucidate the intrinsic connection between duality symmetry and scattering causality, and they facilitate the exploitation of the untapped potential in existing passive absorbers for wave transport control.</description>

      <title>Parametric mechanism of the magnetization reversal as a low-power recording mechanism for MRAM. Measurement of spin-accumulation-induced in-plane magnetic field in a FeB nanomagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.05438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The parametric torque presents a promising recording mechanism for MRAM, complementing Spin Transfer Torque and Spin Orbit Torque, enabling magnetization reversal in a nanomagnet using a DC electrical current. Its resonance nature allows for optimization of magnetization reversal at a lower current, presenting an opportunity for a lower recording current and, therefore, for efficient and high-performance operation in modern MRAM technology. The in-plane magnetic field generated by spin accumulation serves as the driving force behind this torque. Experimental measurements of the current-induced in-plane magnetic field in the FeB nanomagnet reveal its magnitude to be around 40 Gauss at a current density of 25 mA/$\mu m^2$, a value adequate for facilitating parametric magnetization reversal. The parametric torque is analytically calculated by solving the Landau-Lifshitz equation. Analytical calculations demonstrate its potential in advancing modern MRAM technology.</description>

      <title>Towards Monte Carlo based Full Spectrum Modeling of Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This monograph presents advancements in Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS), a critical tool for emergency response to radiological incidents such as severe nuclear accidents or nuclear weapon detonations. Current AGRS calibration and data evaluation methods struggle to accurately quantify many radioactive materials expected in radiological emergencies, limiting the risk assessment and, hence, the effectiveness of emergency response actions. To address these limitations, this work introduces a full spectrum numerical modeling approach that features three key innovations: high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations that combine an advanced scintillation physics model with detailed geometric representations of the aircraft and detector system; a surrogate model that replicates the Monte Carlo simulations with significantly reduced computation time; and a data evaluation methodology that leverages the surrogate model within a Bayesian inversion framework, enabling the quantification of arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. The methodology presented here, rigorously validated through laboratory and field measurements, achieves not only a significant improvement in accuracy and sensitivity over traditional methods but also substantially expands the operational capabilities of AGRS systems for both emergency response scenarios and geophysical surveys. These innovations lay the groundwork for establishing a new global standard for AGRS, ultimately supporting better-informed protective actions and reducing health risks during radiological emergencies.</description>

      <title>Two-media laser threshold magnetometry: A magnetic-field-dependent laser threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a promising platform for high-precision magnetometry. In contrast to the use of spontaneous emission in a number of NV-magnetometers, laser threshold magnetometry (LTM) exploits stimulated emission of NV centers by placing an NV-doped diamond inside an optical cavity. The NV laser system is predicted to reach a high magnetic contrast and strong coherent signal strength, leading to an improved magnetic field sensitivity combined with a high linearity. Here, we consider a two-media setup where the cavity additionally includes a vertical external cavity surface emitting laser. This optically active material compensates cavity losses at 750 nm while still allowing for magnetic-field-dependent effects from the NV-diamond. We demonstrate a magnetic-field-dependent laser threshold and investigate the effects of pump laser induced absorption of the diamond. The experimental data is supported by an analytical simulation based on a rate model. Furthermore, we derive a generalized formula to compute the magnetic field sensitivity in the regime of high contrast yielding 33.79(23) pT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ for the present setup. Simulations with an optimized diamond suggest that values down to 4.9 fT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ are possible.</description>
