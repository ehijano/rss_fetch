      <title>An open-source library for performance-portable neutrino reaction rates: application to neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A realistic and detailed description of neutrinos in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers is essential to build reliable models of such systems. To this end, we present BNS_NURATES, a novel open-source numerical library designed for the efficient on-the-fly computation of neutrino interactions, with particular focus on regimes relevant to BNS mergers. BNS_NURATES targets an higher level of accuracy and realism in the implementation of commonly employed reactions by accounting for relevant microphysics effects on the interactions, such as weak magnetism and mean field effects. It also includes the contributions of inelastic neutrino scattering off electrons and positrons and (inverse) nucleon decays. Finally, it offers a way to reconstruct the neutrino distribution function in the framework of moment-based transport schemes. As a first application, we compute both energy-dependent and energy-integrated neutrino emissivities and opacities for conditions extracted from a BNS merger simulation with M1 transport scheme. We find some qualitative differences in the results when considering the impact of the additional relevant reactions and of microphysics effects. For example, neutrino-electron/positron scattering reactions are important for the energy exchange of heavy-type neutrinos as they do not undergo semi-leptonic charged-current processes, when $\mu^\pm$ are not accounted for. Moreover, weak magnetism and mean field effects can significantly modify the contribution of $\beta$-processes for electron-type (anti)neutrinos, increasing at the same time the importance of (inverse) neutron decays. The improved treatment for the reaction rates also modify the conditions at which neutrinos decouple from matter in the system, potentially affecting their emission spectra.</description>

      <title>Classification of Fermi-LAT unassociated sources with machine learning in the presence of dataset shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: About one third of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) sources are unassociated. We perform multi-class classification of Fermi-LAT sources using machine learning with the goal of probabilistic classification of the unassociated sources. A particular attention is paid to the fact that the distributions of associated and unassociated sources are different as functions of source parameters. In this work, we address this problem in the framework of dataset shifts in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Imaging and Spectral Fitting of Bright Gamma-ray Sources with the COSI Balloon Payload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Compton Spectrometer and Imager balloon payload (COSI-Balloon) is a wide-field-of-view Compton ${\gamma}$-ray telescope that operates in the 0.2 - 5 MeV bandpass. COSI-Balloon had a successful 46-day flight in 2016 during which the instrument observed the Crab Nebula, Cygnus X-1, and Centaurus A. Using the data collected by the COSI-Balloon instrument during this flight, we present the source flux extraction of signals from the variable balloon background environment and produce images of these background-dominated sources by performing Richardson-Lucy deconvolutions. We also present the spectra measured by the COSI-Balloon instrument, compare and combine them with measurements from other instruments, and fit the data. The Crab Nebula was observed by COSI-Balloon and we obtain a measured flux in the energy band 325 - 480 keV of (4.5 ${\pm}$ 1.6) ${\times}$ 10$^{-3}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The model that best fits the COSI-Balloon data combined with measurements from NuSTAR and Swift-BAT is a broken power law with a measured photon index ${\Gamma}$ = 2.20 ${\pm}$ 0.02 above the 43 keV break. Cygnus X-1 was also observed during this flight, and we obtain a measured flux of (1.4 ${\pm}$ 0.2) ${\times}$ 10$^{-3}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the same energy band and a best-fit result (including data from NuSTAR, Swift-BAT, and INTEGRAL/ IBIS) was to a cutoff power law with a high-energy cutoff energy of 138.3 ${\pm}$ 1.0 keV and a photon index of ${\Gamma}$ = 1.358 ${\pm}$ 0.002. Lastly, we present the measured spectrum of Centaurus A and our best model fit to a power law with a photon index of ${\Gamma}$ = 1.73 ${\pm}$ 0.01.</description>

      <title>On Disk Formation around Isolated Black Holes via Stream Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate accretion onto an isolated black hole from uniform winds. If the winds are directed towards the black hole, then the accretion process can be well described by the classical Bondi-Hoyle Lyttleton or BHL accretion. If the wind is not directed towards the black hole and flows past it, then a smaller fraction of the flow can be attracted by the black hole, and this type of accretion cannot be described by the classical BHL, and we coin the second kind as the lateral BHL. We show that the classical BHL cannot form an accretion disk, while lateral BHL can form transient accretion disks. To describe the thermodynamics of the flow, we have used a variable adiabatic index equation of state which depends on the temperature of the flow as well as the composition of the gas. We show that the electron-proton gas forms an accretion disk, which disappears and forms a shock cone, only to form the disk again at a later time, while for flows with less protons, the accretion disk, once lost, does not reappear again. Only when the flow is pair-dominated does it form a persistent accretion disk. We also show that a shock cone is less luminous than the accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Radiative Back-Reaction on Charged Particle Motion in the Dipole Magnetosphere of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of charged particles under the Lorentz force in the magnetosphere of neutron stars, represented by a dipole field in the Schwarzschild spacetime, can be determined by an effective potential, whose local extrema govern circular orbits both in and off the equatorial plane, which coincides with the symmetry plane of the dipole field. In this work, we provide a detailed description of the properties of these "conservative" circular orbits and, using the approximation represented by the Landau-Lifshitz equation, examine the role of the radiative back-reaction force that influences the motion of charged particles following both the in and off equatorial circular orbits, as well as the chaotic orbits confined to belts centered around the circular orbits. To provide clear insight into these dynamics, we compare particle motion with and without the back-reaction force. We demonstrate that, in the case of an attractive Lorentz force, the back-reaction leads to the charged particles falling onto the neutron star's surface in all scenarios considered. For the repulsive Lorentz force, in combination with the back-reaction force, we observe a widening of stable equatorial circular orbits; the off-equatorial orbits shift toward the equatorial plane and subsequently widen if they are sufficiently close to the plane. Otherwise, the off-equatorial orbits evolve toward the neutron star surface. The critical latitude, which separates orbital widening from falling onto the surface, is determined numerically as a function of the electromagnetic interaction's intensity.</description>

      <title>Observation of Cosmic-Ray Anisotropy in the Southern Hemisphere with Twelve Years of Data Collected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed the 7.92$\times 10^{11}$ cosmic-ray-induced muon events collected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory from May 13, 2011, when the fully constructed experiment started to take data, to May 12, 2023. This dataset provides an up-to-date cosmic-ray arrival direction distribution in the Southern Hemisphere with unprecedented statistical accuracy covering more than a full period length of a solar cycle. Improvements in Monte Carlo event simulation and better handling of year-to-year differences in data processing significantly reduce systematic uncertainties below the level of statistical fluctuations compared to the previously published results. We confirm the observation of a change in the angular structure of the cosmic-ray anisotropy between 10 TeV and 1 PeV, more specifically in the 100-300 TeV energy range.</description>

      <title>Search for Orphan Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the alert broker Fink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orphan gamma-ray burst afterglows are good candidates to learn more about the GRB physics and progenitors or for the development of multi-messenger analysis with gravitational waves. Our objective is to identify orphan afterglows in Rubin LSST data, by using the characteristic features of their light curves. In this work, we generated a population of short GRBs based on the Swift SBAT4 catalogue, and we simulated their off-axis afterglow light curves with afterglowpy. We then used the rubin_sim package to simulate observations of these orphan afterglows with Rubin LSST and proceeded with the characterisation of orphan light curves by extracting a number of parameters. The same parameters are computed for the ELAsTiCC (Extended LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge) data set, a simulated alert stream of the Rubin LSST data. We then started to develop a machine learning filter able to discriminate orphan-like events among all the variable objects. We present here the performance of our filter as implemented in the Fink broker and tested on the ELAsTiCC data set and our own Rubin pseudo-observation simulations.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Observing Astrophysical Transients with GeV Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Cherenkov detectors of high-energy neutrinos in ice and water are often optimized to detect TeV-PeV neutrinos, they may also be sensitive to transient neutrino sources in the 1-100~GeV energy range. A wide variety of transient sources have been predicted to emit GeV neutrinos. In light of the upcoming IceCube-Upgrade, which will extend the IceCube detector's sensitivity down to a few GeV, as well as improve its angular resolution, we survey a variety of transient source models and compare their predicted neutrino fluences to detector sensitivities, in particular those of IceCube-DeepCore and the IceCube Upgrade. We consider the ranges of neutrino fluence from transients powered by non-relativistic shocks, such as novae, supernovae, fast blue optical transients, and tidal disruption events. We also consider fast radio bursts and relativistic outflows of high- and low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts. Our study sheds light on the prospects of observing GeV transients with existing and upcoming neutrino facilities.</description>

      <title>Millisecond Pulsars in Globular Clusters and Implications for the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gamma-ray emission from millisecond pulsars within the Milky Way's globular cluster system in order to measure the luminosity function of this source population. We find that these pulsars have a mean luminosity of $\langle L_{\gamma}\rangle \sim (1-8)\times 10^{33}\, {\rm erg/s}$ (integrated between 0.1 and 100 GeV) and a log-normal width of $\sigma_L \sim 1.4-2.8$. If the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess were produced by pulsars with similar characteristics, Fermi would have already detected $N \sim 17-37$ of these sources, whereas only three such pulsar candidates have been identified. We conclude that the excess gamma-ray emission can originate from pulsars only if they are significantly less bright, on average, than those observed within globular clusters or in the Galactic Plane. This poses a serious challenge for pulsar interpretation of the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to explore the quasinormal modes (QNMs) and effective potential profiles of massless and rotating BTZ black holes within the frameworks of $f(\mathcal{R})$ and Ricci-Inverse ($\mathcal{RI}$) modified gravity theories, which, while producing similar space-time structures, exhibit variations due to distinct cosmological constants, $\Lambda_m$. We derive wave equations for these black hole perturbations and analyze the behavior of the effective potential $V_{\text{eff}}(r)$ under different values of mass $m$, cosmological constant $\Lambda_m$, and modified gravity parameters $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, and $\gamma$. The findings indicate that increasing mass and parameter values results in a raised potential barrier, implying stronger confinement of perturbations and impacting black hole stability. Incorporating the generalized uncertainty principle, we also study its effect on the thermodynamics of rotating BTZ black holes, demonstrating how GUP modifies black hole radiation, potentially observable in QNM decay rates. Additionally, we investigate the motion of particles through null and timelike geodesics in static BTZ space-time, observing asymptotic behaviors for null geodesics and parameter-dependent shifts in potential for timelike paths. The study concludes that modified gravity parameters significantly influence QNM frequencies and effective potential profiles, offering insights into black hole stability and suggesting that these theoretical predictions may be tested through gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Cooling of Neutron Stars through Emission of Neutrinos and Photons: Effects of Modified Gravity and Magnetic Field using TOV Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of dark matter has long been extensively studied in the past few decades. In this study, we investigate the emission of neutrinos and photons from neutron stars (NSs) by employing the modified theory of gravity and the corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) system of equations. The extreme matter density and magnetic field inside the NSs provide a unique laboratory for studying fundamental physics, including the interplay between gravity and quantum field effects. The impact of a strong magnetic field has also been incorporated into the corresponding TOV equations. We here attempt to see how neutrinos and photons emissions from these compact objects are impacted by the modified TOV equations due to modified theory of gravity; f(R,T) gravity or scalar-tensor theory and strong magnetic fields. Our analysis focuses on how these modifications influence the structure, cooling, and photon/neutrino luminosities of NS. We computed the surface temperature of NSs for normal Einstein gravity and modified gravity theories with and without magnetic field for three EoSs; namely APR, FPS and SLY. On comparison of our predicted values of surface temperature with the observed surface temperature for three NSs, we find that modified gravity along with inside magnetic field-based predictions shows reasonable agreement with the corresponding observed values.</description>

      <title>Going from 3D common-envelope simulations to fast 1D simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) methods for simulating the common-envelope (CE) phase offer advantages over three-dimensional (3D) simulations regarding their computational speed and feasibility. We present the 1D CE method from Bronner et al. (2024), including the results of the CE simulations of an asymptotic giant branch star donor. We further test this method in the massive star regime by computing the CE event of a red supergiant with a neutron-star mass and a black-hole mass companion. The 1D model can reproduce the orbital evolution and the envelope ejection from 3D simulations when choosing suitable values for the free parameters in the model. The best-fitting values differ from the expectations based on the low mass simulations, indicating that the free parameters depend on the structure of the giant star. The released recombination energy from hydrogen and helium helps to expand the envelope, similar to the low-mass CE simulations.</description>

      <title>X-raying CAMELS: Constraining Baryonic Feedback in the Circum-Galactic Medium with the CAMELS simulations and eRASS X-ray Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) around massive galaxies plays a crucial role in regulating star formation and feedback. Using the CAMELS simulation suite, we develop emulators for the X-ray surface brightness profile and the X-ray luminosity--stellar mass scaling relation to investigate how stellar and AGN feedback shape the X-ray properties of the hot CGM. Our analysis shows that at CGM scales ($10^{12} \lesssim M_{\rm halo}/M_\odot \lesssim 10^{13}$, $10\lesssim r/{\rm kpc} \lesssim 400$), stellar feedback more significantly impacts the X-ray properties than AGN feedback within the parameters studied. Comparing the emulators to recent eROSITA All-Sky Survey observations, it was found that stronger feedback than currently implemented in the IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, and Astrid simulations is required to match observed CGM properties. However, adopting these enhanced feedback parameters causes deviations in the stellar-mass-halo-mass relations from observational constraints below the group mass scale. This tension suggests possible unaccounted systematics in X-ray CGM observations or inadequacies in the feedback models of cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Consistent Description of Compact Stars of Two Interacting Fluids: The Case of Neutron Stars with Higgs Portal Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a thermodynamically consistent approach for the computation of the masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities of compact stars consisting of two interacting fluids with separately conserved quantum numbers. We apply this interacting fluid approach to the case of compact stars of neutron star matter with the Higgs portal fermionic dark matter model for the first time in a thermodynamically consistent manner. The patterns for the mass-radius curves and the tidal deformability depend on the dark matter particle mass and are different from former studies. Compared to ordinary neutron star properties, we obtain smaller masses and radii for dark matter particle masses similar to the nucleon mass and, hence, smaller tidal deformabilities as a result of the softening of the equation of state due to the presence of dark matter. For dark matter particle masses below the nucleon mass and sizable chemical potentials with respect to the dark matter particle mass, there will be a dark halo instead of dark core. Our investigation provides the basis for studying mergers of compact stars where the two fluids of neutron star matter and dark matter are coupled kinetically to each other and are described by one combined energy-momentum tensor of the two interacting fluids but are chemically different with two separately conserved number currents.</description>

      <title>Performance of iDQ ahead of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA's fourth observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave detectors used by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, and the Virgo Collaboration are incredibly sensitive instruments which frequently detect non-stationary, non-Gaussian noise transients. iDQ is a statistical inference framework which leverages the use of auxiliary degrees of freedom monitored in the detectors to identify such transients. In this work, we describe the improvements to the iDQ pipeline made between the third and fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration, and show the performance of these changes. We find that iDQ detects a total of 39,398 of the known 100,512 glitches identified by Omicron over the course of the second half of the third observing run. We construct a measure of the probability a glitch is present in the strain data of a given detector by combining information from iDQ and Omicron as well as extend the output of iDQ in a novel method which finds correlations between known glitch classifications, and auxiliary channels. We identify several channels over the course of O3b which frequently record instances of Scattered Light, Whistle, and Blip glitches and discuss use cases for this method in active observing runs.</description>

      <title>Tripling Fluctuations and Peaked Sound Speed in Fermionic Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A crossover involving three-fermion clusters is relevant to the hadron-quark crossover, which, if occurring in a neutron star, could naturally reproduce the dense-matter equation of state recently deduced from simultaneous observations of neutron-star masses and radii. To understand the crossover mechanism, we examine the role of tripling fluctuations induced by the formation of three-fermion clusters. The phase-shift representation of fluctuations manifests an interplay of bound and scattering states, leading to non-monotonic momentum distributions of baryon-like clusters and peaked sound speed at finite densities. We demonstrate them by applying our approach to a nonrelativistic system of one-dimensional three-color fermions analogous to the hadron-quark matter.</description>

      <title>X-ray/Radio Quasi-periodic Pulsations Associated with Plasmoids in Solar Flare Current Sheets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmoids (or magnetic islands) are believed to play an important role in the onset of fast magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration during solar flares and eruptions. Direct imaging of flare current sheets and formation/ejection of multiple plasmoids in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images, along with simultaneous X-ray and radio observations, offers significant insights into the mechanisms driving particle acceleration in solar flares. Here we present direct imaging of the formation and ejection of multiple plasmoids in flare plasma/current sheets and associated quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) observed in X-ray and radio wavelengths, using observations from SDO/AIA, RHESSI, and Fermi GBM. These plasmoids propagate bidirectionally upward and downward along the flare current sheet beneath the erupting flux rope during two successive flares associated with confined/failed eruptions. The flux rope exhibits evidence of helical kink instability with formation and ejection of multiple plasmoids in the flare current sheet, as predicted in an MHD simulation of a kink-unstable flux rope. RHESSI X-ray images show double coronal sources (``loop-top" and higher coronal sources) located at both ends of the flare current/plasma sheet. Moreover, we detected an additional transient faint X-ray source (6-12 keV) located between the double coronal sources, which was co-spatial with multiple plasmoids in the flare current sheet. X-ray (soft and hard) and radio (decimetric) observations unveil QPPs (periods$\approx$10-s and 100-s) associated with the ejection and coalescence of plasmoids. These observations suggest that energetic electrons are accelerated during the ejection and coalescence of multiple plasmoids in the flare current sheet.</description>

      <title>Masquerading hybrid stars with dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of dark matter on hybrid stars. Using a two-fluid approach, where normal and dark matter components interact only gravitationally, we explore how dark matter can trigger the appearance of quark matter in neutron stars for unprecedented low masses. Our findings reveal that dark matter increases the central pressure of neutron stars, potentially leading to the formation of hybrid stars with quark cores even at very low compact star masses. The critical mass for the appearance of quark matter decreases with increasing dark matter content. We introduce the concept of "masquerading hybrid stars", where dark matter admixed stars exhibit similar mass-radius relations to purely hadronic stars, making it challenging to distinguish between them based solely on these parameters. Additionally, we identify a unique class of objects termed "dark oysters", characterized by a large dark matter halo and a small normal matter core, highlighting the diverse structural possibilities for compact stars influenced by dark matter.</description>

Abstract: The imaging of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) and the supermassive black hole at the center of Messier 87 (M87*) by the Event Horizon Telescope constrains the location and nature of emission from these objects. Coupled with flux limits from the near-infrared through the ultraviolet, the attendant size constraints provide strong evidence for the absence of an accretion-powered photosphere, and therefore for the existence of an event horizon about an astrophysical black hole. Here, we demonstrate that a broad class of naked singularities exhibit inner turning points for time-like geodesics, and therefore may generically be excluded, regardless of the nature and unknown physical impact of singularity itself, subject to the single weak assumption that the its nongravitational impact is localized to its immediate vicinity. While we restrict our attention to static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, we are nevertheless able to exclude or constrain a large number of commonly invoked naked singularity spacetimes in this way.</description>

      <title>Difficulties of two exploding white dwarfs to account for type Ia supernovae with bimodal nebular emission profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a simple dynamical scheme to simulate the ejecta of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) scenarios with two exploding white dwarfs (WDs) and find that the velocity distribution of the ejecta has difficulties accounting for bimodal emission line profiles with a large separation between the two emission peaks. The essence of the dynamical code is in including the fact that the ejecta does not leave the system instantaneously. We find that the final separation velocity between the centers of masses of the two WDs' ejecta is ~80% of the pre-explosion WDs' orbital velocity, i.e., we find separation velocities of 4200-5400 km/s for two WDs of masses M1=M2=0.94 Mo. The lower separation velocities we find challenge scenarios with two exploding WDs to explain bimodal emission line profiles with observed velocity separations of up to ~7000 km/s. Only the mass in the ejecta of one WD with an explosion velocity lower than the separation velocity contributes to one peak of the bimodal profile; this is the inner ejecta. We find the inner ejecta to be only &lt;15% of the ejecta mass in energetic explosions. Less energetic explosions yield higher inner mass but lower separation velocities. We encourage searching for alternative explanations of bimodal line profiles.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Binaries Embedded Within Common Envelopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Triple stellar systems allow us to study stellar processes that cannot be attained in binary stars. The evolutionary phases in which the stellar members undergo mass exchanges can alter the hierarchical layout of these systems. Yet, the lack of a self-consistent treatment of common-envelope (CE) in triple star-systems hinders the comprehensive understanding of their long-term fate. This letter examines the conditions predicted around binaries embedded within CEs using local 3D hydrodynamical simulations. We explore varying the initial binary separation, the flow Mach number, and the background stellar density gradients as informed by a wide array of CE conditions, including those invoked to explain the formation of the triple system hosting PSR J0337+1715. We find that the stellar density gradient governs the gaseous drag force, which determines the final configuration of the embedded binary. We observe a comparable net drag force on the center of mass but an overall reduction in the accretion rate of the binary compared to the single object case. We find that for most CE conditions, and in contrast to the uniform background density case, the binary orbital separation increases with time, softening the binary and preventing it from subsequently merging. We conclude that binaries spiraling within CEs become more vulnerable to be disrupted by tidal interactions. This can have profound implications on the final outcomes of triple star-systems.</description>

      <title>Investigating tidal heating in neutron stars via gravitational Raman scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a scattering amplitude formalism to study the tidal heating effects of nonspinning neutron stars incorporating both worldline effective field theory and relativistic stellar perturbation theory. In neutron stars, tidal heating arises from fluid viscosity due to various scattering processes in the interior. It also serves as a channel for the exchange of energy and angular momentum between the neutron star and its environment. In the interior of the neutron star, we first derive two master perturbation equations that capture fluid perturbations accurate to linear order in frequency. Remarkably, these equations receive no contribution from bulk viscosity due to a peculiar adiabatic incompressibility which arises in stellar fluid for non-barotropic perturbations. In the exterior, the metric perturbations reduce to the Regge-Wheeler (RW) equation which we solve using the analytical Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) method. We compute the amplitude for gravitational waves scattering off a neutron star, also known as gravitational Raman scattering. From the amplitude, we obtain expressions for the electric quadrupolar static Love number and the leading dissipation number to all orders in compactness. We then compute the leading dissipation number for various realistic equation-of-state(s) and estimate the change in the number of gravitational wave cycles due to tidal heating during inspiral in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) band.</description>
