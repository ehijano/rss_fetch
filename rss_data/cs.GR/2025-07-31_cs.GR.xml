      <title>Text-Driven Video Style Transfer with State-Space Models: Extending StyleMamba for Temporal Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: StyleMamba has recently demonstrated efficient text-driven image style transfer by leveraging state-space models (SSMs) and masked directional losses. In this paper, we extend the StyleMamba framework to handle video sequences. We propose new temporal modules, including a \emph{Video State-Space Fusion Module} to model inter-frame dependencies and a novel \emph{Temporal Masked Directional Loss} that ensures style consistency while addressing scene changes and partial occlusions. Additionally, we introduce a \emph{Temporal Second-Order Loss} to suppress abrupt style variations across consecutive frames. Our experiments on DAVIS and UCF101 show that the proposed approach outperforms competing methods in terms of style consistency, smoothness, and computational efficiency. We believe our new framework paves the way for real-time text-driven video stylization with state-of-the-art perceptual results.</description>

      <title>Controllable Segmentation-Based Text-Guided Style Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for controllable, region-specific style editing driven by textual prompts. Building upon the state-space style alignment framework introduced by \emph{StyleMamba}, our method integrates a semantic segmentation model into the style transfer pipeline. This allows users to selectively apply text-driven style changes to specific segments (e.g., ``turn the building into a cyberpunk tower'') while leaving other regions (e.g., ``people'' or ``trees'') unchanged. By incorporating region-wise condition vectors and a region-specific directional loss, our method achieves high-fidelity transformations that respect both semantic boundaries and user-driven style descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can flexibly handle complex scene stylizations in real-world scenarios, improving control and quality over purely global style transfer methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Prompt Style Interpolation for Fine-Grained Artistic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-driven image style transfer has seen remarkable progress with methods leveraging cross-modal embeddings for fast, high-quality stylization. However, most existing pipelines assume a \emph{single} textual style prompt, limiting the range of artistic control and expressiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel \emph{multi-prompt style interpolation} framework that extends the recently introduced \textbf{StyleMamba} approach. Our method supports blending or interpolating among multiple textual prompts (eg, ``cubism,'' ``impressionism,'' and ``cartoon''), allowing the creation of nuanced or hybrid artistic styles within a \emph{single} image. We introduce a \textit{Multi-Prompt Embedding Mixer} combined with \textit{Adaptive Blending Weights} to enable fine-grained control over the spatial and semantic influence of each style. Further, we propose a \emph{Hierarchical Masked Directional Loss} to refine region-specific style consistency. Experiments and user studies confirm our approach outperforms single-prompt baselines and naive linear combinations of styles, achieving superior style fidelity, text-image alignment, and artistic flexibility, all while maintaining the computational efficiency offered by the state-space formulation.</description>

      <title>ReverBERT: A State Space Model for Efficient Text-Driven Speech Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-driven speech style transfer aims to mold the intonation, pace, and timbre of a spoken utterance to match stylistic cues from text descriptions. While existing methods leverage large-scale neural architectures or pre-trained language models, the computational costs often remain high. In this paper, we present \emph{ReverBERT}, an efficient framework for text-driven speech style transfer that draws inspiration from a state space model (SSM) paradigm, loosely motivated by the image-based method of Wang and Liu~\cite{wang2024stylemamba}. Unlike image domain techniques, our method operates in the speech space and integrates a discrete Fourier transform of latent speech features to enable smooth and continuous style modulation. We also propose a novel \emph{Transformer-based SSM} layer for bridging textual style descriptors with acoustic attributes, dramatically reducing inference time while preserving high-quality speech characteristics. Extensive experiments on benchmark speech corpora demonstrate that \emph{ReverBERT} significantly outperforms baselines in terms of naturalness, expressiveness, and computational efficiency. We release our model and code publicly to foster further research in text-driven speech style transfer.</description>

      <title>Distance and Collision Probability Estimation from Gaussian Surface Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes continuous-space methodologies to estimate the collision probability, Euclidean distance and gradient between an ellipsoidal robot model and an environment surface modeled as a set of Gaussian distributions. Continuous-space collision probability estimation is critical for uncertainty-aware motion planning. Most collision detection and avoidance approaches assume the robot is modeled as a sphere, but ellipsoidal representations provide tighter approximations and enable navigation in cluttered and narrow spaces. State-of-the-art methods derive the Euclidean distance and gradient by processing raw point clouds, which is computationally expensive for large workspaces. Recent advances in Gaussian surface modeling (e.g. mixture models, splatting) enable compressed and high-fidelity surface representations. Few methods exist to estimate continuous-space occupancy from such models. They require Gaussians to model free space and are unable to estimate the collision probability, Euclidean distance and gradient for an ellipsoidal robot. The proposed methods bridge this gap by extending prior work in ellipsoid-to-ellipsoid Euclidean distance and collision probability estimation to Gaussian surface models. A geometric blending approach is also proposed to improve collision probability estimation. The approaches are evaluated with numerical 2D and 3D experiments using real-world point cloud data. Methods for efficient calculation of these quantities are demonstrated to execute within a few microseconds per ellipsoid pair using a single-thread on low-power CPUs of modern embedded computers</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal State-Space Graph Reasoning for Structured Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to extract compact, meaningful summaries from large-scale and multimodal data is critical for numerous applications, ranging from video analytics to medical reports. Prior methods in cross-modal summarization have often suffered from high computational overheads and limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose a \textit{Cross-Modal State-Space Graph Reasoning} (\textbf{CSS-GR}) framework that incorporates a state-space model with graph-based message passing, inspired by prior work on efficient state-space models. Unlike existing approaches relying on purely sequential models, our method constructs a graph that captures inter- and intra-modal relationships, allowing more holistic reasoning over both textual and visual streams. We demonstrate that our approach significantly improves summarization quality and interpretability while maintaining computational efficiency, as validated on standard multimodal summarization benchmarks. We also provide a thorough ablation study to highlight the contributions of each component.</description>

      <title>Text-Driven Voice Conversion via Latent State-Space Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-driven voice conversion allows customization of speaker characteristics and prosodic elements using textual descriptions. However, most existing methods rely heavily on direct text-to-speech training, limiting their flexibility in controlling nuanced style elements or timbral features. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{Latent State-Space} approach for text-driven voice conversion (\textbf{LSS-VC}). Our method treats each utterance as an evolving dynamical system in a continuous latent space. Drawing inspiration from mamba, which introduced a state-space model for efficient text-driven \emph{image} style transfer, we adapt a loosely related methodology for \emph{voice} style transformation. Specifically, we learn a voice latent manifold where style and content can be manipulated independently by textual style prompts. We propose an adaptive cross-modal fusion mechanism to inject style information into the voice latent representation, enabling interpretable and fine-grained control over speaker identity, speaking rate, and emphasis. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms recent baselines in both subjective and objective quality metrics, while offering smoother transitions between styles, reduced artifacts, and more precise text-based style control.</description>

      <title>Signed Higher-Order Interactions for Brain Disorder Diagnosis via Multi-Channel Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately characterizing higher-order interactions of brain regions and extracting interpretable organizational patterns from Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data is crucial for brain disease diagnosis. Current graph-based deep learning models primarily focus on pairwise or triadic patterns while neglecting signed higher-order interactions, limiting comprehensive understanding of brain-wide communication. We propose HOI-Brain, a novel computational framework leveraging signed higher-order interactions and organizational patterns in fMRI data for brain disease diagnosis. First, we introduce a co-fluctuation measure based on Multiplication of Temporal Derivatives to detect higher-order interactions with temporal resolution. We then distinguish positive and negative synergistic interactions, encoding them in signed weighted simplicial complexes to reveal brain communication insights. Using Persistent Homology theory, we apply two filtration processes to these complexes to extract signed higher-dimensional neural organizations spatiotemporally. Finally, we propose a multi-channel brain Transformer to integrate heterogeneous topological features. Experiments on Alzheimer' s disease, Parkinson' s syndrome, and autism spectrum disorder datasets demonstrate our framework' s superiority, effectiveness, and interpretability. The identified key brain regions and higher-order patterns align with neuroscience literature, providing meaningful biological insights.</description>
