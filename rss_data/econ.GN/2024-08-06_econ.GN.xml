      <title>Are EU low-carbon structural funds efficient in reducing emissions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of the ``low-carbon economy'' expenditures from European Structural and Investment Funds in fostering reductions in greenhouse gas emissions within European regions, focusing on the 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 programme periods. By decomposing emissions time series into trend and cycle components and considering them within a panel data framework, our research highlights that the impacts of low-carbon economy expenditures vary, qualitatively and quantitatively, with the targeted regions' development level. We find significant emissions reductions in developed and transition regions yet less favourable outcomes in less developed areas. Further analysis into specific greenhouse gas emissions types (CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and N$_2$O) reveals inconsistent impacts, underscoring the complexity of achieving emissions reductions. Our findings emphasise the need for tailored environmental strategies that accommodate the economic disparities of regions in the European Union.</description>

      <title>Modeling the impact of Climate transition on real estate prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a model to quantify the impact of the climate transition on a property in housing market. We begin by noting that property is an asset in an economy. That economy is organized in sectors, driven by its productivity which is a multidimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, while the climate transition is declined thanks to the carbon price, a continuous deterministic process. We then extend the sales comparison approach and the income approach to valuate an energy inefficient real estate asset. We obtain its value as the difference between the price of an equivalent efficient building following an exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck as well as the actualized renovation costs and the actualized sum of the future additional energy costs. These costs are due to the inefficiency of the building, before an optimal renovation date which depends on the carbon price process. Finally, we carry out simulations based on the French economy and the house price index of France. Our results allow to conclude that the order of magnitude of the depreciation obtained by our model is the same as the empirical observations.</description>

      <title>The international forward guidance transmission under a global liquidity trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.12503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper quantitatively explores the interaction effect of forward guidance (FG) on international monetary policy transmission using a standard two-country new Keynesian model with a global liquidity trap. First, we show that the magnitude of the constant risk aversion coefficient (CRRA) is important in determining the beggar-thy-neighbor and prosper-thy-neighbor effects in foreign economies when the home country only faces the zero lower bound (ZLB) constraints. Second,we demonstrate that both countries may benefit from adopting only the home country's FG policies if the home central bank only faces the ZLB. Third, we find the potential benefit of the FG interaction effect between two countries. Thus, we document the possibility that home and foreign central banks can benefit from monetary policy coordination by adopting the same duration of FG quarters.</description>

      <title>The Inflation Attention Threshold and Inflation Surges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the outbreak of the recent inflation surge, the public's attention to inflation was low but increased quickly once inflation started to rise. In this paper, I quantify when and by how much the public's attention to inflation changes, and derive the macroeconomic implications of these attention changes. I estimate an attention threshold at an inflation rate of about $4%$, and that attention doubles when inflation exceeds this threshold. Adverse supply shocks become more inflationary in times of high attention, and the increase in people's attention to inflation in 2021 accounts for half of the subsequent supply-driven inflation. I develop a model accounting for the attention threshold and show that shocks that are usually short lived lead to a persistent surge in inflation if they induce an increase in people's attention. The attention threshold further lengthens the last mile of disinflation after an inflation surge, and leads to an asymmetry in the dynamics of inflation.</description>

      <title>Medical Research as a Productivity Indicator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent literature contends that the returns to research in medicine are declining. This conclusion is premised on two empirical findings: the quantity of medical research is rising, while improvements in health outcomes are stagnant. We argue that the first finding is an artifact of conceptual and empirical problems in the measurement of research. We propose a method for annotating unstructured text based on fine-tuning a large language model. We apply this method to construct a census of published clinical trials. We argue that clinical trials function as a natural proxy for productivity-relevant research in medicine. In our data, the quantity, quality, and composition of clinical trials have been stable since 2010. We find that measured increases in the total quantity of medical research are driven by shifts in the composition of scientific publications that do not correspond to real increases in the quantity of productivity-relevant research. We document large increases in the growth of non-trial publications, driven by publications from China and publications that review existing literature. This increase in quantity is coincident with a decline in various measures of average publication quality. Taken together, we find no support for declining medical research productivity over this period.</description>

      <title>Data Analysis of Decision Support for Sustainable Welfare in The Presence of GDP Threshold Effects: A Case Study of Interactive Data Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy usage and GDP have been the subject of numerous studies over the past decades. It has been overlooked by previous studies that energy consumption correlates with economic growth in relation to GDP. This study uses threshold regression and Granger causality testing to identify GDP-dependent causality in ten OECD countries over the last 10 years. There is a significant correlation between economic growth and energy consumption. Energy consumption and short-term economic growth are statistically significantly correlated. There is a significant positive effect of energy consumption (EC) on GDP in the short run below the threshold of $10,936 USD since the coefficient is 3.34 and the p-value is 0.0252. There is a -0.0127-correlation coefficient and a 0.0327 p-value associated with GDP Granger-cause EC over the long run. EC and GDP are not causally related for GDP per capita above $10,936 USD. In the long run, GDP Granger causes EC with a coefficient of -0.1638 and a p-value of 0.0675. According to the study, sustainable development requires sustainable use of natural resources, technological investment, foreign direct investment, and gross fixed capital formation. Economic growth can be boosted while adhering to sustainability goals by implementing these recommendations.</description>
