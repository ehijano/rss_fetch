      <title>Semi-analytical pricing of American options with hybrid dividends via integral equations and the GIT method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a semi-analytical method for pricing American options on assets (stocks, ETFs) that pay discrete and/or continuous dividends. The problem is notoriously complex because discrete dividends create abrupt price drops and affect the optimal exercise timing, making traditional continuous-dividend models unsuitable. Our approach utilizes the Generalized Integral Transform (GIT) method introduced by the author and his co-authors in a number of papers, which transforms the pricing problem from a complex partial differential equation with a free boundary into an integral Volterra equation of the second or first kind. In this paper we illustrate this approach by considering a popular GBM model that accounts for discrete cash and proportional dividends using Dirac delta functions. By reframing the problem as an integral equation, we can sequentially solve for the option price and the early exercise boundary, effectively handling the discontinuities caused by the dividends. Our methodology provides a powerful alternative to standard numerical techniques like binomial trees or finite difference methods, which can struggle with the jump conditions of discrete dividends by losing accuracy or performance. Several examples demonstrate that the GIT method is highly accurate and computationally efficient, bypassing the need for extensive computational grids or complex backward induction steps.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Convergence for Variational Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an approach to applying neural networks on linear parabolic variational inequalities. We use loss functions that directly incorporate the variational inequality on the whole domain to bypass the need to determine the stopping region in advance and prove the existence of neural networks whose losses converge to zero. We also prove the functional convergence in the Sobolev space. We then apply our approach to solving an optimal investment and stopping problem in finance. By leveraging duality, we convert the nonlinear HJB-type variational inequality of the primal problem into a linear variational inequality of the dual problem and prove the convergence of the primal value function from the dual neural network solution, an outcome made possible by our Sobolev norm analysis. We illustrate the versatility and accuracy of our method with numerical examples for both power and non-HARA utilities as well as high-dimensional American put option pricing. Our results underscore the potential of neural networks for solving variational inequalities in optimal stopping and control problems.</description>

      <title>On the hidden costs of passive investing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Passive investing has gained immense popularity due to its low fees and the perceived simplicity of focusing on zero tracking error, rather than security selection. However, our analysis shows that the passive (zero tracking error) approach of waiting until the market close on the day of index reconstitution to purchase a stock (that was announced days earlier as an upcoming addition) results in costs amounting to hundreds of basis points compared to strategies that involve gradually acquiring a small portion of the required shares in advance with minimal additional tracking errors. In addition, we show that under all scenarios analyzed, a trader who builds a small inventory post-announcement and provides liquidity at the reconstitution event can consistently earn several hundreds of basis points in profit and often much more, assuming minimal risk.</description>
