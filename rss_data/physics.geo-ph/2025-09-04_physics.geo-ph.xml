      <title>A Dataset of Weather Station-Scale Photosynthetic Phenology in Mid- to High-Latitude Regions of the Northern Hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study extracted photosynthetic phenology indicators (SOS, POS, EOS) from daily GPP data at the weather-station scale for the mid- to high-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere from 2001 to 2019. The resulting dataset covers nearly 60,000 site-years, with more than 1,000 stations maintaining complete 19-year records. Results reveal pronounced spatial variability, with distinct trends across vegetation types and aridity zones. Compared with flux networks and satellite-based products, this dataset greatly enhances data availability for phenology studies and provides a solid foundation for assessing the impacts of local hydrothermal conditions and extreme climate events on phenology.</description>

      <title>Pore-scale insights into the role of micro fractures on permeability of fractured porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractures play a critical role in governing fluid flow within subsurface energy systems, including oil and gas production, geologic carbon sequestration, and underground hydrogen storage. This study investigated the impact of pore-scale fractures on fluid flow and permeability in fractured porous media. The analysis focused on a single fracture embedded within a porous medium. Fluid flow was simulated using the lattice Boltzmann method, and the effects of fracture length, width, and orientation angle on permeability were systematically examined. Results showed that increasing both fracture length and width enhanced permeability. Additionally, fractures oriented more closely to the flow direction (i.e., smaller orientation angles) resulted in higher permeability. Interestingly, when the orientation angle approached 90{\deg}, the presence of a fracture could reduce the overall permeability of the porous medium. A critical orientation angle was identified, beyond which the fracture decreased permeability; this critical angle was found to increase with fracture width. Permeability tensors were also fitted to determine the critical angle and quantify the influence of fracture width on the critical orientation angle. These findings provide new insights into the role of microfractures in controlling permeability, with important implications for subsurface energy systems.</description>

      <title>The Transparent Earth: A Multimodal Foundation Model for the Earth's Subsurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Transparent Earth, a transformer-based architecture for reconstructing subsurface properties from heterogeneous datasets that vary in sparsity, resolution, and modality, where each modality represents a distinct type of observation (e.g., stress angle, mantle temperature, tectonic plate type). The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on Earth.</description>
