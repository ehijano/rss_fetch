      <title>We must re-evaluate assumptions about carbon trading for effective climate change mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective climate action depends on dismantling the assumptions and oversimplifications that have become the basis of climate policy. The assumption that greenhouse gases (GHG) are fungible and the use of single-point values in normalizing GHG species to CO2-equivalents can propagate inaccuracies in carbon accounting and have already led to failures of carbon offset systems. Separate emission reduction targets and tracking by GHG species are recommended to achieve long-term climate stabilization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note observes that the Cobb-Douglas function is uniquely characterized by the property that, if the labour share of cost for a constant-returns-to-scale firm remains constant when the firm minimizes its cost for any given output level, then the firm's production function must be Cobb-Douglas.</description>

      <title>Estimating Variability in Hospital Charges: The Case of Cesarean Section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study sought to better understand the causes of price disparity in cesarean sections, using newly released hospital data. Beginning January 1, 2021, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requires hospitals functioning in the United States to publish online pricing information for items and services these hospitals provide in a machine-readable format and a consumer friendly shoppable format. Initial analyses of these data have shown that the price for a given procedure can differ in a hospital and across hospitals. The cesarean section (C-section) is one of the most common inpatient procedures performed across all hospitals in the United States as of 2018. This preliminary study found that for C-section procedures, pricing varied from as little as \$162 to as high as \$115,483 for a single procedure. Overall, indicators for quality and whether or not the hospital was a teaching hospital were found to be significantly significant, while variables including median income and the gini coefficient for wealth inequality were not shown to be statistically significant.</description>

      <title>How Transit Countries Become Refugee Destinations: Insights from Central and Eastern Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores how refugees' destination preferences evolve during transit, with a focus on Central and Eastern Europe, particularly Romania. Using a mixed-methods approach, we analyse data from the International Organization for Migration's (IOM) Flow Monitoring Surveys and complement it with qualitative insights from focus group discussions with refugees. The quantitative analysis reveals that refugees' preferences for destination countries often change during transit, influenced by factors such as safety concerns, asylum conditions, education, and the presence of relatives at the destination. Our results support the application of bounded rationality and human capital theory, showing that while economic opportunities are important, safety becomes the dominant concern during transit. The qualitative analysis adds depth to these findings, highlighting the role of political instability, social networks, and economic hardships as initial migration drivers. Additionally, the study reveals how refugees reassess their destination choices based on their experiences in transit countries, with Romania emerging as a viable settlement destination due to its relative stability and access to asylum procedures. This research contributes to migration studies by challenging the traditional view of transit countries and offering new insights into the fluid nature of refugee decision-making.</description>

      <title>Complementing Carbon Credits from Forest-Related Activities with Biodiversity Insurance and Resilience Value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon credits are a key component of most national and organizational climate strategies. Financing and delivering carbon credits from forest-related activities faces multiple risks at the project and asset levels. Financial mechanisms are employed to mitigate risks for investors and project developers, complemented by non-financial measures such as environmental and social safeguards and physical risk mitigation. Despite these efforts, academic research highlights that safeguards and climate risk mitigation measures are not efficiently implemented in some carbon projects and that specification of environmental safeguards remains underdeveloped. Further, environmental and social risk mitigation capacities may not be integrated into financial mechanisms. This text examines how ecosystem capacities can be leveraged and valued for mitigation of and adaptation to physical risks by complementing carbon credits with biodiversity insurance and resilience value.</description>

      <title>Does the Gini index represent people's views on inequality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents findings from a web-experiment on a representative sample of the French population. It examines the acceptability of the Pigou-Dalton principle of transfers, which posits that transferring income from an individual to a relatively poorer one, reduces overall inequality. While up to 60% of respondents reject standard transfers, the three alternative transfers we test receive more approval, especially those promoting solidarity among lower-income recipients. The study then models respondents' preferences with two types of social welfare functions, utilitarian and Extended Gini. The Extended Gini model aligns better with individual preferences. Nevertheless, Extended Gini-type social welfare functions that adhere to the principle of transfers (including the one underlying the Gini index) poorly capture preferences of each individual. However, quite surprisingly, the preferences of the median individual align almost perfectly with the Gini-based function, using either parametric or non-parametric estimates.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Algorithm for Finite-Horizon Stochastic Control Problems in Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning algorithm for solving finite-horizon stochastic control problems based on a deep neural network representation of the optimal policy functions. The algorithm has three features: (1) It can solve high-dimensional (e.g., over 100 dimensions) and finite-horizon time-inhomogeneous stochastic control problems. (2) It has a monotonicity of performance improvement in each iteration, leading to good convergence properties. (3) It does not rely on the Bellman equation. To demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm, it is applied to solve various finite-horizon time-inhomogeneous problems including recursive utility optimization under a stochastic volatility model, a multi-sector stochastic growth, and optimal control under a dynamic stochastic integration of climate and economy model with eight-dimensional state vectors and 600 time periods.</description>

      <title>The Structure of the U.S. Income Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I show that U.S. incomes follow a one-parameter family of probability distributions over more than fifty years of data. I compare statistical models of income, and I highlight the inverse-gamma distribution as a parsimonious model that matches data particularly well and has straightforward theoretical interpretations. However, despite having relatively few parameters, the inverse-gamma distribution still overfits income data. I establish a linear relationship between parameter estimates, and a one-dimensional model emerges naturally when I exploit this relationship. I conclude with theoretical remarks about the model.</description>

      <title>How Wash Traders Exploit Market Conditions in Cryptocurrency Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wash trading, the practice of simultaneously placing buy and sell orders for the same asset to inflate trading volume, has been prevalent in cryptocurrency markets. This paper investigates whether wash traders in Bitcoin act deliberately to exploit market conditions and identifies the characteristics of such manipulative behavior. Using a unique dataset of 18 million transactions from Mt. Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange, I find that wash trading intensifies when legitimate trading volume is low and diminishes when it is high, indicating strategic timing to maximize impact in less liquid markets. The activity also exhibits spillover effects across platforms and decreases when trading volumes in other asset classes like stocks or gold rise, suggesting sensitivity to broader market dynamics. Additionally, wash traders exploit periods of heightened media attention and online rumors to amplify their influence, causing rapid but short-lived spikes in legitimate trading volume. Using an exogenous demand shock associated with illicit online marketplaces, I find that wash trading responds to contemporaneous events affecting Bitcoin demand. These results advance the understanding of manipulative practices in digital currency markets and have significant implications for regulators aiming to detect and prevent wash trading.</description>

      <title>Strategic Responses to Personalized Pricing and Demand for Privacy: An Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider situations where consumers are aware that a statistical model determines the price of a product based on their observed behavior. Using a novel experiment varying the context similarity between participant data and a product, we find that participants manipulate their responses to a survey about personal characteristics, and manipulation is more successful when the contexts are similar. Moreover, participants demand less privacy, and make less optimal privacy choices when the contexts are less similar. Our findings highlight the importance of data privacy policies in the age of big data, where behavior in seemingly unrelated contexts might affect prices.</description>

      <title>How Periodic Forecast Updates Influence MRP Planning Parameters: A Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many supply chains, the current efforts at digitalization have led to improved information exchanges between manufacturers and their customers. Specifically, demand forecasts are often provided by the customers and regularly updated as the related customer information improves. In this paper, we investigate the influence of forecast updates on the production planning method of Material Requirements Planning (MRP). A simulation study was carried out to assess how updates in information affect the setting of planning parameters in a rolling horizon MRP planned production system. An intuitive result is that information updates lead to disturbances in the production orders for the MRP standard, and, therefore, an extension for MRP to mitigate these effects is developed. A large numerical simulation experiment shows that the MRP safety stock exploitation heuristic, that has been developed, leads to significantly improved results as far as inventory and backorder costs are concerned. An interesting result is that the fixed-order-quantity lotsizing policy performs - in most instances - better than the fixed-order-period lotsizing policy, when periodic forecast updates occur. In addition, the simulation study shows that underestimating demand is marginally more costly than overestimating it, based on the comparative analysis of all instances. Furthermore, the results indicate that the MRP safety stock exploitation heuristic can mitigate the negative effects of biased forecasts.</description>

      <title>How Gender and Birth Order Affect Educational attainment Inequality within-Families: Evidence from Benin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines how gender, birth order, and innate ability shape within-household disparities in children's educational attainment in developing countries. Using data from Benin, I find that in households with non-educated parents, gender and birth order drive over two-thirds of the average educational attainment disparities among adult children, while their influence decreases to one-third in households with college-educated parents. Furthermore, average inequality, measured by the range of children's educational attainment is twice as high among non-educated parents compared to college-educated parents. I propose and estimate a structural model of educational attainment choices within-family. Using the model, I show that the absence of gender and birth order effects does not lead to a significant reduction in the average within-family disparities in children's educational attainment. Additionally, in theory, ensuring that every child has at least one year of education lowers average within-family educational inequality. Yet, even in this scenario, daughters tend to receive less education than sons, and practical efforts to achieve universal entry are less effective than the theoretical model.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Economists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning provides powerful methods to impute structured information from large-scale, unstructured text and image datasets. For example, economists might wish to detect the presence of economic activity in satellite images, or to measure the topics or entities mentioned in social media, the congressional record, or firm filings. This review introduces deep neural networks, covering methods such as classifiers, regression models, generative AI, and embedding models. Applications include classification, document digitization, record linkage, and methods for data exploration in massive scale text and image corpora. When suitable methods are used, deep learning models can be cheap to tune and can scale affordably to problems involving millions or billions of data points.. The review is accompanied by a companion website, EconDL, with user-friendly demo notebooks, software resources, and a knowledge base that provides technical details and additional applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the association between generative AI (GAI) tool adoption and security operations center productivity. We find that GAI adoption is associated with a 30.13% reduction in security incident mean time to resolution. This result is robust to several modeling decisions. While unobserved confounders inhibit causal identification, this result is among the first to use observational data from live operations to investigate the relationship between GAI adoption and security worker productivity.</description>

      <title>Workers as Partners: a Theory of Responsible Firms in Labor Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework analyzing responsible firms (REFs) that prioritize worker welfare alongside profits in labor markets with search frictions. At the micro level, REFs' use of market power varies with labor conditions: they refrain from using it in slack markets but may exercise it in tight markets without harming workers. Our macro analysis shows these firms offer higher wages, creating a distinct high-wage sector. When firms endogenously choose worker bargaining power, there is a trade-off between worker surplus and employment, though this improves with elastic labor supply. While REFs cannot survive with free entry, they can coexist with profit-maximizing firms under limited competition, where their presence forces ordinary firms to raise wages.</description>
