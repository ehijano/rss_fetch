      <title>A microscopic realization of dS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a precise duality between pure de Sitter quantum gravity in 2+1 dimensions and a double-scaled matrix integral. This duality unfolds in two distinct aspects. First, by carefully quantizing the gravitational phase space, we arrive at a novel proposal for the quantum state of the universe at future infinity. We compute cosmological correlators of massive particles in the universe specified by this wavefunction. Integrating these correlators over the metric at future infinity yields gauge-invariant observables, which are identified with the string amplitudes of the complex Liouville string arXiv:2409.17246. This establishes a direct connection between integrated cosmological correlators and the resolvents of the matrix integral dual to the complex Liouville string, thereby demonstrating one aspect of the dS$_3$/matrix integral duality. The second aspect concerns the cosmological horizon of the dS static patch and the Gibbons-Hawking entropy it is conjectured to encode. We show that this entropy can be reproduced exactly by counting the entries of the matrix.</description>

      <title>Algebraic perturbation theory: traversable wormholes and generalized entropy beyond subleading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crossed product has recently emerged as an important tool in high-energy theory. We combine this with another powerful tool, namely pertubation theory, and study the crossed product algebra of a system under a deformation, relating the structure of deformed observables to that of the undeformed theory. In particular, we derive the change in the von Neumann entropy of the type II algebras, and demonstrate that our approach allows one to formally compute this to arbitrarily high orders in perturbation theory. As a concrete example, we apply this machinery to the case of a double-trace deformation of the thermofield double state in AdS/CFT, which is dual to a traversable wormhole in the bulk, obtaining several new contributions to the generalized entropy relative to the original work by Gao, Jafferis, and Wall. We comment on the relevance of this framework for black hole evaporation and interiors, as well as on the applicability of the algebraic approach to quantum gravity more generally.</description>

      <title>More on unconstrained descriptions of Higher Spin Massless Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we suggest a new local action describing arbitrary integer spin-$s$ massless particles in terms of only two symmetric fields $\varphi $ and $\alpha$ of rank-$s$ and $(s-3)$ respectively. It is an unconstrained version of the Fronsdal theory where the double traceless constraint on the physical field is evaded via a rank-$(s-4)$ Weyl like symmetry. The constrained higher spin diffeomorphism is enlarged to full diffeomorphism via the Stueckelberg field $\alpha$ through an appropriate field redefinition. After a partial gauge fixing where the Weyl symmetry is broken while preserving diffeomorphisms, the field equations reproduce, for arbitrary integer spin-$s$, diffeomorphism invariant equations of motion previously obtained via a truncation of the spectrum of the open bosonic string field theory in the tensionless limit. In the $s=4$ case we show that the functional integration over $\alpha$ leads to a unique non local Weyl and diffeomorphism invariant action given only in terms of the physical field $\varphi$ whose spectrum is confirmed via an analysis of the analytic structure of the spin-4 propagator for which we introduce a complete basis of projection and transition non local differential operators. We also show that the elimination of $\alpha$ after the Weyl gauge fixing leads to a non local diffeomorphism invariant action previously obtained in the literature.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Casimir effect at finite temperature in Horava-Lifshitz theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, I study the finite temperature Casimir effect due to a massless fermion field that violates Lorentz invariance according to the Horava-Lifshitz theory. I investigate a fermion field that obeys MIT bag boundary conditions on a pair of parallel plates. I carry out this study using the generalized zeta function technique that enables me to obtain the Helmholtz free energy and the Casimir pressure when the Casimir plates are in thermal equilibrium with a heat reservoir at finite temperature. I investigate the cases when the parameter associated with the violation of Lorentz invariance is even or odd and the limits of low and high temperature relative to the inverse of plate distance, examining all possible combinations of the above quantities. In all scenarios studied, I obtain simple and accurate analytic expressions of the free energy and the temperature-dependent Casimir pressure.</description>

      <title>Scrambling in charged hairy black holes and the Kasner interior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze how the axion parameter, the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar coupling constant, and charge density from Maxwell field affect the chaotic feature of a charged hairy black hole, as characterized by the quantum Lyapunov exponent. Due to relevant deformation in the boundary theory coming from a scalar bulk field, the bulk solution flows into more general Kasner spacetime in the interior of the black hole, near the singularity. We inject charged shock waves from the asymptotic boundary and calculate the out-of-time-ordered correlators holographically, which can probe chaos. The ratio of the quantum Lyapunov exponent with respect to the surface gravity is reduced as the deformation parameter increased, while the Lyapunov exponent of the deformed geometry can be greater than the axion Reissner-Nordstr\"om case when the deformation parameter is large enough. We also study how this deformation, along with the added parameters, affect other chaotic properties such as the butterfly velocity and the scrambling time delay. Furthermore, we also analyze the region where Kasner spacetime undergoes Kasner inversion/transition deeper inside the black hole.</description>

      <title>The ordered phase of charged N=4 SYM plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently is has been shown \cite{Gladden:2024ssb} that strongly coupled ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma with diagonal $U(1)$ $R$-charge chemical potential is unstable at $\frac{\mu}{2\pi T}=\sqrt{2}$. We construct a new homogeneous and isotropic phase of this plasma that dominates in the microcanonical ensemble (but not in the grand canonical one). The new phase extends to arbitrary high temperatures, \ie as $T\gg \mu$, and is characterized by an expectation value of a dimension-2 operator, with ${\cal O}_2\propto T^2$ -- it is the {\it ordered conformal phase}. In the limit $\frac\mu T\to 0$, this ordered phase has vanishing energy density $\frac{{\cal E}}{T^4}\propto \frac{\mu^2}{T^2}$ and is a low entropy density state $\frac{{\cal S}}{T^3}\propto \frac{\mu}{T}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a light and short review on the geometry of hypermultiplets coupled to supergravity and its appearance in string theory. As is long known, the target space of the hypermultiplet sigma-model is a quaternion-K\"ahler (QK) manifold of negative scalar curvature. We review some aspects of hypermultiplet moduli spaces, but also study aspects of QK-geometries in relation to the swampland, including some concrete examples of swampland QK-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Quasi-topological fractons: a 3D dipolar gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the theory of a generic rank-2 tensor field in three spacetime dimensions, which involves a symmetric tensor field transforming under infinitesimal diffeomorphisms, and a vector field, whose gauge transformation depends on a local vector parameter. The gauge fixing shows a non-trivial structure, and some non-intuitive possibilities are listed. Despite the fact that the theory is not topological, the energy-momentum tensor vanishes on-shell, which justifies the quasi-topological appellation we give to this theory. We show that the theory has three degrees of freedom. Moreover we find an interesting physical interpretation, which consists in a generalized planar electromagnetism and in the emergence of two vector charges with restricted mobility. These are typical fractonic behaviours which can be related to the so called traceless scalar and vector charge theories.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces and breather dynamics of analytic solutions in chiral magnets without Heisenberg exchange interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the special case of the chiral magnet with vanishing Heisenberg exchange energy, whose axisymmetric Skyrmion solution has previously been found. The dynamical equations of this model look like inviscid fluid flow, and by investigating path-lines of this flow we can construct explicit static and dynamic solutions. We find an infinite-dimensional family of static Skyrmions that are related to the axisymmetric Skyrmion by co-ordinate transformations thus discovering a new moduli space, and further infinite-dimensional families of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric breather-like supercompactons. We call the maps generating such moduli space "contour-preserving" maps.</description>

      <title>Generalized Kerr-Schild spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the class of generalized Kerr-Schild (GKS) spacetimes in dimensions $n\geq 3$ and analyze their geometric and algebraic properties in a completely theory-independent setting. First, considering the case of a general null vector $\mathbf{k}$ defined by the GKS metric, we obtain the conditions under which it is geodesic. Assuming $\mathbf{k}$ to be geodesic for the remainder of the paper, we examine the alignment properties of the curvature tensors, namely the Ricci and Weyl tensors. We show that the algebraic types of the curvatures of the full (GKS) geometry are constrained by those of the respective background curvatures, thereby listing all kinematically allowed combinations of the algebraic types for the background and the full geometry. A notable aspect of these results is that, unlike the case of Kerr-Schild (KS) spacetimes, the Weyl types of the GKS spacetimes need not be type $II$ or more special. Then, focusing on the case of an expanding $\mathbf k$, we derive the conditions for it to satisfy the optical constraint, extending the previous results of KS spacetimes. We illustrate the general results using the example of (A)dS-Taub-NUT spacetimes in $n=4$, where we also comment on their KS double copy from a GKS perspective. Finally, as an application of our general results, we obtain the full family of GKS spacetimes with a geodesic, expanding, twistfree, and shearfree $\mathbf k$, satisfying the vacuum Einstein equations, and identify it with a subset of the higher-dimensional vacuum Robinson-Trautman solutions. In passing, we also determine the subcase of these solutions that manifests the KS double copy.</description>

      <title>Topological Insights into Black Hole Thermodynamics: Non-Extensive Entropy in CFT framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, We conducted an in-depth investigation into the thermodynamic topology of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black holes within the framework of Conformal Field Theory (CFT), considering the implications of non-extensive entropy formulations. Our study reveals that the parameter $\lambda$ (R\'{e}nyi entropy) plays a crucial role in the phase behavior of black holes. Specifically, when $\lambda$ is below the critical value (C), it has a negligible impact on the phase behavior. However, when $\lambda$ exceeds the critical value, it significantly alters the phase transition outcomes. Determining the most physically representative values of $\lambda$ will require experimental validation, but this parameter flexibility allows researchers to better explain black hole phase transitions under varying physical conditions. Furthermore, the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ affect the phase structure and topological charge for the Sharma-Mittal entropy. Only in the case of $C&gt;C_c$ and in the condition of $\alpha\approx\beta$ will we have a first-order phase transition with topological charge + 1. Additionally, for the loop quantum gravity non-extensive entropy as the parameter $q$ approaches 1, the classification of topological charges changes. We observe configurations with one and three topological charges with respect to critical value $C$, resulting in a total topological charge $W = +1$, and configurations with two topological charges $(\omega = +1, -1)$, leading to a total topological charge $W = 0$. These findings provide new insights into the complex phase behavior and topological characteristics of black holes in the context of CFT and non-extensive entropy formulations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The general theory of relativity is currently established as the most precise theory of gravity supported by observations, and its application is diverse ranging from astronomy to cosmology, while its application to astrophysics has been restricted only to compact stars due to the assumption that the Newtonian approximation is sufficient for celestial bodies with medium density such as the sun. Surprisingly, the recent research of the author has implied that this long-held assumption is not valid, and that non-perturbative effects significantly change relevant results obtained by Newtonian gravity. In particular, local physical quantities inside the sun are newly predicted to exhibit power law differently from the so-called standard solar model. This surprising result is reviewed including brief discussion of physics behind the discrepancy and a new application of the new mass formula to gas planets.</description>

Abstract: Gibbons and Schiller have raised the physically interesting conjecture that forces in general relativity are bounded from above by the mathematically compact relation ${\cal F}\leq c^4/4G$. In the present compact paper we explicitly prove, using the non-linearly coupled Einstein-matter field equations, that the force function ${\cal F}\equiv 4\pi r^2 p(r)$ in {\it stable} self-gravitating horizonless matter configurations is characterized by the upper bound ${\cal F}\leq c^4/G$ [here $p(r)$ is the radial pressure inside the self-gravitating matter configuration].</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Mountains: current-carrying domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain wall (DW) networks may have formed in the early universe following the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry. Notably, several particle physics models predict the existence of current-carrying DWs, which can capture and store particles as zero modes on it. In this study, we demonstrate that gravitational waves (GWs) generated by current-carrying DWs with fermionic zeromodes exhibit a novel feature: an additional peak in the GW spectrum resembling mountains, arising from metastable topological remnants, which we term ``spherons.'' This distinct signature could be detectable in upcoming GW observatories such as LISA and ET. The results suggest that DW networks in beyond Standard Model scenarios could emit GW signals that are significantly stronger and with greater detectability than previously expected.</description>

Abstract: Stueckelberg introduced an axion like scalar field to provide mass to the gauge electromagnetic field without breaking gauge invariance. This can be considered as a precursor to the spontaneously broken abelian Higgs model. We will consider its role in cosmology to provide a novel candidate to the dark matter question. In addition its implications to deeper issues will be pointed out.</description>

Abstract: We derive the full system of canonical differential equations for all planar two-loop massless six-particle master integrals, and determine analytically the boundary conditions. This fully specifies the solutions, which may be written as Chen iterated integrals. We argue that this is sufficient information for evaluating any scattering amplitude in four dimensions up to the finite part. We support this claim by reducing, for the most complicated integral topologies, integrals with typical Yang-Mills numerators. We use the analytic solutions to the differential equations, together with dihedral symmetry, to provide the full solution space relevant for two-loop six-particle computations. This includes the relevant function alphabet, as well as the independent set of iterated integrals up to weight four. We also provide the answer for all master integrals in terms of iterated integrals that can be readily evaluated numerically. As a proof of concept, we provide a numerical implementation that evaluates the integrals in part of the Euclidean region, and validate this against numerical evaluation of the Feynman integrals. Our result removes the bottleneck of Feynman integral evaluation, paving the way to future analytic evaluations of six-particle scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Gravitational Wave Speed in the Early Universe via Gravitational Cherenkov Radiation</title>

Abstract: Scalar particles traveling faster than a subluminal gravitational wave generate gravitons via gravitational Cherenkov radiation. In this paper, we investigate graviton production by the primordial plasma within the framework of modified gravity in the early Universe, generating a relic graviton background. We find that for the minimal model, where only the speed of gravitational waves is modified and a standard model plasma minimally couples to gravity, the relic graviton background can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude, but still agrees with the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound in most cases. Moreover, we also find that for Horndeski theories, such as Galileon theory, the relic background produced by the thermalized scalar field can reach significant amplitudes, exceeding the BBN bound for a region of the parameter space. By requiring the relic graviton background to remain consistent with the BBN constraint, we derive limits on the gravitational wave speed at early times in these modified gravity theories.</description>

Abstract: We present methods for the numerical evaluation of the master integrals that appear in the calculation of scattering amplitudes at higher order in perturbative quantum field theory. We follow the general strategy of solving first-order ordinary differential equations through series expansion. We have collected these procedures in an open source computer program that we dub \Line{}. Boundary conditions can be provided by the user or computed internally using the method of expansion by regions. Illustrative examples are also given.</description>

      <title>Parallel surface defects, Hecke operators, and quantum Hitchin system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine two types of half-BPS surface defects $-$ regular monodromy surface defect and canonical surface defect $-$ in four-dimensional gauge theory with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry and $\Omega_{\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2}$-background. Mathematically, we investigate integrals over the moduli spaces of parabolic framed sheaves over $\mathbb{P}^2$. Using analytic methods of $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories, we demonstrate that the former gives a twisted $\mathcal{D}$-module on $\text{Bun}_{G_{\mathbb{C}}}$ while the latter acts as a Hecke operator. In the limit $\varepsilon_2 \to 0$, the cluster decomposition implies the Hecke eigensheaf property for the regular monodromy surface defect. The eigenvalues are given by the opers associated to the canonical surface defect. We derive, in our $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theoretical framework, that the twisted $\mathcal{D}$-modules assigned to the opers in the geometric Langlands correspondence represent the spectral equations for quantum Hitchin integrable system. A duality to topologically twisted four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ theory is discussed, in which the two surface defects are mapped to Dirichlet boundary and 't Hooft line defect. This is consistent with earlier works on the $\mathcal{N}=4$ theory approach to the geometric Langlands correspondence.</description>

Abstract: With non-perturbative de Sitter gravity and holography in mind, we deduce the genus expansion of de Sitter Jackiw-Teitelboim (dS JT) gravity. We find that this simple model of quantum cosmology has an effective string coupling which is pure imaginary. This imaginary coupling gives rise to alternating signs in the genus expansion of the dS JT S-matrix, which as a result appears to be Borel-Le Roy resummable. Furthermore dS JT gravity is formally an analytic continuation of AdS JT gravity, and behaves like a matrix integral with a negative number of degrees of freedom.</description>

Abstract: We explore the $\textit{difference Langlands correspondence}$ using the four dimensional ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ super-QCD. Surface defects and surface observables play the crucial role. As an application, we give the first construction of the full set of quantum integrals, i.e. commuting differential operators, such that the partition function of the so-called regular monodromy surface defect is their joint eigenvectors in an evaluation module over the Yangian $Y(\mathfrak{gl}(2))$, making it the wavefunction of a $N$-site $\mathfrak{gl}(2)$ spin chain with bi-infinite spin modules. We construct the $\mathbf{Q}$- and $\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}$-surface observables which are believed to be the $Q$-operators on the bi-infinite module over the Yangian $Y(\mathfrak{gl}(2))$, and compute their eigenvalues, the $Q$-functions, as vevs of the surface observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two types of surface observables $-$ the $\mathbf{Q}$-observables and the $\mathbf{H}$-observables $-$ of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $A_1$-quiver $U(N)$ gauge theory obtained by coupling a 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ gauged linear sigma model. We demonstrate that the transition between the two surface defects manifests as a Fourier transformation between the surface observables. Utilizing the results from our previous works, which establish that the $\mathbf{Q}$-observables and the $\mathbf{H}$-observables give rise, respectively, to the $Q$-operators on the evaluation module over the Yangian $Y(\mathfrak{gl}(2))$ and the Hecke operators on the twisted $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(N)$-coinvariants, we derive an exact duality between the spectral problems of the $\mathfrak{gl}(2)$ XXX spin chain with $N$ sites and the $\mathfrak{sl}(N)$ Gaudin model with 4 sites, both of which are defined on bi-infinite modules. Moreover, we present a dual description of the monodromy surface defect as coupling a 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ gauged linear sigma model. Employing this dual perspective, we demonstrate how the monodromy surface defect undergoes a transition to multiple $\mathbf{Q}$-observables or $\mathbf{H}$-observables, implemented through integral transformations between their surface observables. These transformations provide, respectively, $\hbar$-deformation and a higher-rank generalization of the KZ/BPZ correspondence. In the limit $\varepsilon_2\to 0$, they give rise to the quantum separation of variables for the $\mathfrak{gl}(2)$ XXX spin chain and the $\mathfrak{sl}(N)$ Gaudin model, respectively.</description>

      <title>Effective short distance interaction in Calogero-Sutherland quantum fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the effective conformal field theory with symmetry W-infinity x W-infinity that describes the thermodynamic limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model. In the repulsive regime of the free fermion formulation, we identify an attractive interaction between opposite moving particle-hole pairs that dominates the short distance behavior and that is proposed as responsible for the destabilization of the ground state, leading to a new one of bosonic nature. The process is described by a Bogoliubov transformation of the free fermion bilinear operators into bosonic ones, preserving the form of the W-infinity algebra but decoupling the opposite chirality terms in the hamiltonian, as expected in the low energy limit. In coordinate space this interaction has a short range component that arises due to the quantum regularization of the theory. The described dynamical process may be considered as a mechanism of the emergence of the known charge and quantum statistics fractionalization of the low lying excitations of the theory, as predicted in both first and second quantization studies.</description>

      <title>Regularizing infrared divergences in de Sitter spacetime: Loops, dimensional regularization, and cutoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlation functions of light scalar fields in de Sitter spacetime, computed via standard perturbation theory, often exhibit secular growth characterized by time-dependent divergent terms in the form of powers of $\ln a(t)$, where $a(t)$ is the scale factor describing cosmic expansion. It is widely believed that loop corrections further enhance this secular growth. We argue that this is not necessarily the case: Loop corrections can be systematically handled using standard perturbative techniques, such as dimensional regularization, without introducing new $\ln a(t)$ terms. We focus on a canonical massless scalar field $\varphi$ with self-interactions described by a potential $\mathcal{V}(\varphi)$, and analyze correlation functions represented by diagrams with a single vertex and an arbitrary number of loops. In this framework, infrared divergences can be systematically eliminated with counterterms at each order in perturbation theory, leading to loop-corrected correlation functions that are indistinguishable from their tree-level forms, with no secular growth from loops. Furthermore, adopting a Wilsonian perspective, we explore the role of cutoffs in computing loop corrections within effective field theory and identify the effective potential $\mathcal{V}_{\rm eff}(\varphi)$, which guarantees cutoff-independent observables. We conclude that when infrared comoving cutoffs are used to regularize loop integrals, time-dependent Wilsonian coefficients are necessary to maintain cutoff-free correlation functions. Neglecting this time dependence results in secular growth from loops.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first study a non-relativistic field theory model for the Kondo lattice by introducing the Kondo condensation, whose main effect is the hybridization of the flat band of the localized electron with dispersive one of the itinerant electron. The problem here is that the resulting Kondo condensation arises only in strong coupling where the validity of the mean field theory is questionable. Therefore, we build a holographic mean field theory of the Kondo lattice with strong coupling by identifying the effect of the lattice with the fermion's spectral shape due to the coupling with the order parameter representing the symmetry breaking. For the flat band spectrum we use the mixed quantization, and for the dispersive spectrum we intoduce the second fermion in standard quantization. The coupling of the two fermions with the scalar order representing the Kondo condensation provides the hybrization of the two spectrum, reproducing the main feature of the Kondo lattice together with the fuzzy character of the spectrum of the strongly coupled system.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we propose a generalized notion of distance between vacua in the theory of a scalar field $\phi$ with scalar potential $V(\phi)$ coupled to gravity. We propose the normalized tension of domain wall connecting different field values, with a varying normalization relative to a local energy scale, as the distance. We show this definition reproduces the usual moduli space distance for zero potential, as well as the $d\propto |\log \Lambda|$ behavior with the vacuum energy $\Lambda$ in the AdS case, previously proposed in the literature. In the case of large AdS we also obtain the expected exponent of mass versus distance in one particular case, when the mass of the light tower is $m\sim \sqrt \Lambda$ and there is a single extra dimension decompactifying. We also discuss the features and shortcomings of alternative but related proposals.</description>

Abstract: We derive the most generic Carrollian higher derivative free scalar field theory intrinsically on a Carrollian manifold. The solutions to these theories are massless free particles propagating with speeds depending on the coupling constants in the Lagrangian, thus, allowing interference solutions which are not allowed on a Lorentzian manifold. This demonstrates that the set of solutions to the Carrollian theories is much larger than that of their Lorentzian counterparts. We also show that Carrollian higher derivative theories are more resistant to Ostrogradsky's instabilities. These instabilities can be resolved by choosing the coupling constants appropriately in the Carrollian Lagrangian, something that was proven to be impossible in Lorentzian theories.</description>

Abstract: As analogues of compact objects, non-topological solitons have attracted much attention. We reveal that the cylindrical Q-string exhibits dynamical instability to perturbations with wavelengths exceeding a threshold $\lambda&gt;\lambda_{c}$. This instability can destroy the invariance in the cylindrical direction, as a generation mechanism for Q-balls, similar to the formation of droplets. As the interface of the Q-string approaches a thin wall, this long-wavelength instability degenerates into the Rayleigh-Plateau instability with a threshold related only to the geometric radius $\lambda_{c}=2\pi R$. Such results indicate that Q-strings, like black strings, resemble low-viscosity fluids with surface tension.</description>

Abstract: We study the asymptotic symmetries of near-horizon extremal BTZ black holes in higher derivative theories of gravity, such as New Massive Gravity and Topological Massive Gravity. By employing a particular boundary condition and the regularization prescription proposed earlier for the Einstein gravity, we demonstrate the existence of two centrally extended Virasoro algebras. The central charges evaluated within this framework are in agreement with their corresponding expressions evaluated at the spatial infinity. We also discuss the robustness of the regularization procedure by relating asymptotic and near-horizon geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-monotonic behavior of the speed of sound for isospin imbalanced strongly interacting matter, found by recent lattice QCD simulations, can be reproduced within the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model and Linear Sigma Model with quarks when the couplings become isospin chemical potential-dependent. The introduction of medium-dependent couplings can potentially affect the equivalence between the thermodynamic relations and their definitions from statistical mechanics. We describe the procedure to compensate for the introduction of medium-dependent couplings to preserve the correct thermodynamic identities. We find the isospin chemical potential dependence for the couplings from the isospin density LQCD data and, after finding the compensating function to correctly describe the pressure, we show that the description of the square of the speed of sound reported by LQCD is well reproduced when using the found medium-dependent couplings in both models.</description>

Abstract: The observed Standard Model (SM) quark/lepton mass hierarchies and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) mixing pattern are described in an ${\rm SU}(8)$ theory through its realistic symmetry breaking pattern with three intermediate stages, which rely on a set of $d=5$ gravity-induced operators that break the emergent global symmetries in the chiral fermion sector, as well as the precise identifications of all non-trivially embedded SM flavors.</description>

      <title>Exploring Black Hole Mimickers: Electromagnetic and Gravitational Signatures of AdS Black Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study electromagnetic and gravitational properties of AdS black shells (also referred to as AdS black bubbles) -- a class of quantum gravity motivated black hole mimickers, that in the classical limit are described as ultra compact shells of matter. We find that their electromagnetic properties are remarkably similar to black holes. We then discuss the extent to which these objects are distinguishable from black holes, both for intrinsic interest within the black shell model, and as a guide for similar efforts in other sub-classes of exotic compact objects (ECOs). We study photon rings and lensing band characteristics, relevant for very large baseline inteferometry (VLBI) observations, as well as gravitational wave observables -- quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit and the static tidal Love number for non-spinning shells -- relevant for ongoing and upcoming gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Charged rotating wormholes: charge without charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a family of charged rotating wormhole solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations, supported by anisotropic matter fields. We first revisit the charged static cases and analyze the conditions for the solution to represent a wormhole geometry. The rotating geometry is obtained by applying and modifying the Newman-Janis algorithm to the static geometry. We show the solutions to Maxwell equations in detail. We believe that our wormhole geometry offers a geometric realization corresponding to the concept of `charge without charge'.</description>

      <title>Deformation of a one dimensional ferromagnetic domain wall due to double exchange interaction with a free electron system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the energy and conductance of a Bloch or N\'eel magnetic wall interacting with a one dimensional free electron system via a double exchange interaction. Minimization of the total energy indicates that for chemical potential larger than the magnetic interaction the domain wall is generally deformed to a thin wall, while for magnetic field larger than the chemical potential tends towards wide walls. In contrast, for a double wall system the deformation is always towards wide walls. For the single as well as the double magnetic wall systems the conductance monotonically decreases with decreasing wall width. The energy and conductance are identical for Bloch and N\'eel magnetic domain walls within this prototype model.</description>

      <title>Alternative theory for the quantum black hole and the temperature of its quantum radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A mechanism is found that explains how matter falling into the future event horizon of a black hole leaves information there, which it sends to the past event horizon, and there it determines how particles are emitted. This way information must be conserved. The mechanism is a calculable gravitational effect. We also show how it is avoided that the "hidden region" of the black hole gets involved, which has been standing out as a problem ever since Hawking found that particles must be emitted. The most striking consequence of our mechanism is that the radiation temperature is not what Hawking calculated, but twice that value. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the hidden region is not there.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Study of TeV-Scale String Resonances in Photon-Jet Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: STRINGS is a Monte Carlo (MC) event generator for simulating the production and decay of first and second string resonances in proton-proton collisions. STRINGS can also interface with other programs such as Pythia using the Les Houches Accord to produce more accurate data. In this paper, we validate STRINGS for the simulation of 2-parton $\rightarrow$ $\gamma$-parton scattering events by comparing to previous literature. After validation, we produce MC samples of resonances using $M_s$ = {5.0,5.5,6.0,6.5,7.0} TeV at $\sqrt{s}$ = {13,13.6} TeV with STRINGS and Pythia and analyze the kinematic data. To accurately reproduce previous results close to resonance, it is necessary to introduce a scaling factor of $\approx$ 0.53. With this correction, the resonance structure is as expected.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the electro-weak theory from a gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: U(4) local transformations on the four Weyl spinors forming the isospin doublet of Dirac fermions are assumed as symmetries of the standard model. With the Lorentz transformations considered simultaneously, the symmetry group is enlarged in order to form a closed Lie algebra. In this framework, the chirality mixing gauge components with certain constraints collectively are identified as the Higgs field in the standard model. The scalar-appearance of the gauge-natured Higgs field and its varying coupling constants with the fermions, i.e. the mass-ratio parameters, are also given natural explanation. Additionally, a background of a constant right-handed gauge component is postulated to obtain the symmetry-breaking Higgs potential, which leads to a possible explanation of the parity violation in weak interactions. Further, the new framework provides an alternative perspective to understand the hyper symmetry U(1)Y , as a combination of a simultaneous phase rotation on both the left and right handed fermions and a rotation in the third direction of SU(2)R on the right-handed fermions. At last, a topological term involving the Higgs field is found to exist.</description>
