      <title>Reference Quadrupole Moments of Transition Elements from Lamb Shifts in Muonic Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for accurately measuring the absolute electric quadrupole moments of light transition elements $(23 \leq Z \leq 30 )$. Our approach is based on performing precision muonic x-ray spectroscopy of the $2s-2p$ manifold, which is also referred to as the Lamb shift. These transitions are too weak to be detected with dispersive methods and too overlapping to be resolved by solid-state detectors. Here, we propose the use of cryogenic microcalorimeters, which possess high efficiency and excellent energy resolution in the relevant energy regime, coupled with state-of-the-art theoretical calculations. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by performing extensive calculations and realistic simulations. In this way, we establish that the uncertainty in the absolute moment, which is transferred to the quadrupole moments of all isotopes in the chain, could be reduced by up to an order of magnitude within a day of measurement. These precise reference quadrupole moments serve as valuable inputs for nuclear structure studies and for benchmarking state-of-the-art quantum chemistry calculations in open-shell elements.</description>

      <title>Twisted Electron Collisions Enhance the Production of Circular Rydberg States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular Rydberg states offer advantages for quantum information and quantum simulation platforms due to their long lifetimes and strong dipole-dipole interactions. Unfortunately, current techniques for the production of these states remain technically challenging. Here we investigate the ability of twisted electron collisions to produce circular Rydberg states. Twisted electrons carry quantized orbital angular momentum that can be transferred to the electronic state of the atom, potentially providing an efficient means to generate circular Rydberg states. Using a fully quantum mechanical framework, we compute total excitation cross sections for circular Rydberg states of hydrogen, rubidium, and cesium targets using Bessel electron beams. Our models account for the full Bessel-beam structure of the incident electron and incorporate macroscopic target effects to model experimentally-relevant conditions. Our results show that twisted electrons with large opening angles produce significant enhancements in the excitation probability relative to plane-wave electrons, particularly for large opening angles and low energies. We trace this enhancement to contributions from projectiles with large values of orbital angular momentum. These findings demonstrate that twisted-electron excitation may provide a feasible and potentially advantageous pathway for generating circular Rydberg states.</description>

      <title>Development of a projectile charge state analyzer and 10 kV bipolar power supply for MeV energy ion - atom/molecule collision experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a post-collision projectile charge state analyzer (CSA) for detecting the charge state of the projectile ion following ion-atom/molecule collision. The design of the analyzer, based on electrostatic parallel plate deflector was simulated using SIMION ion optics package. We have also developed a 10 kV bipolar programmable power supply to bias the CSA electrodes. The CSA and the power supply, both, were tested in collision studies using MeV energy ion beam of proton and carbon ions at the 1.7 MV tandetron accelerator facility at IIT Kanpur.</description>

      <title>Atomic magnetometry based on the ground-state Hanle effect in an elliptically polarized light wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state Hanle effect in alkali-metal vapor irradiating by a resonant elliptically polarized light wave. The magneto-optical resonances are observed as a change in the ellipticity parameter of the light wave polarization when scanning the transverse magnetic field near zero. We use a miniature ($\approx\,$$0.125$ cm$^3$) glass cesium vapor cell heated to a relatively low temperature of $\approx\,$$85^\circ$C. Under the current experimental conditions, the sensitivity of magnetic field measurements is limited by a technical noise, reaching $180$ fT/$\surd$Hz in a $200$ Hz bandwidth. The ultimate photon-shot-noise-limited sensitivity of the method is estimated to be $\approx\,$$5$ fT/$\surd$Hz. The proposed scheme is promising for the development of a zero-field atomic magnetometer with reduced heat dissipation of the sensor head and relaxed requirements for magnetic shielding compared to counterparts operating in the spin-exchange relaxation-free regime. These features are of particular value for biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on excited states of ICl+ molecular ion considering spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic structure of the ICl+ molecular ion is investigated by using high-level multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) method. To improve computational accuracy, Davidson corrections, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and core-valence electron correlations effects are incorporated into the calculations. The potential energy curves (PECs) of 21 electronic states associated with the two lowest dissociation limits are obtained. The dipole moments (DMs) of the 21 electronic states of ICl+ are systematically studied, and the variations of DMs of the identical symmetry state in the avoided crossing regions are elucidated by analyzing the dominant electronic configuration. With the help of the calculated SOC matrix element, the interaction between crossing states can be elucidated. Spin-orbit coupling matrix elements involving the several states are calculated. By analyzing potential energy curves of these states and the nearby electronic states, the possible predissociation channels are provided. Based on the computed PECs, the spectroscopic constants of bound states are determined. The comparison of the spectroscopic constants including and excluding SOC effect indicates that the SOC effect has an obvious correction to the spectroscopic properties of low-lying states. Finally, the transition properties between excited states and the ground state are studied. Based on the computed transition dipole moments and Franck-Condon Factors, radiative lifetimes for the low-lying vibrational levels of excited states are evaluated.</description>

      <title>Multiphoton ionization with three-dimensional light fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first observation of free-electron angular momentum wave packets generated by atomic multiphoton ionization with bichromatic three-dimensional (3D) polarization-tailored ultrashort laser fields. These fields, created by the non-collinear superposition of two polarization-shaped pulses of different colors from a supercontinuum polarization pulse shaper, provide electric-field components along all spatial directions. The resulting photoelectron momentum distributions, recorded via velocity map imaging, demonstrate full 3D coherent control of electronic superposition states extending beyond the constraints of planar polarization fields by unlocking all dipole selection rules $\Delta m = 0,\pm1$. As an application, 3D pump-probe fields are used to image previously unobserved photoelectron wave packets mapping spin-orbit dynamics of the potassium $3d$ fine structure doublet. Our shaper-based approach establishes a route to fully controllable 3D light fields for chiral-sensitive light-matter interactions and ultrafast spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Puzzling Isotonic Odd-Even Staggering of Charge Radii in Deformed Rare Earth Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear charge radius is a fundamental observable that encodes key aspects of nuclear structure, deformation, and pairing. Isotonic (constant neutron number) systematics in the deformed rare-earth region have long suggested that odd-$Z$ nuclei are more compact than their even-$Z$ neighbors - except for Lu, whose recommended radius appeared anomalously large relative to Yb and Hf. We report a high-precision determination of the natural-abundance-averaged Lu-Yb charge-radius difference using extreme-ultraviolet spectroscopy of highly charged Na-like and Mg-like ions, supported by high-accuracy relativistic atomic-structure calculations - a recently introduced method with the unique ability to measure inter-element charge radius differences. Combined with muonic-atom and optical isotope-shift data, our result resolves the longstanding Lu inversion anomaly and reestablishes a pronounced odd-even staggering along the $N=94$ isotonic chain. The magnitude of this staggering is unexpectedly large, far exceeding that observed in semi-magic nuclei and in deformed isotopic sequences. State-of-the-art nuclear density functional theory calculations, including quantified uncertainties, fail to reproduce this enhancement, possibly indicating missing structural effects in current models. Our work demonstrates the power of highly charged ions for precise, element-crossing charge-radius measurements and provides stringent new constraints for future theoretical and experimental studies of nuclear-size systematics.</description>

      <title>The Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm with qutrits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, which is well-studied in the qubit framework, to its qutrit counterpart (which we call qutrit HHL, as opposed to qubit HHL, which is HHL using qubits). We design the circuit for the algorithm and develop a program for its implementation. We test HHL with qutrits for simple matrices and verify the results against the expected outcomes. We apply the algorithm to quantum chemistry, and in particular, to the potential energy curve calculations of the model problem of the hydrogen molecule in the split valence basis. We compare the number of qudits and the number of gates required between qubit and qutrit HHL implementations. In general, we find that for a fixed precision, the qutrit HHL circuit requires fewer number of qudits and comparable number of two-qudit gates than its qubit counterpart.</description>

      <title>Feynman Diagrams for Matter Wave Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new theoretical framework based on Feynman diagrams to compute phase shifts in matter wave interferometry. The method allows for analytic computation of higher order quantum corrections, beyond the traditional semi-classical approximation. These additional terms depend on the finite size of the initial matter wavefunction and/or have higher order dependence on $\hbar$. We apply the method to compute the response of matter wave interferometers to power law potentials and potentials with an arbitrary spatial dependence. The analytic expressions are validated by comparing to numerical simulations, and estimates are provided for the scale of the quantum corrections to the phase shift response to the gravitational field of the earth, anharmonic trapping potentials, and gravitational fields from local proof masses. We find that for certain experimentally feasible parameters, these corrections are large enough to be measured, and could lead to systematic errors if not accounted for. We anticipate these corrections will be especially important for trapped matter wave interferometers and for free-space matter wave interferometers in the presence of proof masses. These interferometers are becoming increasingly sensitive tools for mobile inertial sensing, gravity surveying, tests of gravity and its interplay with quantum mechanics, and searches for dark energy.</description>

      <title>Wavefront Curvature and Transverse Atomic Motion in Time-Resolved Atom Interferometry: Impact and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-resolved atom interferometry, as employed in applications such as gravitational wave detection and searches for ultra-light dark matter, requires precise control over systematic effects. In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.</description>

      <title>Oscillating nuclear charge radii as sensors for ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that coupling of ultralight dark matter (UDM) to quarks and gluons would lead to an oscillation of the nuclear charge radius for both the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) axion and scalar dark matter. Consequently, the resulting oscillation of electronic energy levels could be resolved with optical atomic clocks, and their comparisons can be used to investigate UDM-nuclear couplings, which were previously only accessible with other platforms. We demonstrate this idea using the ${}^2S_{1/2} (F=0)\leftrightarrow {}^2F_{7/2} (F=3)$ electric octupole and ${}^2S_{1/2} (F=0)\leftrightarrow \,{}^2D_{3/2} (F=2)$ electric quadrupole transitions in ${}^{171}Yb^+$. Based on the derived sensitivity coefficients for these two transitions and a long-term comparison of their frequencies using a single trapped ${}^{171}Yb^+$ ion, we find bounds on the scalar UDM-nuclear couplings and the QCD axion decay constant. These results are at a similar level compared to the tightest spectroscopic limits, and future investigations, also with other optical clocks, promise significant improvements.</description>
