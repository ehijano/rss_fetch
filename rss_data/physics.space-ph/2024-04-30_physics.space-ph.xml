      <title>Three-dimensional plasmoid-mediated reconnection and turbulence in Hall magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmoid instability accelerates reconnection in collisional plasmas by transforming a laminar reconnection layer into numerous plasmoids connected by secondary current sheets in two dimensions (2D) and by fostering self-generated turbulent reconnection in three dimensions (3D). In large-scale astrophysical and space systems, plasmoid instability likely initiates in the collisional regime but may transition into the collisionless regime as the fragmentation of the current sheet progresses toward kinetic scales. Hall MHD models are widely regarded as a simplified yet effective representation of the transition from collisional to collisionless reconnection. However, plasmoid instability in 2D Hall MHD simulations often leads to a single-X-line reconnection configuration, which significantly differs from fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulation results. This study shows that single-X-line reconnection is less likely to occur in 3D compared to 2D. Moreover, depending on the Lundquist number and the ratio between the system size and the kinetic scale, Hall MHD can also realize 3D self-generated turbulent reconnection. We analyze the features of the self-generated turbulent state, including the energy power spectra and the scale dependence of turbulent eddy anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Compositional metrics of fast and slow Alfvenic solar wind emerging from coronal holes and their boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We seek to understand the composition and variability of fast (FSW) and slow Alfvenic solar wind (SASW) emerging from coronal holes (CH). We leverage an opportune conjunction between Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during PSP Encounter 11 to include compositional diagnostics from the Solar Orbiter heavy ion sensor (HIS) as these variations provide crucial insights into the origin and nature of the solar wind. We use Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) and Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models to connect the observed plasma at PSP and Solar Orbiter to its origin footpoint in the photosphere, and compare these results with the in situ measurements. A very clear signature of a heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossing as evidenced by enhancements in low FIP elements, ion charge state ratios, proton density, low-Alfvenicity, and polarity estimates validates the combination of modeling, data, and mapping. We identify two FSW streams emerging from small equatorial coronal holes (CH) with low ion charge state ratios, low FIP bias, high-Alfvenicity, and low footpoint brightness, yet anomalously low alpha particle abundance for both streams. We identify high-Alfvenicity slow solar wind emerging from the over-expanded boundary of a CH having intermediate alpha abundance, high-Alfvenicity, and dips in ion charge state ratios corresponding to CH boundaries. Through this comprehensive analysis, we highlight the power of multi-instrument conjunction studies in assessing the sources of the solar wind.</description>
