      <title>Durrmeyer type operators linked with Boas-Buck type polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present article intends to introduce the sequence of Baskakov-Durrmeyer type operators linked with the generating functions of Boas-Buck type polynomials. After calculating the moments, including the limiting case of central moments of the constructed sequence of operators, in the subsequent sections, we estimate the convergence rate using the Ditzian-Totik modulus of smoothness and some convergence results in Lipchitz-type space.</description>

      <title>An Extended Picard Method to solve non-linear systems of ODE with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide of a method to integrate first order non-linear systems of differential equations with variable coefficients. It determines approximate solutions given initial or boundary conditions or even for Sturm-Liouville problems. This method is a mixture between an iterative process, a la Picard, plus a segmentary integration, which gives explicit approximate solutions in terms of trigonometric functions and polynomials. The segmentary part is particularly important if the integration interval is large. This procedure provide a new tool so as to obtain approximate solutions of systems of interest in the analysis of chemical reactions. We test the method on some classical equations like Mathieu, Duffing quintic equation or Bratu's equation and have applied it on some models of chemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Linear Instability of the Prandtl Equations via Hypergeometric Functions and the Harmonic Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a deep connection between the Prandtl equations linearised around a quadratic shear flow, confluent hypergeometric functions of the first kind, and the Schr\"odinger operator.
  Our first result concerns an ODE and a spectral condition derived in [10], associated with unstable quasi-eigenmodes of the Prandtl equations. We entirely determine the space of solutions in terms of Kummer's functions. By classifying their asymptotic behaviour, we verify that the spectral condition has a unique, explicitly determined pair of eigenvalue and eigenfunction, the latter being expressible as a combination of elementary functions.
  Secondly, we prove that any quasi-eigenmode solution of the linearised Prandtl equations around a quadratic shear flow can be explicitly determined from algebraic eigenfunctions of the Schr\"odinger operator with quadratic potential.
  We show finally that the obtained analytical formulation of the velocity align with previous numerical simulations in the literature.</description>

      <title>Mode stability of blow-up for wave maps in the absence of symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wave maps equation in three spatial dimensions with a spherical target admits an explicit blow-up solution. Numerical studies suggest this solution captures the generic blow-up behaviour in the backward light cone of the singularity. In this work, we establish the mode stability of this blow-up solution in the backward light cone of the blow-up point without any assumptions on the symmetries of the perturbation. We classify all smooth mode solutions for growth rates $\lambda$ with $\mathrm{Re} \, \lambda \geq 0$ and demonstrate that the blow-up solution is stable up to the mode solutions arising from the symmetry group of the wave maps equation. Our proof relies on a decomposition of the linearised wave maps equation into a tractable system of symmetry-equivariant ordinary differential equations (ODEs), utilising the representation theory of the stabiliser of the blow-up solution. We then use the quasi-solution method of Costin-Donninger-Glogi\'{c} to show the absence of non-zero smooth solutions for the resulting system of ODEs.</description>

      <title>Notes on Generalized Gr\"otzsch Ring Function and Generalized Hersch-Pfluger Distortion Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $a\in(0,1)$, $r\in(0,1)$ and $K\in(1,\infty)$, let $\mu_{a}(r)$ and $\varphi_{K}^{a}(r)$ be the generalized Gr\"{o}tzsch ring function and generalized Hersch-Pfluger distortion function. In the past few years, the functions $\mu_{a}(r)$ and $\varphi_{K}^{a}(r)$, and their special cases $\mu_{1/2}(r)$ and $\varphi_{K}^{1/2}(r)$ have been playing the very important role on the theory of quasiconformal mappings and (generalized) Ramanujan's modular equations. In this paper, we present a series expansion of $\mu_{a}(r)$, and thus prove that the function $r\mapsto -[\mu_{a}(r)-\log{(e^{R(a)/2})/r}]$ is absolutely monotonic on $(0,1)$. Here $R(a)$ is the Ramanujan constant. In addition, we also investigate the submultiplicative and power submultiplicative properties of $\varphi_{K}^{a}(r)$, and establish some new inequalities for $\varphi_{K}^{a}(r)$ in terms of elementary functions.</description>

      <title>Subharmonic Kernels and Energy Minimizing Measures, with Applications to the Flat Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the minimization of the energy integral $I_K(\mu) = \int_{\Omega} \int_{\Omega} K(x,y) d\mu(x) d\mu(y)$ over all Borel probability measures $\mu$, where $(\Omega,\rho)$ is a compact connected metric space and $K:\Omega^2 \to [0,\infty]$ is continuous in the extended sense. We focus on kernels $K$ which are subharmonic, which we define so that the potential $U_K^\mu(x) = \int_{\Omega} K(x,y) d\mu(y)$ satisfies a maximum principle on $\Omega\setminus{\rm supp}{\mu}$. This extends the classical electrostatics minimization problem for logarithmic energy $\int_{\Omega}\int_{\Omega}\log\left(\frac{1}{||x-y||}\right)$, which is used heavily as a tool in approximation theory. Using properties of minimizing measures, we show that if the singularities of the subharmonic kernel $K$ are such that $K$ is regular, then $K$ is positive definite, and $\mu$ is a minimizing measure if and only if its potential is constant (outside of a small exceptional set).We then apply this result to group invariant kernels on compact homogeneous manifolds. In this case, the uniform measure $\sigma$ has constant potential, so subharmonicity implies that this is the minimizing measure. Finally, we look at the case of the $d$-dimensional flat torus $T^d$. We use our results to see that the Riesz kernel $K_s(x,y) = {\rm sign}(s)\rho(x,y)^{-s}$ is minimized by $\sigma$ (and thus positive definite) when $d &gt; s \geq d-2$. Additionally, the positive definiteness gives us a condition which implies that the multivariate Fourier series of a function $f:[0,\pi]^d \to [0,\infty]$ has nonnegative coefficients.</description>

      <title>It\^o formula for planarly branched rough paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The It\^o formula, originated by K. It\^o, is focus on the stochastic calculus, where many stochastic processes can be placed under the framework of rough paths. In rough path theory, It\^o formulas have been proved for rough paths with roughness $\frac{1}{3}&lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{2}$ and branched rough paths with roughness $0&lt; \alpha \leq 1$. Planarly branched rough paths contain more random processes than rough paths and branched rough paths. In the present paper, we prove the It\^o formula for planarly branched rough paths with roughness $\frac{1}{4}&lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Projecting dynamical systems via a support bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a polynomial dynamical system, we study the problem of computing the minimal differential equation satisfied by a chosen coordinate (in other words, projecting the system on the coordinate). This problem can be viewed as a special case of the general elimination problem for systems of differential equations and appears in applications to modeling and control.
  We give a bound for the Newton polytope of such minimal equation and show that our bound is sharp in "more than half of the cases". We further use this bound to design an algorithm for computing the minimal equation following the evaluation-interpolation paradigm. We demonstrate that our implementation of the algorithm can tackle problems which are out of reach for the state-of-the-art software for differential elimination.</description>
