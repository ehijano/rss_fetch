      <title>Exploring the first-order phase transition in neutron stars using the parity doublet model and NJL-type quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility and impacts of a first-order phase transition from hadronic matter to quark matter in neutron stars (NSs) using two specific models: the parity doublet model (PDM) for the hadronic phase and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) type model for the quark phase. By combining these models, we construct hybrid equations of state (EOSs) that capture the transition between the two phases. We explore the parameter space of both models to identify the conditions under which a first-order phase transition can occur and study its effects on NS properties. We identify the suitable parameter space and constrain the onset density of the first-order phase transition. For $m_0$ = 500 MeV -- the chiral invariant mass in PDM, the phase transition occurs between 1.9$n_0$ and 2.95$n_0$ and ends between 2.1$n_0$ and 3.6$n_0$. Increasing $m_0$ to 600 MeV shifts the phase transition to higher densities, occurring between 2.9$n_0$ and 4.1$n_0$ and ending between 3.4$n_0$ and 4.6$n_0$.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Wakes of Jets with Energy-Energy-Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the partons in a jet propagate through the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in a heavy-ion collision, they lose energy to, kick, and are kicked by the medium. The resulting modifications to the parton shower encode information about the microscopic nature of QGP. The momentum and energy lost by the parton shower are gained by the medium and, since QGP is a strongly coupled liquid, this means that the jet excites a wake in the droplet of QGP. After freezeout, this wake becomes soft hadrons with net momentum in the jet direction meaning that reconstructed jets include hadrons originating from both the modified parton shower and its wake. This makes it challenging to find an unambiguous experimental view of the response of a droplet of QGP to a jet. Recent years have seen significant advances in the understanding of the substructure of jets using correlation functions of the energy flux operator. So far, such studies have focused primarily on the two-point correlator, which serves to identify the angular scale of the underlying dynamics. Higher-point correlators hold the promise of mapping out the dynamics themselves. We perform the first study of the shape-dependent three-point energy-energy-energy correlator in heavy-ion collisions. Using the Hybrid Model to simulate the interactions of high energy jets with QGP, we show that hadrons originating from wakes are the dominant contribution to the three-point correlator in the regime where the three points are well-separated in angle, forming a roughly equilateral triangle. This equilateral region of the correlator is far from the region populated by collinear vacuum emissions, making it a canvas on which jet wakes can be imaged. Our work is a key step towards the systematic use of energy correlators to image and unravel the dynamical response of a droplet of QGP to a passing jet, and motivates many experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic charge transport in strongly magnetized relativistic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate electrical charge transport in hot magnetized plasma using first-principles quantum field theoretical methods. By employing Kubo's linear response theory, we express the electrical conductivity tensor in terms of the fermion damping rate in the Landau-level representation. Utilizing leading-order results for the damping rates from a recent study within a gauge theory, we derive the transverse and longitudinal conductivities for a strongly magnetized plasma. The analytical expressions reveal drastically different mechanisms that explain the high anisotropy of charge transport in a magnetized plasma. Specifically, the transverse conductivity is suppressed, while the longitudinal conductivity is enhanced by a strong magnetic field. As in the case of zero magnetic field, longitudinal conduction is determined by the probability of charge carriers to remain in their quantum states without damping. In contrast, transverse conduction critically relies on quantum transitions between Landau levels, effectively lifting charge trapping in localized Landau orbits. We examine the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the transverse and longitudinal electrical conductivities over a wide range of parameters and investigate the effects of a nonzero chemical potential. Additionally, we extend our analysis to strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma and study the impact of the coupling constant on the anisotropy of electrical charge transport.</description>

      <title>Sequency Hierarchy Truncation (SeqHT) for Adiabatic State Preparation and Time Evolution in Quantum Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Sequency Hierarchy Truncation (SeqHT) scheme for reducing the resources required for state preparation and time evolution in quantum simulations, based upon a truncation in sequency. For the $\lambda\phi^4$ interaction in scalar field theory, or any interaction with a polynomial expansion, upper bounds on the contributions of operators of a given sequency are derived. For the systems we have examined, observables computed in sequency-truncated wavefunctions, including quantum correlations as measured by magic, are found to step-wise converge to their exact values with increasing cutoff sequency. The utility of SeqHT is demonstrated in the adiabatic state preparation of the $\lambda\phi^4$ anharmonic oscillator ground state using IBM's quantum computer ${\textit ibm\_sherbrooke}$. Using SeqHT, the depth of the required quantum circuits is reduced by $\sim 30\%$, leading to significantly improved determinations of observables in the quantum simulations. More generally, SeqHT is expected to lead to a reduction in required resources for quantum simulations of systems with a hierarchy of length scales.</description>

      <title>Qutrit and Qubit Circuits for Three-Flavor Collective Neutrino Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the utility of qutrits and qubits for simulating the flavor dynamics of dense neutrino systems. The evolution of such systems impacts some important astrophysical processes, such as core-collapse supernovae and the nucleosynthesis of heavy nuclei. Many-body simulations require classical resources beyond current computing capabilities for physically relevant system sizes. Quantum computers are therefore a promising candidate to efficiently simulate the many-body dynamics of collective neutrino oscillations. Previous quantum simulation efforts have primarily focused on properties of the two-flavor approximation due to their direct mapping to qubits. Here, we present new quantum circuits for simulating three-flavor neutrino systems on qutrit- and qubit-based platforms, and demonstrate their feasibility by simulating systems of two, four and eight neutrinos on IBM and Quantinuum quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin tensor is fundamental to relativistic spin hydrodynamics, but its definition is ambiguous due to the pseudogauge symmetry. We show that in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with spin-spin interactions this ambiguity is resolved. We prove that the mean field limit of this theory is equivalent to the non-dissipative spin hydrodynamics with a canonical spin tensor. Finally, we propose to detect the spin potential by performing experiments with collisions of polarized ions.</description>

      <title>QCD phase diagram in the $T-eB$ plane for varying pion mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of a varying pion mass on the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram in the presence of an external magnetic field, aiming to understand it using Nambu\textendash Jona-Lasinio like effective models. We compare results from both its local and nonlocal versions. In both cases, we find that the inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) near the crossover is eliminated with increasing pion mass, while the decreasing trend of crossover temperature with increasing magnetic field persists for pion mass values at least up to $440$ MeV. Thus, the models are capable of capturing qualitatively the results found by lattice QCD (LQCD) for heavy (unphysical) pions. The key feature in the models is the incorporation of the effect of a reduction in the coupling constant with increasing energy. Along with reproducing the IMC effect, it enables models to describe the effects of heavier current quark masses without introducing additional parameters. For the local NJL model, this agreement depends on how the parameters of the model are fit at the physical point. In this respect, the nonlocal version, which, due to its formulation, automatically exhibits the IMC effect around the crossover region, captures the physics more naturally.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Event-Shape Methods in Search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance and parity violation in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The CME-sensitive observable, charge-dependent three-point azimuthal correlator $\Delta\gamma$, is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the particle's elliptic anisotropy $v_2$. Event-shape engineering (ESE) binning events in dynamical fluctuations of $v_2$ and event-shape selection (ESS) binning events in statistical fluctuations of $v_2$ are two methods to search for the CME by projecting $\Delta\gamma$ to the $v_2=0$ intercept. We conduct a systematic study of these two methods using physics models as well as toy model simulations. It is observed that the ESE method requires significantly more statistics than the ESS method to achieve the same statistical precision of the intercept. It is found that the intercept from the ESS method depends on the details of the event content, such as the mixtures of background contributing sources, and thus is not a clean measure of the CME.</description>

      <title>Coordinate versus momentum cuts and effects of collective flow on critical fluctuations</title>

Abstract: We analyze particle number fluctuations in the crossover region near the critical endpoint of a first-order phase transition by utilizing molecular dynamics simulations of the classical Lennard-Jones fluid. We extend our previous study [V.A. Kuznietsov et al., Phys. Rev. C 105, 044903 (2022)] by incorporating longitudinal collective flow. The scaled variance of particle number distribution inside different coordinate and momentum space acceptances is computed through ensemble averaging and found to agree with earlier results obtained using time averaging, validating the ergodic hypothesis for fluctuation observables. Presence of a sizable collective flow is found to be essential for observing large fluctuations from the critical point in momentum space acceptances. We discuss our findings in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Off-lightcone Wilson-line operators in gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Off-lightcone Wilson-line operators are constructed using local operators connected by time-like or space-like Wilson lines, which ensure gauge invariance. Off-lightcone Wilson-line operators have broad applications in various contexts. For instance, space-like Wilson-line operators play a crucial role in determining quasi-distribution functions (quasi-PDFs), while time-like Wilson-line operators are essential for understanding quarkonium decay and production within the potential non-relativistic QCD (pNRQCD) framework. In this work, we establish a systematic approach for calculating the matching from the gradient-flow scheme to the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme in the limit of small flow time for off-lightcone Wilson-line operators. By employing the one-dimensional auxiliary-field formalism, we simplify the matching procedure, reducing it to the matching of local current operators. We provide one-loop level matching coefficients for these local current operators. For the case of hadronic matrix element related to the quark quasi-PDFs, we show at one-loop level that the finite flow time effect is very small as long as the flow radius is smaller than the physical distance $z$, which is usually satisfied in lattice gradient flow computations. Applications include lattice gradient flow computations of quark/gluon quasi-PDFs, gluonic correlators related to quarkonium decay and production in pNRQCD, and spin-dependent potentials in terms of chromoelectric and chromomagnetic field insertions into a Wilson loop.</description>
