      <title>Krylov Complexity, Confinement and Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematic holographic study of Krylov complexity for a wide class of confining quantum field theories. Using the geometric prescription that identifies the time derivative of the complexity with the proper momentum of a massive probe, we analyse radial geodesics in several top-down gravity duals exhibiting confinement and a mass gap. In all geometries with a smooth infrared end-of-space we uncover a robust and universal qualitative feature: Krylov complexity exhibits oscillatory behaviour. The oscillation frequency is controlled by the confinement scale, while the amplitude depends on both the ultraviolet cutoff and the infrared scale. Additional conserved charges modify these patterns without altering their qualitative structure. We further compare our results with the Krylov complexity of the longitudinally perturbed Ising model. The qualitative agreement suggests that oscillatory behaviour of Krylov complexity constitutes a universal signature of confinement and provides a sensitive probe of infrared reorganisation in strongly coupled quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Confining Strings in a Gapless Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of confined strings embedded in a gapless four-dimensional theory. To this end, we examine finite-tension string-like solutions to the equations of motion of the $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1$ non-linear sigma model. We present a comprehensive analysis of the quantum fluctuations around these solutions and derive the corresponding spectrum. These results allow us to determine the quantum corrections to the closed string ground state energy in both the finite- and infinite-size limits. Furthermore, we analyze quantum corrections to the string's effective width. We find that these observables generically depart from the universal predictions of standard Effective String Theory (EST), and we identify specific limits in which the bulk dynamics decouple and EST is recovered. Finally, we discuss the connection between these string configurations and stable electric and magnetic fluxes arising in certain ultraviolet completions of the $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1$ model.</description>

      <title>Baryon Junction and String Interactions: Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study junctions between confining strings. These junctions arise in Yang-Mills theories, and we focus on their universal low-energy dynamics. Using open-closed duality, we map junctions with nonlinear corrections to the $s$-wave scattering amplitudes between confining string loops. In $(3+1)$ dimensions, we uncover an accidental $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. This symmetry implies novel selection rules for loop scattering amplitudes and is broken by the junction mass at subleading order. We determine the total mass of baryons up to order $(\text{baryon size})^{-3}$, providing new, testable predictions for lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons deformations of the gauged O(3) Sigma model on compact surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existence of solutions to the field equations of the gauged Chern-Simons-O(3)-Sigma model on a compact Riemann surface is proved by a topological method. Existence of a minimal deformation constant $\kappa_{*} &gt; 0$ is proved, such that for any prescribed configuration of vortices and antivortices, at least one solution exists for $|\kappa| \leq \kappa_{*}$. For small values of the Chern-Simons deformation parameter $\kappa$, it is proved that the field equations admit multiple solutions, provided the total number of vortices and antivortices are different. The Maxwell limit is computed for solutions of the field equations. In contrast, if the number of vortices equals the number of antivortices, it is proved that the field equations admit at least one solution for any value of $\kappa$ and the limit $\kappa \to \infty$ is proved. dependence of the fields on the deformation parameter is investigated numerically on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Simulating Quantum Field Theories with Boundaries in Curved Spacetimes Using Open Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework to simulate quantum field theories (QFTs) with boundaries in $(1+1)$-dimenmsional curved spacetimes by employing open spin systems. Building upon our previous work that established a mapping from spin systems to QFTs in periodic geometries, we extend the correspondence to systems with boundaries, where boundary conditions play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics. Focusing on Majorana fermions, we derive the allowed boundary conditions from the requirement of inner product conservation and formulate their realization in spin systems. The corresponding spin model is shown to reproduce boundary conditions of QFT accurately when a free function in the spin model is appropriately chosen. As an explicit demonstration, we analyze a flat spacetime example, comparing spectra, mode functions, and linear responses between the continuum and lattice descriptions. Our findings confirm that open spin systems can successfully replicate QFT dynamics with boundaries.</description>

      <title>Renormalized pseudoentropy in dS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study holographic pseudoentropy for subregions in non-unitary Euclidean conformal field theories (CFTs) within the framework of the de Sitter/conformal field theory (dS/CFT) correspondence. Pseudoentropy, defined as the von Neumann entropy of a transition matrix, is computed holographically from codimension-two extremal surfaces in dS space and is divergent due to the asymptotic bulk volume at future infinity. We show that a finite and regulator-independent definition follows from the on-shell action of conformal gravity in four and six dimensions, implemented through the replica construction. We illustrate the formalism for spherical entangling surfaces and small shape deformations thereof. The renormalized pseudoentropy isolates the universal contribution, which for a spherical entangling surface is proportional to the complex-valued central charge $a^\star$ of the non-unitary CFT. On an equal footing, for infinitesimal deformations away from the sphere, we recover, at quadratic order in the deformation parameter, an analytic continuation of the Mezei-like formula in its anti-de Sitter counterpart.</description>

      <title>Moduli-dependent one-loop entropy of hyperbolic BPS black hole in AdS$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study one-loop logarithmic corrections to the entropy of static hyperbolic BPS black holes in asymptotically AdS$_4$ spacetime. Our analysis is carried out in a consistent real-scalar truncation of ${\cal N}=2$ Fayet-Iliopoulos gauged supergravity specified by the prepotential $F=-i X^0 X^1$, which corresponds to an Einstein-Dilaton-Maxwell theory with a nontrivial scalar potential. In this model, the classical BPS attractor mechanism exhibits flat directions, leaving scalar moduli on the black hole horizon unfixed, while the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy depends only on the charges. We show that the resulting one-loop correction to the black hole entropy acquires a nontrivial dependence on the horizon moduli and induces an effective quantum potential that dynamically stabilizes them at a preferred value. Our results provide an explicit and concrete realization of quantum lifting of classical attractor flat directions in gauged supergravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new three-dimensional nonlocal spinor superfield model. This theory is constructed by introducing form factors in the local spinor superfield action. Then, we couple it minimally to a scalar superfield, for which we calculate the one-loop effective potential as a first constructive example of perturbative calculations in this new theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar field theory is studied by constructing interacting saddle point expansions in the symmetric and broken phase, respectively. Focusing on analytically tractable saddle expansions, it is found that broken and symmetric phases are related by sign flip of the quartic coupling. Applications to dimensions $d&lt;4$ recover previous results for the phase diagram, whereas $d=4$ is possibly new.</description>

      <title>Leading singularities of Wilson loop correlators from twistor Wilson loop diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leading singularities of one-loop scattering amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory are known to factorise into products of tree-level amplitudes, and this can be seen from a number of different perspectives e.g. generalised unitarity or on-shell diagrams. Here we investigate the leading singularities from the perspective of the Wilson loop expectation values to which these amplitudes are dual, in particular making use of the twistor Wilson loop formalism. We show that the factorisation of one-loop leading singularities of a null Wilson loop's expectation value into a product of tree-level objects is manifest at the level of twistor Wilson loop diagrams, and is a simple consequence of planarity, without appeal to e.g. unitarity on the amplitude side of the duality. We then use the same approach to derive compact formulae for the one-loop leading singularities of correlators of multiple light-like Wilson loop operators in terms of tree-level objects. Via the chiral box expansion, these formulae provide a simple route to writing down the $O(g^2)$ correlation function of any number of Wilson loops at any MHV degree.</description>

      <title>Sign-Switching Dark Energy: Smooth Transitions with Recent \textit{DESI DR2} Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sign-switching dark energy provides a novel mechanism for modifying the late-time expansion history of the Universe without invoking additional fields or finely tuned initial conditions. In this work, we investigate a class of background--level cosmological models in which the dark energy contribution changes sign at a transition redshift $z_\dagger$, producing a sharp deviation from standard $\Lambda$CDM dynamics. We confront these models with a comprehensive set of cosmological observations, including \textit{Planck 18} cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements, \textit{\textit{DESI DR2}} Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data and the \textit{Pantheon+} $\&amp;$ \textit{SH0ES} Type Ia supernova sample (SN). Using a full Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, we find that the sign-switching scenario significantly alleviates the Hubble tension while obtaining better results when statistically comparing with $\Lambda$CDM, as quantified by the Akaike and Bayesian information Criteria. Although the model is explored only at the background level, the improvement in the inferred Hubble constant demonstrates that sign-switching dark energy offers a promising and physically economical pathway toward resolving late-universe discrepancies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological vector fields are central to many early-Universe phenomena, including inflationary dynamics, primordial magnetogenesis, and dark-matter scenarios. However, constructing models able to generate cosmological magnetic fields while avoiding strong coupling, backreaction, and cosmic microwave background constraints remains challenging. We study a novel mechanism in which brief non--slow-roll phases during inflation amplify primordial magnetic fields at small scales, while maintaining theoretical consistency and observational viability. We incorporate parity-violating interactions in the vector sector and demonstrate, for the first time in a non--slow-roll framework, that chirality can significantly boost magnetic-field amplitudes and imprint distinctive polarization-dependent spectral features. We complement detailed numerical computations with an analytical treatment yielding compact expressions for chiral vector mode functions that reproduce the main spectral properties. We then develop a systematic formalism to evaluate the stochastic gravitational-wave background naturally induced at second order by these amplified fields, identifying both an intensity component and a circularly polarized contribution with characteristic frequency profiles. We discuss detection prospects with future multiband gravitational-wave observatories, showing that chiral signatures could provide a distinctive observational probe. Our results introduce new avenues for enhancing primordial magnetic fields and their associated gravitational-wave signals, opening promising possibilities for their future detection and interpretation, both with cosmological and gravitational wave probes.</description>

      <title>There and back again -- Closed timelike curves as EFT selection principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modified gravity is often approached in the context of effective-field theory (EFT), with the view that the EFT corrections permit a more desirable theory. In this paper, we posit that this should extend to the causal structure of curved spacetime in addition to the standard demands such that of flat spacetime positivity and unitarity. We propose a new guiding principle for modified-gravity theories, namely that closed timelike curves should always be {\it harder} to obtain than in General Relativity. By demanding this, one can place powerful constraints on modified gravity. To elucidate this claim, we investigate modified-gravity EFTs on rotating black-hole backgrounds, focusing on the appearance/disappearance of closed timelike curves, and provide parameter bounds which only partly overlap with other approaches based on time delay. We construct perturbative rotating black-hole solutions in modified-gravity EFTs based on the Horndeski class and provide parameter bounds necessary to preserve causality and stability. Finally, we present a novel probe for the existence of closed timelike curves through quasinormal modes and black-hole echoes. This can be used to diagnose spacetime causality once next-generation gravitational-wave data becomes available.</description>

      <title>Generating the fermion mass hierarchy at the TeV scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a class of theories to generate quark and lepton mass matrices where the scale of new physics is at the TeV scale, without inducing the large flavor and CP violating processes that are often thought to relegate the origin of flavor to energies above $\sim 100$ TeV. The models have new vector-like leptons and quarks, with mass mixings to each other and Yukawa couplings to light Standard Model fields encoded in "chains" reminiscent of dimensional deconstruction. Locality in the chains both generates the hierarchical Standard Model Yukawa matrices, and ensures that CP and flavor violating effects are small, even with the vector-like particles at the TeV scale. A simple extension also generates neutrino masses, whose tiny size is parametrically related to the square of the electron Yukawa coupling. We outline the essential features of these models, explain how fermion mass hierarchies and mixing angles emerge, and explore their phenomenological implications. This framework can be tested both in the final run of the LHC as well as at possible future colliders operating at the 10 TeV scale, and we identify some of the distinctive experimental signatures associated with the production and decay of the new vector-like fermions.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Acceleration from a Simultaneous Variation of Fundamental Constants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of a simultaneous cosmic variation of two fundamental entities: the Newtonian gravitational coupling $G$ and the electron mass $m_e$. We show that this variation can account for the late-time cosmic acceleration without invoking a cosmological constant or an explicit dark-energy fluid. We compare the derived $m_e$ variation with laboratory bounds found from Quasar absorption Spectra. Our results indicate that late-time cosmic acceleration could be a manifestation of evolving fundamental couplings, establishing a direct bridge between precision tests of gravity, particle physics and the origin of cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Decay of a multi-axionic SU(N) symmetric color aether in the early Universe as an origin of emergence of a many-component dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a new SU(N) symmetric model of interaction between the fields of four types: the multiplet of vector fields, which describes the so-called color aether, the multiplet of pseudoscalar fields, which is associated with the multi-component cosmic dark matter, the gauge and gravitational fields. The extended Lagrangian of the model contains a new constructive element, which is based on the covariant SU(N) symmetric divergence of the multiplet of vector fields; this new element, being the multiplet of scalars from the point of view of spacetime transformations and the color vector from the point of view of the SU(N) group space, gives us the possibility to formulate properly the multi-axionic extension of the Peccei-Quinn theory. The hypothesis of a spontaneous polarization of the multi-axionic color aether in the early Universe is presented. The set of self-consistent master equations of the model is derived. An application to cosmology is considered: the obtained master equations are solved for the truncated test model based on the Bianchi-I spacetime platform.</description>

      <title>On type II(D) Einstein spacetimes in six dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After a concise overview of Einstein spacetimes of type II (or more special) in four and five dimensions, we summarize recent results in the six-dimensional case. We assume the optical matrix to be non-degenerate and ``generic'', and the Weyl tensor to fall off sufficiently rapidly at infinity. As it turns out, the most general metric is characterized by one discrete (normalized) and three continuous parameters, is of type D and belongs to the Kerr-Schild class. Its relation to the previously known Kerr-(A)dS and Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metrics is clarified.</description>

      <title>Observation of Robust and Coherent Non-Abelian Hadron Dynamics on Noisy Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real-time evolution of strongly interacting matter remains a frontier of fundamental physics, as classical simulations are hampered by exponential Hilbert space growth and entanglement-driven bottlenecks in tensor networks. This study reports the quantum simulation of hadron dynamics within a $(1+1)$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory using a 156-qubit IBM superconducting processor. Leveraging a hardware-efficient Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) encoding, we simulate the dynamics of the physical degrees of freedom on a $60$-site lattice in the weak-coupling regime, as a crucial step toward the continuum limit. We successfully observe the light-cone propagation of a confined meson and internal oscillations indicative of early-time hadronic breathing modes. Notably, these high-fidelity results were obtained directly from the quantum data via a differential measurement protocol, together with measurement error mitigation, demonstrating a robust pathway for large-scale simulations even on noisy hardware. To validate the results, we benchmarked the quantum algorithm and outcome from the quantum processor against state-of-the-art approximated classical algorithms using CPU -- based on tensor network methods and Pauli propagation method, respectively. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative comparison demonstrating that as the system approaches the weak-coupling or the continuum limit, the quantum processor maintains a consistent structural robustness where classical tensor networks and Pauli propagation methods encounter an onset of exponential complexity or symmetry violations as an artifact of approximation in the algorithm. These results establish a scalable pathway for simulating non-Abelian dynamics on near-term quantum hardware and mark a critical step toward achieving a practical quantum advantage in high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>A contour for the entanglement negativity of bosonic Gaussian states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a contour function for the logarithmic negativity and the logarithm of the moments of the partial transpose of the reduced density matrix for multimode bosonic Gaussian states of a free lattice model. In one spatial dimension, numerical results are obtained for harmonic chains either in the ground state or at finite temperature, by considering, respectively, either a subsystem made by two adjacent or disjoint blocks on the line or a bipartition of the circle. The contour function of the logarithmic negativity diverges only at the entangling points, while the contour function for the logarithm of the moments of the partial transpose is divergent also at the boundary of the bipartite subsystem, as functions of the position. In a two-dimensional conformal field theory, analytic expressions that describe these divergencies are discussed. In one spatial dimension, we explore the partial derivative of the logarithmic negativity of two adjacent intervals with respect to the logarithm of the harmonic ratio of their lengths while their ratio and the other parameters are kept fixed. Considering the ground state of the harmonic chain on the line and in the massive regime, we report numerical results showing that this quantity displays a monotonically decreasing behaviour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the dynamical evolution of spherically symmetric charge free wormholes. We concentrate on two specific examples, both of which exhibit wormhole expansion and wormhole collapse: the Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole, which is sourced by a real massless ghost scalar field, and the quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole in semiclassical gravity (which has a wormhole structure and is not a true black hole), which is sourced by a renormalized energy-momentum tensor. Despite their very different sources, we demonstrate that the dynamics of these two wormholes are remarkably similar. Our analysis focuses on diagrams for the areal radius and components of the energy-momentum tensor. This work also serves as a review, offering a detailed description of how to perform a spherically symmetric dynamical evolution using double null coordinates as well as a review of the static solutions for our two examples.</description>

      <title>CMB anisotropies from cosmic (super)strings in light of ACT DR6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on cosmic string and superstring parameters derived from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. The constraints are obtained via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses of the full \textit{Planck} temperature and polarization data combined with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6). For ordinary cosmic strings, we constrain the string tension $G\mu$, the string wiggliness parameter $\alpha$, and the self-chopping efficiency $\tilde{c}$. For cosmic superstrings, we constrain the fundamental string tension $G\mu_F$, the string coupling $g_s$, and a parameter $w$ describing the volume of the compact extra dimensions. In both cases, we find significantly tighter bounds on the string tension compared to previous analyses, obtaining $2\sigma$ upper limits of $G\mu &lt; 3.66\times10^{-8}$ and $G\mu_F &lt; 1.38\times10^{-8}$. We also discuss the significant prior-dependence of these results. The computational pipeline used in this work, including a modified version of \texttt{CAMB} capable of computing CMB anisotropies sourced by any active network described via unequal-time correlators, is released publicly as \texttt{CAMBactive} \cite{Raidal_CAMBactive_CAMB_extension_2026}.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of a lattice fermion model with symmetric mass generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase structure of a model containing two flavors of massless staggered fermions interacting through two independent four-fermion couplings, UI and UB, formulated on a three-dimensional Euclidean space-time lattice. At UB = 0, this model is known to exhibit a direct second-order quantum phase transition between a massless fermion (MF) phase and a phase in which fermions acquire masses through the mechanism commonly referred to as symmetric mass generation (SMG). We demonstrate that introducing a small nonzero value of UB qualitatively alters this structure: the single exotic transition at UB = 0 splits into two distinct, conventional transitions, separated by an intermediate phase in which fermion masses arise through the standard mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). The first of these is a Gross-Neveu transition separating the MF phase from the SSB-induced massive phase, while the second is a three-dimensional XY transition between the SSB phase and the SMG phase. Using the fermion-bag Monte Carlo method, we verify that the critical exponents associated with both transitions are consistent with the literature, thereby yielding a quantitative characterization of the resulting phase structure of the model.</description>

      <title>De Sitter quantum gravity and the emergence of local algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00111v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum theories of gravity are generally expected to have some degree of non-locality, with familiar local physics emerging only in a particular limit. Perturbative quantum gravity around backgrounds with isometries and compact Cauchy slices provides an interesting laboratory in which this emergence can be explored. In this context, the remaining isometries are gauge symmetries and, as a result, gauge-invariant observables cannot be localized. Instead, local physics can arise only through certain relational constructions.
  We explore such issues below for perturbative quantum gravity around de Sitter space. In particular, we describe a class of gauge-invariant observables which, under appropriate conditions, provide good approximations to certain algebras of local fields. Our results suggest that, near any minimal $S^d$ in dS$_{d+1}$, this approximation can be accurate only over regions in which the corresponding global time coordinate $t$ spans an interval $\Delta t \lesssim O(\ln G^{-1})$. In contrast, however, we find that the approximation can be accurate over arbitrarily large regions of global dS$_{d+1}$ so long as those regions are located far to the future or past of such a minimal $S^d$. This in particular includes arbitrarily large parts of any static patch.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Corrected Hawking Radiation from Near-Extremal Kerr-Newman Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near-extremal black holes have a long AdS$_2$ throat in their near-horizon region. Quantum fluctuations in the throat region are effectively governed by a quantum version of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with matter and are strongly coupled at low temperatures. We investigate how these quantum fluctuations affect the spectrum of emission of particles during Hawking radiation. We systematically consider the cases of Kerr and Kerr-Newman black holes for emission of scalar particles and discuss photon and graviton emission from the Kerr background. We find that at very low temperatures the quantum fluctuations radically change the nature of particle emission. Unlike the generic suppression of particle emission in the spherically symmetric Reissner-Nordstr\"om case, we uncover that for particles with non-vanishing angular momentum, the quantum-corrected emission can be substantially enhanced with respect to the standard semiclassical result.</description>

      <title>Decoherence from quantum spacetime noise: An open-systems framework with application to neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general open-quantum-systems framework to model decoherence induced by stochastic Planck-scale fluctuations of spacetime, focusing on the kappa-Minkowski noncommutative geometry as a representative quantum-gravity scenario. Treating the deformation parameter as Gaussian white noise, we derive a Lindblad-type master equation applicable to arbitrary quantum systems and obtain a distinctive inverse-energy scaling of the decoherence rate, Gamma proportional to E^{-4}. As an illustrative example, we analyze a three-level system motivated by neutrino flavor oscillations and derive closed-form expressions for survival and transition probabilities with spacetime-induced damping. The E^{-4} scaling contrasts sharply with the positive power laws often invoked in quantum-gravity phenomenology and predicts negligible decoherence for high-energy neutrinos consistent with IceCube observations, while implying that the strongest effects arise in the extreme low-energy regime. In this context, the sub-eV-scale energies characteristic of the cosmic neutrino background provide a natural infrared benchmark for illustrating the enhanced sensitivity to quantum-spacetime fluctuations. Our results establish a unified formalism connecting quantum-information methods, open-system dynamics, and quantum-spacetime phenomenology, thereby offering a framework for exploring potential signatures of Planck-scale physics in future low-energy neutrino studies.</description>

Abstract: We explain how to relate the ideas of Carroll geometry, matrix theory on instantonic objects, and infinite boost limits of M-theory. Based on these new insights, we explore the implications for possible holographic constructions involving a de Sitter or flat space bulk. We show that Carroll-like geometry in a hypothetical de Sitter holography mirrors the recently realized important role played by Galilei-like geometry in matrix theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence. This also allows us to generate examples of holography with a Carroll-like bulk.</description>

      <title>Feynman Integral Reduction using Syzygy-Constrained Symbolic Reduction Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for integration-by-parts (IBP) reduction of Feynman integrals with high powers of numerators or propagators, a demanding computational step in evaluating multi-loop scattering amplitudes. The algorithm starts with solving syzygy equations in individual sectors to produce IBP operators that turn seed integrals into IBP equations without artificially raised propagator powers. The IBP operators are expressed in terms of index-shift operators and number operators. We perform row reduction to systematically reshuffle the IBP operators and expose reduction rules with symbolic dependence on the powers of propagators and numerators. When this is insufficient, we produce more symbolic reduction rules by directly solving the linear system of IBP equations in which some propagator/numerator powers are kept symbolic. This linear system is kept small, as the equations are generated from a small set of seed integrals in the neighborhood of the target integral. We stress-test our algorithm against two highly non-trivial examples, namely rank-20 integrals for the double box with an external mass and the massless pentabox. As an application, we revisit the IBP reduction in a calculation of scattering amplitudes for spinning black hole binary systems, which involves two-loop Feynman integrals with complexity greater than 20, and achieve much faster IBP reduction than that of the original calculation.</description>

      <title>Symmetry extension by condensation defects in five-dimensional gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the symmetry structure of five-dimensional Yang-Mills theories with $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ gauge algebra. These theories feature intertwined 0-, 1-, and 2-form symmetries, depending on the global variant one is considering. In the $SU(N)$ theory, there is a mixed 't Hooft anomaly between the instantonic 0-form symmetry and the electric 1-form symmetry. We show that in the $PSU(N)$ theory this translates into a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ extension of the instantonic symmetry, generated by an invertible condensation defect of the magnetic 2-form symmetry. We identify the charged configurations as linked 't Hooft surfaces, while pointlike instanton operators remain insensitive to the extension. We generalize our analysis to the $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_k$ global form and show that similar results hold, embedded now in a 3-group structure for generic $k$. We then apply our findings to $SO(3)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We determine the global form of the enhanced instantonic symmetry of its superconformal UV completion, showing that it arises through a similar symmetry extension mechanism from the parent $E_1$ theory, which is the UV completion of $SU(2)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Finally, we recast our results in the language of the symmetry topological field theory. As a warm-up, we also analyze Maxwell theory, highlighting analogous features involving continuous symmetries and composite currents.</description>

      <title>Towards a Nicolai map for supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of a Nicolai map for minimal supergravity in four dimensions. Such a map would allow for the computation of quantum supergravity correlation functions in terms of flat-space correlators in an effective nonlocal bosonic theory with the help of a nonlinear field transformation, the inverse Nicolai map. Such a map is guaranteed for off-shell global supersymmetry, but local supersymmetry presents at least three obstacles for the construction. Their effects are analyzed in detail, in an attempt to set up a Nicolai map to leading order in the gravitational coupling. We find indications that the conformal factor of the metric obstructs the off-shell construction, suggesting that the unimodular variant of supergravity may do better. The on-shell supersymmetry approach, successful for super-Yang-Mills theory in its critical dimensions, also fails, because the graviton self-interaction cannot be written as a supervariation. Nevertheless, by brute force we obtain a four-parameter first-order Nicolai map fulfilling the free-action condition. For the acid test of determinant matching, however, one needs to push the general ansatz and the perturbative expansion to the second order and to the quantum level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the correspondence between highly excited strings and black holes in the presence of angular momentum. At fixed imaginary angular velocity $\nu$, we show that free strings exhibit a Hagedorn instability due to a thermal-winding mode turning tachyonic. This allows us to determine the exact Hagedorn temperature $\beta_H(\nu)$ for bosonic, type II, and heterotic strings. Using the effective field theory for the thermal-winding mode around the $\nu$-dependent background, we find a novel `rotating string star' saddle (perturbatively in the angular velocity) and study its properties. This configuration describes a self-gravitating bound state of highly excited rotating strings. As in the non-rotating case, the saddle is qualitatively shown to interpolate between the rotating strings phase and a rotating black hole. We also comment on the implications of these results for anti-de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>On the degrees of freedom of spatially covariant vector field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a class of spatially covariant vector field theories on a flat background, where the Lagrangians are constructed as polynomials of first-order derivatives of the vector field. Because Lorentz and $\mathrm{U}(1)$ invariances are broken, such theories generally propagate three degrees of freedom (DOFs): two transverse modes and one longitudinal mode. We examine the conditions under which the additional longitudinal mode is eliminated so that only two DOFs remain. To this end, we perform a Hamiltonian constraint analysis and identify two necessary and sufficient degeneracy conditions that reduce the number of DOFs from three to two. We find three classes of solutions satisfying these degeneracy conditions, corresponding to distinct types of theories. Type-I theories possess one first-class and two second-class constraints, type-II theories have four second-class constraints, and type-III theories contain two first-class constraints. The Maxwell theory is recovered as a special case of the type-III theories, where Lorentz symmetry is restored.</description>

      <title>Holographic CCFT Pseudo-Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the flat/CCFT correspondence, Carrollian conformal field theories (CCFT) in d dimensions are dual to asymptotically flat spacetimes in d+1 dimensions. In this paper, starting from the holographic interpretation of pseudo-entropy in the (A)dS$_3$/CFT$_2$, we show that both extremal spacelike and timelike curves possess a well-defined flat-space limit. The length of these curves can be regarded as the real and imaginary parts of the pseudo-entropy for the underlying field theory, where only the real part has been considered thus far. Our calculations can confirm that the entanglement entropy in the CCFTs is fundamentally pseudo-entropy.</description>

      <title>On Gauge-Invariant Entire-Function Regulators and UV Finiteness in NonLocal Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11756v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We clarify the status of gauge-invariant entire-function regulators in NonLocal Quantum Field Theory. The regulator is implemented as an entire function of the covariant Laplace--Beltrami operator. Working in the background-field formalism and expanding around flat, trivial backgrounds, we show that plane waves diagonalize the d'Alembertian, so that the entire function reduces to a multiplicative form factor in Minkowski momentum space. After Wick rotation, to the Euclidean axis, producing exponential ultraviolet damping in loop integrals without introducing additional poles or branch cuts. Our analysis provides a concise, gauge-covariant justification for the use of entire-function regulators in nonlocal quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Confinement by Monopole Loops in Inhomogeneous Magnetic Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a generalized Polyakov mechanism can lead to confinement at weak coupling in $3+1$ dimensions when the theory is placed in a non-trivial, spatially varying magnetic field background. Depending on the magnitude of the field and the length scale of its spatial variation, the "dual" Schwinger mechanism for monopole-antimonopole pair creation may or may not be operative. At the threshold, monopole loops in the Euclidean description develop an almost flat direction. In this regime, confinement arises in a way similar to the $2+1$ dimensional Polyakov mechanism and the monopoles and antimonopoles are effectively replaced by deconfined "bits" of a monopole loop.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a unitary matrix model with a complex potential with Fisher-Hartwig singularities. We show that the model exhibits finite-$N$ phase transitions. The order of the phase transition is coupling-dependent. At large-$N$, these transitions are replaced by third-order Gross-Witten-Wadia transitions between multiple ungapped phases and a single gapped phase, with transitions between ungapped phases forbidden. At both finite and large $N$, the phases are characterized by the locations of the Fisher-Hartwig singularities in the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative data for Weil-Petersson volumes and intersection numbers using ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a new method was introduced for computing $V_{g,1}(b)$, the Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces of genus $g$ with one geodesic boundary of length $b$, various supersymmetric generalizations of them, as well as analogous quantities in intersection theory. The physical setting is the computation of a certain one-point function in a variety of models of 2D gravity for which there is a double-scaled random matrix model (RMM) description. The method combines perturbative solutions of two ordinary differential equations (ODEs), the Gel'fand-Dikii resolvent equation, and the RMM's string equation. In this paper, we extend the method to extract non-perturbative information about the $V_{g,1}(b)$ (and their analogues) that is naturally contained in the full ODEs, providing an efficient prescription for computing the transseries coefficients of the one-point correlation function, fully incorporating ZZ-brane and FZZT-brane effects, and for the first time, mixed ZZ-FZZT-effects. We use as a case study the (2,3) minimal string, computing perturbative and non-perturbative quantities, comparing them to perturbative results from topological recursion, and to results from the recent non-perturbative topological recursion framework. As a particularly powerful further application we provide general predictions for the large order in $g$ growth of $V_{g,1}(b)$, and apply them to JT gravity, finding agreement with known results, and for analogous quantities in ${N} {=} 1$ JT supergravity, proving a conjecture of Stanford and Witten. Our predictions yield new growth formulae for the cases of ${N} {=} 2$ and ${N}{=}4$ JT supergravity.</description>

Abstract: A single geometric invariant fixes the relative normalization and structure of gravity, Yang-Mills theory, and fermion kinetic terms -- including ghost freedom in the gravitational sector -- without tuning. Our results establish a minimal geometric route to unification that does not rely on extra dimensions or symmetry breaking by hand. Unlike previous gauge-gravity constructions, the relative normalizations and ghost freedom emerge from a single Clifford-algebraic invariant, without explicit symmetry breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the formation, detection and coarse-graining of black holes in AdS/CFT, with an emphasis on the tension between boundary unitarity and the production of mixed state Hawking radiation in the bulk. We construct CFT states dual to black hole formation and evaporation by colliding bulk particle wavepackets at trans-Planckian energy. We propose boundary probes which are able to distinguish small AdS black holes from other states within the microcanonical ensemble. We investigate different coarse-graining prescriptions acting on the evolving CFT state, including averaging over CFT data, Hamiltonians and time windows, and compare their purities to those expected from the bulk semiclassical description. Our results clarify how semiclassical black hole behaviour can arise from an ensemble-averaging of the exact unitary dynamics, and take a step towards a better understanding of coarse-graining in the single-sided black hole information problem.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Scattering in Spinless WQFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the computational framework for gravitational wave - black hole scattering in worldline quantum field theory (WQFT) without spin. Crucially, we prove on general grounds that, in the absence of dissipation, the exponential representation of the $S$-matrix maps -- through a partial-wave transformation -- directly onto the scattering phase shift from black hole perturbation theory (BHPT), indicating an exponentiation of the WQFT amplitude itself in partial-wave space. Computing explicitly, we reproduce the BHPT phase shift without spin up to $O(G^{3})$ from WQFT. While this result is expected, it lays the groundwork for higher-precision analyses involving non-minimal effects. Along the way, we outline our efficient diagram generation technique and include a pedagogical discussion on the computation of the required two-loop integrals.</description>

Abstract: Average of exponential ${\rm Tr}_R e^X$, i.e. of a group rather than an algebra character, in Gaussian matrix model is known to be an amusing generalization of Schur polynomial, where time variables are substituted by traces of products of non-commuting matrices ${\rm Tr} \left(\prod_i A_{k_i}\right)$ and are thus labeled by weak compositions. The entries of matrices $A_k$ are made from extended Laguerre polynomials, what introduces additional difficulties. We describe the generic sum rules, which express arbitrary traces through convolutions of a single Laguerre polynomial $L_{N-1}^1(z_{k_i})$, what is a considerable simplification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1805.05382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an exact Einstein-Maxwell solution constructed by Alekseev and Garcia which describes a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in the magnetic universe of Levi-Civita, Bertotti and Robinson (LCBR). After reviewing the basic properties of this spacetime, we study the ultrarelativistic limit in which the black hole is boosted to the speed of light, while sending its mass to zero. This results in a non-expanding impulsive wave traveling in the LCBR universe. The wave front is a 2-sphere carrying two null point particles at its poles -- a remnant of the structure of the original static spacetime. It is also shown that the obtained line-element belongs to the Kundt class of spacetimes, and the relation with a known family of exact gravitational waves of finite duration propagating in the LCBR background is clarified. In the limit of a vanishing electromagnetic field, one point particle is pushed away to infinity and the single-particle Aichelburg-Sexl pp-wave propagating in Minkowski space is recovered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13714v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement of gravitational waves can provide precision tests of the nature of black holes and compact objects. In this work, we test Giddings' nonviolent nonlocality proposal, which posits that quantum information is transferred via a nonlocal interaction that generates metric perturbations around black holes. In contrast to firewalls, these quantum fluctuations would be spread out over a larger distance range -- up to a Schwarzschild radius away. In this letter, we model the modification to the gravitational waveform from nonviolent nonlocality. We modify the nonspinning EOBNRv2 effective one body waveform to include metric perturbations that are due to a random Gaussian process. We find that the waveform exhibits random deviations which are particularly important in the late inspiral-plunge phase. We find an optimal dephasing parameter for detecting this effect with a principal component analysis. This is particularly intriguing because it predicts random phase deviations across different gravitational wave events, providing theoretical support for hierarchical tests of general relativity. We estimate the constraint on the perturbations in nonviolent nonlocality with events for the LIGO-Virgo network and for a third-generation network.</description>

Abstract: Understanding how well future cosmological experiments can reconstruct the mechanism that generated primordial inhomogeneities is key to assessing the extent to which cosmology can inform fundamental physics. In this work, we apply a quantum metrology tool - the quantum Fisher information - to the squeezed quantum state describing cosmological perturbations at the end of inflation. This quantifies the ultimate precision achievable in parameter estimation, assuming ideal access to early-universe information. By comparing the quantum Fisher information to its classical counterpart - derived from measurements of the curvature perturbation power spectrum alone (homodyne measurement) - we evaluate how close current observations come to this quantum limit. Focusing on the tensor-to-scalar ratio as a case study, we find that the gap between classical and quantum Fisher information grows exponentially with the number of e-folds a mode spends outside the horizon. This suggests the existence of a highly efficient (but presently inaccessible) optimal measurement. Conversely, we show that accessing the decaying mode of inflationary perturbations is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for exponentially improving the inference of the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>New Interpretations of the Cosmological Preference for a Negative Neutrino Mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) show some tension with a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. For one, the cosmological parameters determined by the CMB are at odds with the expansion history determined by latest BAO measurements. In addition, the combined data has placed uncomfortably strong constraints on neutrino mass. Both effects can be interpreted as negative neutrino mass, one describing the change to the expansion history and the other one describing enhanced lensing. In this paper, we show the current tensions can be solved with a single change either to the lensing of the CMB or the expansion of the universe. We show additional lensing could arise from a variety of models with new light fields. However, these models rarely give the same signal in temperature and polarization, giving a concrete test of the scenario. Alternatively, dark sector models can explain the changes to the expansion by changing the evolution of the matter density. These models introduce new forces, giving rise to long range signals in the three-point statistics of galaxies. We discuss a range of other examples which all illustrate the pattern that additional signals should appear if these tensions are explained by beyond the Standard Model physics.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Schild transformation of the Benenti-Francaviglia metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Benenti-Francaviglia (BF) family of metrics provides the most general form of a spacetime metric that admits two mutually commuting Killing vectors and an irreducible Killing tensor. The geodesic equations for the BF family are thus completely integrable by separation of variables. Within this broad class, we explore the Kerr-Schild transformation of a degenerate subclass distinguished by the existence of a shear-free null geodesic congruence. By requiring the deformed metric to preserve the Killing symmetry and circularity, we demonstrate that the deformed metric again falls into the degenerate BF family, modulo the replacement of a single structure function. We apply the present algorithm to ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity and obtain a dyonic generalization of the Chong-Cveti\v{c}-L\"u-Pope rotating black hole solution, by taking the background metric to be a solution of the Einstein-scalar gravity. The present prescription extends to five dimensions, provided that the constant of geodesic motion associated with the extra Killing direction vanishes. The same reasoning applies to the case where the background degenerate BF metric is distorted in a (non)conformal manner. Our formalism offers a unified perspective on the relation between seed and deformed metrics in the Kerr-Schild construction.</description>

Abstract: These proceedings summarise some recent efforts in understanding a class of vector-tensor theories known as {\it bumblebee} models, which spontaneously break local Lorentz and diffeomorphism invariance. Using cosmological perturbation theory on an FLRW background, we find that for non-minimal coupling to gravity, the theory contains a ghost mode unless degeneracy conditions are imposed, after which the model becomes a subset of generalised Proca theory, and the potential is then completely fixed by the background equations. We find a constraint on the bumblebee field from the speed of tensor modes on the order of $10^{-15}$. We go further to show that scalar perturbations do not propagate at the linear level, indicating that the theory is pathological around dynamical cosmological backgrounds, a result which is independent of the form of the potential.</description>

      <title>Ringdown in Vaidya spacetimes: time-dependent frequencies, Penrose limit and time-domain analyses</title>

Abstract: We examine the possible characterization of ringdown waves in a dynamical Vaidya spacetime using the Penrose limit geometry around the dynamical photon sphere. In the case of a static spherically symmetric black hole spacetime, it is known that the quasinormal frequency in the eikonal limit can be characterized by the angular velocity and the Lyapunov exponent for the null geodesic congruence on the orbit of the unstable circular null geodesic. This correspondence can be further backed up by the analysis of the Penrose limit geometry around the unstable circular null geodesic orbit. We try to extend this analysis to a Vaidya spacetime, focusing on the dynamical photon sphere in it. Then we discuss to what extent the Penrose limit geometry can be relevant to the ringdown waves in the Vaidya spacetime, comparing the results with the numerically calculated waveform in the Vaidya spacetime.</description>

      <title>Threshold Resolvent Singularities and the Infrared Structure of Linearized Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a sharp geometric threshold governing the infrared spectral behavior of the spatial Lichnerowicz operator on asymptotically flat three-dimensional manifolds. Let $(M,g)$ be asymptotically flat and let $L=\Delta_L$ denote the spatial Lichnerowicz operator acting on symmetric $2$-tensors. Assume \[ |{\rm Riem}(x)| \lesssim r(x)^{-p} \quad \text{as } r(x)\to\infty. \]
  If $p&gt;3$, curvature is spectrally short-range: $L$ exhibits regular low-energy scattering and zero energy is not singular. At the critical decay \[ |{\rm Riem}(x)| \sim r^{-3}, \] dispersion and curvature balance. Zero enters the essential spectrum, and the weighted resolvent develops a threshold singularity. For $s\in(1/2,1)$, \[ \|\langle r\rangle^{-s}(L-i\varepsilon)^{-1}\langle r\rangle^{-s}\| \gtrsim \varepsilon^{-(1-s)} \quad \text{as } \varepsilon \downarrow 0 . \] Thus, the limiting absorption principle fails at zero energy.
  This singularity provides a spatial spectral mechanism for the infrared sector of linearized gravity. The same inverse-cube scaling governs long-range correlations, irregular low-frequency scattering, and soft gravitational modes. Numerical simulations of a radial model and the full tensor operator confirm that $p=3$ marks a sharp transition between negligible and marginal curvature.
  The associated branch point at zero energy determines late-time relaxation, yielding the universal tail exponent \[ t^{-(2\ell+3)}, \] a spectral consequence of nonzero ADM mass. More generally, in $d$ spatial dimensions, the critical decay \[ |{\rm Riem}(x)| \sim r^{-d} \] forms a universal boundary for curvature-coupled Laplace-type operators, encoding the infrared structure of gravity in the spectral geometry of a Cauchy slice.</description>

      <title>High-order coupling as a driver for Mott insulating behavior in Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a simple holographic model incorporating higher-order coupling terms for electron self-interactions. It can exhibit typical behavior of a Mott insulator, including a metal-insulator transition and a decrease in DC conductivity with the increase of charge density. In the analysis of AC conductivity, a soft gap is generally observed. Notably, when the DC conductivity approaches zero, the AC conductivity reveals a multi-peak structure, which can be attributed to the Mott and charge-transfer gaps observed experimentally in transition metals. With the increase of DC conductivity, the multi-peak structure gradually reverts to soft-gap behavior or even metallic conductivity. The accuracy of the numerical result is guaranteed by $\sigma(\omega\to 0)=\sigma_{DC}$ and sum rules.</description>

      <title>Tropical symmetries of cluster algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms of cluster algebras and show that their induced action on the g-vectors can be realized by tropicalising their action on the homogeneous $\hat{y}$ (or $\mathcal{X}$) variables of a chosen initial cluster. This perspective allows us to interpret the action on g-vectors as a change of coordinates in the tropical setting. Focusing on Grassmannian cluster algebras, we analyse tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms in detail. We derive tropical analogues of the braid group action and the twist map on both g-vectors and tableaux. We introduce the notions of unstable and stable fixed points for quasi-automorphisms, which prove useful for constructing cluster monomials and non-real modules, respectively.
  As an application, we demonstrate that the counts of prime non-real tableaux with a fixed number of columns in $\mathrm{SSYT}(3, [9])$ and $\mathrm{SSYT}(4, [8])$, arising from the braid group action on stable fixed points, are governed by Euler's totient function. Furthermore, we apply our findings to scattering amplitudes in physics, providing a novel interpretation of the square root associated with the four-mass box integral via stable fixed points of quasi-automorphisms of the Grassmannian cluster algebra $\CC[\Gr(4,8)]$.</description>

      <title>A simple mechanism for the enhancement of the inflationary power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The background evolution in two-field inflation can feature two distinct stages, corresponding to the evolution along two successive field directions. When the second stage occurs at a significantly lower energy scale, the inflationary trajectory includes a sharp transition, accompanied by a series of rapid turns in field space. Fluctuations crossing the Hubble horizon during this turning phase can experience amplification by several orders of magnitude. This mechanism is very intuitive and can be implemented even in simple two-field models. It produces a peak in the scalar power spectrum that can lead to significant abundances of primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Quantum Brownian motion with non-Gaussian noises: Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation and nonlinear Langevin equation</title>

Abstract: Building upon the work of Hu, Paz, and Zhang [1,2] on open quantum systems we consider the quantum Brownian motion (QBM) model with one oscillator (position variable $x$) as the system, {\it nonlinearly} coupled to an environment of $N$ harmonic oscillators (with mass $m_n$, natural frequency $\omega_n$, position $q_n$ and momentum $p_n$ variables) in the form $\sum_{n}\left(v_{n1}(x)q_{n}^{k}+v_{n2}(x)p_{n}^{l}\right)$ where $k, l$ are integers (the present work only considers the $k=l=2$ cases). The vertex functions $v_{n1}, v_{n2} $ are of the form $v_{n1}=\lambda C_{n1} f(x), v_{n2}(x)=-\lambda\,C_{n2}m_{n}^{-2}\omega_{n}^{-2}f(x)$ where $C_{n1,2}$ are the coupling constants with the $n$th oscillator, $f(x)$ is any arbitrary function of $x$, and $\lambda$ is a dimensionless constant. Employing the closed-time-path formalism the influence action $S_{IF}$ is calculated using a perturbative expansion in $\lambda$. It is possible to identify the terms in $S_{IF}$ quadratic or higher in $\Delta(s)\equiv f(x_{+}(s))-f(x_{-}(s))$ to constitute the noise kernel, while terms linear in $\Delta$ to that of the dissipation kernel. The non-Gaussian noise kernel gives rise to non-zero three-point correlation function of the corresponding stochastic force. The pathway presented here should be useful for the exploration of \textit{non-Gaussian properties of systems nonlinearly coupled with their environments}; examples in early universe cosmology and in quantum optomechanics (QOM) are mentioned. A modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) is also established, which ensures the consistency of the model and the accuracy of results even at higher perturbative orders. Another result of significance is the derivation of a nonlinear Langevin equation which is expected to be useful for many open quantum system applications.</description>
