      <title>Experimental observation of dynamical blockade between transmon qubits via ZZ interaction engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental realization of strong longitudinal (ZZ) coupling between two superconducting transmon qubits achieved solely through capacitive engineering. By systematically varying the qubit frequency detuning, we measure cross-Kerr inter-qubit interaction strengths ranging from 10 MHz up to 350 MHz, more than an order of magnitude larger than previously observed in similar capacitively coupled systems. In this configuration, the qubits enter a strong-interaction regime in which the excitation of one qubit inhibits that of its neighbor, demonstrating a dynamical blockade mediated entirely by the engineered ZZ coupling. Circuit quantization simulations accurately reproduce the experimental results, while perturbative models confirm the theoretical origin of the energy shift as a hybridization between the computational states and higher-excitation manifolds. We establish a robust and scalable method to access interaction-dominated physics in superconducting circuits, providing a pathway towards solid-state implementations of globally controlled quantum architectures and cooperative many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Sub-domain structure in a single crystal of the magnetic topological insulator MnSb2Te4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The domain structure of a MnSb$_2$Te$_4$ single crystal with a Curie temperature $T_C \approx 45~K$ was studied using the high-resolution Bitter decoration technique. Magnetotransport measurements confirm a soft ferromagnetic ordering with a coercive field of $ \sim 100$ Oe. We revealed the formation of a hierarchical domain structure characterized by two distinct spatial scales. These results indicate the existence of two magnetically weakly coupled subsystems -- surface and bulk. The observed sub-domain structure can be attributed to the formation of a ferromagnetic well due to an inhomogeneous distribution of $\mathrm{Mn_{Sb}}$ antisite defects, with an additional contribution from symmetry breaking in the near-surface layer.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Low-Dimensional Layered Double Perovskites: The Role of the Organic Moieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Halide double perovskites are an interesting alternative to Pb-containing counterparts as active materials in optoelectronic devices. Low-dimensional double perovskites are fabricated by introducing large organic cations, resulting in organic/inorganic architectures with one or more inorganic octahedral layers separated by organic cations. Here, we synthesize layered double perovskites based on 3D Cs2AgBiBr6 that consist of double (2L) or single (1L) inorganic octahedral layers, using ammonium cations of different size and chemical structure. Temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy reveals phase transition signatures in both inorganic lattice and organic moieties by detecting variations in their vibrational modes. Changes in the conformational arrangement of the organic cations to an ordered state coincide with a phase transition in the 1L systems with the shortest ammonium moieties. Significant changes of photoluminescence intensity observed around the transition temperature suggest that optical properties may be deeply affected by the octahedral tilts emerging at the phase transition.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Capacitance Dilatometry of Microscopically Thin Samples Using a Miniature Dilatometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel application of our high-resolution capacitance dilatometer, specifically engineered for the precise characterization of quantum materials. These materials, which often appear as ultrathin, platelet-shaped crystals, are known for exotic phenomena such as superconductivity, topological order and quantum spin liquid. However, these crystals seldom reach macroscopic dimensions, making them unsuitable for conventional dilatometry techniques. By introducing a modified sample-mounting configuration, our design enables high-resolution measurements of thermal expansion and magnetostriction along in-plane crystallographic directions in samples with thicknesses well below 500 $\mu$m. Validation measurements using a Quantum Design PPMS system confirm reliable performance for a 300 $\mu$m-thick silver platelet, relatively hard ferromagnetic EuB$_6$ single crystals down to 50 $\mu$m, and a 40 $\mu$m-thin, soft AgCrS$_2$ single crystal. This advancement significantly broadens the applicability of capacitance dilatometry, providing a powerful platform for investigating emergent phenomena in reduced-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Anderson insulator and reentrant topological transitions in a mosaic trimer lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topological properties of a one-dimensional quasiperiodic-potential-modulated mosaic trimer lattice. To begin with, we first investigate the topological properties of the model in the clean limit free of quasiperiodic disorder based on analytical derivation and numerical calculations of the Zak phase $Z$ and the polarization $P$. Two nontrivial topological phases corresponding to the $1/3$ filling and $2/3$ filling, respectively, are revealed. Then we incorporate the mosaic modulation and investigate the influence of quasiperiodic disorder on the two existing topological phases. Interestingly, it turns out that quasiperiodic disorder gives rise to multiple distinct effects for different fillings. At $2/3$ filling, the topological phase is significantly enhanced by the quasiperiodic disorder and topological Anderson insulator emerges. Based on the calculations of polarization and energy gap, we explicitly present corresponding topological phase diagram in the $\lambda-J$ plane. While for the $1/3$ filling case, % the topological phase is dramatically suppressed by the same quasiperiodic disorder. the quasiperiodic disorder dramatically compresses the topological phase, and strikingly, further induces the emergence of reentrant topological phase transitions instead. Furthermore, we verify the topological phase diagrams by computing the many-body ground state fidelity susceptibility for both the $1/3$ filling and $2/3$ filling cases. Our work exemplifies the diverse roles of quasiperiodic disorder in the modulation of topological properties, and will further inspire more research on the competitive and cooperative interplay between topological properties and quasiperiodic disorder.</description>

      <title>Nanoparticle Self-assembly Assisted by Polymers: The Role of Shear Stress in the Nanoparticle Arrangement of Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to use the self-assembly ability of a block copolymer combined with compression-expansion cycles to obtain CdSe quantum dots (QDs) structures of different morphology. The methodology proposed consists in transferring onto mica mixed Langmuir monolayers of QDs and the polymer poly (styrene-co-maleic anhydride) partial 2 buthoxy ethyl ester cumene terminated, PS-MA-BEE, previously sheared by 50 compression-expansion cycles. Results indicate that the shear stress takes out nanoparticles at the air-water interface from metastable states and promoted a new equilibrium state of the Langmuir monolayer, then it was transferred onto mica by the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) methodology and the morphology of the LB films was analyzed by Atomic Force Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy measurements. Our results show that when the amplitude strain increases the QDs domain size decreases and the LB film becomes more ordered. The dynamic of the monolayer relaxation after cycling involves at least three timescales which are related to the damping of surface fluctuation, raft rearrangement and component movements inside each raft. Brewster Angle Microscopy allowed visualizing in situ the raft rearrangement at the air-water interface.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Tip-Sample Distance Behavior on the Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy of Graphene in Ambient Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) combines Raman spectroscopy with scanning probe microscopy to overcome the spatial resolution limitation imposed by light diffraction, offering a primary optical technique for the comprehensive study of two-dimensional (2D) materials. In this work, we investigate an anomalous decay profile of the TERS intensity of the graphene 2D band as the tip-sample separation changes, observations enabled by high TERS efficiency and accuracy in tip-approach and tip-retract procedures. The anomalous results can be properly described by the addition of an ad hoc deformation to the effective tip-sample distance, rationalized here as due to the presence of a liquid meniscus formed via capillary forces.</description>

      <title>Gibbs Sampling gives Quantum Advantage at Constant Temperatures with O(1)-Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01516v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from Gibbs states -- states corresponding to system in thermal equilibrium -- has recently been shown to be a task for which quantum computers are expected to achieve super-polynomial speed-up compared to classical computers, provided the locality of the Hamiltonian increases with the system size (Bergamaschi et al., arXiv: 2404.14639). We extend these results to show that this quantum advantage still occurs for Gibbs states of Hamiltonians with O(1)-local interactions at constant temperature by showing classical hardness-of-sampling and demonstrating such Gibbs states can be prepared efficiently using a quantum computer. In particular, we show hardness-of-sampling is maintained even for 5-local Hamiltonians on a 3D lattice. We additionally show that the hardness-of-sampling is robust when we are only able to make imperfect measurements.</description>

      <title>Non-linear anomalous Edelstein response at altermagnetic interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In altermagnets, time-reversal symmetry breaking spin-polarizes electronic states, while total magnetization remains zero. In addition, at altermagnetic surfaces Rashba-spin orbit coupling is activated due to broken inversion symmetry, introducing a competing spin-momentum locking interaction. Here we show that their interplay leads to the formation of complex, chiral spin textures that offer novel, non-linear spin-to-charge conversion properties. Whereas altermagnetic order suppresses the canonical linear in-plane Rashba-Edelstein response, we establish the presence of an \textit{anomalous} transversal Edelstein effect for planar applied electric and magnetic field, or alternatively, an in-plane magnetization. Additionally, we predict a purely electric-field-driven non-linear out-of-plane magnetization. We compute the anomalous response within a general altermagnet $d$-wave model, with parameters extracted from the ab-initio electronic structure of an altermagnetic bilayer. Our results suggest altermagnetic surfaces as a promising platform for unconventional spintronic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Geometry Induced Localization and Multifractality in Spiral quasiperiodic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a quasiperiodic Aubry Andre lattice arranged along a spiral curve. In this setup, the changing angle of the spiral naturally stretches and compresses the distances between neighboring sites, which in turn modulates the hopping amplitudes.
  The onsite potential itself remains the familiar AA form, but this geometry induced variation in the hopping dramatically changes how the system behaves both in its energy spectrum and in how its states localize.Using inverse participation ratios together with a full multifractal analysis, we find that curvature makes the system localize much more easily, even at relatively small quasiperiodic strengths. It also produces clear windows where the eigenstates become strongly multifractal. This shows that quasiperiodicity and geometry do not act independently rather, they reinforce one another in shaping the wavefunctions. Overall, we observe a smooth evolution of the states from extended, to multifractal, and finally to strongly localized. Our results pave the way for creating tunable quasiperiodic and geometry-driven localization effects in photonic waveguide arrays, ultracold atoms, mechanical metamaterials, and nanoscale platforms.</description>
