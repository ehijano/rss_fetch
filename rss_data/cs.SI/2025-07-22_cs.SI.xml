      <title>Belief Alignment vs Opinion Leadership: Understanding Cross-linguistic Digital Activism in K-pop and BLM Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internet has transformed activism, giving rise to more organic, diverse, and dynamic social movements that transcend geo-political boundaries. Despite extensive research on the role of social media and the internet in cross-cultural activism, the fundamental motivations driving these global movements remain poorly understood. This study examines two plausible explanations for cross-cultural activism: first, that it is driven by influential online opinion leaders, and second, that it results from individuals resonating with emergent sets of beliefs, values, and norms. We conduct a case study of the interaction between K-pop fans and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement on Twitter following the murder of George Floyd. Our findings provide strong evidence that belief alignment, where people resonate with common beliefs, is a primary driver of cross-cultural interactions in digital activism. We also demonstrate that while the actions of potential opinion leaders--in this case, K-pop entertainers--may amplify activism and lead to further expressions of love and admiration from fans, they do not appear to be a direct cause of activism. Finally, we report some initial evidence that the interaction between BLM and K-pop led to slight increases in their overall belief similarity.</description>

      <title>WhatsApp Tiplines and Multilingual Claims in the 2021 Indian Assembly Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WhatsApp tiplines, first launched in 2019 to combat misinformation, enable users to interact with fact-checkers to verify misleading content. This study analyzes 580 unique claims (tips) from 451 users, covering both high-resource languages (English, Hindi) and a low-resource language (Telugu) during the 2021 Indian assembly elections using a mixed-method approach. We categorize the claims into three categories, election, COVID-19, and others, and observe variations across languages. We compare content similarity through frequent word analysis and clustering of neural sentence embeddings. We also investigate user overlap across languages and fact-checking organizations. We measure the average time required to debunk claims and inform tipline users. Results reveal similarities in claims across languages, with some users submitting tips in multiple languages to the same fact-checkers. Fact-checkers generally require a couple of days to debunk a new claim and share the results with users. Notably, no user submits claims to multiple fact-checking organizations, indicating that each organization maintains a unique audience. We provide practical recommendations for using tiplines during elections with ethical consideration of users' information.</description>

      <title>SASH: Decoding Community Structure in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of communities in a graph entails identifying clusters of densely connected vertices; the area has a variety of important applications and a rich literature. The problem has previously been situated in the realm of error correcting codes by viewing a graph as a noisy version of the assumed underlying communities. In this paper, we introduce an encoding of community structure along with the resulting code's parameters. We then present a novel algorithm, SASH, to decode to estimated communities given an observed dataset. We demonstrate the performance of SASH via simulations on an assortative planted partition model and on the Zachary's Karate Club dataset.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Data-centric Overview of Federated Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of big data applications, Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has emerged as a prominent solution that reconcile the tradeoff between optimizing the collective intelligence between decentralized datasets holders and preserving sensitive information to maximum. Existing FGL surveys have contributed meaningfully but largely focus on integrating Federated Learning (FL) and Graph Machine Learning (GML), resulting in early stage taxonomies that emphasis on methodology and simulated scenarios. Notably, a data centric perspective, which systematically examines FGL methods through the lens of data properties and usage, remains unadapted to reorganize FGL research, yet it is critical to assess how FGL studies manage to tackle data centric constraints to enhance model performances. This survey propose a two-level data centric taxonomy: Data Characteristics, which categorizes studies based on the structural and distributional properties of datasets used in FGL, and Data Utilization, which analyzes the training procedures and techniques employed to overcome key data centric challenges. Each taxonomy level is defined by three orthogonal criteria, each representing a distinct data centric configuration. Beyond taxonomy, this survey examines FGL integration with Pretrained Large Models, showcases realistic applications, and highlights future direction aligned with emerging trends in GML.</description>

      <title>Network Analytics for Anti-Money Laundering -- A Systematic Literature Review and Experimental Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19383v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Money laundering presents a pervasive challenge, burdening society by financing illegal activities. The use of network information is increasingly being explored to effectively combat money laundering, given it involves connected parties. This led to a surge in research on network analytics for anti-money laundering (AML). The literature is, however, fragmented and a comprehensive overview of existing work is missing. This results in limited understanding of the methods to apply and their comparative detection power. This paper presents an extensive and unique literature review, based on 97 papers from Web of Science and Scopus, resulting in a taxonomy following a recently proposed fraud analytics framework. We conclude that most research relies on expert-based rules and manual features, while deep learning methods have been gaining traction. This paper also presents a comprehensive framework to evaluate and compare the performance of prominent methods in a standardized setup. We compare manual feature engineering, random walk-based, and deep learning methods on two publicly available data sets. We conclude that (1) network analytics increases the predictive power, but caution is needed when applying GNNs in the face of class imbalance and network topology, and that (2) care should be taken with synthetic data as this can give overly optimistic results. The open-source implementation facilitates researchers and practitioners to extend this work on proprietary data, promoting a standardised approach for the analysis and evaluation of network analytics for AML.</description>

      <title>Why We Experience Society Differently: Intrinsic Dispositions as Drivers of Ideological Complexity in Adaptive Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of inequality in complex systems requires attention to both structural dynamics and intrinsic heterogeneity. In the context of opinion dynamics, traditional models relied on static snapshots or assumed homogeneous agent behavior, overlooking how diverse cognitive dispositions shape belief evolution. While some recent models introduce behavioral heterogeneity, they typically focus on macro-level patterns, neglecting the unequal and individualized dynamics that unfold at the agent level. In this study, we analyze an adaptive social network model where each agent exhibits one of three behavioral tendencies-homophily, neophily (attention to novelty), or social conformity-and measure the complexity of individual opinion trajectories using normalized Lempel-Ziv (nLZ) complexity. We find that the resulting dynamics are often counterintuitive-homophilic agents, despite seeking similarity, become increasingly unpredictable; neophilic agents, despite pursuing novelty, stabilize; and conformic agents follow a U-shaped trajectory, transitioning from early stability to later unpredictability. More fundamentally, these patterns remain robust across diverse network settings, showing that internal behavioral dispositions - not external environment - primarily govern long-term opinion unpredictability. The broader implication is that individuals' experiences of ideological volatility, uncertainty, or stability are not merely environmental, but endogenously self-structured through their own cognitive tendencies. These results establish a novel individual-level lens on opinion dynamics, where the behavioral identity of agents serves as a dynamical fingerprint in the evolution of belief systems, and gives rise to persistent disparities in dynamical experience within self-organizing social systems, even in structurally similar environments.</description>

      <title>MindVote: When AI Meets the Wild West of Social Media Opinion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Authentic opinion prediction in social contexts presents a complex challenge that requires the seamless integration of three distinct cognitive capabilities: domain adaptation, cultural schema activation, and contextual scaffolding. The core difficulty is that no existing opinion prediction benchmark, particularly in a poll-based setting, compels a Large Language Model (LLM) to integrate all three capabilities, leaving a critical gap in our ability to evaluate genuine social understanding. Drawing from cognitive science principles, we introduce MindVote, the first benchmark evaluating poll prediction within naturalistic social media discourse. We construct MindVote from 3,918 authentic polls across Reddit and Weibo, incorporating rich contextual metadata that traditional survey-based benchmarks ignored. Our evaluation reveals three theoretical phenomena that validate cognitive science hypotheses: formal discourse privilege, where models achieve higher performance on institutional than on vernacular discourse; semantic space colonization, demonstrating performance biases favoring English content beyond translation artifacts; and contextual scaffolding dependencies, with performance degradation when social context is removed. These findings expose limitations in models, close the gaps of current opinion prediction benchmarks and advocate for developing socially-grounded AI systems with authentic cross-cultural opinion prediction. Our code and data are available in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/mindvote-8DBC/.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Coordinated Online Behavior: Trade-offs and Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coordinated online behavior, which spans from beneficial collective actions to harmful manipulation such as disinformation campaigns, has become a key focus in digital ecosystem analysis. Traditional methods often rely on monomodal approaches, focusing on single types of interactions like co-retweets or co-hashtags, or consider multiple modalities independently of each other. However, these approaches may overlook the complex dynamics inherent in multimodal coordination. This study compares different ways of operationalizing the detection of multimodal coordinated behavior. It examines the trade-off between weakly and strongly integrated multimodal models, highlighting the balance between capturing broader coordination patterns and identifying tightly coordinated behavior. By comparing monomodal and multimodal approaches, we assess the unique contributions of different data modalities and explore how varying implementations of multimodality impact detection outcomes. Our findings reveal that not all the modalities provide distinct insights, but that with a multimodal approach we can get a more comprehensive understanding of coordination dynamics. This work enhances the ability to detect and analyze coordinated online behavior, offering new perspectives for safeguarding the integrity of digital platforms.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Multimodal News Recommendation through Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalized News Recommendation systems (PNR) have emerged as a solution to information overload by predicting and suggesting news items tailored to individual user interests. However, traditional PNR systems face several challenges, including an overreliance on textual content, common neglect of short-term user interests, and significant privacy concerns due to centralized data storage. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a novel multimodal federated learning-based approach for news recommendation. First, it integrates both textual and visual features of news items using a multimodal model, enabling a more comprehensive representation of content. Second, it employs a time-aware model that balances users' long-term and short-term interests through multi-head self-attention networks, improving recommendation accuracy. Finally, to enhance privacy, a federated learning framework is implemented, enabling collaborative model training without sharing user data. The framework divides the recommendation model into a large server-maintained news model and a lightweight user model shared between the server and clients. The client requests news representations (vectors) and a user model from the central server, then computes gradients with user local data, and finally sends their locally computed gradients to the server for aggregation. The central server aggregates gradients to update the global user model and news model. The updated news model is further used to infer news representation by the server. To further safeguard user privacy, a secure aggregation algorithm based on Shamir's secret sharing is employed. Experiments on a real-world news dataset demonstrate strong performance compared to existing systems, representing a significant advancement in privacy-preserving personalized news recommendation.</description>

      <title>Beyond English: Evaluating Automated Measurement of Moral Foundations in Non-English Discourse with a Chinese Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores computational approaches for measuring moral foundations (MFs) in non-English corpora. Since most resources are developed primarily for English, cross-linguistic applications of moral foundation theory remain limited. Using Chinese as a case study, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of applying English resources to machine translated text, local language lexicons, multilingual language models, and large language models (LLMs) in measuring MFs in non-English texts. The results indicate that machine translation and local lexicon approaches are insufficient for complex moral assessments, frequently resulting in a substantial loss of cultural information. In contrast, multilingual models and LLMs demonstrate reliable cross-language performance with transfer learning, with LLMs excelling in terms of data efficiency. Importantly, this study also underscores the need for human-in-the-loop validation of automated MF assessment, as the most advanced models may overlook cultural nuances in cross-language measurements. The findings highlight the potential of LLMs for cross-language MF measurements and other complex multilingual deductive coding tasks.</description>
