      <title>Flow methods for cooperative games with generalized coalition configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the class of cooperative games with generalized coalition configuration. This new class of games corresponds to cooperative games with coalition configuration and restricted cooperation. A coalition configuration is a collection of coalitions covering the agent set. The restriction of cooperation between agents is represented by a set system on each element of the coalition configuration. A coalition profile is a list of feasible coalitions, one for each element of the coalition configuration. A coalition profile function associates a worth with each coalition profile. Based on this framework, we define and axiomatically characterize marginal values whose coefficients induce a unitary flow on the product digraph obtained from these set systems. Next, we propose a two-step procedure, inspired by Owen's procedure, to construct flow methods as above. Then, we show that the associated flow is decomposable into two flows. Finally, we use two axioms to characterize the flows that can be decomposed in this way, and hence the flow methods constructed using our procedure.</description>

      <title>Non-Allais Paradox and Context-Dependent Risk Attitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide and axiomatize a representation of preferences over lotteries that generalizes the expected utility model. Our representation is consistent with the violations of the independence axiom that we observe in the laboratory experiment that we conduct. The violations differ from the Allais Paradox in that they are incompatible with some of the most prominent non-expected utility models. Our representation can be interpreted as a decision-maker with context-dependent attitudes to risks and allows us to generate various types of realistic behavior. We analyze some properties of our model, including specifications that ensure preferences for first-order stochastic dominance. We test whether subjects in our experiment exhibit the type of context-dependent risk attitudes that arise in our model.</description>

      <title>Strategic Ambiguity in Global Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12263v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In games with incomplete and ambiguous information, rational behavior depends not only on fundamental ambiguity (ambiguity about states) but also on strategic ambiguity (ambiguity about others' actions), which further induces hierarchies of ambiguous beliefs. We study the impacts of strategic ambiguity in global games and demonstrate the distinct effects of ambiguous-quality and low-quality information. Ambiguous-quality information makes more players choose an action yielding a constant payoff, whereas (unambiguous) low-quality information makes more players choose an ex-ante best response to the uniform belief over the opponents' actions. If the ex-ante best-response action yields a constant payoff, sufficiently ambiguous-quality information induces a unique equilibrium, whereas sufficiently low-quality information generates multiple equilibria. In applications to financial crises, we show that news of more ambiguous quality triggers a debt rollover crisis, whereas news of less ambiguous quality triggers a currency crisis.</description>

      <title>Matching Design with Sufficiency and Applications to Child Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many local foster care systems across the United States, child welfare practitioners struggle to effectively match children in need of a home to foster families. We tackle this problem while navigating a key sensitivity in this domain: in foster care systems, individual caseworkers must assent to any proposed matching. We codify this constraint in one-sided matching markets as the problem of matching design with sufficiency. We design a mechanism that guarantees outcome sufficiency, a form of welfare-maximizing Pareto efficiency ensuring that no caseworker can ex-post gain from any child-family placement reassignment and that the foster care authority's objective preferences for child-family placements are maximally satisfied. Our work subsequently evaluates this mechanism's strategic properties. Finally, we plan to conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment to elicit real-world caseworkers' preferences and estimate the child welfare gains our algorithm produces. Current simulation-based results show dramatic improvements to welfare. Designing sufficient matching systems is an example of mechanism-reform because replacing existing systems without regard for existing agents' preferences and wishes has previously resulted in failure.</description>
