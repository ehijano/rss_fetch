      <title>Degeneracy and metallic character in free and confined weakly coupled plasmas: with and without electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incidental degeneracy and metallic character is probed for weakly coupled plasmas in free and confined environments. The generality of incidental degeneracy in quantum mechanical systems is discussed and demonstrated. It is a fundamental property of free and confined quantum systems. In plasmas, at a given $n, \ell$state there exists $\frac{(n-\ell)(n-\ell+1)}{2}$ number of incidental degenerate states. Such degeneracy condition involves shell confinement model, where a particleis encaged inside two concentric sphere. Apart from that, Dipole oscillator strength and polarizability are examined in free and confined conditions for ground and some low-lying $\ell$ states. In excited states, negative $\alpha^{(1)}$ is recorded. Further, metallic behavior of H-like plasmas is investigated. The impact of external static electric field on these degeneracy, dipole OS, dipole polarizability are examined with utmost interest. Pilot calculation are done with, (i) Debye plasmas and, (ii) Exponential screened coulomb potentials employing the Generalized pseudo-spectral (GPS) method.</description>

      <title>Transport theory in moderately anisotropic plasmas: I, Collisionless aspects of axisymmetric velocity space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel transport theory, based on the finitely distinguishable independent features (FDIF) hypothesis, is presented for scenarios when velocity space exhibits axisymmetry. In this theory, the transport equations are derived from the 1D-2V Vlasov equation, employing the Spherical harmonics expansions (SHE) coupled with the King function expansion (KFE) in velocity space. The characteristic parameter equations (CPEs) are provided based on the King mixture model (KMM), serving as the constraint equations of the transport equations. It is a nature process to present the closure relations of transport equations based on SHE and KFE, successfully providing a kinetic moment-closed model (KMCM). This model is typically a nonlinear system, effective for moderately anisotropic nonequilibrium plasmas.</description>

      <title>Intermingled open and closed magnetic field lines near the radial origin of the heliospheric current sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. To investigate the magnetic field geometry and waves in the region near the Sun where the heliospheric current sheet is formed. Methods. One good example of apparent open and closed field lines was found and its fields and plasmas were analyzed. Results. The radial component of the magnetic field (the Z-component) measured on the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) changed sign between 12:00 and 13:00 UT on March 30, 2024, when the spacecraft was at 13 solar radii. This sign change may have occurred because the spacecraft crossed the heliospheric current sheet on long open magnetic field lines or it may have occurred because the spacecraft crossed from one side of the equator to the other on much shorter closed magnetic field lines. During this crossing, two distinct regions having different magnetic field geometries, strahl flows, plasma densities, and electric field spectra were observed and identified as regions with open and closed magnetic field lines, respectively. The two regions intermingled on time scales less than 100 milliseconds to create a complex magnetic field geometry. The waves observed in both regions were electrostatic and composed of wide band signatures (in the open field lines regions) and well-structured frequency harmonics (in both the open and closed field lines regions). These harmonic frequencies correlated with the proton plasma frequency, fpp, with the lowest frequency at ~0.1fpp. This result plus the field aligned electric field perturbations and plasma density fluctuations, require that the observed intense electrostatic mode and associated harmonics were ion acoustic waves. The absence of broadband electrostatic signals in closed field line regions is explained by the lower (than in open field line regions) hot and core electron density and higher ratio of the electron plasma frequency to the electron gyrofrequency, suppressing wave generation.</description>

      <title>Surrogate-based multilevel Monte Carlo methods for uncertainty quantification in the Grad-Shafranov free boundary problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a hybrid technique to quantify the variability in the numerical solutions to a free boundary problem associated with magnetic equilibrium in axisymmetric fusion reactors amidst parameter uncertainties. The method aims at reducing computational costs by integrating a surrogate model into a multilevel Monte Carlo method. The resulting surrogate-enhanced multilevel Monte Carlo methods reduce the cost of simulation by factors as large as $10^4$ compared to standard Monte Carlo simulations involving direct numerical solutions of the associated Grad-Shafranov partial differential equation. Accuracy assessments also show that surrogate-based sampling closely aligns with the results of direct computation, confirming its effectiveness in capturing the behavior of plasma boundary and geometric descriptors.</description>

      <title>Helicity effect on turbulent passive and active scalar diffusivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent flows are known to produce enhanced effective magnetic and passive scalar diffusivities, which can fairly accurately be determined with numerical methods. It is now known that, if the flow is also helical, the effective magnetic diffusivity is reduced relative to the nonhelical value. Neither the usual second-order correlation approximation nor the various $\tau$ approaches have been able to capture this. Here we show that the helicity effect on the turbulent passive scalar diffusivity works in the opposite sense and leads to an enhancement. This effect has not previously been seen. We have also demonstrated that the correlation time of the turbulent velocity field increases by the kinetic helicity. This is a key point in the theoretical interpretation of the obtained numerical results. Simulations in which helicity is being produced self-consistently by stratified rotating turbulence, resulted in a turbulent passive scalar diffusivity that was found to be decreasing with increasing rotation rate.</description>

Abstract: We propose a preliminary analytical procedure in 4 steps (based on an improved fully relativistic plane hydrodynamic model) to tailor the initial density of a cold diluted plasma to the laser pulse profile so as to control wave-breaking (WB) of the plasma wave and maximize the acceleration of small bunches of electrons self-injected by the first WB at the density down-ramp.</description>

      <title>Using Deep Learning to Design High Aspect Ratio Fusion Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of fusion devices is typically based on computationally expensive simulations. This can be alleviated using high aspect ratio models that employ a reduced number of free parameters, especially in the case of stellarator optimization where non-axisymmetric magnetic fields with a large parameter space are optimized to satisfy certain performance criteria. However, optimization is still required to find configurations with properties such as low elongation, high rotational transform, finite plasma beta, and good fast particle confinement. In this work, we train a machine learning model to construct configurations with favorable confinement properties by finding a solution to the inverse design problem, that is, obtaining a set of model input parameters for given desired properties. Since the solution of the inverse problem is non-unique, a probabilistic approach, based on mixture density networks, is used. It is shown that optimized configurations can be generated reliably using this method.</description>

      <title>General relaxation model for a homogeneous plasma with spherically symmetric velocity space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A kinetic moment-closed model, derived from the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) equation with spherically symmetric velocity space, is introduced as a general relaxation model for homogeneous plasma. The closed form of this model is presented by introducing a set new functions called $R$ function and $R$ integration. This nonlinear model, based on the finitely distinguishable independent features (FDIF) hypothesis, allows the ability to capture the nature of equilibrium state. From this relaxation model, a general temperature relaxation model is derived and the general characteristic frequency of temperature relaxation when velocity space exhibits spherical symmetry is presented.</description>

      <title>Quarks to Cosmos: Particles and Plasma in Cosmological evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe in the context of the particle physics (PP) standard model (SM) `PP-SM' the understanding of the primordial properties and composition of the Universe in the temperature range $130\GeV&gt;T&gt;20\keV$. The Universe evolution is described using FLRW cosmology. We present a global view on particle content across time and describe the different evolution eras using deceleration parameter $q$. We follow the arrow of time in the expanding and cooling Universe: After the PP-SM heavies $(t, h, W, Z)$ diminish in abundance below $T\simeq 50\GeV$, the PP-SM plasma in the Universe is governed by the strongly interacting Quark-Gluon content. Once the temperature drops below $T\simeq 150\MeV$, quarks and gluons hadronize into strongly interacting matter particles. Rapid disappearance of baryonic antimatter completes at $T_\mathrm{B}=38.2\MeV$. We study the ensuing disappearance of strangeness and mesons in general. We show that the different eras defined by particle populations are barely separated from each other with abundance of muons fading out just prior to $T=\mathcal{O}(2.5)\MeV$, the era of emergence of the free-streaming neutrinos. We discuss the two relevant fundamental constants controlling the decoupling of neutrinos. We subsequently follow the primordial Universe as it passes through the hot dense electron-positron plasma epoch. The high density of positron antimatter disappears near $T=20.3\keV$: Nuclear reactions occur in the presence of a highly mobile and relatively strongly interacting electron-positron plasma phase. We apply plasma theory methods to describe the strong screening effects between heavy dust particle (nucleons). We analyze the paramagnetic characteristics of the electron-positron plasma when exposed to an external primordial magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection-driven energization of protons up to 400 keV at the near-Sun heliospheric current sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report observations of direct evidence of energetic protons being accelerated above ~400 keV within the reconnection exhaust of a heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossing by NASA's Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at a distance of ~16.25 solar radii (Rs) from the Sun. Inside the extended exhaust, both the reconnection-generated plasma jets and the accelerated protons propagated toward the Sun, unambiguously establishing their origin from HCS reconnection sites located beyond PSP. Within the core of the exhaust, PSP detected stably trapped energetic protons up to ~400 keV, which is approximately 1000 times greater than the available magnetic energy per particle. The differential energy spectrum of the accelerated protons behaved as a pure power-law with spectral index of about -5. Supporting simulations using the kglobal model suggest that the trapping and acceleration of protons up to ~400 keV in the reconnection exhaust is likely facilitated by merging magnetic islands with a guide field between ~0.2-0.3 of the reconnecting magnetic field, consistent with the observations. These new results, enabled by PSP's proximity to the Sun, demonstrate that magnetic reconnection in the HCS is a significant new source of energetic particles in the near-Sun solar wind. The discovery of in-situ particle acceleration via magnetic reconnection at the HCS provides valuable insights into this fundamental process which frequently converts the large magnetic field energy density in the near-Sun plasma environment and may be responsible for heating the sun's atmosphere, accelerating the solar wind, and energizing charged particles to extremely high energies in solar flares.</description>
