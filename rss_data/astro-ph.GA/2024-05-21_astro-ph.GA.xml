      <title>AGN populations in the local universe: their alignment with the main-sequence, characteristics of their stellar populations, accretion efficiency, and the impact of AGN feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we utilize a sample of 338 galaxies within the redshift range of $\rm 0.02&lt;z&lt;0.1$, drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), for which there are available classifications, based on their emission line ratios. We, further, identify and select Compton-thick (CT) AGN through the use of X-ray and infrared luminosities at $12\,\mu m$. We construct the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for all sources and fit them using the CIGALE code to derive properties related to both the AGN and host galaxies. Employing stringent criteria to ensure the reliability of SED measurements, our final sample comprises 14 CT AGN, 118 Seyfert 2 (Sy2), 82 composite, and 124 LINER galaxies. Our analysis reveals that, irrespective of their classification, the majority of the sources lie below the star-forming main-sequence (MS). Additionally, a lower level of AGN activity is associated with a closer positioning to the MS. Utilizing the D$_n$4000 spectral index as a proxy for the age of stellar populations, we observe that LINERs exhibit the oldest stellar populations compared to other AGN classes. Conversely, CT sources are situated in galaxies with the youngest stellar populations. Furthermore, LINER and composite galaxies tend to show the lowest accretion efficiency, while CT AGN, on average, display the most efficient accretion among the four AGN populations. Our findings are consistent with a scenario in which the different AGN populations might not originate from the same AGN activity burst. Early triggers in gas rich environments can create high accretion rate SMBHs leading to a progression from CT to Sy2, while later triggers in gas poor stages result in low accretion rate SMBHs like those found in LINERs.</description>

      <title>(Re)mind the gap: a hiatus in star formation history unveiled by APOGEE DR17</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of several spectroscopic surveys indicates the presence of a bimodality between the disc stars in the abundance ratio space of [${\alpha}$/Fe] versus [Fe/H]. The two stellar groups are commonly referred to as the high-${\alpha}$ and low-${\alpha}$ sequences. Some models capable of reproducing such a bimodality, invoke the presence of a hiatus in the star formation history in our Galaxy, whereas other models explain the two sequences by means of stellar migration. Our aim is to show that the existence of the gap in the star formation rate between high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ is evident in the stars of APOGEE DR17, if one plots [Fe/$\alpha$] versus [$\alpha$/H], thus confirming previous suggestions by Gratton et al. (1996) and Fuhrmann (1998). Then we try to interpret the data by means of detailed chemical models. We compare the APOGEE DR17 red giant stars with the predictions of a detailed chemical evolution model based on the two-infall paradigm, taking also into account possible accretion of dwarf satellites. The APOGEE DR17 abundance ratios [Fe/$\alpha$] versus [$\alpha$/H] exhibit a sharp increase of [Fe/$\alpha$] at a nearly constant [$\alpha$/H] (where $\alpha$ elements considered are Mg, Si, O) during the transition between the two disc phases. This observation strongly supports the hypothesis that a hiatus in star formation occurred during this evolutionary phase. Notably, the most pronounced growth in the [Fe/$\alpha$] versus [$\alpha$/H] relation is observed for oxygen, as this element is exclusively synthesised in core-collapse supernovae. A chemical model predicting a stop in the star formation of a duration of roughly 3.5 Gyr, and where the high-$\alpha$ disc starts forming from pre-enriched gas by a previous encounter with a dwarf galaxy can well explain the observations.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Jitter as a Detection Diagnostic for Recoiling and Slingshot Supermassive Black Hole Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can be ejected from their galactic centers due to gravitational wave recoil or the slingshot mechanism following a galaxy merger. If an ejected SMBH retains its inner accretion disk, it may be visible as an off-nuclear active galactic nucleus (AGN). At present, only a handful of offset AGNs that are recoil or slingshot candidates have been found, and none have been robustly confirmed. Compiling a large sample of runaway SMBHs would enable us to constrain the mass and spin evolution of binary SMBHs and study feedback effects of displaced AGNs. We adapt the method of varstrometry -- which was developed for Gaia observations to identify off-center, dual, and lensed AGNs -- in order to quickly identify off-nuclear AGNs in optical survey data by looking for an excess of blue versus red astrometric jitter. We apply this to the Pan-STARRS1 3pi Survey and report on five new runaway AGN candidates. We focus on ZTF18aajyzfv: a luminous quasar offset by 6.7 $\pm$ 0.2 kpc from an adjacent galaxy at $z$=0.224, and conclude after Keck LRIS spectroscopy and comparison to ASTRID simulation analogs that it is likely a dual AGN. This selection method can be easily adapted to work with data from the soon-to-be commissioned Vera C. Rubin Telescope Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). LSST will have a higher cadence and deeper magnitude limit than Pan-STARRS1, and should permit detection of many more runaway SMBH candidates.</description>

      <title>An Outflow-Driven Water Maser Associated with Positive Black Hole Feedback in the Dwarf Galaxy Henize 2-10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Henize 2-10 is a dwarf galaxy experiencing positive black hole (BH) feedback from a radio-detected low-luminosity active galactic nucleus. Previous Green Bank Telescope (GBT) observations detected a H2O "kilomaser" in Henize 2-10, but the low angular resolution (33") left the location and origin of the maser ambiguous. We present new Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations of the H2O maser line at 22.23508 GHz in Henize 2-10 with ~2" resolution. These observations reveal two maser sources distinct in position and velocity. The first maser source is spatially coincident with the known BH outflow and the region of triggered star formation ~70 pc to the east. Combined with the broad width of the maser (W50 ~ 66 km s-1), this confirms our hypothesis that part of the maser detected with the GBT is produced by the impact of the BH outflow shocking the dense molecular gas along the flow and at the interface of the eastern star-forming region. The second maser source lies to the south-east far from the central BH and has a narrow width (W50 ~ 8 km s-1), suggesting a star-formation-related origin. This work has revealed the nature of the H2O kilomaser in Henize 2-10 and illustrates the first known connection between outflow-driven H2O masers and positive BH feedback.</description>

      <title>The Galactic Center Lobe as an HII Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic center lobe (GCL) is an object ~1{\deg} across that is located north of the Galactic center. In the mid-infrared (MIR) the GCL appears as two 8.0${\mu}$m filaments between which is strong 24${\mu}$m and radio continuum emission. Due to its morphology and location in the sky, previous authors have argued that the GCL is located in the Galactic center region, created by outflows from star formation or by activity of the central black hole Sagittarius A*. In an associated paper (Hurley-Walker et al., 2024, in press), low-frequency radio emission indicates that the GCL must instead lie foreground to the Galactic center. If the GCL is foreground to the Galactic center, it is likely to be a type of object common throughout the Galactic disk; we here investigate whether its properties are similar to those of Galactic HII regions. We find that the GCL's MIR morphology, MIR flux densities, dust temperatures, and radio recombination line (RRL) properties as traced by the GBT Diffuse Ionized Gas Survey (GDIGS) are consistent with those of known Galactic HII regions, although the derived electron temperature is low. We search for the ionizing source(s) of the possible HII region and identify a stellar cluster candidate (Camargo #1092/Ryu &amp; Lee #532) and a cluster of young stellar objects (SPICY G359.3+0.3) whose members have Gaia parallaxes distances of 1.7${\pm}$0.4kpc. Taken together, the results of our companion paper and those shown here suggest that the GCL has properties consistent with those of an HII region located ~2kpc from the Sun.</description>

      <title>A Detailed Study of Dwarf Galaxies in the Core of the Coma Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an earlier paper, we determined the morphological types of galaxies in the Coma Cluster using data from the HST/ACS Coma Cluster treasury survey. We found that of the 132 members, 51 are non dwarfs and 81 are dwarfs. We define dwarfs to have a absolute luminosity $M_{F814W}\geq -18.5$ as in \cite{2012ApJ...746..136M}.
  In this paper, we determine the morphological types of these dwarf galaxies and make a detailed study of their properties. Using GALFIT, we determine the structural properties of our sample and with spectroscopic redshifts, we determined memberships and distances to identify dwarfs. A visual examination of the residual images reveals that our sample of 78 dwarf galaxies comprises of: dwarf lenticular (\textit{dS0}) 22\%, dwarf Elliptical ($dE$) 69\%, dwarf spirals (\textit{dSp}) 4\%, dwarf ring (\textit{dring}) 1\%, dwarf barred spirals (\textit{dSBp}) 3\% and dwarf irregular (\textit{dIrr}) 1\% galaxies. We find that the bulge-disk decomposition (S\'ersic + exponential) fits are good only for the \textit{dS0} galaxies. The remainder of the sample gives good fits only for single S\'ersic fits. The Colour Magnitude Relation (CMR) shows that the $dEs$ are redder and fainter than the rest of the sample (except one $dIrr$ galaxy). The Kormendy relation reveals that $dE$ galaxies have lower surface brightness than the rest of the sample. Our research leads us to the conclusion that dwarf galaxies appear to have a different formation and evolution process than non-dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Peculiarities of the chemical enrichment of metal-poor Stars in the Milky Way Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oldest stars in the Milky Way are metal-poor with [Fe/H] &lt; -- 1.0, displaying peculiar elemental abundances compared to solar values. The relative variations in the chemical compositions among stars is also increasing with decreasing stellar metallicity, allowing for the pure signature of unique nucleosynthesis processes to be revealed. In this work, we report the atmospheric parameters, main dynamic properties, and the abundances of four metal-poor stars: HE 1523--0901, HD 6268, HD 121135, and HD 195636 (--1.5 &gt; [Fe/H] &gt;--3.0). The abundances were derived from spectra obtained with the HRS echelle spectrograph at the SALT, using both LTE and NLTE approaches. Based on their kinematical properties, we show that HE 1523--0901 and HD 195636 are halo stars with typical high velocities. In particular, HD 121135 displays a peculiar kinematical behaviour, making it unclear whether it is a halo or an accreted star. Furthermore, HD 6268 is possibly a rare prototype of very metal-poor thick disk stars. The abundances derived for our stars are compared with theoretical stellar models and with other stars with similar metallicity values from the literature. HD 121135 is Al-poor and Sc-poor, compared to stars observed in the same metallicity range (--1.62 &gt; [Fe/H] &gt;--1.12). The most metal-poor stars in our sample, HE 1523 -- 0901, HD 6268, and HD 195636, exhibit anomalies that are better explained by supernova models from fast-rotating stellar progenitors for elements up to the Fe group. Compared to other stars in the same metallicity range, their common biggest anomaly is represented by the low Sc abundances. If we consider the elements beyond Zn, HE 1523--0901 can be classified as an r-II star, HD 6268 as an r-I candidate, and HD 195636 and HD 121135 exhibiting a borderline r-process enrichment between limited-r and r-I star.</description>

      <title>Fast-rotating massive Population~III stars as possible sources of extreme N-enrichment in high-redshift galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the chemical compositions in high-redshift galaxies, with a focus on the nitrogen-enhanced galaxies GN-z11 and CEERS-1019. We use stellar models of massive stars with initial masses ranging from 9 to 120 Msol across various metallicities to deduce the chemical abundances of stellar ejecta for a few light elements (H, He, C, N, O). Our study reveals insights into the chemical processes and elemental synthesis in the early universe. We find that Population III stars, particularly at initial fast equatorial rotation and sampled from a top-heavy initial mass function, as well as stars at Z=10^{-5} with moderate rotation, align closely with observed abundance ratios in GN-z11 and CEERS-1019. These models demonstrate log(N/O) = -0.38, log(C/O) =-0.22 and log(O/H) + 12 = 7.82 at dilution factors of f = 20~100, indicating a good match with observational data. Models at higher metallicities do not match these observations, highlighting the unique role of Population III and extremely metal-poor stars in enhancing nitrogen abundance in high-redshift galaxies. Predictions for other abundance ratios, such as log(He/H) ranging from -1.077 to -1.059 and log{(^{12}C/^{13}C)} from 1.35 to 2.42, provide detailed benchmarks for future observational studies.</description>

      <title>The MAGPI Survey: Using kinematic asymmetries in stars and gas to dissect drivers of galaxy dynamical evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of kinematic asymmetries from the integral field spectroscopic surveys MAGPI and SAMI. By comparing the asymmetries in the ionsied gas and stars, we aim to disentangle the physical processes that contribute to kinematic disturbances. We normalise deviations from circular motion by $S_{05}$, allowing us to study kinematic asymmetries in the stars and gas, regardless of kinematic temperature. We find a similar distribution of stellar asymmetries in galaxies where we do and do not detect ionised gas, suggesting that whatever is driving the stellar asymmetries does not always lead to gas removal. In both MAGPI and SAMI, we find an anti-correlation between stellar asymmetry and stellar mass, that is absent in the gas asymmetries. After stellar mass and mean-stellar-age matching distributions, we find that at all stellar masses, MAGPI galaxies display larger stellar asymmetry compared to SAMI galaxies. In both MAGPI and SAMI galaxies, we find that star-forming galaxies with old mean-stellar-ages typically have larger asymmetries in their gas compared to their stars, whereas galaxies with young mean-stellar-ages have larger asymmetries in their stars compared to their gas. We suggest that this results from continuous, clumpy accretion of gas.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of the Sagittarius Spiral Arm in the Inner Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report measurements of trigonometric parallax and proper motion for two 6.7 GHz methanol and two 22 GHz water masers located in the far portion of the Sagittarius spiral arm as part of the BeSSeL Survey. Distances for these sources are estimated from parallax measurements combined with 3-dimensional kinematic distances. The distances of G033.64$-$00.22, G035.57$-$00.03, G041.15$-$00.20, and G043.89$-$00.78 are $9.9\pm0.5$, $10.2\pm0.6$, $7.6\pm0.5$, and $7.5\pm0.3$ kpc, respectively. Based on these measurements, we suggest that the Sagittarius arm segment beyond about 8 kpc from the Sun in the first Galactic quadrant should be adjusted radially outward relative to previous models. This supports the suggestion of Xu et al. (2023) that the Sagittarius and Perseus spiral arms might merge in the first quadrant before spiraling inward to the far end of the Galactic bar.</description>

      <title>The AstroSat UV Deep Field North: The IRX-$\beta$ relation for the UV-selected galaxies at $z\sim$ 0.5-0.7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation between the observed UV continuum slope ($\beta$) and the infrared excess (IRX) is used as a powerful probe to understand the nature of dust attenuation law in high-redshift galaxies. We present a study of 83 UV-selected galaxies between redshift 0.5 and 0.7 from the AstroSat UV Deep Field north (AUDFn) that encloses the GOODS-north field. Using empirical relation, we estimate the observed IRX of 52 galaxies that are detected in either one or both of the Herschel PACS 100$\mu$m and 160$\mu$m bands. We further utilize the multi-band photometric data in 14 - 18 filters from the UVIT, KPNO, HST, Spitzer, and Herschel telescopes to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. Both the observed and model-derived IRX - $\beta$ values show a large scatter within the span of previously known relations, signifying diversity in dust attenuation. We found a distinct relation between the best-fit power law slope of the modified Calzetti relation ($\delta$) in the IRX - $\beta$ plane: where the steeper SMC-like attenuation law prefers lower $\delta$ values. Our SED model based IRX - $\beta$ relation shows a preference for steeper SMC-like attenuation which we further confirm from the agreement between extinction-corrected star formation rates derived using H$\alpha$ emission line and the observed FUV plus reprocessed far-IR fluxes. The current study reveals a strong positive correlation between IRX and the galaxy stellar mass between $10^{9.5}$ and $10^{11.0}$ M$_{\odot}$, signifying increased dust production in more massive star-forming galaxies.</description>

      <title>Low-frequency absorption and radio recombination line features of the Galactic Center Lobe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic center lobe (GCL) is a $\sim 1^\circ$ object located north of the Galactic center. In the mid-infrared (MIR), the GCL appears as two 8.0-micron filaments that roughly define an ellipse. There is strong 24-micron and radio continuum emission in the interior of the ellipse. Due to its morphology and location in the sky, previous authors have argued that the GCL is created by outflows from star formation in the central molecular zone or by activity of the central black hole Sgr~A$^*$. We present images of the GCL from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array survey in radio continuum that show thermal absorption against the Galactic center, incompatible with an interpretation of synchrotron self-absorption. Estimates of the cosmic ray emissivity in this direction allow us to place a distance constraint on the GCL. To be consistent with standard emissivity assumptions, the GCL would be located 2kpc away. At a distance of 8kpc, the synchrotron background emissivity is enhanced by $\sim75$% in the direction of the GCL. We also present radio recombination line data from the Green Bank Telescope that constrains the electron temperature and line widths in this region, which are also more explicable if the GCL lies relatively close.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field dragging in filamentary molecular clouds</title>

Abstract: Maps of polarized dust emission of molecular clouds reveal the morphology of the magnetic field associated with star-forming regions. In particular, polarization maps of hub-filament systems show the distortion of magnetic field lines induced by gas flows onto and inside filaments. We aim to understand the relation between the curvature of magnetic field lines associated with filaments in hub-filament systems and the properties of the underlying gas flows. We consider steady-state models of gas with finite electrical resistivity flowing across a transverse magnetic field. We derive the relation between the bending of the field lines and the flow parameters represented by the Alfv\'en Mach number and the magnetic Reynolds number. We find that, on the scale of the filaments, the relevant parameter for a gas of finite electrical resistivity is the magnetic Reynolds number, and we derive the relation between the deflection angle of the field from the initial direction (assumed perpendicular to the filament) and the value of the electrical resistivity, due to either Ohmic dissipation or ambipolar diffusion. Application of this model to specific observations of polarized dust emission in filamentary clouds shows that magnetic Reynolds numbers of a few tens are required to reproduce the data. Despite significant uncertainties in the observations (the flow speed, the geometry and orientation of the filament), and the idealization of the model, the specific cases considered show that ambipolar diffusion can provide the resistivity needed to maintain a steady state flow across magnetic fields of significant strength over realistic time scales.</description>

      <title>Probing the CIV continuum size luminosity relation in active galactic nuclei with photometric reverberation mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reverberation mapping accurately determines virial black hole masses only for redshifts $z &lt;$ 0.2 by utilizing the relationship between the H$\beta$ broad-line region (BLR) size and the 5100 Angstroms continuum luminosity established with $\sim 200$ active galactic nuclei (AGN). For quasars at $z \sim 2-3$ determining the BLR size is time-consuming and limited by seasonal gaps, requiring e.g., $\sim$ 20 years of monitoring of the CIV emission lines. In this work, we demonstrate that an efficient alternative is to use a continuum size-luminosity relation, which can be obtained up to 150 times faster than BLR sizes using photometric reverberation mapping (PRM). We outline the method and its feasibility based on simulations and propose an observational strategy that can be carried out with meter-class telescopes. In particular, we focus on the ESO La Silla 2.2 meter telescope as it is suitable for an efficient PRM campaign. These observations will provide the scaling factor between the accretion disk and the BLR size (for CIV-1350 Angstroms), which is crucial for estimating the masses of black holes at higher redshifts ($z \gtrsim 2-3$).</description>

      <title>Keck/KCWI Spectroscopy of Globular Clusters in Local Volume Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of nearby dwarf galaxies have globular cluster (GC) candidates that require spectroscopic confirmation. Here we present Keck telescope spectra for 15 known GCs and GC candidates that may be associated with a host dwarf galaxy, and an additional 3 GCs in the halo of M31 that are candidates for accretion from a now disrupted dwarf galaxy. We confirm 6 star clusters (of intermediate-to-old age) to be associated with NGC~247. The vast bulk of its GC system remains to be studied spectroscopically. We also confirm the GC candidates in F8D1 and DDO190, finding both to be young star clusters. The 3 M31 halo GCs all have radial velocities consistent with M31, are old and very metal-poor. Their ages and metallicities are consistent with accretion from a low mass satellite galaxy. Finally, three objects are found to be background galaxies -- two are projected near NGC~247 and one (candidate GCC7) is near the IKN dwarf. The IKN dwarf thus has only 5 confirmed GCs but still a remarkable specific frequency of 124.</description>

      <title>The Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Reverberation Mapping Project: Initial Results for a candidate IMBH in a nearby Seyfert 1 Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the short-term variability and determine the size of the optical continuum emitting size of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), we carried out high-cadence, multi-band photometric monitoring of a Seyfert 1 galaxy J0249-0815 across two nights, together with a one-night single-band preliminary test. The presence of the broad Ha component in our target was confirmed by recent Palomar/P200 spectroscopic observations, 23 years after Sloan Digital Sky Survey, ruling out the supernovae origin of the broad Ha line. The photometric experiment was primarily conducted utilizing four-channel imagers MuSCAT 3 &amp; 4 mounted on 2-meter telescopes within the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network. Despite the expectation of variability, we observed no significant variation (&lt;1.4%) on timescales of 6-10 hours. This non-detection is likely due to substantial host galaxy light diluting the subtle AGN variability. Dual-band preliminary tests and tailored simulations may enhance the possibility of detecting variability and lag in future IMBH reverberation campaigns.</description>

      <title>AGN energetics and lifetimes from remnant radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy coupling efficiency of active galactic nucleus (AGN) outbursts is known to differ significantly with factors including the jet kinetic power, duration of the outburst, and properties of the host galaxy cluster. As such, constraints on their jet power and lifetime functions are crucial to quantify the role of kinetic-mode AGN feedback on the evolution of galaxies since $z \sim 1$. In this work, we address this issue by measuring the energetics of a sample of 79 low-redshift (0.02 $&lt; z &lt;$ 0.2) remnant radio galaxies compiled from large-sky radio surveys - these objects uniquely probe the full duration of an AGN outburst. The jet kinetic power and outburst duration of each remnant are determined using the RAiSE dynamical model based on the surface brightness distribution observed in multi-frequency radio images. We compare the energetics constrained for this sample to those predicted for mock radio source populations - with various intrinsic functions for jet power and lifetime distributions - to correct for sample selection biases imposed on our sample. The intrinsic jet power and lifetime functions that yield a selection-biased mock population most similar to our observed sample are found using Bayesian inference. Our analysis places robust constraints on assumed power-law indices for the intrinsic jet power and lifetime functions: $p(Q)\propto Q^{-1.49\pm0.07}$ and $p(t_{\mathrm{on}})\propto t_{\mathrm{on}}^{-0.97\pm0.12}$ respectively. We discuss the implication of these findings for feedback-regulated accretion and the self-regulating nature of jet activity. The methodology proposed in this work can be extended to active radio galaxies in future studies.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way Atlas for Linear Filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filamentary structure is important for the ISM and star formation. Galactic distribution of filaments may regulate the star formation rate in the Milky Way. However, interstellar filaments are intrinsically complex, making it difficult to study quantitatively. Here, we focus on linear filaments, the simplest morphology that can be treated as building blocks of any filamentary structure. We present the first catalog of 42 ``straight-line'' filaments across the full Galactic plane, identified by clustering of far-IR Herschel HiGAL clumps in position-position-velocity space. We use molecular line cubes to investigate the dynamics along the filaments; compare the filaments with Galactic spiral arms; and compare ambient magnetic fields with the filaments' orientation. The selected filaments show extreme linearity ($&gt;$10), aspect ratio (7-48), and velocity coherence over a length of 3-40 pc (mostly $&gt;$10 pc). About 1/3 of them are associated with spiral arms, but only one is located in arm center, a.k.a. ``bones'' of the Milky Way. A few of them extend perpendicular to the Galactic plane, and none is located in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) near the Galactic center. Along the filaments, prevalent periodic oscillation (both in velocity and density) is consistent with gas flows channeled by the filaments and feeding the clumps which harbor diverse star formation activities. No correlation is found between the filament orientations with Planck measured global magnetic field lines. This work highlights some of the fundamental properties of molecular filaments and provides a golden sample for follow-up studies on star formation, ISM structure, and Milky Way structure.</description>

      <title>TEGLIE: Transformer encoders as strong gravitational lens finders in KiDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a state-of-the-art transformer algorithm to 221 deg$^2$ of the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) to search for new strong gravitational lenses (SGL). We test four transformer encoders trained on simulated data from the Strong Lens Finding Challenge on KiDS survey data. The best performing model is fine-tuned on real images of SGL candidates identified in previous searches. To expand the dataset for fine-tuning, data augmentation techniques are employed, including rotation, flipping, transposition, and white noise injection. The network fine-tuned with rotated, flipped, and transposed images exhibited the best performance and is used to hunt for SGL in the overlapping region of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) and KiDS surveys on galaxies up to $z$=0.8. Candidate SGLs are matched with those from other surveys and examined using GAMA data to identify blended spectra resulting from the signal from multiple objects in a fiber. We observe that fine-tuning the transformer encoder to the KiDS data reduces the number of false positives by 70%. Additionally, applying the fine-tuned model to a sample of $\sim$ 5,000,000 galaxies results in a list of $\sim$ 51,000 SGL candidates. Upon visual inspection, this list is narrowed down to 231 candidates. Combined with the SGL candidates identified in the model testing, our final sample includes 264 candidates, with 71 high-confidence SGLs of which 44 are new discoveries. We propose fine-tuning via real augmented images as a viable approach to mitigating false positives when transitioning from simulated lenses to real surveys. Additionally, we provide a list of 121 false positives that exhibit features similar to lensed objects, which can benefit the training of future machine learning models in this field.</description>

      <title>The efficiency of black hole formation via collisions in stellar systems: An analysis of data from simulations and observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the theoretical relation between star clusters and black holes within, focusing on the potential role of Nuclear Star Clusters (NSCs), Globular Clusters (GCs), and Ultra Compact Dwarf Galaxies (UCDs) as environments that lead to black hole formation through stellar collisions. The study aims to identify optimal conditions for stellar collisions in different stellar systems leading to the formation of very massive stars that subsequently collapse into black holes. Data from numerical simulations and observations of diverse stellar systems are analyzed, encompassing various initial conditions, initial mass functions, and stellar evolution scenarios. We compute a critical mass, determined by the interplay of collision time, system age, and initial properties of the star cluster. The efficiency of black hole formation ($\epsilon_{\mathrm{BH}}$) is defined as the ratio of initial stellar mass divided by critical mass. The study finds out that stellar systems with a ratio of initial stellar mass over critical mass above 1 exhibit high efficiencies of black hole formation, ranging from $30-100\%$. While there is some scatter, potentially attributed to complex system histories and the presence of gas, the results highlight the potential for achieving high efficiencies through a purely collisional channel in black hole formation. In conclusion, this theoretical exploration elucidates the connection between star clusters and black hole formation. The study underscores the significance of UCDs, GCs, and NSCs as environments conducive to stellar collisions leading to black hole formation. The defined black hole formation efficiency ($\epsilon_{\mathrm{BH}}$) is shown to be influenced by the ratio of initial stellar mass to critical mass.</description>

      <title>A Possible Additional Formation Pathway for the Interstellar Diatomic SiS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of silicon monosulfide (SiS) in space appears to be a difficult process, but the present work is showing that a previously excluded pathway may contribute to its astronomical abundance. Reaction of the radicals SH + SiH produces SiS with a submerged transition state and generates a stabilizing H$_2$ molecule as a product to dissipate the kinetic energy. Such is a textbook chemical reaction for favorable gas-phase chemistry. While previously proposed mechanisms reacting atomic sulfur and silicon with SiH, SH, and H$_2$S will still be major contributors to the production of SiS, an abundance of SiS in certain regions could be a marker for the presence of SiH where it has previously been unobserved. These quantum chemically-computed reaction profiles imply that the silicon-chalcogen chemistry of molecular clouds, shocked regions, or protoplanetary disks may be richer than previously thought. Quantum chemical spectral data for the intermediate cis- and trans-HSiSH are also provided in order to aid in their potential spectroscopic characterization.</description>

      <title>AGNfitter-rx: Modelling the radio-to-X-ray SEDs of AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new frontiers in the modelling of the spectral energy distributions (SED) of active galaxies by introducing the radio-to-X-ray fitting capabilities of the publicly available Bayesian code AGNfitter. The new code release, called AGNfitter-rx, models the broad-band photometry covering the radio, infrared (IR), optical, ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray bands consistently, using a combination of theoretical and semi-empirical models of the AGN and host galaxy emission. This framework enables the detailed characterization of four physical components of the active nuclei: the accretion disk, the hot dusty torus, the relativistic jets/core radio emission, and the hot corona; alongside modeling three components within the host galaxy: stellar populations, cold dust, and the radio emission from the star-forming regions. Applying AGNfitter-rx to a diverse sample of 36 AGN SEDs at z&lt;0.7 from the AGN SED ATLAS, we investigate and compare the performance of state-of-the-art torus and accretion disk emission models on fit quality and inferred physical parameters. We find that clumpy torus models that include polar winds and semi-empirical accretion disk templates including emission line features significantly increase the fit quality in 67% of the sources, by effectively reducing by $2\sigma$ fit residuals in the $1.5-5 \mu \rm m$ and $0.7 \mu \rm m$ regimes.We demonstrate that, by applying AGNfitter-rx on photometric data, we are able to estimate inclination and opening angles of the torus, consistent with spectroscopic classifications within the AGN unified model, as well as black hole mass estimates in agreement with virial estimates based on H$\alpha$. The wavelength coverage and the flexibility for the inclusion of state-of-the-art theoretical models make AGNfitter-rx a unique tool for the further development of SED modelling for AGNs in present and future radio-to-X-ray galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>SkyCURTAINs: Model agnostic search for Stellar Streams with Gaia data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SkyCURTAINs, a data driven and model agnostic method to search for stellar streams in the Milky Way galaxy using data from the Gaia telescope. SkyCURTAINs is a weakly supervised machine learning algorithm that builds a background enriched template in the signal region by leveraging the correlation of the source's characterising features with their proper motion in the sky. This allows for a more representative template of the background in the signal region, and reduces the false positives in the search for stellar streams. The minimal model assumptions in the SkyCURTAINs method allow for a flexible and efficient search for various kinds of anomalies such as streams, globular clusters, or dwarf galaxies directly from the data. We test the performance of SkyCURTAINs on the GD-1 stream and show that it is able to recover the stream with a purity of 75.4% which is an improvement of over 10% over existing machine learning based methods while retaining a signal efficiency of 37.9%.</description>

      <title>Feedback-regulated Seed Black Hole Growth in Star-Forming Molecular Clouds and Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in high-redshift luminous quasars may require a phase of rapid accretion, and as a precondition, substantial gas influx toward seed black holes (BHs) from kilo-parsec or parsec scales. Our previous research demonstrated the plausibility of such gas supply for BH seeds within star-forming giant molecular clouds (GMCs) with high surface density ($\sim 10^4\,{\rm {\rm M_\odot}\, pc}^{-2}$), facilitating ``hyper-Eddington'' accretion via efficient feeding by dense clumps which are driven by turbulence and stellar feedback. This article investigates the impacts of feedback from accreting BHs on this process, including radiation, mechanical jets, and highly relativistic cosmic rays. We run a suite of numerical simulations to explore diverse parameter spaces of BH feedback, including the sub-grid accretion model, feedback energy efficiency, mass loading factor, and initial metallicity. Utilizing radiative feedback models inferred from the slim disk, we find that hyper-Eddington accretion is still achievable, yielding BH bolometric luminosities as high as $10^{41}$ -- $10^{44}\,\rm erg/s$, depending on the GMC properties and specific feedback model assumed. We find the maximum possible mass growth of seed BHs ($\Delta M_{\rm BH}^{\rm max}$) is regulated by the momentum deposition rate from BH feedback, $\dot{p}_{\rm feedback}/(\dot{M}_{\rm BH} c)$, which leads to an analytic scaling that agrees well with simulations. This scenario predicts the rapid formation of $\sim 10^4\,\rm M_\odot$ intermediate-massive BHs (IMBHs) from stellar-mass BHs within $\sim \rm Myr$. Furthermore, we examine the impacts of sub-grid accretion models and how BH feedback may influence star formation within these cloud complexes.</description>

      <title>Episodic mass loss in the very luminous red supergiant [W60] B90 in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study delves into [W60] B90, one of the most luminous and extreme Red Supergiants (RSGs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), aiming to search for evidence of episodic mass loss. Our discovery of a bar-like nebular structure at 1 pc, reminiscent of the bar around Betelgeuse, raised the question of whether [W60] B90 also has a bow shock. We collected and analyzed proper motion data from Gaia, as well as new multi-epoch spectroscopic and imaging data, and archival time-series photometry in the optical and mid-infrared. We found [W60] B90 to be a walkaway star, with a supersonic peculiar velocity in the direction of the bar. We detected shocked emission between the bar and the star, based on the [S II]/H$\alpha$ &gt; 0.4 criterion, providing strong evidence for a bow shock. The 30-year optical light curve revealed semi-regular variability, showing three similar dimming events with $\Delta V \sim 1$ mag, a recurrence of $\sim$12 yr, and a rise time of 400 d. We found the mid-IR light curve to vary by 0.51 mag and 0.37 mag in the WISE1 and WISE2 bands, respectively, and by 0.42 mag and 0.25 mag during the last dimming event. During this event, optical spectroscopy revealed spectral variability (M3I to M4I), a correlation between the $T_{\rm eff}$ and the brightness, increased extinction, and, after the minimum, spectral features incompatible with the models. We also found a difference of &gt;300 K between the $T_{\rm eff}$ measured from the TiO bands in the optical and the atomic lines from our $J$-band spectroscopy. We inferred that [W60] B90 is a more massive analog of Betelgeuse in the LMC and the first extragalactic single RSG with a suspected bow shock. Its high luminosity $\log(L/L_{\odot})=5.32$ dex, mass-loss rate, and mid-IR variability compared to other RSGs in the LMC, indicate that it is in an unstable evolutionary state undergoing episodes of mass loss.</description>

Abstract: An hourglass-shaped magnetic field pattern arises naturally from the gravitational collapse of a star-forming gas cloud. Most studies have focused on the prestellar collapse phase, when the structure has a smooth and monotonic radial profile. However, most observations target dense clouds that already contain a central protostar, and possibly a circumstellar disk. We utilize an analytic treatment of the magnetic field along with insights gained from simulations to develop a more realistic magnetic field model for the protostellar phase. Key elements of the model are a strong radial magnetic field in the region of rapid collapse, an off-center peak in the magnetic field strength (a consequence of magnetic field dissipation in the circumstellar disk), and a strong toroidal field that is generated in the region of rapid collapse and outflow generation. A model with a highly pinched and twisted magnetic field pattern in the inner collapse zone facilitates the interpretation of magnetic field patterns observed in protostellar clouds.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Survey of Faint Planetary-Nebula Nuclei. V. The EGB 6-Type Central Star of Abell 57</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During our spectroscopic survey of central stars of faint planetary nebulae (PNe), we found that the nucleus of Abell 57 exhibits strong nebular emission lines. Using synthetic narrow-band images, we show that the emission arises from an unresolved compact emission knot (CEK) coinciding with the hot (90,000 K) central star. Thus Abell 57 belongs to the rare class of "EGB 6-type" PNe, characterized by dense emission cores. Photometric data show that the nucleus exhibits a near-IR excess, due to a dusty companion body with the luminosity of an M0 dwarf but a temperature of ~1800 K. Emission-line analysis reveals that the CEK is remarkably dense (electron density ~1.6x10**7 cm**-3), and has a radius of only ~4.5 AU. The CEK suffers considerably more reddening than the central star, which itself is more reddened than the surrounding PN. These puzzles may suggest an interaction between the knot and central star; however, Hubble Space Telescope imaging of EGB 6 itself shows that its CEK lies more than ~125 AU from the PN nucleus. We discuss a scenario in which a portion of the AGB wind that created the PN was captured into a dust cloud around a distant stellar companion; this cloud has survived to the present epoch, and has an atmosphere photoionized by radiation from the hot central star. However, in this picture EGB 6-type nuclei should be relatively common, yet they are actually extremely rare; thus they may arise from a different transitory phenomenon. We suggest future observations of Abell 57 that may help unravel its mysteries.</description>

      <title>Estimating Photometric Distances to Ultracool Dwarfs in Next Generation Space-based Infrared Surveys: Synthetic Photometry and New Absolute Magnitude Versus Spectral Type Relations for JWST, Euclid, and Roman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We synthesize JWST NIRCam photometry for the F164N, F187N, F212N narrow filters, F140M, F162M, F182M, F210M medium filters, and F115W, F150W, F200W wide filters, Euclid Near Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) photometry for the $Y_E J_E H_E$ filters, and Roman Wide Field Instrument (WFI) photometry for the F106, F129, F146, F158, F184 and F213 filters using SpeX prism spectra and parallaxes of 688 field-age and 151 young ($\lesssim$ 200 Myr) ultracool dwarfs (spectral types M6-T9). We derive absolute magnitude-spectral type polynomial relations that enable the calculation of photometric distances for ultracool dwarfs observed with JWST, and to be observed with Euclid and Roman, in the absence of parallax measurements. Additionally, using the synthesized photometry to generate color-color figures can help distinguish high-redshift galaxies from brown dwarf interlopers in survey datasets. In particular, anticipating the upcoming Euclid Early Release Observations, we provide synthetic Euclid colors for ultracool dwarfs in our sample.</description>

      <title>CO Observations of the Type Ia Supernova Remnant 3C 397 by the Nobeyama 45-m Radio Telescope: Possible Evidence for the Single-Degenerated Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new CO observation toward the Type Ia supernova remnant (SNR) 3C 397 using the Nobeyama 45-m radio telescope at an unprecedent angular resolution of $\sim$18''. We newly found that the CO cloud at $V_{\mathrm{LSR}}$ = 55.7-62.2 km s$^{-1}$ (60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud) shows a good spatial correspondence with the radio continuum shell. We also found an expanding gas motion of the 60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud with an expansion velocity of $\sim$3 km s$^{-1}$, which is thought to be formed by the pre-and/or post-supernova feedback. By considering the positions of Galactic spiral arms and the X-ray/HI absorption studies, we concluded that 3C 397 is physically associated with the 60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud rather than the previously known CO cloud at $V_{\mathrm{LSR}}$ $\sim$30 km s$^{-1}$. Given that the previously measured pre-shock density is $\sim$2-5 cm$^{-3}$, the expanding motion of the 60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud was likely formed by the pre-supernova feedback known as optically thick wind. The scenario is consistent with that 3C 397 exploded inside a wind-blown bubble as a single degenerate system.</description>

      <title>HCN as a probe of the inner disk in a candidate proto-brown dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of Keplerian rotation is rare among Class 0 protostellar systems. We have investigated the high-density tracer HCN as a probe of the inner disk in a Class 0 proto-brown dwarf candidate. Our ALMA high angular resolution observations show the peak in the HCN (3-2) line emission arises from a compact component near the proto-brown dwarf with a small bar-like structure and a deconvolved size of $\sim$50 au. Radiative transfer modelling indicates that this HCN feature is tracing the innermost, dense regions in the proto-brown dwarf where a small Keplerian disk is expected to be present. The limited velocity resolution of the observations, however, makes it difficult to confirm the rotational kinematics of this feature. A brightening in the HCN emission towards the core center suggests that HCN can survive in the gas phase in the inner, dense regions of the proto-brown dwarf. In contrast, modelling of the HCO$^{+}$ (3-2) line emission indicates that it originates from the outer pseudo-disk/envelope region and is centrally depleted. HCN line emission can reveal the small-scale structures and can be an efficient observational tool to study the inner disk properties in such faint compact objects where spatially resolving the disk is nearly impossible.</description>

      <title>PENELLOPE\,VI. -- Searching the PENELLOPE/UVES sample with spectro-astrometry: Two new microjets of Sz 103 and XX Cha</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this study is to screen the PENELLOPE/UVES targets for outflow activity and find microjets via spectro-astrometry in, e.g., the [OI]$\lambda$6300 line. In total, 34 T\,Tauri stars of the PENELLOPE survey have been observed with the high resolution slit spectrograph UVES in three different slit positions rotated by $120^\text{o}$. Our spectro-astrometric analysis in the [OI]$\lambda$6300 wind line reveals two newly discovered microjets associated with Sz\,103 and XX\,Cha. Both microjets have an extent of about $0.04$ arcseconds, that is, $&lt;10\,\text{au}$, and we confined their orientation by the three slit observations. Furthermore, we confirm the binary nature of VW\,Cha and CVSO\,109. We present (further) evidence that DK\,Tau\,B and CVSO\,104\,A are spectroscopic binaries. Sz\,115 is tentatively a spectroscopic binary. The origin of the LVC, that is, MHD winds versus photoevaporative winds, of the Sz\,103 and XX\,Cha microjets remains unclear.</description>

      <title>How do Primordial Black Holes change the Halo Mass Function and Structure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the effects of massive primordial black holes (PBHs) on cosmic structure formation, employing both a semi-analytical approach and cosmological simulations. Our simulations incorporate PBHs with a monochromatic mass distribution centered around $10^6 \ \rm M_{\odot}$, constituting a fraction of $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-4}$ of the dark matter (DM) in the universe, with the remainder being collision-less particle dark matter (PDM). Additionally, we conduct a $\Lambda$CDM simulation for comparative analysis with runs that include PBHs. At smaller scales, halos containing PBHs exhibit similar density and velocity dispersion profiles to those without PBHs. Conversely, at larger scales, PBHs can expedite the formation of massive halos and reside at their centers due to the `seed effect'. To analyze the relative distribution of PBH host halos compared to non-PBH halos, we apply nearest-neighbor (NN) statistics. Our results suggest that PBH host halos, through gravitational influence, significantly impact the structure formation process, compared to the $\Lambda$CDM case, by attracting and engulfing nearby newly-formed minihalos. Should PBHs constitute a fraction of DM significantly larger than $\sim$$10^{-3}$, almost all newly-formed halos will be absorbed by PBH-seeded halos. Consequently, our simulations predict a bimodal feature in the halo mass function, with most of the massive halos containing at least one PBH at their core and the rest being less massive non-PBH halos.</description>

      <title>The population synthesis of Wolf-Rayet stars involving binary merger channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs) are very important massive stars. However, their origin and the observed binary fraction within the entire WR population are still debated. We investigate some possible merger channels for the formation of WRs, including main sequence (MS)/ Hertzsprung Gap (HG) + MS, He + HG/ Giant Branch (GB). We find that many products produced via binary merger can evolve into WRs, the MS/ HG + MS merger channel can explain WRs with luminosities higher than $\sim 10^{5.4}$\,L$_{\odot}$, while the He + HG/ GB merger channel can explain low-luminosity WRs in the range of $10^{4.7}$\,L$_{\odot}$\,$\sim$\,$10^{5.5}$\,L$_{\odot}$. In the population synthesis analysis of WRs, we assume an initial binary fraction ($f_{\rm ini,bin}$) of 50\% and 100\% for massive stars. We also assume that MS/ HG + MS merger products are non-rotating or rapidly rotating ($\omega/\omega_{\rm crit}=0.8$). In different cases, the calculated single fractions of WRs range from $22.2\%$ to $60.6\%$ in the Milky Way (MW) and from $8.3\%$ to $70.9\%$ in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The current observations fall within the range of our calculations. When the merger product of MS/HG+MS rotates rapidly, we estimate that there are approximately 1015 to 1396 WRs in the MW and 128 to 204 WRs in the LMC. Our model also roughly reproduces the observed single-peak luminosity distribution of WRs in the MW. However, the weak bimodal luminosity distribution observed in the LMC is not reproduced in our model. We assess that this may be due to the model underestimating the mass-loss rate in the LMC. In conclusion, we consider that the binary merger is significant formation channel for WR formation, and can explain the observed high fraction of the single WRs in the total population.</description>

      <title>Magnetized Accretion onto and Feedback from Supermassive Black Holes in Elliptical Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the fueling of supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies from a turbulent cooling medium on galactic scales, taking M87* as a typical case. We find that the mass accretion rate is increased by a factor of $\sim 10$ compared with analogous hydrodynamic simulations. The scaling of $\dot{M} \sim r^{1/2}$ roughly holds from $\sim 10\,\mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{pc}$ ($\sim 10\, r_\mathrm{g}$) with the accretion rate through the event horizon being $\sim 10^{-2}\, M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. The accretion flow on scales $\sim 0.03-3\,\mathrm{kpc}$ takes the form of magnetized filaments. Within $\sim 30\,\mathrm{pc}$, the cold gas circularizes, forming a highly magnetized ($\beta\sim 10^{-3}$) thick disk supported by a primarily toroidal magnetic field. The cold disk is truncated and transitions to a turbulent hot accretion flow at $\sim0.3\,\mathrm{pc}$ ($10^3\,r_\mathrm{g}$). There are strong outflows towards the poles driven by the magnetic field. The outflow energy flux increases with smaller accretor size, reaching $\sim 3\times10^{43}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ for $r_\mathrm{in}=8\,r_\mathrm{g}$; this corresponds to a nearly constant energy feedback efficiency of $\eta\sim0.05-0.1$ independent of accretor size. The feedback energy is enough to balance the total cooling of the M87/Virgo hot halo out to $\sim 50$ kpc. The accreted magnetic flux at small radii is similar to that in magnetically arrested disk models, consistent with the formation of a powerful jet on horizon scales in M87. Our results motivate a subgrid model for accretion in lower-resolution simulations in which the hot gas accretion rate is suppressed relative to the Bondi rate by $\sim (10r_\mathrm{g}/r_\mathrm{B})^{1/2}$.</description>

      <title>On the Determination of Stellar Mass and Binary Fraction of Open Clusters within 500 pc from the Sun</title>

Abstract: We investigated the stellar mass function and the binary fraction of 114 nearby open clusters (OCs) using the high-precision photometric data from Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3). We estimated the mass of member stars by using a ridge line (RL) that is better in line with the observed color-magnitude diagram (CMD), thus obtaining more accurate stellar mass and binary mass ratio ($q$) at the low-mass region. By analyzing the present-day mass function (PDMF) of star clusters, we found that 108 OCs follow a two-stage power-law distribution, whereas 6 OCs present a single power-law PDMF. Subsequently, we fitted the high(low)-mass index of PDMF ($dN/dm \propto m^{-\alpha}$), denoted as $\alpha_{\rm h}$($\alpha_{\rm l}$), and segmentation point $m_{\rm c}$. For our cluster sample, the median values of $\alpha_{\rm h}$ and $\alpha_{\rm l}$ are 2.65 and 0.95, respectively, which are approximately consistent with the initial mass function (IMF) results provided by Kroupa (2001). We utilized the cumulative radial number distribution of stars with different masses to quantify the degree of mass segregation. We found a significant positive correlation between the state of dynamical evolution and mass segregation in OCs. We also estimated the fraction of binary stars with $q \geq 0.5$, ranging from 6% to 34% with a median of 17%. Finally, we provided a catalog of 114 nearby cluster properties, including the total mass, the binary fraction, the PDMF, and the dynamical state.</description>

      <title>The global structure of astrospheres: effect of Knudsen number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between stellar winds and the partially ionized local interstellar medium (LISM) is quite common in astrophysics. However, the main difficulty in describing the neutral components lies in the fact that the mean free path of an interstellar atom, l, can be comparable to the characteristic size of an astrosphere, L (i.e., the Knudsen number, which is equal to l/L, is approximately equal to 1, as in the case of the heliosphere). In such cases, a single-fluid approximation becomes invalid, and a kinetic description must be used for the neutral component. In this study, we consider a general astrosphere and use a kinetic-gas dynamics model to investigate how the global structure of the astrosphere depends on the Knudsen number. We present numerical results covering an extremely wide range of Knudsen numbers (from 0.0001 to 100). Additionally, we explore the applicability of single-fluid approaches for modeling astrospheres of various sizes. We have excluded the influence of interstellar and stellar magnetic fields in our model to make parametric study of the kinetic effects feasible. The main conclusion of this work is that, for large astrospheres (with a distance to the bow shock greater than 600 AU) a heated rarefied plasma layer forms in the outer shock layer near the astropause. The formation of this layer is linked to localized heating of the plasma by atoms (specifically, ENAs) that undergo charge exchange again behind the astropause. This process significantly alters the flow structure in the outer shock layer and the location of the bow shock, and it cannot be described by a single-fluid model. Additionally, this paper discusses how atoms weaken the bow shocks at near-heliospheric conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of the MeerKAT radio interferometer is an opportunity to probe deeper into the population of rare and faint extragalactic pulsars. The TRAPUM (TRAnsients and PUlsars with MeerKAT) collaboration has conducted a radio-domain search for accelerated pulsars and transients in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). This partially targeted survey, performed at L-band (856-1712 MHz) with the core array of the MeerKAT telescope in 2-h integrations, is twice as sensitive as the latest SMC radio pulsar survey. We report the discovery of seven new SMC pulsars, doubling this galaxy's radio pulsar population and increasing the total extragalactic population by nearly a quarter. We also carried out a search for accelerated millisecond pulsars in the SMC Globular Cluster NGC 121 using the full array of MeerKAT. This improved the previous upper limit on pulsed radio emission from this cluster by a factor of six. Our discoveries reveal the first radio pulsar-PWN systems in the SMC, with only one such system previously known outside our galaxy (the "Crab pulsar twin" in the Large Magellanic Cloud, PSR J0540$-$6919). We associate the 59 ms pulsar discovery PSR J0040$-$7337, now the fastest spinning radio pulsar in the SMC, with the bow-shock Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN) of Supernova Remnant DEM S5. We also present a new young pulsar with a 79 ms period, PSR J0048$-$7317, in a PWN recently discovered in a MeerKAT radio continuum image. Using the multi-beam capability of MeerKAT, we localised our pulsar discoveries, and two previous Murriyang discoveries, to a positional uncertainty of a few arcseconds.</description>

      <title>Constraining the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ from main sequence binary stars. Theoretical analysis of the accuracy and precision of the age and helium abundance estimates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the theoretical possibility of accurately determining the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ from precise observations of double lined eclipsing binary systems. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we drew synthetic binary systems with masses between 0.85 and 1.00 $M_{\odot}$ from a grid of stellar models with $\Delta Y/\Delta Z = 2.0$ [...]. Subsequently, a broader grid with $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ from 1.0 to 3.0 was used in the fitting process. To account for observational uncertainties, two scenarios were explored: S1 with realistic uncertainties of 100 K in temperature and 0.1 dex in [Fe/H], and S2 with halved uncertainties. We repeated the simulation at two baseline metallicities: [Fe/H] = 0.0 and -0.3. The posterior distributions of $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ were severely biased towards the edge of the allowable range in the S1 errors scenario. The situation only marginally improved when considering the S2 scenario. The effect is due to the impact of changing $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ in the stellar effective temperature and its interplay with [Fe/H] observational error, and it is therefore not restricted to the specific fitting method. Despite the presence of these systematic discrepancies, the age of the systems were recovered unbiased with 10% precision. Our findings indicate that the observational uncertainty in effective temperature and metallicity significantly hinders the accurate determination of the $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ parameter from main sequence binary systems.</description>

      <title>Naming the SMD Bridge Program--A White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) has initiated a program to enhance the participation of historically underrepresented institutions and communities in NASA's mission. Currently known as the NASA SMD Bridge Program, its goal is to establish enduring partnerships among these institutions, research-intensive universities, and NASA centers. There are concerns about using "Bridge" in the program's name, with stakeholders suggesting that it might stigmatize students and mislead applicants about its focus. In this white paper, we address these concerns and conclude that a name change that better reflects the mission of this SMD effort is necessary to address these concerns.</description>

      <title>Properties of the Line-of-Sight Velocity Field in the Hot and X-ray Emitting Circumgalactic Medium of Nearby Simulated Disk Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hot, X-ray-emitting phase of the circumgalactic medium of massive galaxies is believed to be the reservoir of baryons from which gas flows onto the central galaxy and into which feedback from AGN and stars inject mass, momentum, energy, and metals. These effects shape the velocity fields of the hot gas, which can be observed via the Doppler shifting and broadening of emission lines by X-ray IFUs. In this work, we analyze the gas kinematics of the hot circumgalactic medium of Milky Way-mass disk galaxies from the TNG50 simulation with synthetic observations to determine how future instruments can probe this velocity structure. We find that the hot phase is often characterized by outflows from the disk driven by feedback processes, radial inflows near the galactic plane, and rotation, though in some systems the velocity field is more disorganized and turbulent. With a spectral resolution of $\sim$1 eV, fast and hot outflows ($\sim$200-500 km s$^{-1}$) can be measured, depending on the orientation of the galaxy on the sky. The rotation velocity of the hot phase ($\sim$100-200 km s$^{-1}$) can be measured using line shifts in edge-on galaxies, and is slower than that of colder gas phases but similar to stellar rotation velocities. By contrast, the slow inflows ($\sim$50-100 km s$^{-1}$) are difficult to measure in projection with these other components, but may be detected in multi-component spectral fits. We find that the velocity measured is sensitive to which emission lines are used. Measuring these flows will constrain theories of how the gas in these galaxies evolves.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Characterization of Two Ultra Faint-Dwarfs Outside the Halo of the Milky Way: Leo M and Leo K</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of two ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, Leo M and Leo K, that lie outside the halo of the Milky Way. Using Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the resolved stars, we create color-magnitude diagrams reaching the old main sequence turn-off of each system and (i) fit for structural parameters of the galaxies; (ii) measure their distances using the luminosity of the Horizontal Branch stars; (iii) estimate integrated magnitudes and stellar masses; and (iv) reconstruct the star formation histories. Based on their location in the Local Group, neither galaxy is currently a satellite of the Milky Way, although Leo K is located ~26 kpc from the low-mass galaxy Leo T and these two systems may have had a past interaction. Leo M and Leo K have stellar masses of 1.8 (+0.3/-0.2) x 10^4 Msun and 1.2+/-0.2 x 10^4 Msun, and were quenched 10.6 (+2.2/-1.1) Gyr and 12.8 (+0.1/-4.2) Gyr ago, respectively. Given that the galaxies are not satellites of the MW, it is unlikely that they were quenched by environmental processing. Instead, given their low stellar masses, their early quenching timescales are consistent with the scenario that a combination of reionization and stellar feedback shut-down star formation at early cosmic times.</description>

      <title>The robustness in identifying and quantifying high-redshift bars using JWST observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the methodological robustness in identifying and quantifying high-redshift bars is essential for studying their evolution with the {\it James} {\it Webb} Space Telescope (JWST). We used nearby spiral galaxies to generate simulated images at various resolutions and signal-to-noise ratios, and obtained the simulated galaxy images observed in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey from Yu et al. Through a comparison of measurements before and after image degradation, we show that the bar measurements for massive galaxies remain robust against noise. While the measurement of the bar position angle remains unaffected by resolution, the measured bar ellipticity is significantly underestimated in low-resolution images. The size measurement is on average barely affected as long as the intrinsic bar size $a_{\rm bar,\,true}&gt;2\times{\rm FWHM}$. To address these effects, correction functions are derived. We also find that the effectiveness of detecting bars remains at $\sim$\,100\% when the $a_{\rm bar,\,true}/{\rm FWHM}$ is above 2, below which the rate drops sharply, quantitatively validating the effectiveness of using $a_{\rm bar,\,true}&gt;2\times {\rm FWHM}$ as a bar detection threshold. We analyze a set of simulated CEERS images, which take into account observational effects and plausible galaxy (and bar-size) evolution models, and show that a significant (and misleading) reduction in detected bar fraction with increasing redshift would apparently result even if the true bar fraction remained constant. Our results underscore the importance of disentangling the true bar fraction evolution from resolution effects and bar size growth.</description>

      <title>Micro galaxies in LCDM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental prediction of the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) cosmology is the centrally divergent cuspy density profile of dark matter haloes. Density cusps render CDM haloes resilient to tides, and protect dwarf galaxies embedded in them from full tidal disruption. The hierarchical assembly history of the Milky Way may therefore give rise to a population of micro galaxies; i.e., heavily stripped remnants of early accreted satellites, which may reach arbitrarily low luminosity. Assuming that the progenitor systems are dark matter dominated, we use an empirical formalism for tidal stripping to predict the evolution of the luminosity, size, and velocity dispersion of such remnants, tracing their tidal evolution across multiple orders of magnitude in mass and size. The evolutionary tracks depend sensitively on the progenitor distribution of stellar binding energies. We explore three cases that likely bracket most realistic models of dwarf galaxies: one where the energy distribution of the most tightly bound stars follows that of the dark matter, and two where stars are defined by either an exponential density or surface brightness profile. The tidal evolution in the size-velocity dispersion plane is quite similar for these three models, although their remnants may differ widely in luminosity. Micro galaxies are therefore best distinguished from globular clusters by the presence of dark matter; either directly, by measuring their velocity dispersion, or indirectly, by examining their tidal resilience. Our work highlights the need for further theoretical and observational constraints on the stellar energy distribution in dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Observing the Galactic Underworld: Predicting photometry and astrometry from compact remnant microlensing events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Isolated black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs) are largely undetectable across the electromagnetic spectrum. For this reason, our only real prospect of observing these isolated compact remnants is via microlensing; a feat recently performed for the first time. However, characterisation of the microlensing events caused by BHs and NSs is still in its infancy. In this work, we perform N-body simulations to explore the frequency and physical characteristics of microlensing events across the entire sky. Our simulations find that every year we can expect $88_{-6}^{+6}$ BH, $6.8_{-1.6}^{+1.7}$ NS and $20^{+30}_{-20}$ stellar microlensing events which cause an astrometric shift larger than 2~mas. Similarly, we can expect $21_{-3}^{+3}$ BH, $18_{-3}^{+3}$ NS and $7500_{-500}^{+500}$ stellar microlensing events which cause a bump magnitude larger than 1~mag. Leveraging a more comprehensive dynamical model than prior work, we predict the fraction of microlensing events caused by BHs as a function of Einstein time to be smaller than previously thought. Comparison of our microlensing simulations to events in Gaia finds good agreement. Finally, we predict that in the combination of Gaia and GaiaNIR data there will be $14700_{-900}^{+600}$ BH and $1600_{-200}^{+300}$ NS events creating a centroid shift larger than 1~mas and $330_{-120}^{+100}$ BH and $310_{-100}^{+110}$ NS events causing bump magnitudes $&gt; 1$. Of these, $&lt;10$ BH and $5_{-5}^{+10}$ NS events should be detectable using current analysis techniques. These results inform future astrometric mission design, such as GaiaNIR, as they indicate that, compared to stellar events, there are fewer observable BH events than previously thought.</description>

      <title>An overlooked source of uncertainty in the mass of the Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the conventional approach to decomposing a rotation curve into a set of contributions from mass model components, the measurements of the rotation curve at different radii are taken to be independent. It is clear, however, that radial correlations are present in such data, for instance (but not only) because the orbital speed depends on the mass distribution at all (or, minimally, inner) radii. We adopt a very simple parametric form for a covariance matrix and constrain its parameters using Gaussian process regression. Applied to the rotation curve of the Milky Way, this suggests the presence of correlations between neighbouring rotation curve points with amplitudes $&lt;10\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ over length scales of $1.5$-$2.5\,\mathrm{kpc}$ regardless of the assumed dark halo component. We show that accounting for such covariance can result in a $\sim 50$ per cent lower total mass estimate for the Milky Way than when it is neglected, and that the statistical uncertainty associated with the covariance is comparable to or exceeds the total systematic uncertainty budget. Our findings motivate including more detailed treatment of rotation curve covariance in future analyses.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Driven Relativistic Jet in the High-Redshift Blazar OH~471</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context : Understanding the mechanisms that launch and shape powerful relativistic jets from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in high-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) is crucial for probing the co-evolution of SMBHs and galaxies over cosmic time.
  Aims :We study the high-redshift ($z=3.396$) blazar OH~471 to explore the jet launching mechanism in the early Universe.
  Methods : Using multi-frequency radio monitoring observations and high-resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometry imaging over three decades, we study the milliarcsecond structure and long-term variability of OH~471.
  Results : Spectral modelling of the radio flux densities reveals a synchrotron self-absorbed spectrum indicating strong magnetic fields within the compact core. By applying the flux freezing approximation, we estimate the magnetic flux carried by the jet and find that it reaches or exceeds theoretical predictions for jets powered by black hole spin energy via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. This implies that OH~471 was in a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state where the magnetic flux accumulated near the horizon regulates the accretion flow, allowing efficient extraction of black hole rotational energy.
  Conclusions : Our study demonstrates the dominance of MAD accretion in powering the prominent radio flares and relativistic jets observed in the radio-loud AGN OH~471 and statistical studies of large samples of high-redshift AGN will shed light on the role of MAD accretion in launching and accelerating the earliest relativistic jets.</description>

      <title>Improved source classification and performance analysis using Gaia DR3</title>

Abstract: The Discrete Source Classifier (DSC) provides probabilistic classification of sources in Gaia Data Release 3 using a Bayesian framework and a global prior. The DSC Combmod classifier in GDR3 achieved for the extragalactic classes (quasars and galaxies) a high completeness of 92%, but a low purity of 22% due to contamination from the far larger star class. However, these single metrics mask significant variation in performance with magnitude and sky position. Furthermore, a better combination of the individual classifiers is possible. Here we compute two-dimensional representations of the completeness and the purity as function of Galactic latitude and source brightness, and also exclude the Magellanic Clouds where stellar contamination significantly reduces the purity. Reevaluated on a cleaner validation set and without introducing changes to the published GDR3 DSC probabilities themselves, we achieve for Combmod average 2D completenesses of 92% and 95% and average 2D purities of 55% and 89% for the quasar and galaxy classes, respectively. Since the relative proportions of extragalactic objects to stars in Gaia is expected to vary significantly with brightness and latitude, we introduce a new prior as a continuous function of brightness and latitude, and compute new class probabilities. This variable prior only improves the performance by a few percentage points, mostly at the faint end. Significant improvement, however, is obtained by a new additive combination of Specmod and Allosmod. This classifier, Combmod-$\alpha$, achieves average 2D completenesses of 82% and 93% and average 2D purities of 79% and 93% for the quasar and galaxy classes, respectively, when using the global prior. Thus, we achieve a significant improvement in purity for a small loss of completeness. The improvement is most significant for faint quasars where the purity rises from 20% to 62%.</description>

      <title>JADES -- The small blue bump in GN-z11: insights into the nuclear region of a galaxy at z=10.6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of continuum excess in the rest-frame UV between 3000 {\AA} and 3550 {\AA} in the JWST/NIRSpec spectrum of GN-z11, a galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z = 10.603. The shape of the continuum excess resembles a Balmer continuum but has a break around 3546 {\AA} in the rest frame, which is 100 {\AA} bluewards to the Balmer limit at 3646 {\AA}. A Balmer continuum model alone cannot fit the spectrum, implying a different origin for the continuum excess. The absence of the Balmer jump indicates an electron temperature of $\sim 3\times 10^4$ K, which is significantly higher than the temperature of $T_{e}({\rm O^{2+}}) \approx 1.3\times 10^{4}$ K inferred from [OIII]$\lambda 4363$. The temperature difference must result from mixing of different ionized regions: the Balmer emission mainly arises from dense and hot clouds in the Broad Line Region, close to the accreting black hole, whereas the forbidden lines originate from less dense and colder gas in the host galaxy (although these ionized regions are kinematically similar in GN-z11 due to its small BH mass). We propose a potential explanation for the observed continuum excess to come from a complex of FeII emission, which shows a characteristic jump bluewards to the Balmer limit as previously seen in the spectra of many lower-redshift quasars. Through comparisons with Cloudy models, we show an Fe abundance or an overall metallicity above $\sim 1/3$ solar is likely needed. Besides the FeII emission, part of the small blue bump might also be associated with an OIII Bowen fluorescent line, a line often enhanced in dense AGN-ionized gas. Finally, the spectrum provides further evidence against Wolf-Rayet or massive stars dominating the nebular emission in GN-z11.</description>

      <title>Are Lithium-Rich Giants Binaries?: A Radial Velocity Variability Analysis of 1,400 Giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-mass giants with large amounts of lithium (Li) have challenged stellar evolution for decades. One of the possibilities usually discussed to explain them involves the interaction with a close binary companion. This predicts that when compared against their non-enriched counterparts, Li-rich giants should preferentially be found as part of binary systems. In order to test this scenario, we assemble a sample of 1418 giants with radial velocities (RVs) from RAVE, GALAH, and Gaia, as well as stellar parameters and Li abundances from GALAH. Evolutionary states can be determined for 1030 of these giants. We develop a method that quantifies the degree of RV variability, which we use as a proxy for close binary companions. The method is tested and calibrated against samples of known RV standard stars and known spectroscopic binaries. We also compare the results of our RV variability analysis with binarity indicators from Gaia. We find that the accuracy of the classification is controlled by the precision of the RVs, which for the set of RVs available for the giants is 80-85%. Consistent with seismic studies, the resulting sample of giants contains a fraction of Li-rich objects in the red clump (RC) that is twice as large as that for first-ascent giants (RGB). Among RC giants, the fractions of Li-rich objects with high RV variability and with no RV variability are the same as those for Li-normal objects, which argues against a binary interaction scenario for the genesis of the bulk of Li-rich giants at that evolutionary stage. On the other hand, Li-rich giants in the RGB appear to have a small but detectable preference for higher RV variability, and thus possibly a larger close binary fraction, than the Li-normal giants at that stage. Additional measurements of the RVs of these giants at higher RV precision would greatly help confirm and more robustly quantify these results.</description>

      <title>SRG/ART-XC Galactic Plane Survey near Galactic Longitude $l\simeq20^\circ$: Catalog of Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07290v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a catalog of sources detected by the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope onboard the SRG space observatory during the observations of the Galactic plane region near a longitude $l\simeq20$ deg (L20 field) in October 2019. The L20 field was observed four times in the scanning mode, which provided a uniform coverage of the sky region with a total area of $\simeq24$ sq. deg with a median sensitivity of $8\times10^{-13}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ (at 50% detection completeness) in the 4$-$12 keV. As a result, we have detected 29 X-ray sources at a statistically significant level, 11 of which have not been detected previously by other X-ray observatories. Preliminary estimates show that four of them can presumably be extragalactic in nature. We also show that the source SRGA J183220.1$-$103508 (CXOGSG J183220.8$-$103510), is most likely a galaxy cluster containing a bright radio galaxy at redshift $z\simeq0.121$.</description>

Abstract: We present ionization structures of IC 2003, a planetary nebula with [WR] central star, using a 1-D dusty photo-ionization code: "CLOUDY 17.03". The photo-ionization model is constrained by archival UV emission line fluxes, medium-resolution optical spectroscopy, $IRAS$ $25 \mu m$ flux, absolute $H\beta$ flux, and the mean angular size of the nearly spherical optical nebula. To constrain the carbon abundance and the effect of photo-electric heating in the ionized gas, we used UV emission lines. We considered an amorphous carbon dust grain with MRN and KMH size distributions to address the importance of photo-electric heating in the ionized nebula. We show that KMH grain size distribution with quantum dust heating reproduces the observations quite well. We construct the ionization structures of different elements at their different ionization stages in the nebula. We derive the physical properties of the planetary nebula and its chemical composition, as well as the parameters of its central star. The estimated nebular dust-to-gas mass ratio is $2.37\times 10^{-3}$, and the enhanced photo-electric heating yielded by small dust grains is $9.4\%$ of the total heating. We considered the H-poor model atmosphere for the central star; the effective temperature of the central star is 177kK, the specific gravity log(g) is 6, and its luminosity ($L_*$) is 6425 $L_\odot$. The derived central star parameters plotted on stellar evolutionary tracks correspond to a central star mass of 0.636$M_\odot $ and to a progenitor mass of 3.26$M_\odot$.</description>
