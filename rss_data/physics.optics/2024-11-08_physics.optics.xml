      <title>Photon acceleration of high-intensity vector vortex beams into the extreme ultraviolet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light sources allow for the probing of bound electron dynamics on attosecond scales, interrogation of high-energy-density matter, and access to novel regimes of strong-field quantum electrodynamics. Despite the importance of these applications, coherent XUV sources remain relatively rare, and those that do exist are limited in their peak intensity and spatio-polarization structure. Here, we demonstrate that photon acceleration of an optical vector vortex pulse in the moving density gradient of an electron beam-driven plasma wave can produce a high-intensity, tunable-wavelength XUV pulse with the same vector vortex structure as the original pulse. Quasi-3D, boosted-frame particle-in-cell simulations show the transition of optical vector vortex pulses with 800-nm wavelengths and intensities below $10^{18}$ W/cm$^2$ to XUV vector vortex pulses with 36-nm wavelengths and intensities exceeding $10^{20}$ W/cm$^2$ over a distance of 1.2 cm. The XUV pulses have sub-femtosecond durations and nearly flat phase fronts. The production of such high-quality, high-intensity XUV vector vortex pulses could expand the utility of XUV light as a diagnostic and driver of novel light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Frequency-doubled chirped-pulse dual-comb generation in the near-UV: Combined vs separated beam investigations of Rb atoms near 420 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an electro-optic dual-comb system that operates in the near-infrared (near-IR) region to generate optical frequency combs in the near-UV by sum frequency generation in two configurations. The near-IR frequency combs are generated using chirped pulses that down convert the optical information into the radio frequency (RF) domain by a difference in the chirp bandwidths. Near (UV) combs at twice the near-IR bandwidth are obtained by sum frequency generation in a nonlinear crystal and detected by a hybrid photon counting detection system. We compare the results of studies of Rb near 420 nm using two optical arrangements where the near-IR combs are mixed in the crystal as combined or as separated beams. While the latter method enables phase retrievals, the combined beam method is superior for phase stability, power throughput for detection, and ease of alignment. High order interleaving enables near-UV bandwidths near 4 cm-1 for faint photonic sensing and spectroscopic applications. The harmonic generation method is easily extendable across much of the titanium sapphire tuning range.</description>

      <title>Reflection-mode diffraction tomography of multiple-scattering samples on a reflective substrate from intensity images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong substrate reflections and complex scattering effects present significant challenges for diffraction tomography in metrology and inspection applications. To address these issues, we introduce a reflection-mode diffraction tomography technique for imaging strongly scattering samples on a reflective substrate using intensity-only measurements. Our technique leverages the modified Born series to model complex wave interactions with fast and stable convergence, further incorporating Bloch and perfect electric conductor boundary conditions for improved accuracy. The adjoint method is used for efficient gradient computation in solving the inverse problem. Validated on a reflection-mode LED array microscope, we achieve high-resolution reconstructions of dual-layer targets and phase structures through a scattering fiber layer, demonstrating the technique's potential for challenging metrology and inspection tasks.</description>

      <title>Differential absorption ozone Lidar with 4H-SiC single-photon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential absorption Lidar (DIAL) in the ultraviolet (UV) region is an effective approach for monitoring tropospheric ozone. 4H-SiC single-photon detectors (SPDs) are emergent devices for UV single-photon detection. Here, we demonstrate a 4H-SiC SPD-based ozone DIAL. We design and fabricate the 4H-SiC single-photon avalanche diode with a beveled mesa structure and optimized layer thickness. An active quenching circuit with a quenching time of 1.03 ns is developed to significantly mitigate the afterpulsing effect while enhancing the maximum count rate. After characterization, the SPD exhibits excellent performance with a photon detection efficiency of 16.6% at 266 nm, a dark count rate of 138 kcps, a maximum count rate of 13 Mcps, and an afterpulse probability of 2.7% at room temperature. Then, we apply two 4H-SiC SPDs in an ozone DIAL. The measured ozone concentrations at altitudes of 1-3.5 km agree well with the results of a commercial ozone DIAL. Our work provides an alternative solution for general UV Lidar applications.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-Integrated Polarization-Insensitive LCoS for Projection Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) panels, renowned for their high resolution and fill-factor, are integral to modern projection displays. However, their inherent polarization sensitivity constrains the upper limit of light utilization, increases system complexity and restricts broader applicability. Here, we demonstrate a dual-layer metasurface-integrated LCoS prototype that achieves polarization-insensitive, addressable amplitude modulation in the visible. Polarization sensitivity is eliminated in the reflective architecture through polarization conversion in the underlying metasurface and polarization-sensitive phase modulation of the liquid crystals (LC). This is further enhanced by the electrically tunable subwavelength grating formed by the upper metasurface and LC, resulting in a high-contrast, polarization-insensitive optical switch. We showcase a 64-pixel 2D addressable prototype capable of generating diverse projection patterns with high contrast. Compatible with existing LCoS processes, our metasurface device reduces system size and enhances energy efficiency, offering applications in projectors and AR/VR displays, with the potential to redefine projection chip technology.</description>

      <title>Integrated electro-optic digital-to-analog link for efficient computing and arbitrary waveform generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth in artificial intelligence and modern communication systems demands innovative solutions for increased computational power and advanced signaling capabilities. Integrated photonics, leveraging the analog nature of electromagnetic waves at the chip scale, offers a promising complement to approaches based on digital electronics. To fully unlock their potential as analog processors, establishing a common technological base between conventional digital electronic systems and analog photonics is imperative to building next-generation computing and communications hardware. However, the absence of an efficient interface has critically challenged comprehensive demonstrations of analog advantage thus far, with the scalability, speed, and energy consumption as primary bottlenecks. Here, we address this challenge and demonstrate a general electro-optic digital-to-analog link (EO-DiAL) enabled by foundry-based lithium niobate nanophotonics. Using purely digital inputs, we achieve on-demand generation of (i) optical and (ii) electronic waveforms at information rates up to 186 Gbit/s. The former addresses the digital-to-analog electro-optic conversion challenge in photonic computing, showcasing high-fidelity MNIST encoding while consuming 0.058 pJ/bit. The latter enables a pulse-shaping-free microwave arbitrary waveform generation method with ultrabroadband tunable delay and gain. Our results pave the way for efficient and compact digital-to-analog conversion paradigms enabled by integrated photonics and underscore the transformative impact analog photonic hardware may have on various applications, such as computing, optical interconnects, and high-speed ranging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a family of paraxial beams constructed by the linear superposition of Laguerre-Gaussian beams, representing an optical analogue to generalized $SU(2)$ Lie group coherent states. A single complex parameter controls a smooth transition between Laguerre-Gaussian and Hermite-Gaussian beams, with intermediate beams that merge characteristics of both families. Our beams exhibit propagation-invariant properties, up to a scaling factor, a highly desirable feature for optical applications, validated via holographic experimental results.</description>

      <title>Programmable photonic unitary circuits for light computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitarity serves as a fundamental concept for characterizing linear and conservative wave phenomena in both classical and quantum systems. Developing platforms that perform unitary operations on light waves in a uni-versal and programmable manner enables the emulation of complex light-matter interactions and the execution of general-purpose functionalities for wave manipulations, photonic computing, and quantum circuits. Recent-ly, numerous approaches to implementing programmable photonic unitary circuits have been proposed and demonstrated, each employing different design strategies that distinctly impact overall device performance. Here, we review foundational design principles and recent achievements in the implementation of programma-ble photonic unitary circuits, with a particular focus on integrated photonic platforms. We classify the design strategies based on the dimensionality of nontrivial unit operations in their building blocks: lower-dimensional unitary units, such as SU(2) operations, and higher-dimensional ones, such as Fourier transforms. In each cate-gory, recent efforts to leverage alternative physical axes, such as the temporal and frequency domains, to ad-dress scalability challenges are also reviewed. We discuss the underlying concepts, design procedures, and trade-offs of each design strategy, especially in relation to light-based computing.</description>

      <title>Visualizing hot carrier dynamics by nonlinear optical microscopy at the atomic length scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing and manipulating the spatiotemporal dynamics of hot carriers in nanoscale metals is crucial to a plethora of applications ranging from nonlinear nanophotonics to single molecule photochemistry. The direct investigation of these highly non-equilibrium carriers requires the experimental capability of high energy resolution (~ meV) broadband femtosecond spectroscopy. When considering the ultimate limits of atomic scale structures, this capability has remained out of reach until date. Using a two color femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy, we present here the real-time tracking of hot carrier dynamics in a well-defined plasmonic picocavity, formed in the tunnel junction of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). The excitation of hot carriers in the picocavity enables ultrafast all optical control over the broadband (~ eV) anti Stokes electronic resonance Raman scattering (ERRS) and the four-wave mixing (FWM) signals generated at the atomic length scale. By mapping the ERRS and FWM signals from a single graphene nanoribbon (GNR), we demonstrate that both signals are more efficiently generated along the edges of the GNR: a manifestation of atomic-scale nonlinear optical microscopy. This demonstration paves the way to the development of novel ultrafast nonlinear picophotonic platforms, affording unique opportunities in a variety of contexts, from the direct investigation of non equilibrium light matter interactions in complex quantum materials, to the development of robust strategies for hot carriers harvesting in single molecules and the next generation of active metasurfaces with deep-sub-wavelength meta-atoms.</description>

      <title>Multi-Wavelength Selective Thermal Emission Enabled by Dual-Layer Localized Surface Plasmon Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal emission is a ubiquitous electromagnetic wave with an extreme broad spectrum in nature, and controlling thermal emission can be used to develop low-cost and convenient infrared light sources with wavelength tunable in a wide range that is currently difficult to other sources. Conventional metasurfaces are commonly used to control light but lack the flexibility to achieve complex emission spectral profiles and dynamic tuning. Here, we introduce a novel dual-layer metasurface structure with two completely independent layers to achieve a multi-peak thermal emission within the 5-8 {\mu}m wavelength range. Simulations and experiments show that this two-layer structure can achieve arbitrary spectral shapes without interfering with multiple resonant modes. This unique configuration presents a promising platform for further exploration in thermal emission engineering, enabling spectral control and dynamic tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip coherent laser sources are crucial for the future of photonic integrated circuits, yet progress has been hindered by the complex interplay between material quality, device geometry, and performance metrics. We combine high-throughput characterization, statistical analysis, experimental design, and multi-objective Bayesian optimization to accelerate the design process for low-threshold, high-yield III-V microring lasers with room-temperature operation at communication wavelengths. We demonstrate a 1.6$\times$ reduction in threshold over expert-designed configurations, achieving a 100% lasing yield that emits within the O-band with a median threshold as low as 33$\mu$J cm$^{-2}$ pulse$^{-1}$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a method to retrieve full-complex models (Transmission Matrix and Neural Network) of a highly multimode fiber (140 LP modes/polarization) using a straightforward machine learning approach, without the need of a reference beam. The models are first validated by the high fidelity between the predicted and the experimental images in the near field and far field output planes (Pearson correlation coefficient between 97.5% and 99.1% with our trained Transmission Matrix or Neural Network). Their accuracy was further confirmed by successful 3D beam shaping, a task achievable only with a true full complex model. As a prospect, we also demonstrate the ability of our neural network architecture to model nonlinear Kerr propagation in gradient index multimode fiber and predict the output beam shape.</description>

      <title>Conditional neural holography: a distance-adaptive CGH generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is useful for overcoming the trade-off between generation speed and accuracy in the process of synthesizing computer-generated holograms (CGHs). However, methods using a CNN have limited applicability as they cannot specify the propagation distance when synthesizing a hologram. We developed a distance-adaptive CGH generator that can generate CGHs by specifying the target image and propagation distance, which comprises a zone plate encoder stage and an augmented HoloNet stage. Our model is comparable to that of prior CNN methods, with a fixed distance, in terms of performance and achieves the generation accuracy and speed necessary for practical use.</description>

      <title>PZT Optical Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical memristors represent a monumental leap in the fusion of photonics and electronics, heralding a new era of new applications from neuromorphic computing to artificial intelligence. However, current technologies are hindered by complex fabrication, limited endurance, high optical loss or low modulation efficiency. For the first time, we unprecedentedly reveal optical non-volatility in thin-film Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) by electrically manipulating the ferroelectric domains to control the refractive index, providing a brand-new routine for optical memristors. The developed PZT optical memristors offer unprecedented advantages more than exceptional performance metrics like low loss, high precision, high-efficiency modulation, high stability quasi-continuity and reconfigurability. The wafer-scale sol-gel fabrication process also ensures compatible with standardized mass fabrication processes and high scalability for photonic integration. Specially, these devices also demonstrate unique functional duality: setting above a threshold voltage enables non-volatile behaviors, below this threshold allows volatile high-speed optical switching. This marks the first-ever optical memristor capable of performing high-speed signal processing and non-volatile retention on a single platform, and is also the inaugural demonstration of scalable functional systems. The PZT optical memristors developed here facilitate the realization of novel paradigms for high-speed and energy-efficient optical interconnects, programmable PICs, quantum computing, neural networks, in-memory computing and brain-like architecture.</description>

Abstract: Topological properties of photonic structures described by Hamiltonian matrices have been extensively studied in recent years. Photonic systems are often open systems, and their coupling with the environment is characterized by scattering matrices, which can exhibit topological features as well. In this work, we uncover that topological singularities can be manifested in the scattering matrices of two-dimensional periodic photonic systems with open boundaries in the third dimension, introducing a new topological approach to describe scattering. We elaborate the importance of symmetry and demonstrate that mirror symmetry gives rise to the formation of diabolic points and nodal lines in the three-dimensional frequency-momentum space, which transform into exceptional points and lines in the presence of material loss. These topological features in the eigenvalue structure of the scattering matrix manifest as vortex lines in the cross-polarization scattering phase, providing a direct link between the eigen-problem and observable scattering phenomena in the frequency-momentum space. We demonstrate these phenomena numerically and experimentally using a reflective non-local metasurface. These findings extend the concept of topological singularities to scattering matrices and pave the way for novel photonic devices and wavefront engineering techniques.</description>

      <title>Robust multimode interference and conversion in topological unidirectional surface magnetoplasmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have theoretically investigated surface magnetoplasmons (SMPs) in a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sandwiched waveguide. The dispersion demonstated that this waveguide can support topological unidirectional SMPs. Based on unidirectional SMPs, magnetically controllable multimode interference (MMI) is verified in both symmetric and asymmetric waveguides. Due to the coupling between the modes along two YIG-air interfaces, the asymmetric waveguide supports a unidirectional even mode within a single-mode frequency range. Moreover, these modes are topological protected when disorder is introduced. Utilizing robust unidirectional SMPs MMI (USMMI), tunable splitters have been achieved. It has been demonstrated that mode conversion between different modes can be realized. These results provide many degrees of freedom to manipulate topological waves.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced acousto-optic modulators on polymer-loaded lithium niobate integrated platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On chip acousto-optic (AO) modulation represents a significant advancement in the development of highly integrated information processing systems. However, conventional photonic devices face substantial challenges in achieving efficient conversion due to the limited overlap between acoustic waves and optical waves. In this study, we address this limitation by demonstrating an enhanced conversion effect of photonic crystal nanobeam cavities (PCNBCs) in AO modulation on a polymer-loaded lithium niobate integrated platform. Attributed to the high ratio of quality factor (Q) to mode volume (V) and optimal light-sound overlap within the nanocavity, PCNBCs-based AO modulator exhibits a significantly enhanced extinction ratio of 38 dB with a threshold RF power below -50 dBm, which is two orders of magnitude lower than that based on micro-ring resonator (MRRs). In addition, robust digital amplitude shift keying modulations using selected RF and optical channels of the PCNBCs-enhanced AO modulators. These findings validate the compelling properties of the PCNBCs photonic platform, establishing it as a promising candidate for on-chip integrated microwave photonics, optical transceivers, and computing applications.</description>

      <title>Peregrine solitons and resonant radiation in cubic and quadratic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the fascinating phenomena of resonant radiation emitted by transient rogue waves in cubic and quadratic nonlinear media, particularly those shed from Peregrine solitons, one of the main wavepackets used today to model real-world rogue waves. In cubic media, it turns out that the emission of radiation from a Peregrine soliton can be attributed to the presence of higher-order dispersion, but is affected by the intrinsic local longitudinal variation of the soliton wavenumber. In quadratic media, we reveal that a two-color Peregrine rogue wave can resonantly radiate dispersive waves even in the absence of higher-order dispersion, subjected to a phase-matching mechanism that involves the second harmonic wave, and to a concomitant difference-frequency generation process. In both cubic and quadratic media, we provide simple analytic criteria for calculating the radiated frequencies in terms of material parameters, showing excellent agreement with numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using optical technology for current injection and electromagnetic emission simplifies the comparison between materials. Here, we inject current into monolayer graphene and bulk gallium arsenide (GaAs) using two-color quantum interference and detect the emitted electric field by electro-optic sampling. We find the amplitude of emitted terahertz (THz) radiation scales in the same way for both materials even though they differ in dimension, band gap, atomic composition, symmetry and lattice structure. In addition, we observe the same mapping of the current direction to the light characteristics. With no electrodes for injection or detection, our approach will allow electron scattering timescales to be directly measured. We envisage that it will enable exploration of new materials suitable for generating terahertz magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Broadband THz Generation from NV Centers in Bulk Diamond Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamond single crystals could be an attractive nonlinear THz source due to the materials high damage threshold, high transparency and THz-NIR phase matching ability. However, the buildup of second order nonlinear fields is restricted due to the centrosymmetric structure of the crystal. Here, we demonstrate nonlinear broadband THz emission due to optical rectification from diamond single crystals induced by embedded symmetry breaking nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. The nonlinear temporal and spectral emission properties of the crystal are examined using THz time domain spectroscopy after pumping with NIR femtosecond pulses. The diamond-NV cell structure was also examined using density functional theory (DFT). The results show the potential of NV centers in diamond as a new nonlinear platform for broadband efficient THz generation.</description>

      <title>Bell state generation and CNOT operation using on-demand identical photons from shape-controlled spatially ordered quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fault tolerant on-chip photonic quantum computation is enormously helped by (a) deterministic generation of the needed thousands to millions of photon qubits from (b) quantum emitters in designed spatially ordered arrays to enable networks for implementing many-qubit logic circuits. Scaling up photonic quantum information processing systems has, however, been prevented by the lack of such quantum emitters until the demonstration of the platform of mesa-top single quantum dots (MTSQDs) -- controlled shape, size, and volume single QD -- located in designed regular arrays. Here we demonstrate 2 qubit CNOT gate operation -- a universal gate necessary to enable quantum circuits of arbitrary complexity -- in polarization basis using photons emitted from individual MTSQDs. A Bell state fidelity of 0.825$\pm$0.010 is achieved with two photon interference (TPI) visibility of 0.947$\pm$0.0015 at 4K without Purcell enhancement. The results make a strong case for developing MTSQD arrays for utility scale optical quantum information processing platforms.</description>

      <title>Tunable transmissive metasurface based on thin-film lithium niobate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active metasurfaces hold great promise for spatial light modulation, and electro-optic tuning using lithium niobate is particularly attractive due to its high transparency and well-established thin-film platform. In this work, we present a free-space transmissive light modulator based on a seemingly un-patterned thin-film lithium niobate-on-insulator platform, integrated with a transparent conductive oxide meta-grating fabricated through a single lithography process. Guided mode resonance in the near-infrared region is induced with high mode confinement within lithium niobate layer, which directly in contact with the electrodes. A notable resonance shift of 0.38 nm is observed for the fundamental mode under +-10 V bias, while a maximum modulation amplitude of 4.6% is achieved for another higher-order mode. Incident angle is further exploited as another tuning parameter to split and sensitively shift the resonances. These results demonstrate the potential of this design for applications in compact, scalable, and tunable spatial light modulation devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum limited imaging of a nanomechanical resonator with a spatial mode sorter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the use of a spatial mode sorter to image a nanomechanical resonator, with the goal of studying the quantum limits of active imaging and extending the toolbox for optomechanical force sensing. In our experiment, we reflect a Gaussian laser beam from a vibrating nanoribbon and pass the reflected beam through a commercial spatial mode demultiplexer (Cailabs Proteus). The intensity in each demultiplexed channel depends on the mechanical mode shapes and encodes information about their displacement amplitudes. As a concrete demonstration, we monitor the angular displacement of the ribbon's fundamental torsion mode by illuminating in the fundamental Hermite-Gauss mode (HG$_{00}$) and reading out in the HG$_{01}$ mode. We show that this technique permits readout of the ribbon's torsional vibration with a precision near the quantum limit. Our results highlight new opportunities at the interface of quantum imaging and quantum optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Bridging Rayleigh-Jeans and Bose-Einstein condensation of a guided fluid of light with positive and negative temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the free propagation geometry of a light beam (or fluid of light) in a multimode waveguide. As a result of the effective photon-photon interactions, the photon fluid thermalizes to an equilibrium state during its conservative propagation. In this configuration, Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) thermalization and condensation of classical light waves have been recently observed experimentally in graded index multimode optical fibers characterized by a 2D parabolic trapping potential. As well-known, the properties of RJ condensation differ substantially from those of Bose-Einstein (BE) condensation: The condensate fraction decreases quadratically with the temperature for BE condensation, while it decreases linearly for RJ condensation. Furthermore, for quantum particles the heat capacity tends to zero at small temperatures, and it takes a constant value in the classical particle limit at high temperatures. This is in contrast with classical RJ waves, where the specific heat takes a constant value at small temperatures, and tends to vanish above the condensation transition in the normal (uncondensed) state. Here, we reconcile the thermodynamic properties of BE and RJ condensation: By introducing a frequency cut-off inherent to light propagation in a waveguide, we derive generalized expressions of the thermodynamic properties that include the RJ and BE limits as particular cases. We extend the approach to encompass negative temperatures. In contrast to positive temperatures, the specific heat does not display a singular behavior at negative temperatures, reflecting the non-critical nature of the transition to a macroscopic population of the highest energy level. Our work contributes to understanding the quantum-to-classical crossover in the equilibrium properties of light, within a versatile experimental platform based on nonlinear optical propagation in multimode waveguides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-injection locking (SIL) of laser diodes to microresonators is a powerful technique that enables compact narrow linewidth lasers. Here, we extend this technique to chip-integrated Fabry-Perot microresonators, which offer high-quality factors and large mode volumes in a compact footprint, reducing fundamental thermo-refractive noise. The resonators consist of a silicon nitride waveguide terminated by two photonic crystal reflectors fabricated via scalable ultraviolet lithography. Evanescent side-coupling allows precise tuning of the SIL feedback mechanism. We present a theoretical model and experimentally demonstrate SIL, resulting in a fundamental thermorefractive-noise-limited laser. We achieve excellent agreement between the experimental results and theoretical model. These results complement current SIL techniques and are relevant to chip-scale low-noise laser systems.</description>

      <title>Representing Domain-Mixing Optical Degradation for Real-World Computational Aberration Correction via Vector Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relying on paired synthetic data, existing learning-based Computational Aberration Correction (CAC) methods are confronted with the intricate and multifaceted synthetic-to-real domain gap, which leads to suboptimal performance in real-world applications. In this paper, in contrast to improving the simulation pipeline, we deliver a novel insight into real-world CAC from the perspective of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). By incorporating readily accessible unpaired real-world data into training, we formalize the Domain Adaptive CAC (DACAC) task, and then introduce a comprehensive Real-world aberrated images (Realab) dataset to benchmark it. The setup task presents a formidable challenge due to the intricacy of understanding the target optical degradation domain. To this intent, we propose a novel Quantized Domain-Mixing Representation (QDMR) framework as a potent solution to the issue. Centering around representing and quantizing the optical degradation which is consistent across different images, QDMR adapts the CAC model to the target domain from three key aspects: (1) reconstructing aberrated images of both domains by a VQGAN to learn a Domain-Mixing Codebook (DMC) characterizing the optical degradation; (2) modulating the deep features in CAC model with DMC to transfer the target domain knowledge; and (3) leveraging the trained VQGAN to generate pseudo target aberrated images from the source ones for convincing target domain supervision. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks reveal that the models with QDMR consistently surpass the competitive methods in mitigating the synthetic-to-real gap, which produces visually pleasant real-world CAC results with fewer artifacts.

      <description>arXiv:2404.01221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum interaction between free electrons and photons is fundamental to free-electron based light sources and free-electron quantum optics applications. A large coupling between free electrons and photons is generally desired. In this manuscript, I obtain the upper bound for the quantum coupling between free electrons and photons. The upper bound has a straightforward expression and can be applied to a broad range of optical materials, especially widely used low-loss photonic materials. The upper bound depends on the optical medium, the free-electron velocity, and the separation between the free electron and the optical medium. With simple structures, the numerically calculated coupling coefficient can reach ~99% of the upper bound. This study provides simple and practical guidance to reach the strong coupling between free electrons and photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bosonic codes offer a hardware-efficient approach to encoding and protecting quantum information with a single continuous-variable bosonic system. In this paper, we introduce a new universal quantum gate set composed of only one type of gate element, which we call the quantum lattice gate, to engineer bosonic code states for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We develop a systematic framework for code state engineering based on the Floquet Hamiltonian engineering, where the target Hamiltonian is constructed directly from the given target state(s). We apply our method to three basic code state engineering processes, including single code state preparation, code space embedding and code space transformation. Furthermore, we explore the application of our method to automatic quantum error correction against single-photon loss with four-legged cat codes. Our proposal is particularly well-suited for superconducting circuit architectures with Josephson junctions, where the full nonlinearity of Josephson junction potential is harnessed as a quantum resource and the quantum lattice gate can be implemented on a sub-nanosecond timescale.</description>

Abstract: The coupling between acoustic vibrations in a lithium niobate bulk acoustic wave resonator and microwave photons of a re-entrant microwave cavity was investigated at a temperature close to 4 K. Coupling was achieved by placing the acoustic resonator in the location of the re-entrant cavity electric field maxima, in a symmetric "split-post" configuration, with a large overlap between the microwave field and the acoustic mode, allowing acoustic modulations of the microwave frequency. We show that the acoustic modes in this setup retain large inherent quality factors of greater than $10^6$. A maximum optomechanical coupling rate was determined to be $g_0$ = 0.014 mHz, four orders of magnitude larger than previous results obtained using a quartz BAW at 4 K in a similar experimental setup, but using a single post-re-entrant cavity resonator.</description>
