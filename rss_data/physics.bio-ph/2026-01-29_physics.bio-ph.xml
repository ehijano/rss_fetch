      <title>Controlled drug delivery from chitosan-coated heparin-loaded nanopores anodically grown on nitinol shape-memory alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitinol (NiTi shape-memory alloy) is an interesting candidate in various medical applications like dental, orthopedic, and cardiovascular devices, owing to its unique mechanical behaviors and proper biocompatibility. The aim of this work is the local controlled delivery of a cardiovascular drug, heparin, loaded onto nitinol treated by electrochemical anodizing and chitosan coating. In this regard, the structure, wettability, drug release kinetics, and cell cytocompatibility of the specimens were analyzed in vitro. The two-stage anodizing process successfully developed a regular nanoporous layer of Ni-Ti-O on nitinol, which considerably decreased the sessile water contact angle and induced hydrophilicity. The application of the chitosan coatings controlled the release of heparin mainly by a diffusional mechanism, where the drug release mechanisms were evaluated by the Higuchi, first-order, zero-order, and Korsmeyer-Pepass models. Human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVECs) viability assay also showed the non-cytotoxicity of the samples, so that the best performance was found for the chitosan-coated samples. It is concluded that the designed drug delivery systems are promising for cardiovascular, particularly stent applications.</description>

      <title>Roles of pigment arrangement in light-harvesting phycobiliproteins revealed by recombinant techniques combined with two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed methods for protein synthesis and performed two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2D-ES) to examine the influence of pigment arrangement on the photoexcitation dynamics of light-harvesting proteins in phycobilisome. We synthesized allophycocyanin (APC), C-phycocyanin (CPC), and mutant CPC lacking the \b{eta}153 phycocyanobilin (PCB) pigment by an Escherichia coli expression system. The number of pigments in the mutant CPC is identical to that in the wild-type APC, and their spatial arrangements are similar. The absorption and fluorescence spectra of the mutant CPC closely resemble those of the wild-type CPC rather than the wild-type APC, indicating that pigment spatial arrangement is not a primary factor in determining the excited-state energy structure. The 2D-ES measurements show that the wild-type CPC retains broad positive signals at 1 ps, signifying incomplete relaxation and persistence of excited vibronic states, unlike APC, which vibrationally relaxes to the bottom of the potential energy surface within the same timeframe. The mutant CPC behaves similarly to the wild-type CPC in the 2D-ES, reinforcing that the pigment number or arrangement is not a dominant factor. Instead, the local pigment-protein interaction governs the electronic structure and relaxation dynamics. Structural analysis reveals that the bent structure of PCB in CPC's {\alpha}-chain versus the planar structure of PCB in APC. The bent PCB in CPC reduces the degree of {\pi}-conjugation, and exhibits excited-state properties distinct from those of the planar structure of PCB in APC. This finding highlights a critical role of the electronic structure governed by the local interaction in ultrafast energy relaxation.</description>

      <title>Steer'n Roll: A Stereoscopic Flow-Sensing Strategy for Planktonic Prey Detection and Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planktonic organisms such as copepods sense swimming prey and sinking food particles through the hydrodynamic disturbances they generate. However, because these flow fields are often highly symmetric, they provide little directional information, making accurate localization of the source challenging. Here, we introduce the steer'n roll sensing and response strategy. This strategy combines stereoscopic flow sensing and a roll motion. Stereoscopic sensing allows plankton to disambiguate flow signals by integrating two spatially separated flow measurements, while a roll about the swimming axis enhances exploration of the three-dimensional space. We show that steer'n roll is efficient, achieving a 100% success rate, versatile across signal type, and robust to flow sensing noise, orientational diffusion, and turbulence. Together, these findings identify a biologically plausible mechanism for prey detection and capture via flow sensing, and offer testable insights into the sensory-motor strategies of planktonic organisms.</description>

      <title>What Does FEXI Measure in Neurons?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exchange between tissue compartments is crucial for interpretation of diffusion MRI measurements in brain gray matter. Reported values of exchange time are broadly dispersed, about two orders of magnitude. We analyze the measurement technique called Filtered Exchange Imaging (FEXI) using numerical solution of Bloch--Torrey equation in digitalized neurons downloaded from NeuroMorpho.org. The FEXI outcome, the recovery of diffusion coefficient in cells with impermeable membrane is multiexponential, tightly related to the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator. Fitting the commonly used exponential recovery function results in a strong dependence of the apparent exchange time on the involved mixing time interval. For short mixing times, exchange time is of the order of 10 ms. It gets an order of magnitude larger for mixing times of a few hundreds of milliseconds. To obtain an estimate of membrane permeability, we reinterpret previously published data on preexchange lifetime in neuronal cell culture. It results in the permeability 0.005 micrometer/ms. The corresponding exchange time is about 140 ms. We conclude that essentially shorter exchange times are due to fast geometric exchange inside the ramified cells.</description>

      <title>Chesapeake Bay Food Web: Robustness Analysis via Energy Cutoff in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chesapeake Bay, one of the largest estuaries in the United States, is an ecological system of great complexity and relevance. The food web is composed of thirty-six trophic components, all of which are functionally connected. In this work, the interactions among these components are numerically analyzed using complex network methods. An energy flow cutoff paradigm is applied to a weighted ecological network. The results reveal patterns characteristic of connectivity dynamics, evidencing both the initial robustness of the system and its tendency to fragmentation at higher values of the cutoff. From an applied perspective, the findings underscore the importance of conservation strategies that protect keystone species, such as carnivorous fish, which act as crucial connectors between the two main subnetworks. Although they are positioned at the top of the food web and are often assumed to be less critical to network stability, these species play a pivotal role in regulating populations of lower-level organisms, thereby maintaining the overall integrity of the ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Integrated vortex-assisted electroporation platform with enhanced throughput for genetic delivery to primary cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primary human cells offer the most faithful representation of native human physiology, yet their practical utility is constrained by the difficulty of introducing exogenous genetic material. Electroporation provides a promising non-viral gene delivery approach; however, conventional bulk systems lack the uniformity and integration required for heterogeneous primary cell samples. Here, we present a vortex-assisted electroporation platform integrating size-selective cell trapping with enhanced throughput, parameter optimization across buffer and electrical conditions, and robust delivery of plasmid DNA and in vitro-transcribed mRNA in primary human cells. This integrated platform provides a unified workflow that addresses sample heterogeneity, throughput demands, and delivery efficiency, enabling broader implementation of non-viral gene delivery into primary cells for research and translational applications.</description>

      <title>Advances in ion-doping of Ca-Mg silicate bioceramics for bone tissue engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of bioceramics as hard tissue substitutes is extensive due to their excellent biocompatible and osteogenic behaviors. Among various bioceramics, Ca-Mg silicates are unique from the viewpoints of osteoinductive and mechanical properties, as well as their outstanding osteoconductive and angiogenic behaviors owing to the release of Si, Ca and Mg. Despite these distinct advantages, different compositions of these bioceramics still require mechanical and biological enhancements for further applications. For this purpose, doping with some ions like F-, Sr2+, Cu2+, Eu2+, Ba+, Ce3+ and some alkali cations has been proved to be a valued approach. This review attempts to bring together areas for the performance improvement of the further researched Ca-Mg silicates (i.e., diopside, akermanite, bredigite and monticellite) and the alteration of these compositions via ion-doping. It is concluded that a correct choice of dopants incorporated at the optimal concentration makes these silicates ideal bone substitutes competing or even superior to calcium phosphates (apatites) and bioglasses which are known as the most prominent bioceramics.</description>

      <title>A Practical Computational Hemolysis Model Incorporating Biophysical Properties of the Red Blood Cell Membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Hemolysis is a key issue in the design of blood-handling medical devices. Computational prediction of this phenomenon is challenging due to the complex multiscale nature of blood. As a result, conventional approaches often fail to predict hemolysis accurately, commonly showing deviations of multiple orders of magnitude compared to experimental data. More accurate models are typically computationally expensive and thus impractical for real-world applications. This work aims to fill this gap by presenting accurate yet simple and efficient computational hemolysis models.
  Methods: Hemolysis modeling relies on two key components: a red blood cell model and a hemoglobin release model. In this work, we compare three red blood cell models: a common stress-based model (Bludszuweit), a simple strain-based model based on the Kelvin-Voigt constitutive law, and a more complex tensor-based model (TTM). Further, we compare two hemoglobin release models: the widely used power-law approach and a biophysical pore formation model.
  Results: We evaluate these models in two benchmark cases: the FDA blood pump and the FDA nozzle. In both benchmarks, the simple strain-based model combined with the pore formation model achieves absolute predictions of hemolysis within the standard deviation of experimental measurements. In contrast, stress-based power law models deviate by several orders of magnitude.
  Conclusion: The strain-based pore modeling approach takes into account the biophysical properties of red blood cell membranes, in particular their viscoelastic deformation behavior and hemoglobin release through membrane pores. This leads to significantly improved hemolysis predictions in a framework that can easily be integrated into common CFD workflows.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium noise emerging from broken detailed balance in active gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In thermodynamic equilibrium, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem links thermal fluctuations and dissipation. Biological systems, however, are driven out of equilibrium by internal processes that produce additional, active fluctuations. Despite being relevant for biological functions such as intracellular transport, predicting the statistical properties of active fluctuations remains challenging. Here, we address this challenge in a minimal model of an active gel as a network of elastic elements connected by transient crosslinks. The crosslinkers' binding and unbinding rates break detailed balance, which drives the system out of equilibrium. Through coarse-graining, we derive fluctuating hydrodynamic equations including an active noise term, which emerges explicitly from the breaking of detailed balance. Finally, we provide predictions for the stochastic motion of a tracer particle embedded in the active gel, which enables comparisons with microrheology experiments both in synthetic active gels and in cells. Overall, our work provides an explicit link between the statistical properties of active fluctuations and the molecular breaking of detailed balance. Thus, it paves the way toward complementing the fluctuation-dissipation theorem with a fluctuation-activity relation in active systems.</description>

      <title>Ion-Modulated Polyelectrolyte Complexation of DNA and Polyacrylic Acid from Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of complexes between like-charged polyelectrolytes challenges conventional electrostatic intuition and highlights the central role of ions in mediating macromolecular organization. Here, we investigate the salt-dependent association of DNA with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in NaCl, MgCl$_2$, and CaCl$_2$ solutions. A time-resolved state classification scheme, based on heavy-atom distance and hydrogen-bond formation, was applied to distinguish bound and unbound configurations, enabling quantitative analysis of how ion valency modulates complex stability and structure. The results reveal a clear hierarchy of association strength with Ca$^{2+}$ promoting persistent complex formation through direct inner-sphere coordination between DNA phosphates and PAA carboxylates, Mg$^{2+}$ mediating weaker, transient bridging interactions and Na$^+$ exhibiting only electrostatic screening action with negligible bridge formation. Structural analysis shows that multivalent ions not only enhance complex stability but also reshape the molecular organization of both macromolecules. Ca$^{2+}$ induces expansion of DNA and compaction of PAA within a strongly bridged complex characterized by directional alignment and backbone-dominated binding, whereas Mg$^{2+}$ promotes more transient groove associations and Na$^+$ supports flexible, weakly correlated contacts. Our findings provide molecular-level insight into ion-specific mechanisms underlying polyelectrolyte organization and inform the design of responsive biomaterials and nucleic acid-based assemblies in multivalent ionic environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Squeezing Enhanced Photothermal Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Label-free optical microscopy through absorption or scattering spectroscopy provides fundamental insights across biology and materials science, yet its sensitivity remains fundamentally limited by photon shot noise. While recent demonstrations of quantum nonlinear microscopy show sub-shot-limited sensitivity, they are intrinsically limited by availability of high peak-power squeezed light sources. Here, we introduce squeezing-enhanced photothermal (SEPT) microscopy, a quantum imaging technique that leverages twin-beam quantum correlations to detect absorption induced signals with unprecedented sensitivity. SEPT achieves 3.5 dB noise suppression beyond the standard quantum limit, enabling a 2.5-fold increase in imaging throughput or 31% reduction in pump power, while providing an unmatched versatility through the intrinsic compatibility between continuous-wave squeezing and photothermal modulation. We showcase SEPT applications by providing high-precision characterization of nanoparticles and revealing subcellular structures, such as cytochrome c, that remain undetectable under shot-noise-limited imaging. By combining label-free contrast, quantum-enhanced sensitivity, and compatibility with existing microscopy platforms, SEPT establishes a new paradigm for molecular absorption imaging with far-reaching implications in cellular biology, nanoscience, and materials characterization.</description>

      <title>From biting to engulfment: curvature-actin coupling controls phagocytosis of soft, deformable targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phagocytosis is a fundamental process of the innate immune system, yet the physical determinants that govern the engulfment of soft, deformable targets remain poorly understood. Existing theoretical models typically approximate targets as rigid particles, overlooking the fact that both immune cells and many biological targets undergo significant membrane deformation during contact. Here, we develop a Monte Carlo-based membrane simulation framework to model the interactions of multiple vesicles, enabling us to explore phagocytosis-like processes in systems where both the phagocyte and the target possess flexible, thermally fluctuating membranes. We first validate our approach against established observations for the engulfment of rigid objects. We then investigate how the mechanical properties of a soft target -- specifically membrane bending rigidity govern the outcome of phagocytic interactions. Our simulations reveal three distinct mechanical regimes: (i) biting or trogocytosis, in which the phagocyte extracts a portion of the target vesicle; (ii) pushing, where the target is displaced rather than engulfed; and (iii) full engulfment, in which the target is completely internalized. Increasing membrane tension via internal pressure produces analogous transitions, demonstrating a unified mechanical origin for these behaviours. Qualitative comparison with experiments involving Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs, deformable microparticles) and lymphoma cells supports the relevance of these regimes to biological phagocytosis. Together, these results highlight how target deformability fundamentally shapes phagocytic success and suggest that immune cells may exploit mechanical cues to recognize among different classes of soft targets.</description>

      <title>Forces and symmetry breaking of a living meso-swimmer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21396v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Swimming is ubiquitous in nature and crucial for the survival of a wide range of organisms. The physics of swimming at the viscosity-dominated microscale and inertia-dominated macroscale is well studied. However, in between lies a complicated mesoscale with swimmers affected by non-linear and time-dependent fluid mechanics. The intricate motility strategies, combined with complex and periodically changing body shapes add extra challenges for accurate meso-swimming modelling. Here, we have further developed the micropipette force sensor to directly probe the swimming forces of the meso-organism Artemia. Through deep neural network-based image analysis, we show how Artemia achieves an increased propulsive force by increasing its level of time-reversal symmetry breaking. We present a universal force-based scaling law for a wide range of micro- to meso-organisms with different body shapes, swimming strategies, and level of inertia at the mesoscale. These results capture fundamental aspects of biological meso-swimming dynamics and provide guidance for future biomimicking meso-robot designs.</description>
