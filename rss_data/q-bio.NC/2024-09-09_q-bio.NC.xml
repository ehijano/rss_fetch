      <title>Study of Brain Network in Alzheimers Disease Using Wavelet-Based Graph Theory Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by memory loss and cognitive decline, making early detection vital for timely intervention. However, early diagnosis is challenging due to the heterogeneous presentation of symptoms. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) captures spontaneous brain activity and functional connectivity, which are known to be disrupted in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Traditional methods, such as Pearson's correlation, have been used to calculate association matrices, but these approaches often overlook the dynamic and non-stationary nature of brain activity. In this study, we introduce a novel method that integrates discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and graph theory to model the dynamic behavior of brain networks. By decomposing rs-fMRI signals using DWT, our approach captures the time-frequency representation of brain activity, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of the underlying network dynamics. Graph theory provides a robust mathematical framework to analyze these complex networks, while machine learning is employed to automate the discrimination of different stages of AD based on learned patterns from different frequency bands. We applied our method to a dataset of rs-fMRI images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, demonstrating its potential as an early diagnostic tool for AD and for monitoring disease progression. Our statistical analysis identifies specific brain regions and connections that are affected in AD and MCI, at different frequency bands, offering deeper insights into the disease's impact on brain function.</description>

      <title>Network reconstruction may not mean dynamics prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With an increasing amount of observations on the dynamics of many complex systems, it is required to reveal the underlying mechanisms behind these complex dynamics, which is fundamentally important in many scientific fields such as climate, financial, ecological, and neural systems. The underlying mechanisms are commonly encoded into network structures, e.g., capturing how constituents interact with each other to produce emergent behavior. Here, we address whether a good network reconstruction suggests a good dynamics prediction. The answer is quite dependent on the nature of the supplied (observed) dynamics sequences measured on the complex system. When the dynamics are not chaotic, network reconstruction implies dynamics prediction. In contrast, even if a network can be well reconstructed from the chaotic time series (chaos means that many unstable dynamics states coexist), the prediction of the future dynamics can become impossible as at some future point the prediction error will be amplified. This is explained by using dynamical mean-field theory on a toy model of random recurrent neural networks.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Spiking Neural Networks for Low-Power Intra-Cortical Brain-Machine Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intra-cortical brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs) have the potential to dramatically improve the lives of people with paraplegia by restoring their ability to perform daily activities. However, current iBMIs suffer from scalability and mobility limitations due to bulky hardware and wiring. Wireless iBMIs offer a solution but are constrained by a limited data rate. To overcome this challenge, we are investigating hybrid spiking neural networks for embedded neural decoding in wireless iBMIs. The networks consist of a temporal convolution-based compression followed by recurrent processing and a final interpolation back to the original sequence length. As recurrent units, we explore gated recurrent units (GRUs), leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, and a combination of both - spiking GRUs (sGRUs) and analyze their differences in terms of accuracy, footprint, and activation sparsity. To that end, we train decoders on the "Nonhuman Primate Reaching with Multichannel Sensorimotor Cortex Electrophysiology" dataset and evaluate it using the NeuroBench framework, targeting both tracks of the IEEE BioCAS Grand Challenge on Neural Decoding. Our approach achieves high accuracy in predicting velocities of primate reaching movements from multichannel primary motor cortex recordings while maintaining a low number of synaptic operations, surpassing the current baseline models in the NeuroBench framework. This work highlights the potential of hybrid neural networks to facilitate wireless iBMIs with high decoding precision and a substantial increase in the number of monitored neurons, paving the way toward more advanced neuroprosthetic technologies.</description>

      <title>Emergence of robust memory manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.03879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to store continuous variables in the state of a biological system (e.g. a neural network) is critical for many behaviours. Most models for implementing such a memory manifold require hand-crafted symmetries in the interactions or precise fine-tuning of parameters. We present a general principle that we refer to as {\it frozen stabilisation} (FS), which allows a family of neural networks to self-organise to a critical state exhibiting multiple memory manifolds without parameter fine-tuning or symmetries. Memory manifolds arising from FS exhibit a wide range of emergent relaxational timescales and can be used as general purpose integrators for inputs aligned with the manifold. Moreover, FS allows robust memory manifolds in small networks, and this is relevant to debates of implementing continuous attractors with a small number of neurons in light of recent experimental discoveries.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Graph Pooling for Explainable Classification of Brain Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a commonly used technique to measure neural activation. Its application has been particularly important in identifying underlying neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Autism. Recent analysis of fMRI data models the brain as a graph and extracts features by graph neural networks (GNNs). However, the unique characteristics of fMRI data require a special design of GNN. Tailoring GNN to generate effective and domain-explainable features remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a contrastive dual-attention block and a differentiable graph pooling method called ContrastPool to better utilize GNN for brain networks, meeting fMRI-specific requirements. We apply our method to 5 resting-state fMRI brain network datasets of 3 diseases and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art baselines. Our case study confirms that the patterns extracted by our method match the domain knowledge in neuroscience literature, and disclose direct and interesting insights. Our contributions underscore the potential of ContrastPool for advancing the understanding of brain networks and neurodegenerative conditions.

      <title>Multiscale Functional Connectivity: Exploring the brain functional connectivity at different timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human brains exhibit highly organized multiscale neurophysiological dynamics. Understanding those dynamic changes and the neuronal networks involved is critical for understanding how the brain functions in health and disease. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a prevalent neuroimaging technique for studying these complex interactions. However, analyzing fMRI data poses several challenges. Furthermore, most approaches for analyzing Functional Connectivity (FC) still rely on preprocessing or conventional methods, often built upon oversimplified assumptions. On top of that, those approaches often ignore frequency-related information despite evidence showing that fMRI data contain rich information that spans multiple timescales. This study introduces a novel methodology, Multiscale Functional Connectivity (MFC), to analyze fMRI data by decomposing the fMRI into their intrinsic modes, allowing us to separate the neurophysiological activation patterns at multiple timescales while separating them from other interfering components. Additionally, the proposed approach accounts for the natural nonlinear and nonstationary nature of fMRI and the particularities of each individual in a data-driven way. We evaluated the performance of our proposed methodology using three fMRI experiments. Our results demonstrate that our novel approach effectively separates the fMRI data into different timescales while identifying highly reliable functional connectivity patterns across individuals. In addition, we further extended our knowledge of how the FC for these three experiments spans among different timescales.</description>

      <title>Element-wise and Recursive Solutions for the Power Spectral Density of Biological Stochastic Dynamical Systems at Fixed Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19890v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochasticity plays a central role in nearly every biological process, and the noise power spectral density (PSD) is a critical tool for understanding variability and information processing in living systems. In steady-state, many such processes can be described by stochastic linear time-invariant (LTI) systems driven by Gaussian white noise, whose PSD is a complex rational function of the frequency that can be concisely expressed in terms of their Jacobian, dispersion, and diffusion matrices, fully defining the statistical properties of the system's dynamics at steady-state. Here, we arrive at compact element-wise solutions of the rational function coefficients for the auto- and cross-spectrum that enable the explicit analytical computation of the PSD in dimensions n=2,3,4. We further present a recursive Leverrier-Faddeev-type algorithm for the exact computation of the rational function coefficients. Crucially, both solutions are free of matrix inverses. We illustrate our element-wise and recursive solutions by considering the stochastic dynamics of neural systems models, namely Fitzhugh-Nagumo (n=2), Hindmarsh-Rose (n=3), Wilson-Cowan (n=4), and the Stabilized Supralinear Network (n=22), as well as an evolutionary game-theoretic model with mutations (n=5, 31). We extend our approach to derive a recursive method for calculating the coefficients in the power series expansion of the integrated covariance matrix for interacting spiking neurons modeled as Hawkes processes on arbitrary directed graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multimodal contrastive learning utilizing a quantum encoder to integrate EEG (electroencephalogram) and image data. This groundbreaking attempt explores the integration of quantum encoders within the traditional multimodal learning framework. By leveraging the unique properties of quantum computing, our method enhances the representation learning capabilities, providing a robust framework for analyzing time series and visual information concurrently. We demonstrate that the quantum encoder effectively captures intricate patterns within EEG signals and image features, facilitating improved contrastive learning across modalities. This work opens new avenues for integrating quantum computing with multimodal data analysis, particularly in applications requiring simultaneous interpretation of temporal and visual data.</description>
