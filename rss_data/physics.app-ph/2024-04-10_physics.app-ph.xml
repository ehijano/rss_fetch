      <title>Thermal Barrier Coatings in burner rig experiment analyzed through LAser Shock for DAmage Monitoring (LASDAM) method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates failure mechanisms in a typical thermal barrier coating (TBC) system comprising an EB-PVD columnar top coat, an aluminide bond coat, and a Ni-based single crystal superalloy substrate, simulating gas turbine operating conditions using a burner rig. TBC degradation, initiated by interfacial defects from the LASAT method, was studied during thermal gradient cycling under fast and slow cooling. In-situ optical and infrared imaging, along with ex-situ SEM cross-sectional analysis, monitored failure mechanisms. The Laser Shock for Damage Monitoring (LASDAM) technique provided insights into gradient and cooling rate impacts on columnar TBC damage. Results showed significant effects of cooling rate on delamination and localized failure at blister sites, with LASDAM revealing significant overheating at damage sites. Analysis included full-field temperature and damage assessment, emphasizing blister-driven delamination under severe thermal gradients. Discussion focused on elastic stored energy effects, noting that fast cooling induced transient conditions where reversed temperature gradients increased damage, limiting TBC lifespan</description>

      <title>Modification of Jet Velocities in an Explosively Loaded Copper Target with a Conical Defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the design and execution of an experiment with the goal of demonstrating control over the evolution of a copper jet is described. Simulations show that when using simple multi-material buffers placed between a copper target with a conical defect and a cylinder of high-explosive, a variety of jetting behaviors occur based on material placement, including both jet velocity augmentation and mitigation. A parameter sweep was performed to determine optimal buffer designs in two configurations. Experiments using the optimal buffer designs verified the effectiveness of the buffer and validated the modeling.</description>

      <title>Simple arithmetic operation in latent space can generate a novel three dimensional graph metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)-based design strategies for metamaterials have revolutionized the creation of customizable architectures spanning nano- to macro-scale dimensions, achieving unprecedented mechanical behaviors that surpass the inherent properties of the constituent materials. However, the growing complexity of these methods poses challenges in generating diverse metamaterials without substantial human and computational resources, hindering widespread adoption. Addressing this, our study introduces an innovative design strategy capable of generating various three-dimensional graph metamaterials using simple arithmetic operations within the latent space. By seamlessly integrating hidden representations of disentangled latent space and latent diffusion processes, our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of complex design spaces, generating diverse graph metamaterials through arithmetic operations. This methodology stands as a versatile tool for creating structures ranging from repetitive lattice structures to functionally graded mechanical metamaterials. It also serves as an inverse design strategy for diverse lattice structures, including crystalline structures and those made of trabecular bone. We believe that this methodology represents a foundational step in advancing our comprehension of the intricate latent design space, offering the potential to establish a unified model for various traditional generative models in the realm of mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Modeling of antenna-coupled Si MOSFETs in the Terahertz Frequency Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the modeling and experimental characterization of Si CMOS detectors of terahertz radiation based on antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (TeraFETs). The detectors are manufactured using TSMC's 65-nm technology. We apply two models -- the TSMC RF foundry model and our own ADS-HDM -- to simulate the Si CMOS TeraFET performance and compare their predictions with respective experimental data. Both models are implemented in the commercial circuit simulation software Keysight Advanced Design System (ADS). We find that the compact model TSMC RF is capable to predict the detector responsivity and its dependence on frequency and gate voltage with good accuracy up to the highest frequency of 1.2 THz covered in this study. This frequency is well beyond the tool's intended operation range for 5G communications and 110-GHz millimeter wave applications. We demonstrate that our self-developed physics-based ADS-HDM tool, which relies on an extended one-dimensional hydrodynamic transport model and can be adapted readily to other material technologies, has high predictive qualities comparable to those of the foundry model. We use the ADS-HDM to discuss the contribution of diffusive and plasmonic effects to the THz response of Si CMOS TeraFETs, finding that these effects, while becoming more significant with rising frequency, are never dominant. Finally, we estimate that the electrical NEP (perfect power coupling conditions) is on the order of 5 pW/$\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ at room-temperature.</description>

      <title>A mid-infrared Brillouin laser using ultra-high-Q on-chip resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high-Q optical resonators have facilitated recent advancements in on-chip photonics by effectively harnessing nonlinear phenomena providing useful functionalities. While these breakthroughs, primarily focused on the near-infrared region, have extended interest to longer wavelengths holding importance for monitoring and manipulating molecules, the absence of ultra-high-Q resonators in this region remains a significant challenge. Here, we have developed on-chip microresonators with a remarkable Q-factor of 38 million, surpassing previous mid-infrared records by over 30 times. Employing innovative fabrication techniques, including the spontaneous formation of light-guiding geometries during material deposition, resonators with internal multilayer structures have been seamlessly created and passivated with chalcogenide glasses within a single chamber. Major loss factors, especially airborne-chemical absorption, were thoroughly investigated and mitigated by extensive optimization of resonator geometries and fabrication procedures. This allowed us to access the fundamental loss performance offered by doubly purified chalcogenide glass sources, as demonstrated in their fiber form. Exploiting this ultra-high-Q resonator, we successfully demonstrated Brillouin lasing on a chip for the first time in the mid-infrared, with a threshold power of 91.9 {\mu}W and a theoretical Schawlow-Townes linewidth of 83.45 Hz, far surpassing carrier phase noise. Our results showcase the effective integration of cavity-enhanced optical nonlinearities into on-chip mid-infrared photonics.</description>

      <title>Aluminium nanoparticle-based ultra-wideband high-performance polarizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The polarizer-based device industry is expanding quickly, requiring high-quality research on nanoscale wideband polarizers. Here, we investigated the possibility of utilizing Al dimer nanostructures on broad-band polarizers. Metals are always considered promising candidates for reflection-based polarizer development because of their high extinction ratio. This study proposes a nanoparticle polarizer comprised of semi-immersed Al nanodimers with a 200 nm radius on a CaF_2 substrate. Our proposed polarizer has effective polarization anisotropy in the near-infrared (NIR) and THz range. This study includes calculating performance parameters for the extraction of the proposed polarizer, including insertion loss, extinction ratio (ER), Mueller matrix values, and polarization ellipse diagram. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation-based results suggested obtaining more than 55 dB extinction ratio for the 0.2 to 9 THz range. The average extinction ratio and insertion loss over the 1-1665 micrometer wavelength were 29.01 dB and ~1 dB, respectively. We have reviewed recent reports of similar nanoparticle and wire grid-based polarizers to evaluate our Al nanodimer-based polarizer and performed a comparative analysis. The idea of Al dimer and the insight gained from the results extracted from the rigorous simulation report suggested a great opportunity for developing micro-scale metallic wideband polarizers.</description>

      <title>Multi-interface engineering to realize all-solution processed highly efficient Kesterite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of Kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 solar cells in the past few years, how to achieve higher cost-performance ratio has become an important topic in the future development and industrialization of this technology. Herein, we demonstrate an all-solution route for the cell fabrication, in particular targeting at the solution processed window layer comprised of ZnO nanoparticles/Ag nanowires. A multi-interface engineering strategy assisted by organic polymers and molecules is explored to synergistically improve the film deposition, passivate the surface defects and facilitate the charge transfer. These efforts help us achieve high-performance and robust Kesterite solar cells at extremely low time and energy costs, with efficiency records of 14.37% and 13.12% being realized in rigid and flexible Kesterite solar cells, respectively. Our strategy here is also promising to be transplanted into other solar cells with similar geometric and energy band structures, helping reduce production costs and shorten the production cycle (i.e. increasing production capacity) of these photovoltaic industries.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Micro-Bunching based on Transverse-Longitudinal Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, three specific scenarios of a novel accelerator light source mechanism called steady-state micro-bunching (SSMB) have been studied, i.e., longitudinal weak focusing, longitudinal strong focusing and generalized longitudinal strong focusing (GLSF). Presently, GLSF is the most promising among them in realizing high-power short-wavelength coherent radiation with a mild requirement on the modulation laser power. Its essence is to exploit the ultrasmall natural vertical emittance in a planar electron storage ring for efficient microbunching formation, like a partial transverse-longitudinal emittance exchange at the optical laser wavelength range. By invoking such a scheme, the laser modulator of an SSMB storage ring can work in a continuous wave or high duty cycle mode, thus allowing a high filling factor of microbunched electron beam in the storage ring and high average output radiation power. The backbone of it is the precision transverse-longitudinal phase space coupling dynamics, which is analyzed in depth in this paper. Based on the investigation, an example parameters set of a GLSF SSMB storage ring which can deliver 1 kW-average-power EUV light is presented. The presented work here, like the analysis on theoretical minimum emittances, transverse-longitudinal coupling dynamics, derivation of bunching factor and modulation strengths, is expected to be useful not only for the development of SSMB, but also future accelerator light sources in general which demand more and more precise electron beam phase space manipulations.</description>

      <title>Multiscale structure-property discovery via active learning in scanning tunneling microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic arrangements and local sub-structures fundamentally influence emergent material functionalities. The local structures are conventionally probed using spatially resolved studies and the property correlations are usually deciphered by a researcher based on sequential explorations and auxiliary information, thus limiting the throughput efficiency. Here we demonstrate a Bayesian deep learning based framework that automatically correlates material structure with its electronic properties using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements in real-time. Its predictions are used to autonomously direct exploration toward regions of the sample that optimize a given material property. This autonomous method is deployed on the low-temperature ultra-high vacuum STM to understand the structure-property relationship in a europium-based semimetal, EuZn2As2, one of the promising candidates for studying the magnetism-driven topological properties. The framework employs a sparse sampling approach to efficiently construct the scalar-property space using a minimal number of measurements, about 1 - 10 % of the data required in standard hyperspectral imaging methods. We further demonstrate a target-property-guided active learning of structures within a multiscale framework. This is implemented across length scales in a hierarchical fashion for the autonomous discovery of structural origins for an observed material property. This framework offers the choice to select and derive a suitable scalar property from the spectroscopic data to steer exploration across the sample space. Our findings reveal correlations of the electronic properties unique to surface terminations, local defect density, and point defects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal multi-layer device design requires consideration of fabrication uncertainties associated with inter-layer alignment and conformal layering. We present layer-restricted topology optimization (TO), a novel technique which mitigates the effects of unwanted conformal layering for multi-layer structures and enables TO in multi-etch material platforms. We explore several approaches to achieve this result compatible with density-based TO projection techniques and geometric constraints. Then, we present a robust TO formulation to design devices resilient to inter-layer misalignment. The novel constraint and robust formulation are demonstrated in 2D grating couplers and a 3D polarization rotator.</description>

      <title>The anomalous skin effect and copper cavity operation at cryogenic conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A geometric model based on a spherical Fermi - surface and using the equivalent skin-layer model allows to calculate the surface resistance, which is relevant for the RF power losses in the cavity walls. An exact solution for this conduction electron model in skin layers was derived. It is compared with measurements and with predictions from the traditional diffusion model as formulated by Reuter, Sondheimer and Chambers. A focus is put on frequencies with relevance in ion linac acceleration. At frequencies up to the GHz - range the geometric model gives up to 15% higher resistance values - when the electron free path length is about five times longer then the classical skin depth. Though both model assumptions differ a lot, the results are close to each other. A 340 MHz test cavity was built from bulk copper. The quality - factor measurements were performed in a liquid helium cryostat during the warming up phase of the cavity.The cavity was at first measured after just polishing the bulk copper surface. In the next step this surface was copper-plated. After annealing for one hour at 400 deg Celsius, a corresponding RRR - value around 120 was reached. An ion linac with copper cavities operated at cryogenic temperatures around 40 deg Celsius is expected to allow attractive, compact future linac designs. Simulations on heat conduction in pulsed operation give promising results.</description>

      <title>Efficient activation of telecom emitters in silicon upon ns pulsed laser annealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent demonstration of optically active telecom emitters makes silicon a compelling candidate for solid state quantum photonic platforms. Particularly fabrication of the G center has been demonstrated in carbon-rich silicon upon conventional thermal annealing. However, the high-yield controlled fabrication of these emitters at the wafer-scale still requires the identification of a suitable thermodynamic pathway enabling its activation following ion implantation. Here we demonstrate the efficient activation of G centers in high-purity silicon substrates upon ns pulsed laser annealing. The proposed method enables the non-invasive, localized activation of G centers by the supply of short non-stationary pulses, thus overcoming the limitations of conventional rapid thermal annealing related to the structural metastability of the emitters. A finite-element analysis highlights the strong non-stationarity of the technique, offering radically different defect-engineering capabilities with respect to conventional longer thermal treatments, paving the way to the direct and controlled fabrication of emitters embedded in integrated photonic circuits and waveguides.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity of macroporous graphene aerogel measured using high resolution comparative infrared thermal microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphene aerogel (GA) is a promising material for thermal management applications across many fields due to its lightweight and thermally insulative properties. However, standard values for important thermal properties, such as thermal conductivity, remain elusive due to the lack of reliable characterization techniques for highly porous materials. Comparative infrared thermal microscopy (CITM) is an attractive technique to obtain thermal conductance values of porous materials like GA, due to its non-invasive character, which requires no probing of, or contact with, the often-delicate structures and frameworks. In this study, we improve upon CITM by utilizing a higher resolution imaging setup and reducing the need for pore-filling coating of the sample (previously used to adjust for emissivity). This upgraded setup, verified by characterizing porous silica aerogel, allows for a more accurate confirmation of the fundamental thermal conductivity value of GA while still accounting for the thermal resistance at material boundaries. Using this improved method, we measure a thermal conductivity below 0.036 W/m$\cdot$K for commercial GA using multiple reference materials. These measurements demonstrate the impact of higher resolution thermal imaging to improve accuracy in low density, highly porous materials characterization. This study also reports thermal conductivity for much lower density (less than 15 mg/cm$^3$) GA than previously published studies while maintaining the robustness of the CITM technique.</description>

      <title>Investigation of RF performance of Ku-band GaN HEMT device and an in-depth analysis of short channel effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we have characterized an AlGaN/GaN High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) with a short gate length (Lg $\approx$ 0.15$\mu$m). We have studied the effect of short gate length on the small signal parameters, linearity parameters and gm-gd ratio in GaN HEMT devices. To understand how scaling results in the variation of the above-mentioned parameters a comparative study with higher gate length devices on similar heterostructure is also presented here. We have scaled down the gate length but the barrier thickness(t$_{bar}$) remained same which affects the aspect ratio (L$_{g}$/t$_{bar}$) of the device and its inseparable consequences are the prominent short channel effects (SCEs) barring the optimum output performance of the device. These interesting phenomena were studied in detail and explored over a temperature range of -40$^\circ$C to 80$^\circ$C. To the best of our knowledge this paper explores temperature dependence of SCEs of GaN HEMT for the first time. With an approach to reduce the impact of SCEs a simulation study in Silvaco TCAD was carried out and it is observed that a recessed gate structure on conventional heterostructure successfully reduces SCEs and improves RF performance of the device. This work gives an overall view of gate length scaling on conventional AlGaN/GaN HEMTs.</description>

Abstract: Managing insertion losses, polarizations and device footprint is crucial in developing large-scale photonic integrated circuits (PICs). This paper presents a solution to these critical challenges by designing a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) in the O-band with reduced polarization sensitivity, leveraging the ultra-compact InP Membrane on Silicon (IMOS) platform. The platform is compatible with close integration atop electronics, via densely populated vertical interconnects. The SOA incorporates a thin tensile-strained bulk active layer to mitigate polarization sensitivity. The developed 500 um long SOA has a peak gain of 11.5 dB at 1350 nm and an optimal polarization dependency of less than 1 dB across a 25 nm bandwidth, ranging from 1312 nm to 1337 nm. The device is practical for integrated circuits where multiple amplifiers work in cascades with a minimal 6.5 dB noise figure (NF) measured at the gain peak. The designed vertical active-passive transition, achieved through inverse tapering, allows for effective field coupling in the vertical direction resulting in a transmission efficiency of over 95% at the transition and minimal polarization sensitivity of less than 3%. The device yields significant gain at a small current density of less than 3 kA/cm2 as the result of minimalist gain medium structure, reducing joule heating and improving energy efficiency. This is especially relevant in applications such as optical switching, where multiple SOAs populate the PIC within a small area. Consequently, the simulated and fabricated low polarization sensitive O-band SOA is a suitable candidate for integration into large-scale, ultra-compact photonic integrated circuits.</description>
