      <title>Water Production of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS from SOHO/SWAN Observations after Perihelion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solar Wind ANisotropies (SWAN) all-sky hydrogen Lyman-alpha camera on the Solar and Heliosphere Observatory (SOHO) observed the hydrogen coma of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, also called C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), beginning on November 6, 2025, 9 days after perihelion. Water production rates were calculated from each image of 3I/ATLAS using the methodology of M\"akinen &amp; Combi (2005, Icarus 177, 217) and fluorescence rates calculated using the daily solar Lyman-alpha fluxes from the LASP database corrected for solar rotation. The method has been used for over 90 comet apparitions (Combi 2022; Combi et al 2019). A water production rate of 3.17 x 10^29 s^-1 was found on November 6 when the comet was at a heliocentric distance of 1.40 au and at a sufficient solar elongation angle. It decreased over time after that, down to 1-2 x 10^28 s^-1 around 40 days post-perihelion (December 8).</description>

      <title>Interstellar Interloper 3I/ATLAS: Nucleus Size, Photometry in RGB, Af(rho) and Antitail Structure Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) exhibits an unusual, tightly collimated dust feature in the sunward hemisphere which has been widely described as an anti-tail. At the same time, precise constraints on the nucleus size have been derived from a combination of high-resolution imaging and non-gravitational dynamics. In this work I present a unified analysis that combines existing constraints on the nucleus radius with new ground-based RGB imaging of the dust anti-tail obtained with a 0.25 m telescope at the Toni Scarmato Astronomical Observatory (MPC L92).</description>

      <title>Formation of the Moon and Binary Asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposed multi-impact model explains the formation of the Moon, Charon, and binary asteroids without invoking catastrophic cosmic events. The main elements of the new model are as follows: a. A primordial, low-mass proto-satellite disk with prograde rotation existed around the proto-Earth. b. Most of the lunar material was ejected from Earth mantle by numerous impacts of large asteroids. This naturally explains the lunar iron deficiency. c. Collisions between ejecta and particles of the prograde proto-satellite disk stabilize the fragments on satellite orbits. We demonstrate the high efficiency of the multi-impact mechanism: ejecta on prograde orbits readily merges with the prograde proto-satellite disk, whereas retrograde ejecta falls back onto Earth.</description>

      <title>Chain Reactions in Space: Analyzing the Impact of Satellite Collisions and Debris Accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential increase in artificial satellites, growing from 852 in 2004 to over 9,000 in 2023, has intensified the risk of the Kessler Syndrome: a cascading chain reaction of orbital collisions. This paper analyzes the dynamics of space debris accumulation to identify the primary orbital features contributing to this systemic risk. We compiled and analyzed Two-Line Element (TLE) datasets from Space-Track.org and historical collision data using a Python-based data mining approach. Specifically, we derived satellite velocities using the Vis-Viva equation and evaluated the correlation of five key features, launch piece count, orbital period, apogee, perigee, and Radar Cross Section (RCS) size, with debris density. Our evaluation reveals that apogee and orbital period exhibit the strongest correlation with the risk of the Kessler Syndrome, indicating that satellites in higher orbits pose a disproportionately greater threat to long-term sustainability due to navigational constraints. Contrary to common assumptions, our data suggests that velocity and object size (RCS) show negligible direct correlation with collision incidence in the current dataset. Based on these findings, we propose mitigation strategies focusing on integrating AI-driven autonomous navigation systems and deploying advanced radiation-resistant shielding materials to enhance the resilience of high-orbit assets.</description>

      <title>A Linearized Approach to Radial-Velocity Extraction. II: Shot-Noise-Limited Precision via Spectral Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) formalism for radial velocity extraction to cases where the underlying spectral components are unknown. The method factorizes a spectroscopic time series into principal spectra and time-dependent kernels, enabling simultaneous recovery of both. In Fourier space, each inverse-wavelength slice is decomposed by singular value decomposition, and radial velocity shifts are inferred from phase differences between epochs. In the high-SNR regime, this provides a linearized and statistically tractable estimate of differential velocities. The method is validated on synthetic and SOAP simulations and applied to EXPRES observations of HD 34411 and $\tau$ Ceti, recovering coherent signals and reaching the instrumental precision limit of ~30 cm/s. Apart from p-mode modulation, the residuals show no significant long-term correlations and allow the detection of signals with semi-amplitudes down to ~50 cm/s with $\lesssim10$ cm/s uncertainty. The framework thus enables extreme-precision radial velocity measurements in the presence of spectral variability, representing a step toward detecting and characterizing Earth-like planets around solar-type stars.</description>

      <title>Predicting the detection yields of giant planets and brown dwarfs with CSST astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST), which will begin its scientific operations around 2027, is going to survey the sky area of the median-to-high Galactic latitude and median-to-high ecliptic latitude. The high astrometric precision of the CSST Survey Camera for faint objects enables the detection of a number of giant planets and brown dwarfs around M-dwarfs and brown dwarfs via differential astrometry in its optical survey. In this paper, we predict the number of giant planets and brown dwarfs around stars and brown dwarfs detectable with CSST astrometry. We generate synthetic samples of CSST stellar and substellar sources, and carry out companion injection-recovery simulations in the samples using different occurrence rates for FGK-dwarfs, M-dwarfs, and brown dwarfs. We calculate companion yields based on CSST astrometric precision. Our analysis reveals that over its 10-year mission, the CSST Survey Camera could barely discover giant planets and low-mass BDs around FGK-dwarfs, but is projected to detect 20 - 170 giant planets and low-mass brown dwarfs around M-dwarfs within 300 pc, and 300 - 570 brown dwarf binaries within 600 pc. Therefore, CSST astrometry is likely to significantly increase the current sample of substellar companions around M-dwarfs and brown dwarfs. This sample will deepen our understanding of planet formation and evolution around low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Not Just Gas: How Solid-Driven Torques Shaped the Migration of the Galilean Moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surviving rapid inward orbital migration is a crucial aspect of formation models for the Jupiter's Galilean moons. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the orbital migration of the Galilean moons by incorporating self-consistent solid dynamics in circumjovian disk models. We perform two-fluid simulations using the FARGO3D code on a 2D polar grid. The simulations model a satellite with the mass of a proto-moon, Europa, or Ganymede interacting with a circumjovian disk. The dust component, coupled to the gas via a drag force, is characterized by the dust-to-gas mass ratio ($\epsilon$) and the Stokes number ($T_s$). The effect of solids fundamentally alter the satellites' evolution. We identify a vast parameter space where migration is slowed, halted, robustly reversed -leading to outward migration-, or significantly accelerated inward. The migration rate is dependent on satellite mass, providing a natural source of differential migration. Solid dynamics provides a robust and self-consistent mechanism that fundamentally alters the migration of the Galilean moons, potentially addressing the long-standing migration catastrophe. This mechanism critically affects the survival of satellites and could offer a viable physical process to explain the establishment of resonances through differential migration. These findings establish that solid torques are a critical, non-negligible factor in shaping the final architecture of satellite systems.</description>

      <title>Precise Physical Parameters, Habitability, and Orbital Stability of Sun-like SB2 Systems: HD 130669, HD 184467, HD 191854, and HD 214222</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work analyzes four Sun-like double-lined spectroscopic binary (SB2) systems by combining visual and spectroscopic observational data with Al-Wardat's atmospheric modeling method to accurately determine their fundamental parameters. For each system, we determine stellar masses, orbital parallaxes, effective temperatures, spectral types, semimajor axes, and eccentricities with high precision, resolving discrepancies between astrometric and spectroscopic measurements. Moreover, we assess the potential for stable planetary orbits in these systems. We also calculate habitable zones around these binaries based on the orbital evolution of planetary orbits. These systems may represent promising targets for future extrasolar planet searches around Sun-like stars due to their robust physical and orbital parameters that can be used to determine planetary habitability and stability.</description>

      <title>Two birds with one stone: simultaneous realization of both Lunar Coordinate Time and lunar geoid time by a single orbital clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Among options for definition of the lunar reference time, the option taking Lunar Coordinate Time (O1) has its simplicity but cannot be realized by any clock without steering, while another option adopting the lunar geoid (selenoid) proper time (O2) has its convenience for users on the lunar surface but would bring a new scaling of spatial coordinates and mass parameter of the Moon. Aims. We propose a ''time aligned orbit'' that the readings of an ideal clock in this orbit could equal to the selenoid proper time in O2 and these readings could be converted to Lunar Coordinate Time in O1 by a known linear transformation. Methods. We show that there exist the time aligned orbit around the Moon with its semi-major axis of about 1.5 lunar radius slightly depending on its inclination. We conduct a set of numerical simulations to assess to what extent a clock on these orbits could realize O2 in a more realistic lunar environment. Results. We find that the proper time in our simulations would desynchronize from the selenoid proper time up to 190 ns after a year with a frequency offset of 6E-15, which is solely 3.75% of the frequency difference in O2 caused by the lunar surface topography. These numbers might be further reduced to 13 ns and 4E-16, if we could account for the deviation of the mean orbits in our simulations from the nominal ones. Conclusions. One might simultaneously realize O1 and O2 by deployment of a single clock in the time aligned orbit. This approach also has its scalability for other terrestrial planets beyond the Earth-Moon system.</description>

      <title>Towards an agnostic algorithm for sampling empirical structure models: The case of Uranus and Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an algorithm to efficiently sample the full space of planetary interior density profiles. Our approach uses as few assumptions as possible to pursue an agnostic algorithm. The algorithm avoids the common Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and instead uses an optimisation-based gradient-descent approach designed for computational efficiency. In this work, we use Uranus and Neptune as test cases and obtain empirical models that provide density and pressure profiles consistent with the observed physical properties (total mass, radius, and gravitational moments). We compare our findings to other work and find that while other studies are generally in line with our findings, they do not cover the entire space of solutions faithfully. Furthermore, we present guidance for modellers that construct Uranus or Neptune interior models with a fixed number of layers. We provide a statistical relation between the steepness classifying a density discontinuity and the resulting number of discontinuities to be expected. For example, if one classifies a discontinuity as a density gradient larger than 0.02 kg$\,$m$^{-4}$, then most solutions should have at most one such discontinuity. Finally, we find that discontinuities, if present, are concentrated around a planetary normalised radius of 0.65 for Uranus and 0.7 for Neptune. Our algorithm to efficiently and faithfully investigate the full space of possible interior density profiles can be used to study all planetary objects with gravitational field data.</description>

      <title>Alpha effect and dynamo in density-stratified turbulence with large-scale shear: applications to protoplanetary discs and astrophysical clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A joint effect of the density-stratified turbulence (or inhomogeneous turbulence) and a large-scale shear for arbitrary Mach numbers results in the $\alpha$ effect and mean-field dynamo action. These effects also produce the effective pumping velocity of a large-scale magnetic field. Compressibility of the turbulent velocity field (i.e., finite Mach number effects) does not affect the contributions to the $\alpha$ tensor caused by the joint effect of inhomogeneity of turbulence and a large-scale shear. The isotropic part of the $\alpha$ tensor is independent of the exponent of the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum. There is also an additional contribution to the effective pumping velocity of the mean magnetic field that is proportional to the product of the fluid density gradient and the divergence of the mean fluid velocity caused, e.g., by collapsing (or expanding) astrophysical clouds. Applications of these effects to protoplanetary discs, proto-galactic and proto-stellar clouds are discussed.</description>

      <title>A mini-review on combinatorial solutions to the Marcus-Lushnikov irreversible aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.</description>
