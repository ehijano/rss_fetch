      <title>Compartmental-reaction diffusion framework for microscale dynamics of extracellular serotonin in brain tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) is a major neurotransmitter whose release from densely distributed serotonergic varicosities shapes plasticity and network integration throughout the brain, yet its extracellular dynamics remain poorly understood due to the sub-micrometer and millisecond scales involved. We develop a mathematical framework that captures the coupled reaction-diffusion processes governing serotonin signaling in realistic tissue microenvironments. Formulating a two-dimensional compartmental-reaction diffusion system, we use strong localized perturbation theory to derive an asymptotically equivalent set of nonlinear integro-ODEs that preserve diffusive coupling while enabling efficient computation. We analyze period-averaged steady states, establish bounds using Jensen's inequality, obtain closed-form spike maxima and minima, and implement a fast marching-scheme solver based on sum-of-exponentials kernels. These mathematical results provide quantitative insight into how firing frequency, varicosity geometry, and uptake kinetics shape extracellular serotonin. The model reveals that varicosities form diffusively coupled microdomains capable of generating spatial "serotonin reservoirs," clarifies aspects of local versus volume transmission, and yields predictions relevant to interpreting high-resolution serotonin imaging and the actions of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors.</description>

      <title>HEIST: A Graph Foundation Model for Spatial Transcriptomics and Proteomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics have become a great source for data-driven insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to understand cellular heterogeneity and gene expression at the single-cell level. With the advent of spatial-omics data, we have the promise of characterizing cells within their tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and intra-cellular transcriptional or protein counts. Proteomics offers a complementary view by directly measuring proteins, which are the primary effectors of cellular function and key therapeutic targets. However, existing models either ignore the spatial information or the complex genetic and proteomic programs within cells. Thus they cannot infer how cell internal regulation adapts to microenvironmental cues. Furthermore, these models often utilize fixed gene vocabularies, hindering their generalizability unseen genes. In this paper, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. HEIST models tissues as hierarchical graphs. The higher level graph is a spatial cell graph, and each cell in turn, is represented by its lower level gene co-expression network graph. HEIST achieves this by performing both intra-level and cross-level message passing to utilize the hierarchy in its embeddings and can thus generalize to novel datatypes including spatial proteomics without retraining. HEIST is pretrained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive and masked autoencoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST embeddings reveals spatially informed subpopulations missed by prior models. Downstream evaluations demonstrate generalizability to proteomics data and state-of-the-art performance in clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, and gene imputation across multiple technologies.</description>
