      <title>Balancing Costs and Utilities in Future Networks via Market Equilibrium with Externalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of market equilibrium (ME) in future wireless networks, with multiple actors competing and negotiating for a pool of heterogeneous resources (communication and computing) while meeting constraints in terms of global cost. The latter is defined in a general way but is associated with energy and/or carbon emissions. In this direction, service providers competing for network resources do not acquire the latter, but rather the right to consume, given externally defined policies and regulations. We propose to apply the Fisher market model, and prove its convergence towards an equilibrium between utilities, regulatory constraints, and individual budgets. The model is then applied to an exemplary use case of access network, edge computing, and cloud resources, and numerical results assess the theoretical findings of convergence, under different assumptions on the utility function and more or less stringent constraints.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Strategy Templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents (permissive) \emph{Quantitative Strategy Templates} (QaSTels) to succinctly represent infinitely many winning strategies in two-player energy and mean-payoff games. This transfers the recently introduced concept of \emph{Permissive (qualitative) Strategy Templates} (PeSTels) for $\omega$-regular games to games with quantitative objectives. We provide the theoretical and algorithmic foundations of (i) QaSTel synthesis, and (ii) their (incremental) combination with PeSTels for games with mixed quantitative and qualitative objectives. Using a prototype implementation of our synthesis algorithms, we demonstrate empirically that QaSTels extend the advantageous properties of strategy templates over single winning strategies -- known from PeSTels -- to games with (additional) quantitative objectives. This includes (i) the enhanced robustness of strategies due to their runtime-adaptability, and (ii) the compositionality of templates w.r.t. incrementally arriving objectives. We use control-inspired examples to illustrate these superior properties of QaSTels for CPS design.</description>

      <title>How Irrationality Shapes Nash Equilibria: A Prospect-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncooperative games with uncertain payoffs have been classically studied under the expected-utility theory framework, which relies on the strong assumption that agents behave rationally. However, simple experiments on human decision makers found them to be not fully rational, due to their subjective risk perception. Prospect theory was proposed as an empirically-grounded model to incorporate irrational behaviours into game-theoretic models. But, how prospect theory shapes the set of Nash equilibria when considering irrational agents, is still poorly understood. To this end, we study how prospect theoretic transformations may generate new equilibria while eliminating existing ones. Focusing on aggregative games, we show that capturing users' irrationality can preserve symmetric equilibria while causing the vanishing of asymmetric equilibria. Further, there exist value functions which map uncountable sets of equilibria in the expected-utility maximization framework to finite sets. This last result may shape some equilibrium selection theories for human-in-the-loop systems where computing a single equilibrium is insufficient and comparison of equilibria is needed.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Pricing and Algorithmic Collusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of algorithmic pricing in online retail platforms has attracted significant interest in how autonomous software agents interact under competition. This article explores the potential emergence of algorithmic collusion - supra-competitive pricing outcomes that arise without explicit agreements - as a consequence of repeated interactions between learning agents. Most of the literature focuses on oligopoly pricing environments modeled as repeated Bertrand competitions, where firms use online learning algorithms to adapt prices over time. While experimental research has demonstrated that specific reinforcement learning algorithms can learn to maintain prices above competitive equilibrium levels in simulated environments, theoretical understanding of when and why such outcomes occur remains limited. This work highlights the interdisciplinary nature of this challenge, which connects computer science concepts of online learning with game-theoretical literature on equilibrium learning. We examine implications for the Business &amp; Information Systems Engineering (BISE) community and identify specific research opportunities to address challenges of algorithmic competition in digital marketplaces.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Knapsack for Sequential Competitive Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses competitive resource allocation in a sequential setting, where two players allocate resources across objects or locations of shared interest. Departing from the simultaneous Colonel Blotto game, our framework introduces a sequential decision-making dynamic, where players act with partial or complete knowledge of previous moves. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on complex mixed strategies, we focus on deterministic pure strategies, streamlining computation while preserving strategic depth. Additionally, we extend the payoff structure to accommodate fractional allocations and payoffs, moving beyond the binary, all-or-nothing paradigm to allow more granular outcomes. We model this problem as an adversarial knapsack game, formulating it as a bilevel optimization problem that integrates the leader's objective with the follower's best-response. This knapsack-based approach is novel in the context of competitive resource allocation, with prior work only partially leveraging it for follower analysis. Our contributions include: (1) proposing an adversarial knapsack formulation for the sequential resource allocation problem, (2) developing efficient heuristics for fractional allocation scenarios, and (3) analyzing the 0-1 knapsack case, providing a computational hardness result alongside a heuristic solution.</description>

      <title>Fair division of the replacement-units without an appraiser in urban renewal processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rebuild and Divide is an urban renewal process that involves the demolition of old buildings and the construction of new ones. Original homeowners are compensated with upgraded apartments, while surplus units are sold for profit, so theoretically it is a win-win project for all parties involved. However, many rebuild-and-divide projects withheld or delayed due to disagreements over the assignment of new units, claiming they are not "fair". The goal of this research is to develop algorithms for envy-free allocation of the new units. The main challenge is that, in contrast to previous work on envy-free allocation, the envy depends also on the value of the old units, as people with more valuable old units are entitled to more valuable new units. We introduce three models that capture different notions of fairness: (1) the Difference Model, where agents evaluate their gains relative to others; (2) the Envy Sum Model, which permits some envy as long as the total envy does not exceed that of the original allocation; and (3) the Ratio Model, where fairness is assessed based on the proportional value of old apartments. For each model, we establish an envy criterion and seek a payment vector and allocation that ensure envy-freeness. These models present both theoretical challenges and intriguing insights. Additionally, within the Envy Sum Model, we present a mechanism that computes an allocation and payment scheme that minimizes total envy. We also analyze the mechanism's vulnerability to manipulation and identify conditions under which it is obviously manipulable.</description>

      <title>Nash Equilibrium Learning In Large Populations With First Order Payoff Modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish Nash equilibrium learning -- convergence of the population state to a suitably defined Nash equilibria set -- for a class of payoff dynamical mechanism with a first order modification. The first order payoff modification can model aspects of the agents' bounded rationality, anticipatory or averaging terms in the payoff mechanism, or first order Pad\'e approximations of delays. To obtain our main results, we apply a combination of two nonstandard system-theoretic passivity notions.</description>

      <title>Universal Online Contention Resolution with Preselected Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online contention resolution scheme (OCRS) is a powerful technique for online decision making, which--in the case of matroids--given a matroid and a prior distribution of active elements, selects a subset of active elements that satisfies the matroid constraint in an online fashion. OCRS has been studied mostly for product distributions in the literature. Recently, universal OCRS, that works even for correlated distributions, has gained interest, because it naturally generalizes the classic notion, and its existence in the random-order arrival model turns out to be equivalent to the matroid secretary conjecture. However, currently very little is known about how to design universal OCRSs for any arrival model. In this work, we consider a natural and relatively flexible arrival model, where the OCRS is allowed to preselect (i.e., non-adaptively select) the arrival order of the elements, and within this model, we design simple and optimal universal OCRSs that are computationally efficient. In the course of deriving our OCRSs, we also discover an efficient reduction from universal online contention resolution to the matroid secretary problem for any arrival model, answering a question from Dughmi (2020).</description>

      <title>Multiplicative weights, equalizers, and P=PPAD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:1609.08934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, by using multiplicative weights in a game-theoretic thought experiment (and an important convexity result on the composition of multiplicative weights with the relative entropy function), a symmetric bimatrix game (that is, a bimatrix matrix wherein the payoff matrix of each player is the transpose of the payoff matrix of the other) either has an interior symmetric equilibrium or there is a pure strategy that is weakly dominated by some mixed strategy. Weakly dominated pure strategies can be detected and eliminated in polynomial time by solving a linear program. Furthermore, interior symmetric equilibria are a special case of a more general notion, namely, that of an "equalizer," which can also be computed efficiently in polynomial time by solving a linear program. An elegant "symmetrization method" of bimatrix games [Jurg et al., 1992] and the well-known PPAD-completeness results on equilibrium computation in bimatrix games [Daskalakis et al., 2009, Chen et al., 2009] imply then the compelling P = PPAD.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Frontier on Approximate EFX Allocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of allocating a set of indivisible goods to a set of agents with additive valuation functions, aiming to achieve approximate envy-freeness up to any good ($\alpha$-EFX). The state-of-the-art results on the problem include that (exact) EFX allocations exist when (a) there are at most three agents, or (b) the agents' valuation functions can take at most two values, or (c) the agents' valuation functions can be represented via a graph. For $\alpha$-EFX, it is known that a $0.618$-EFX allocation exists for any number of agents with additive valuation functions. In this paper, we show that $2/3$-EFX allocations exist when (a) there are at most \emph{seven agents}, (b) the agents' valuation functions can take at most \emph{three values}, or (c) the agents' valuation functions can be represented via a \emph{multigraph}. Our results can be interpreted in two ways. First, by relaxing the notion of EFX to $2/3$-EFX, we obtain existence results for strict generalizations of the settings for which exact EFX allocations are known to exist. Secondly, by imposing restrictions on the setting, we manage to beat the barrier of $0.618$ and achieve an approximation guarantee of $2/3$. Therefore, our results push the \emph{frontier} of existence and computation of approximate EFX allocations, and provide insights into the challenges of settling the existence of exact EFX allocations.</description>

      <title>Oh the Prices You'll See: Designing a Fair Exchange System to Mitigate Personalized Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many online marketplaces personalize prices based on consumer attributes. Since these prices are private, consumers may be unaware that they have spent more on a good than the lowest possible price, and cannot easily take action to pay less. In this paper, we introduce a fairness-centered exchange system that takes advantage of personalized pricing, while still allowing consumers to individually benefit. Our system produces a matching of consumers to promote trading; the lower-paying consumer buys the good for the higher-paying consumer for some fee. We explore various modeling choices and fairness targets to determine which schema will leave consumers best off, while also earning revenue for the system itself. We show that when consumers individually negotiate the transaction price, and our fairness objective is to minimize mean net cost, we are able to achieve the most fair outcomes. Conversely, when transaction prices are centrally set, consumers are often unwilling to transact. When price dispersion (or range) is high, the system can reduce the mean net cost to each individual by $66\%$, or the mean net cost to a group by $69\%$. We find that a high dispersion of original prices is necessary for our system to be viable. Higher dispersion can actually lead to decreased net price paid by consumers, and act as a check against extreme personalization, increasing seller accountability. Our results provide theoretical evidence that such a system could improve fairness for consumers while sustaining itself financially.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of assigning students to schools, when students have different utilities for schools and schools have capacity. There are additional group fairness considerations over students that can be captured either by concave objectives, or additional constraints on the groups. We present approximation algorithms for this problem via convex program rounding that achieve various trade-offs between utility violation, capacity violation, and running time. We also show that our techniques easily extend to the setting where there are arbitrary covering constraints on the feasible assignment, capturing multi-criteria and ranking optimization.</description>

      <title>A Cardinality-Constrained Approach to Combinatorial Bilevel Congestion Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial bilevel congestion pricing (CBCP), a variant of the mixed (continuous/discrete) network design problems, seeks to minimize the total travel time experienced by all travelers in a road network, by strategically selecting toll locations and determining toll charges. Conventional wisdom suggests that these problems are intractable since they have to be formulated and solved with a significant number of integer variables. Here, we devise a scalable local algorithm for the CBCP problem that guarantees convergence to an approximate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point. Our approach is novel in that it eliminates the use of integer variables altogether, instead introducing a cardinality constraint that limits the number of toll locations to a user-specified upper bound. The resulting bilevel program with the cardinality constraint is then transformed into a block-separable, single-level optimization problem that can be solved efficiently after penalization and decomposition. We are able to apply the algorithm to solve, in about 20 minutes, a CBCP instance with up to 3,000 links. To the best of our knowledge, no existing algorithm can solve CBCP problems at such a scale while providing any assurance of convergence.</description>

      <title>{\alpha}-RACER: Real-Time Algorithm for Game-Theoretic Motion Planning and Control in Autonomous Racing using Near-Potential Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous racing extends beyond the challenge of controlling a racecar at its physical limits. Professional racers employ strategic maneuvers to outwit other competing opponents to secure victory. While modern control algorithms can achieve human-level performance by computing offline racing lines for single-car scenarios, research on real-time algorithms for multi-car autonomous racing is limited. To bridge this gap, we develop game-theoretic modeling framework that incorporates the competitive aspect of autonomous racing like overtaking and blocking through a novel policy parametrization, while operating the car at its limit. Furthermore, we propose an algorithmic approach to compute the (approximate) Nash equilibrium strategy, which represents the optimal approach in the presence of competing agents. Specifically, we introduce an algorithm inspired by recently introduced framework of dynamic near-potential function, enabling real-time computation of the Nash equilibrium. Our approach comprises two phases: offline and online. During the offline phase, we use simulated racing data to learn a near-potential function that approximates utility changes for agents. This function facilitates the online computation of approximate Nash equilibria by maximizing its value. We evaluate our method in a head-to-head 3-car racing scenario, demonstrating superior performance compared to several existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Truthful mechanisms for linear bandit games with private contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The contextual bandit problem, where agents arrive sequentially with personal contexts and the system adapts its arm allocation decisions accordingly, has recently garnered increasing attention for enabling more personalized outcomes. However, in many healthcare and recommendation applications, agents have private profiles and may misreport their contexts to gain from the system. For example, in adaptive clinical trials, where hospitals sequentially recruit volunteers to test multiple new treatments and adjust plans based on volunteers' reported profiles such as symptoms and interim data, participants may misreport severe side effects like allergy and nausea to avoid perceived suboptimal treatments. We are the first to study this issue of private context misreporting in a stochastic contextual bandit game between the system and non-repeated agents. We show that traditional low-regret algorithms, such as UCB family algorithms and Thompson sampling, fail to ensure truthful reporting and can result in linear regret in the worst case, while traditional truthful algorithms like explore-then-commit (ETC) and $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm incur sublinear but high regret. We propose a mechanism that uses a linear program to ensure truthfulness while minimizing deviation from Thompson sampling, yielding an $O(\ln T)$ frequentist regret. Our numerical experiments further demonstrate strong performance in multiple contexts and across other distribution families.</description>

Abstract: Mean-field game theory relies on approximating games that would otherwise have been intractable to model. While the games can be solved analytically via the associated system of partial derivatives, this approach is not model-free, can lead to the loss of the existence or uniqueness of solutions and may suffer from modelling bias. To reduce the dependency between the model and the game, we combine mean-field game theory with deep learning in the form of neural ordinary differential equations. The resulting model is data-driven, lightweight and can learn extensive strategic interactions that are hard to capture using mean-field theory alone. In addition, the model is based on automatic differentiation, making it more robust and objective than approaches based on finite differences. We highlight the efficiency and flexibility of our approach by solving three mean-field games that vary in their complexity, observability and the presence of noise. Using these results, we show that the model is flexible, lightweight and requires few observations to learn the distribution underlying the data.</description>
