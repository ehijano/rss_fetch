      <title>Improved Learning via k-DTW: A Novel Dissimilarity Measure for Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces $k$-Dynamic Time Warping ($k$-DTW), a novel dissimilarity measure for polygonal curves. $k$-DTW has stronger metric properties than Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and is more robust to outliers than the Fr\'{e}chet distance, which are the two gold standards of dissimilarity measures for polygonal curves. We show interesting properties of $k$-DTW and give an exact algorithm as well as a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-DTW by a parametric search for the $k$-th largest matched distance. We prove the first dimension-free learning bounds for curves and further learning theoretic results. $k$-DTW not only admits smaller sample size than DTW for the problem of learning the median of curves, where some factors depending on the curves' complexity $m$ are replaced by $k$, but we also show a surprising separation on the associated Rademacher and Gaussian complexities: $k$-DTW admits strictly smaller bounds than DTW, by a factor $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt{m})$ when $k\ll m$. We complement our theoretical findings with an experimental illustration of the benefits of using $k$-DTW for clustering and nearest neighbor classification.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Space-Efficient Algorithms for Counting Distinct Elements in the Turnstile Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The turnstile continual release model of differential privacy captures scenarios where a privacy-preserving real-time analysis is sought for a dataset evolving through additions and deletions. In typical applications of real-time data analysis, both the length of the stream $T$ and the size of the universe $|U|$ from which data come can be extremely large. This motivates the study of private algorithms in the turnstile setting using space sublinear in both $T$ and $|U|$. In this paper, we give the first sublinear space differentially private algorithms for the fundamental problem of counting distinct elements in the turnstile streaming model. Our algorithm achieves, on arbitrary streams, $\tilde{O}_{\eta}(T^{1/3})$ space and additive error, and a $(1+\eta)$-relative approximation for all $\eta \in (0,1)$. Our result significantly improves upon the space requirements of the state-of-the-art algorithms for this problem, which is linear, approaching the known $\Omega(T^{1/4})$ additive error lower bound for arbitrary streams. Moreover, when a bound $W$ on the number of times an item appears in the stream is known, our algorithm provides $\tilde{O}_{\eta}(\sqrt{W})$ additive error, using $\tilde{O}_{\eta}(\sqrt{W})$ space. This additive error asymptotically matches that of prior work which required instead linear space. Our results address an open question posed by [Jain, Kalemaj, Raskhodnikova, Sivakumar, Smith, Neurips23] about designing low-memory mechanisms for this problem. We complement these results with a space lower bound for this problem, which shows that any algorithm that uses similar techniques must use space $\tilde{\Omega}(T^{1/3})$ on arbitrary streams.</description>

      <title>Information-Computation Gaps in Quantum Learning via Low-Degree Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a variety of physically relevant settings for learning from quantum data, designing protocols that can computationally efficiently extract information remains largely an art, and there are important cases where we believe this to be impossible, that is, where there is an information-computation gap. While there is a large array of tools in the classical literature for giving evidence for average-case hardness of statistical inference problems, the corresponding tools in the quantum literature are far more limited. One such framework in the classical literature, the low-degree method, makes predictions about hardness of inference problems based on the failure of estimators given by low-degree polynomials. In this work, we extend this framework to the quantum setting.
  We establish a general connection between state designs and low-degree hardness. We use this to obtain the first information-computation gaps for learning Gibbs states of random, sparse, non-local Hamiltonians. We also use it to prove hardness for learning random shallow quantum circuit states in a challenging model where states can be measured in adaptively chosen bases. To our knowledge, the ability to model adaptivity within the low-degree framework was open even in classical settings. In addition, we also obtain a low-degree hardness result for quantum error mitigation against strategies with single-qubit measurements.
  We define a new quantum generalization of the planted biclique problem and identify the threshold at which this problem becomes computationally hard for protocols that perform local measurements. Interestingly, the complexity landscape for this problem shifts when going from local measurements to more entangled single-copy measurements.
  We show average-case hardness for the "standard" variant of Learning Stabilizers with Noise and for agnostically learning product states.</description>

      <title>Fast Isotropic Median Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Median filtering is a cornerstone of computational image processing. It provides an effective means of image smoothing, with minimal blurring or softening of edges, invariance to monotonic transformations such as gamma adjustment, and robustness to noise and outliers. However, known algorithms have all suffered from practical limitations: the bit depth of the image data, the size of the filter kernel, or the kernel shape itself. Square-kernel implementations tend to produce streaky cross-hatching artifacts, and nearly all known efficient algorithms are in practice limited to square kernels. We present for the first time a method that overcomes all of these limitations. Our method operates efficiently on arbitrary bit-depth data, arbitrary kernel sizes, and arbitrary convex kernel shapes, including circular shapes.</description>

      <title>The Generalized Skew Spectrum of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a family of permutation-invariant graph embeddings, generalizing the Skew Spectrum of graphs of Kondor &amp; Borgwardt (2008). Grounded in group theory and harmonic analysis, our method introduces a new class of graph invariants that are isomorphism-invariant and capable of embedding richer graph structures - including attributed graphs, multilayer graphs, and hypergraphs - which the Skew Spectrum could not handle. Our generalization further defines a family of functions that enables a trade-off between computational complexity and expressivity. By applying generalization-preserving heuristics to this family, we improve the Skew Spectrum's expressivity at the same computational cost. We formally prove the invariance of our generalization, demonstrate its improved expressiveness through experiments, and discuss its efficient computation.</description>

      <title>Fast Compressed-Domain N-Point Discrete Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel algorithm for computing the N-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) based solely on recursive Rectangular Index Compression (RIC) [1][2] and structured frequency shifts. The RIC DFT algorithm compresses a signal from $N=CL$ to $C\in[2,N/2]$ points at the expense of $N-1$ complex additions and no complex multiplication. It is shown that a $C$-point DFT on the compressed signal corresponds exactly to $C$ DFT coefficients of the original $N$-point DFT, namely, $X_{kL}$, $k=0,1,\ldots,C-1$ with no need for twiddle factors. We rely on this strategy to decompose the DFT by recursively compressing the input signal and applying global frequency shifts (to get odd-indexed DFT coefficients). We show that this new structure can relax the power-of-two assumption of the radix-2 FFT by enabling signal input lengths such as $N=c\cdot 2^k$ (for $k\geq 0$ and a non-power-of-two $c&gt;0$). Thus, our algorithm potentially outperforms radix-2 FFTs for the cases where significant zero-padding is needed. The proposed approach achieves a computational complexity of $O(N \log N)$ and offers a new structural perspective on DFT computation, with potential impacts on several DFT issues like numerical stability, hardware implementation, sparse transforms, convolutions, and others DFT-based procedures.</description>

      <title>A Unified View of Graph Regularity via Matrix Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.11868v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove algorithmic weak and \Szemeredi{} regularity lemmas for several classes of sparse graphs in the literature, for which only weak regularity lemmas were previously known. These include core-dense graphs, low threshold rank graphs, and (a version of) $L^p$ upper regular graphs. More precisely, we define \emph{cut pseudorandom graphs}, we prove our regularity lemmas for these graphs, and then we show that cut pseudorandomness captures all of the above graph classes as special cases.
  The core of our approach is an abstracted matrix decomposition, roughly following Frieze and Kannan [Combinatorica '99] and \Lovasz{} and Szegedy [Geom.\ Func.\ Anal.\ '07], which can be computed by a simple algorithm by Charikar [AAC0 '00]. This gives rise to the class of cut pseudorandom graphs, and using work of Oveis Gharan and Trevisan [TOC '15], it also implies new PTASes for MAX-CUT, MAX-BISECTION, MIN-BISECTION for a significantly expanded class of input graphs. (It is NP Hard to get PTASes for these graphs in general.)</description>

      <title>Efficient Approximation Schemes for Stochastic Probing and Selection-Stopping Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.13121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general framework to design {efficient} polynomial time approximation schemes (EPTAS) for fundamental stochastic combinatorial optimization problems. Given an error parameter $\epsilon&gt;0$, such algorithmic schemes attain a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation in $t(\epsilon)\cdot poly(|{\cal I}|)$ time, where $t(\cdot)$ is a function that depends only on $\epsilon$ and $|{\cal I}|$ denotes the input length. Technically speaking, our approach relies on presenting tailor-made reductions to a newly-introduced multi-dimensional Santa Claus problem. Even though the single-dimensional version of this problem is already known to be APX-Hard, we prove that an EPTAS can be designed for a constant number of machines and dimensions, which hold for each of our applications.
  To demonstrate the versatility of our framework, we first study selection-stopping settings to derive an EPTAS for the Free-Order Prophets problem [Agrawal et al., EC~'20] and for its cost-driven generalization, Pandora's Box with Commitment [Fu et al., ICALP~'18]. These results constitute the first approximation schemes in the non-adaptive setting and improve on known \emph{inefficient} polynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS) for their adaptive variants. Next, turning our attention to stochastic probing problems, we obtain an EPTAS for the adaptive ProbeMax problem as well as for its non-adaptive counterpart; in both cases, state-of-the-art approximability results have been inefficient PTASes [Chen et al., NIPS~'16; Fu et al., ICALP~'18].</description>

      <title>Concurrent Composition for Interactive Differential Privacy with Adaptive Privacy-Loss Parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the concurrent composition of interactive mechanisms with adaptively chosen privacy-loss parameters. In this setting, the adversary can interleave queries to existing interactive mechanisms, as well as create new ones. We prove that every valid privacy filter and odometer for noninteractive mechanisms extends to the concurrent composition of interactive mechanisms if privacy loss is measured using $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP, $f$-DP, or R\'enyi DP of fixed order. Our results offer strong theoretical foundations for enabling full adaptivity in composing differentially private interactive mechanisms, showing that concurrency does not affect the privacy guarantees. We also provide an implementation for users to deploy in practice.</description>

      <title>Pairwise Rearrangement is Fixed-Parameter Tractable in the Single Cut-and-Join Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01942v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genome rearrangement is a common model for molecular evolution. In this paper, we consider the Pairwise Rearrangement problem, which takes as input two genomes and asks for the number of minimum-length sequences of permissible operations transforming the first genome into the second. In the Single Cut-and-Join model (Bergeron, Medvedev, &amp; Stoye, J. Comput. Biol. 2010), Pairwise Rearrangement is $\#\textsf{P}$-complete (Bailey, et. al., COCOON 2023), which implies that exact sampling is intractable. In order to cope with this intractability, we investigate the parameterized complexity of this problem. We exhibit a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm with respect to the number of components in the adjacency graph that are not cycles of length $2$ or paths of length $1$. As a consequence, we obtain that Pairwise Rearrangement in the Single Cut-and-Join model is fixed-parameter tractable by distance. Our results suggest that the number of nontrivial components in the adjacency graph serves as the key obstacle for efficient sampling.</description>

      <title>Two-sided Assortment Optimization: Adaptivity Gaps and Approximation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08929v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address efficiency and design challenges in choice-based matching platforms, we introduce a two-sided assortment optimization framework under general choice preferences. The goal in this problem is to maximize the expected number of matches by deciding which assortments are displayed to the agents and the order in which they are shown. In this context, we identify several classes of policies that platforms can use in their design. Our goals are: (1) to measure the value that one class of policies has over another one, and (2) to approximately solve the optimization problem itself for a given class. For (1), we define the adaptivity gap as the worst-case ratio between the optimal values of two different policy classes. First, we show that the gap between the class of policies that statically show assortments to one-side first and the class of policies that adaptively show assortments to one-side first is exactly $e/(e-1)$. Second, we show that the gap between the latter class of policies and the fully adaptive class of policies that show assortments to agents one by one is exactly $2$. We also note that the worst policies are those who simultaneously show assortments to all the agents. For (2), we first design a polynomial time algorithm that achieves a $1/4$ approximation factor within the class of policies that adaptively show assortments to agents one by one. Furthermore, when agents' preferences are governed by multinomial-logit models, we show that a 0.067 approximation factor can be obtained within the class of policies that show assortments to all agents at once. We further generalize our results to constrained assortment settings, where we impose an upper bound on the size of the displayed assortments. Finally, we present a computational study to evaluate the empirical performance of our theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Finding $d$-Cuts in Graphs of Bounded Diameter, Graphs of Bounded Radius and $H$-Free Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $d$-Cut problem is to decide if a graph has an edge cut such that each vertex has at most $d$ neighbours at the opposite side of the cut. If $d=1$, we obtain the intensively studied Matching Cut problem. The $d$-Cut problem has been studied as well, but a systematic study for special graph classes was lacking. We initiate such a study and consider classes of bounded diameter, bounded radius and $H$-free graphs. We prove that for all $d\geq 2$, $d$-Cut is polynomial-time solvable for graphs of diameter $2$, $(P_3+P_4)$-free graphs and $P_5$-free graphs. These results extend known results for $d=1$. However, we also prove several NP-hardness results for $d$-Cut that contrast known polynomial-time results for $d=1$. Our results lead to full dichotomies for bounded diameter and bounded radius and to almost-complete dichotomies for $H$-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the QuickVal Residual</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: QuickSelect (aka Find), introduced by Hoare (1961), is a randomized algorithm for selecting a specified order statistic from an input sequence of $n$ objects, or rather their identifying labels usually known as keys. The keys can be numeric or symbol strings, or indeed any labels drawn from a given linearly ordered set. We discuss various ways in which the cost of comparing two keys can be measured, and we can measure the efficiency of the algorithm by the total cost of such comparisons.
  We define and discuss a closely related algorithm known as QuickVal and a natural probabilistic model for the input to this algorithm; QuickVal searches (almost surely unsuccessfully) for a specified population quantile $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ in an input sample of size $n$. Call the total cost of comparisons for this algorithm $S_n$. We discuss a natural way to define the random variables $S_1, S_2, \ldots$ on a common probability space. For a general class of cost functions, Fill and Nakama (2013) proved under mild assumptions that the scaled cost $S_n / n$ of QuickVal converges in $L^p$ and almost surely to a limit random variable $S$. For a general cost function, we consider what we term the QuickVal residual: \[\rho_n := \frac{S_n}n - S.\] The residual is of natural interest, especially in light of the previous analogous work on the sorting algorithm QuickSort. In the case $\alpha = 0$ of QuickMin with unit cost per key-comparison, we are able to calculate -- \`a la Bindjeme and Fill (2012) for QuickSort -- the exact (and asymptotic) $L^2$-norm of the residual. We take the result as motivation for the scaling factor $\sqrt{n}$ for the QuickVal residual for general population quantiles and for general cost. We then prove in general (under mild conditions on the cost function) that $\sqrt{n}\,\rho_n$ converges in law to a scale-mixture of centered Gaussians, and we also prove convergence of moments.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bounds for Adversarial Constrained Online Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13366v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constrained Online Convex Optimization (COCO) can be seen as a generalization of the standard Online Convex Optimization (OCO) framework. At each round, a cost function and constraint function are revealed after a learner chooses an action. The goal is to minimize both the regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV) against an adaptive adversary. We show for the first time that is possible to obtain the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ bound on both regret and CCV, improving the best known bounds of $O \left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ and $\tilde{O} \left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ for the regret and CCV, respectively. Based on a new surrogate loss function enforcing a minimum penalty on the constraint function, we demonstrate that both the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader and the Online Gradient Descent achieve the optimal bounds.</description>

      <title>Parallel GPU-Accelerated Randomized Construction of Approximate Cholesky Preconditioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a parallel algorithm to construct a preconditioner for solving a large, sparse linear system where the coefficient matrix is a Laplacian matrix (a.k.a., graph Laplacian). Such a linear system arises from applications such as discretization of a partial differential equation, spectral graph partitioning, and learning problems on graphs. The preconditioner belongs to the family of incomplete factorizations and is purely algebraic. Unlike traditional incomplete factorizations, the new method employs randomization to determine whether or not to keep fill-ins, i.e., newly generated nonzero elements during Gaussian elimination. Since the sparsity pattern of the randomized factorization is unknown, computing such a factorization in parallel is extremely challenging, especially on many-core architectures such as GPUs. Our parallel algorithm dynamically computes the dependency among row/column indices of the Laplacian matrix to be factorized and processes the independent indices in parallel. Furthermore, unlike previous approaches, our method requires little pre-processing time. We implemented the parallel algorithm for multi-core CPUs and GPUs, and we compare their performance to other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Improved and Oracle-Efficient Online $\ell_1$-Multicalibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study \emph{online multicalibration}, a framework for ensuring calibrated predictions across multiple groups in adversarial settings, across $T$ rounds. Although online calibration is typically studied in the $\ell_1$ norm, prior approaches to online multicalibration have taken the indirect approach of obtaining rates in other norms (such as $\ell_2$ and $\ell_{\infty}$) and then transferred these guarantees to $\ell_1$ at additional loss. In contrast, we propose a direct method that achieves improved and oracle-efficient rates of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$ respectively, for online $\ell_1$-multicalibration. Our key insight is a novel reduction of online \(\ell_1\)-multicalibration to an online learning problem with product-based rewards, which we refer to as \emph{online linear-product optimization} ($\mathtt{OLPO}$).
  To obtain the improved rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, we introduce a linearization of $\mathtt{OLPO}$ and design a no-regret algorithm for this linearized problem. Although this method guarantees the desired sublinear rate (nearly matching the best rate for online calibration), it is computationally expensive when the group family \(\mathcal{H}\) is large or infinite, since it enumerates all possible groups. To address scalability, we propose a second approach to $\mathtt{OLPO}$ that makes only a polynomial number of calls to an offline optimization (\emph{multicalibration evaluation}) oracle, resulting in \emph{oracle-efficient} online \(\ell_1\)-multicalibration with a rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$. Our framework also extends to certain infinite families of groups (e.g., all linear functions on the context space) by exploiting a $1$-Lipschitz property of the \(\ell_1\)-multicalibration error with respect to \(\mathcal{H}\).</description>
