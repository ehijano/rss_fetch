      <title>A multistep strategy for polynomial system solving over finite fields and a new algebraic attack on the stream cipher Trivium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a multistep generalization of the guess-and-determine or hybrid strategy for solving a system of multivariate polynomial equations over a finite field. In particular, we propose performing the exhaustive evaluation of a subset of variables stepwise, that is, by incrementing the size of such subset each time that an evaluation leads to a polynomial system which is possibly unfeasible to solve. The decision about which evaluation to extend is based on a preprocessing consisting in computing an incomplete Grobner basis after the current evaluation, which possibly generates linear polynomials that are used to eliminate further variables. If the number of remaining variables in the system is deemed still too high, the evaluation is extended and the preprocessing is iterated. Otherwise, we solve the system by a complete Grobner basis computation.
  Having in mind cryptanalytic applications, we present an implementation of this strategy in an algorithm called MultiSolve which is designed for polynomial systems having at most one solution. We prove explicit formulas for its complexity which are based on probability distributions that can be easily estimated by performing the proposed preprocessing on a testset of evaluations for different subsets of variables. We prove that an optimal complexity of MultiSolve is achieved by using a full multistep strategy with a maximum number of steps and in turn the standard guess-and-determine strategy, which essentially is a strategy consisting of a single step, is the worst choice. Finally, we extensively study the behaviour of MultiSolve when performing an algebraic attack on the well-known stream cipher Trivium.</description>

      <title>The Recovery of $\lambda$ from a Hilbert Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the study of Hilbert schemes, the integer partition $\lambda$ helps researchers identify some geometric and combinatorial properties of the scheme in question. To aid researchers in extracting such information from a Hilbert polynomial, we describe an efficient algorithm which can identify if $p(x)\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is a Hilbert polynomial and if so, recover the integer partition $\lambda$ associated with it.</description>

      <title>$D$-Module Techniques for Solving Differential Equations in the Context of Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feynman integrals are solutions to linear partial differential equations with polynomial coefficients. Using a triangle integral with general exponents as a case in point, we compare $D$-module methods to dedicated methods developed for solving differential equations appearing in the context of Feynman integrals, and provide a dictionary of the relevant concepts. In particular, we implement an algorithm due to Saito, Sturmfels, and Takayama to derive canonical series solutions of regular holonomic $D$-ideals, and compare them to asymptotic series derived by the respective Fuchsian systems.</description>
