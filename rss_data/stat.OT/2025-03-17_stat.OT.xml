      <title>The Problem of the Priors, or Posteriors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of the priors is well known: it concerns the challenge of identifying norms that govern one's prior credences. I argue that a key to addressing this problem lies in considering what I call the problem of the posteriors -- the challenge of identifying norms that directly govern one's posterior credences, which then induce constraints on the priors via the diachronic requirement of conditionalization. This forward-looking approach can be summarized as: Think ahead, work backward. Although this idea can be traced to Freedman (1963), Carnap (1963), and Shimony (1970), it has received little attention in philosophy. In this paper, I initiate a systematic defense of forward-looking Bayesianism, addressing potential objections from more traditional views (both subjectivist and objectivist) and arguing for its advantages. In particular, I develop a specific approach to forward-looking Bayesianism -- one that treats the convergence of posterior credences to the truth as a fundamental rather than derived normative requirement. This approach, called convergentist Bayesianism, is argued to be crucial for a Bayesian foundation of Ockham's razor and related inference methods in statistics and machine learning.</description>

      <title>A quantile-based bivariate distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a flexible bivariate distribution specified by a quantile function. The distribution contains as special cases new bivariate exponential, Pareto I, Pareto II, beta, power, log logistic and uniform distributions and also can approximate many other continuous models. Various $L$-moment based properties of the distribution such as covariance, coskewness, cokurtosis, $L$-correlation, etc are discussed. The distribution is used to model two real data sets.</description>

      <title>How causal perspectives can inform problems in computational neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, considerable strides have been made in advancing neuroscience techniques, yet the translation of these advancements into clinically relevant insights for human mental health remains a challenge. This review addresses a fundamental issue in neuroscience - attributing causality - and advocates for the development of robust causal frameworks. We systematically introduce the necessary definitions and concepts, emphasizing the implicit role of causal frameworks in neuroscience investigations. We illustrate how persistent challenges in neuroscience, such as batch effects and selection biases, can be conceptualized and approached using causal frameworks. Through theoretical development and real-world examples, we show how these causal perspectives highlight numerous shortcomings of existing data collection strategies and analytical approaches. We demonstrate how causal frameworks can inform both experimental design and analysis, particularly for observational studies where traditional randomization is infeasible. Using neuroimaging as a detailed case study, we explore the advantages, shortcomings, and implications for generalizability that these perspectives afford to existing and novel research paradigms. Together, we believe that this perspective offers a framework for conceptualizing, framing, and inspiring innovative approaches to problems in neuroscience.</description>
