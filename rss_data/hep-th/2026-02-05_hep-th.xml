      <title>The Line, the Strip and the Duality Defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Symmetry Topological Field Theories (SymTFT) that describes the exotic models XY-plaquette and XYZ-cube, we construct codim-1 condensation defects by higher gauging with discrete torsion the non-compact symmetry of the bulk. In the framework of SymTFT Mille-feuille, which captures the Lorentz-invariance breaking subsystem symmetries, these models are dual to foliated versions of Maxwell theory. We show first that the XY-plaquette model admits a $\theta$-term. Then, we show these condensation defects realize non-invertible self-duality symmetries at any value of the coupling. In the XYZ-cube model such symmetry is discrete. On the other hand, we find that the XY-plaquette has a non-invertible continuous $SO(2)$ symmetry, thus extending the results in the current literature.</description>

      <title>Degenerate vortices and world-line instantons in three-dimensional gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the study of particle-like topological solitons with degenerate masses and their mixing due to world-line instantons. Previously, this phenomenon was studied in 1+1-dimensional setups. Here we take a step further and consider degenerate vortices in 2+1 dimensions. We find that, while classically such vortices may be degenerate, they generally mix and split at the quantum level. Supersymmetry protects BPS-saturated vortices only when the number of supercharges in the bulk is large enough.</description>

      <title>Orbi-Instantons and Class $\mathcal{S}$ Theories of Type D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the landscape of 6d $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ D-type orbi-instanton superconformal field theories (SCFTs) and their torus compactifications to four-dimensional class $\mathcal{S}$ theories. By analysing a general class of 6d F-theory constructions via generalised quivers, we demonstrate that -- in contrast to the well-characterised A-type series -- the dimensional reductions that admit a 4d class $\mathcal{S}$ description on a Riemann sphere with three untwisted D-type punctures constitute only a subset of the full orbi-instanton landscape. For this subclass, we show that the punctures can be effectively characterised by two sets of integers: the $s$-labels and the $m$-labels. The $s$-labels, or ``Kac-type labels'', serve as the D-type analogues to the Kac labels used in A-type theories; we establish their correspondence with ``modified excess numbers'' in the associated 3d mirror theories (magnetic quivers). The $m$-labels are further introduced to streamline the mapping from 6d generalised quivers to their class $\mathcal{S}$ descriptions. Furthermore, we analyse physical distinctions arising from 6d $\theta$ angles and explore the hierarchy of Higgs branch flows. In doing so, we uncover instances of ``hidden Higgsings'' -- renormalization group flows present in the 6d parent theories that are not manifest in the puncture closures of the corresponding class $\mathcal{S}$ descriptions.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Couplings of Dark Domain Walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Maxwell electrodynamics with a Chern--Simons coupling to a dark sector top form sourced by domain walls. Electromagnetic fields which cross such domain walls exhibit optical activity. We outline the parameter space where the theory satisfies the observational bounds from domain wall nucleation rates and cosmic microwave background anisotropies. In this regime, the discretely evanescent dark energy walls can produce a polarization rotation of cosmic microwave background by $\Delta\vartheta \sim 10^{-3} ~{\rm radians}$.</description>

      <title>On the importance of radiation-era initial conditions for tensor perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conservation of super-horizon tensor fluctuations is crucial for connecting inflation to observations. Starting from first principles, recent works have found violations of this conservation if free-streaming radiation is produced during reheating. We show that the non-conservation is sensitive to the radiation initial state, and argue that the physical state should be affected by tensor perturbations that are already present during reheating. The deviation from super-horizon conservation is then negligible, recovering the standard result from kinetic theory. In contrast, a globally homogeneous and isotropic plasma state leads to a large suppression of tensor amplitudes. This difference between the local (physical) and global thermal equilibrium settles the discrepancy between the older and recent literature.</description>

      <title>Boundary conformal field theory, holography and bulk locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bulk locality in a scalar effective field theory (EFT) in AdS background in presence of an end-of-the-world (EOW) brane. The holographic dual description is given in terms of a boundary conformal field theory (BCFT). We compute the two point correlation function of scalar operators in the BCFT using the one-loop Witten diagrams and compare its analytic structure with the constraints imposed by boundary conformal symmetry. We find that the loop-corrected correlator derived from a local bulk description is not fully compatible with BCFT expectations. This result places nontrivial constraint on bulk locality in holographic BCFT constructions and identifies BCFT correlators as sensitive probes of quantum bulk dynamics in presence of boundaries.</description>

      <title>Quantum fields from real-time ensemble dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic quantum field theory (QFT) is commonly formulated in terms of operators, asymptotic states, and covariant amplitudes, a perspective that tends to obscure the real-time origin of field dynamics and correlations. Here we formulate quantum fields in a real-time Schr\"odinger-picture framework, in which fields evolve as probability ensembles on the space of field configurations. Within this formulation, the wavefunctional $\Psi[\phi,t]$ encodes a first-order, causal ensemble dynamics on configuration space. Interactions appear as couplings between configuration-space directions, while propagators arise as derived correlation structures rather than as fundamental postulates. Entanglement, scattering amplitudes, and conformal field theory correlators emerge as distinct projections of the same underlying ensemble evolution, corresponding to equal-time, asymptotic, and symmetry-organized observables. Standard operator, diagrammatic, and path-integral formulations are recovered as computational representations of this single real-time dynamics. This organization makes explicit the distinction between fundamental dynamical structure and representational tools in QFT, and clarifies the scope within which ensemble-averaged correlators account for quantum fluctuations, while also delineating the level at which questions associated with individual realizations and randomness would arise beyond the correlator-based field-theoretic description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $4D$, $\mathcal{N}=4$, $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills theory formulated in terms of $\mathcal{N}=1$ superfields where the leading low-energy contributions to effective action are given by chiral effective potential. This effective potential is calculated in one- and higher-loop approximations. It is shown that this potential is automatically finite and proportional to the classical chiral potential. All quantum corrections are found explicitly and factored into a coefficient at the classical potential.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear self-duality for arbitrary spin, superspin, and supersymmetry type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the general formalism of duality rotations for $\cal N$-extended (super)conformal gauge multiplets of arbitrary (super)spin in four dimensions, with ${\cal N} \geq 0$. Self-dual models for a vector field (${\cal N}=0$) and for ${\cal N}=1$ and ${\cal N}=2$ vector supermultiplets are naturally formulated on general (super)gravity backgrounds. For all other (super)spin values, the corresponding self-dual systems are realised on arbitrary conformally flat backgrounds. Every $\mathsf{U}(1)$ duality-invariant model is demonstrated to be self-dual with respect to a Legendre transformation. Methods are proposed to generate such self-dual models including superconformal ones. We show that every model for self-dual nonlinear electrodynamics admits a higher-spin extension. Throughout the review, we make use of the formalism of conformal (super)space, that is the geometric setting to describe the gauge theory of the (super)conformal group.</description>

      <title>Canonical differential equations beyond polylogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feynman integrals whose associated geometries extend beyond the Riemann sphere, such as elliptic curves and Calabi-Yau varieties, are increasingly relevant in modern precision calculations. They arise not only in collider cross-section calculations, but also in the post-Minkowskian expansion of gravitational-wave scattering. A powerful approach to compute integrals of this type is via differential equations, particularly when cast in a canonical form, which simplifies their $\varepsilon$-expansion and makes analytic properties manifest. In these proceedings, we will present a method to systematically construct canonical differential equations even for integrals that evaluate beyond multiple polylogarithms. The discussion is kept as light as possible, focusing on the two-loop sunrise integral, deferring the technical details to the original publications.</description>

Abstract: We perform a resurgence analysis of the perturbative partition functions of orientifolded conifolds and obtain the full nonperturbative partition functions in terms of multiple sine functions. We derive the unoriented Donaldson--Thomas invariants from the analysis of associated Stokes jumps. We further discuss the Riemann--Hilbert problems defined by the Donaldson--Thomas invariants arising from orientifolded conifolds and the corresponding $\tau$-functions.</description>

      <title>The holographic Fermions over the ionic lattice with CDW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the holographic Fermion as a probe over the background with ionic lattice, which may undergo a phase transition with the development of charge density wave by the spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry. We focus on the structure of the Fermi surface within different Brillouin zones and demonstrate how the presence of CDW in the background affects the formation of the band gap in the momentum space. Specifically, we find the formation of the CDW enhances the amplitude of spectral function as well as the momentum of the Fermi surface. Furthermore, we are concerned with the change of the Fermi surface with the doping parameter as well as the lattice amplitude. Interestingly, we find that the radius of the Fermi surface expands with the increase of the doping parameter and finally may cross the first Brillouin zone. Additionally, the width of band gap becomes larger with the increase of the lattice amplitude as well, which is consistent with the observation in condensed matter experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present integrable deformations of Yang-Baxter (YB) sigma models based on the Courant-Hilbert (CH) construction. To this end, we employ the four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory, in which the CH construction is shown in arXiv:2509.22080. As a result, the CH construction works in an intricate way alongside the YB deformations. Remarkably, the resulting deformed action can also be expressed as the sum of the master formula Lagrangian and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. This result indicates the universality of the correction term.</description>

      <title>Translating auxiliary symmetries between Schottky uniformization and Jacobi parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explicit description and computation of functions defined on Riemann surfaces of various genera depends on the choice of language: while the Jacobi parametrization is widely known and used, the Schottky uniformization has been proven to provide an alternative approach, useful in particular for (but not limited to) numerical calculations. Despite capturing the geometry of the Riemann surface completely, the two languages are subject to rather different sets of auxiliary symmetries. In this article we translate and compare the symplectic transformations inherent in the Jacobi parametrization to the freedom in choosing M\"obius transformations generating the Schottky group for the Schottky uniformization. Our results are aimed at transferring functional relations expressed in the Schottky language to the Jacobi language and vice versa. An immediate application would be the efficient numerical evaluation of special functions in a physics context by favorably tuning the Schottky cover leading to quicker convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge-invariant polynomial functions of matrix and tensor variables capture combinatorial structures of gauge-string duality, which can be usefully organised using finite-dimensional associative algebras. I review recent work on eigenvalue systems using these algebras as state spaces, which provide efficient computational algorithms for the construction of orthogonal bases in the multi-matrix case. Algebraic counting formulae in matrix and tensor systems with $U(N)$ as well as $S_N$ symmetry have led to gauged quantum mechanical models which display a negative branch of specific heat capacity in the micro-canonical ensemble followed by positive specific heat capacity at larger energies measured by a polynomial degree parameter $n$. The negative branch is associated with near-exponential or factorial growth of degeneracies for $ n \gg 1$ in a region of large $N$ stability, while the positive branch occurs when the finite $N$ reduction of degrees of freedom takes over as $n$ becomes sufficiently large compared to $N$.</description>

      <title>Computation of $\langle \Phi^2\rangle$ and quantum fluxes at the polar interior of a spinning black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17464v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renormalization of physical quantities for quantum field theories in curved spacetimes can be achieved via the consistent subtraction of counterterms within a regularization scheme such as a point-splitting method. Pragmatic mode-sum regularization (PMR) is a point-splitting method which is particularly suitable for rotating black hole spacetimes. We extend and tailor the t-splitting variant of PMR specifically for the interior of a Kerr black hole on the axis of rotation, focusing on a minimally-coupled massless scalar field in the physically-motivated Unruh state. The method addresses unique challenges in the black hole interior that do not occur outside. In particular, while the infinite sum over multipolar number l converges in the black hole exterior, it diverges in the interior, necessitating the subtraction of a so-called intermediate divergence which includes introducing an additional "small" split in the direction of the polar angle. This procedure is outlined and justified, along with the standard PMR method's counterterms subtraction. We apply this method to calculate the renormalized energy-momentum fluxes $\langle T_{uu}\rangle^U_\text{ren}$, $\langle T_{vv}\rangle^U_\text{ren}$ (where u and v are the standard Eddington coordinates) and the renormalized field square $\langle \Phi^2\rangle^U_\text{ren}$ throughout the black hole interior, spanning from (just off) the event horizon to (just off) the inner horizon. Special emphasis is placed on the inner horizon vicinity, where our t-splitting results for the fluxes asymptote to those obtained directly at the inner horizon using a different method in a previous work. In an Appendix, we develop an alternative t-splitting PMR variant which does not include the intermediate divergence subtraction. We utilize it for independent computations that are used to verify the standard t-splitting variant presented in the main text.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative renormalization for lattice massive QED$_2$: the ultraviolet problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a lattice regularization, preserving Ward Identities (WI) and with a Wilson term, of the Massive QED$_2$, describing a fermion with mass $m$ and charge $\mathsf{e}$ interacting with a vector field with mass $M$, in the regime $m\ll M\ll a^{-1}$ ($a$ being the lattice spacing) which is the suitable one to mimic a realistic 4d massive gauge theory like the Electroweak sector. The presence of the lattice and of the mass $m$ breaks any solvability property. In this paper we prove that the effective action obtained after the integration of the ultraviolet degrees of freedom is expressed by expansions which are convergent for values of the coupling $|\mathsf{e}|\le \mathsf{e}_0$, with $\mathsf{e}_0$ independent on $a$ and $m$, and with cut-off-independent bare parameters. By combining this result with the analysis of the infrared part in previous papers we get a complete construction of the model and a number of properties whose analogous are expected to hold in 4d. The analysis is done by integrating out the bosons and reducing to a fermionic theory; however, with respect to the case with momentum regularizations (which break essential features like the WI), the resulting effective fermionic action has not a simple form and this requires the developments of new methods to get the necessary bounds.</description>

      <title>Boundary and Symmetry Breaking in a Deformed Toric Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores a deformation of the Kitaev toric code that induces a phase transition out of the topologically ordered phase. By placing the model on a cylinder, the bulk global 1-form symmetries separate into distinct boundary operators, allowing us to show that the transition is accompanied by the breaking of one higher-form symmetry. Using a holographic $(1+1)$-dimensional boundary Hamiltonian, we extract an effective central charge and find a pronounced suppression near $\beta_c$, followed by its restoration at strong coupling, indicating sensitivity to bulk criticality rather than topological order.</description>

      <title>A simple mechanism for the enhancement of the inflationary power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The background evolution in two-field inflation can feature two distinct stages, corresponding to the evolution along two successive field directions. When the second stage occurs at a significantly lower energy scale, the inflationary trajectory includes a sharp transition, accompanied by a series of rapid turns in field space. Fluctuations crossing the Hubble horizon during this turning phase can experience amplification by several orders of magnitude. This mechanism is very intuitive and can be implemented even in simple two-field models. It produces a peak in the scalar power spectrum that can lead to significant abundances of primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Parametric Resonance and Backreaction Effects in Magnetogenesis from Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We take a more detailed look at the recently proposed magnetogenesis mechanism triggered by ultralight dark matter coupled to electromagnetism. The proposed mechanism made use of a tachyonic resonance channel which leads to the exponential amplification of infrared modes. Here, we first investigate a possible narrow band parametric resonance channel which can produce photons at higher frequencies. Secondly, we estimate the effects of back-reaction on terminating the resonance. We find that there is indeed a narrow resonance channel. It is characterized by a Floquet exponent which is slightly smaller than the corresponding exponent for the tachyonic resonance. However, there is a region of parameter space (corresponding to a very small coupling constant) for which the tachyonic resonance is ineffective. In this case, the narrow resonance will dominate, and it will still be sufficiently strong to generate the observed magnetic fields on cosmological scales. Our analytical treatment of the back-reaction effects considered here indicates that a fraction of order one of the initial dark matter density can flow into the gauge fields. Hence, our magnetogenesis scenario appears to be robust to back-reaction effects.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Dynamics in Extremal Black Holes: A Challenge to the Chaos Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate chaotic dynamics in extremal black holes by analyzing the motion of massless particles in both Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and Kerr geometries. Two complementary approaches (i) taking the extremal limit of non-extremal solutions and (ii) working directly in the extremal background, yield consistent results. We find that, contrary to naive extrapolation of the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) chaos bound, the Lyapunov exponent remains positive even at zero temperature. For Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes, chaos diminishes but persists at extremality, while for Kerr black holes it strengthens with increasing spin. These results demonstrate that extremal black holes exhibit residual chaotic dynamics that violate the MSS bound, establishing them as qualitatively distinct dynamical phases of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aim of this paper is to retrace the path that led the young Enrico Fermi to write his paper on the statistics of an ideal monatomic gas. This discovery originated in his interest, which he had shown since his formative years, in the absolute entropy constant and in the problems he highlighted in Sommerfeld's quantization in the case of identical particle systems. The fundamental step taken by Fermi in writing his work on statistics was to apply the Exclusion Principle, formulated for electrons in an atom and which could therefore have been a pure effect due to dynamics, to a system of non-interacting particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we present the simple example of an Exotic Invariant with just two chiral electron supermultiplets E and P. In this example we include a mass term, and that means that there is a constraint on the Exotic Invariant. The constraint is easily solved for this simple case. Here we also exhibit a simple conjecture for the Completion Terms. This simple example is very useful, because the constraint that arises in the case of the Exotic Model, presented in E6, is just as easy to solve, and the Completion Terms there are also very similar to those here. So this simple EP model is very useful for understanding the Exotic Model, which is what results from adding an Exotic Invariant to the rather complicated Supersymmetric Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Restoring Landauer's Principle for Unitarily Transformed Thermal Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landauer's principle, a cornerstone of quantum information and thermodynamics, appears to be violated when the thermal reservoir is replaced by a squeezed thermal state (STS). We introduce a formal extension of the principle to such unitarily transformed thermal states. By defining an effective Hamiltonian, we rigorously establish a generalized Landauer inequality, which naturally reduces to the standard case for an ordinary thermal reservoir as a special instance. The framework further yields a consistent definition of entropy production and a proof of its non-negativity. We illustrate its utility by studying an arbitrarily moving Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a quantum field initially prepared in the STS. Using perturbation theory, we compute the entropy production explicitly, confirming its positivity. As a result of the symmetry breaking induced by the unitary transformation, it depends on both the proper time interval and the absolute spacetime position. Our work resolves the apparent violation of Landauer's principle with STSs. It also provides a robust tool for analyzing quantum thermodynamics in non-equilibrium and relativistic settings, with potential implications for quantum thermal machines and information protocols.</description>

      <title>Emergent Hawking Radiation and Quantum Sensing in a Quenched Chiral Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence and detection of Hawking radiation (HR) in a 1D chiral spin chain model, where the gravitational collapse is simulated by a sudden quantum quench that triggers a horizon-inducing phase transition. While our previous work Jaiswal [2025] established that this model mimics BH formation conditions even when the Hoop conjecture is seemingly violated, we here focus on the resulting stationary radiation spectrum and its detectability. By mapping the spin chain dynamics to a Dirac fermion in a curved (1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime, we analyze the radiation using two complementary approaches: field-theoretic modes and operational quantum sensors. First, using localized Gaussian wave packets to model realistic detectors, we find that the radiation spectrum exhibits deviations from the ideal Planckian form, analogous to frequency-dependent greybody factors, while retaining robust Poissonian statistics that signal the loss of formation-scale information. Second, we introduce a qubit coupled to the chain as a stationary Unruh-DeWitt detector. We demonstrate that the qubit functions as a faithful quantum sensor of the Hawking temperature only in the weak-coupling regime, where its population dynamics are governed solely by the bath spectral density. In the strong-coupling limit, the probe thermalizes with the global environment, obscuring the horizon-induced thermal signature. These results provide a clear operational protocol for distinguishing genuine analog HR from environmental noise in quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Kodaira-Spencer theory for Courant algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying Courant algebroids on dg ringed manifolds, we observe that the associated Roytenberg-Weinstein $L_\infty$ algebra admits a local structure reminiscent of a shifted contact structure. On a dg ringed manifold with an $n$-orientation, its symplectification produces a sheaf of $(2-n)$-shifted symplectic formal moduli problems, which we call the Courant contact model. This construction can be interpreted as a ($\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-graded) theory in the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism whenever $n$ is odd. After developing the procedure of reduction and extension of scalars, we show how twisted backgrounds in type I supergravity naturally lead to Courant algebroids over the Dolbeault complex. Specialising to the case of a Calabi-Yau fivefold, we show that the Courant contact model for that Courant algebroid is equivalent to a central extension of minimal type I BCOV theory. Inspired by this, we extend the conjecture of Costello and Li and place it within the setting of generalized geometry, conjecturing a description of the BV formulation of type I supergravity in general twisted backgrounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the theory of a higher-derivative (HD) real scalar field $\phi$ coupled to a complex scalar $\sigma$, the coupling of the $\phi$ and $\sigma$ being given by two types, $\lambda_{\sigma\phi}\sigma^\dagger \sigma\phi^{2}$ and $\xi_{\sigma\phi}\sigma^\dagger \sigma\left(\partial_{\mu}\phi\right)^{2}$. We evaluate $\phi$ one-loop corrections $\delta V(\sigma)$ to the effective potential of $\sigma$, both the contribution from the positive norm part of $\phi$ and that from the {\it negative norm part} (ghost). We show that $\delta V(\sigma_{\rm cl})$ at $\sigma_{\rm cl}\to \infty$, where $\sigma_{\rm cl}$ is a classical value of $\sigma$, is positive, implying the stability of $\delta V(\sigma_{\rm cl})$ by the HD 1-loop radiative corrections at high energy.</description>

      <title>The Gauge Theory Bootstrap: Predicting pion dynamics from QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gauge Theory Bootstrap [arXiv:2309.12402, arXiv:2403.10772] computes the strongly coupled pion dynamics by considering the most general scattering matrix, form factors and spectral densities and matching them with perturbative QCD at high energy and with weakly coupled pions at low energy. In this work, we show that further constraints on the spectral densities significantly reduce the possible solutions to a small set of qualitatively similar ones. Quantitatively, the precise solution is controlled by the asymptotic value of the form factors and SVZ sum rules. We also introduce an iterative procedure that, starting from a generic feasible point, converges to a unique solution parameterized by the UV input. For the converged solution we compute masses and widths of resonances that appear, scattering lengths and effective ranges of partial waves, low energy coefficients in the effective action. Additionally, we use these results to discuss the thermodynamics of a pion gas including pair correlations of pions with same and opposite charge.</description>

Abstract: We formulate the BCOV theory of deformations of complex structures as a pull-back to the super moduli space of the worldline of a spinning particle. In this approach the appearance of a non-local kinetic term in the target space action has the same origin as the mismatch of pictures in the Ramond sector of super string field theory and is resolved by the same type of auxiliary fields in shifted pictures. The BV-extension is manifest in this description. A compensator for the holomorphic 3-form can be included by resorting to a description in the large Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills Flux Tube in AdS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of flux tubes in confining gauge theories placed in a rigid AdS background, which serves as an infrared regulator. Varying the AdS radius from large to small allows us to interpolate between the flat space confining string, and a weakly coupled string-like object which is held together by the AdS gravitational potential. At any radius, the string preserves a subgroup of AdS isometries equivalent to the one-dimensional conformal group and hence, from the boundary point of view, can be thought of as a conformal defect. The defect hosts a protected operator, called displacement, which nonlinearly realizes the broken AdS isometries. At small radius the displacement corresponds to the gauge field strength inserted at the boundary, while at large radius it is mapped to the Goldstone mode living on the string worldsheet. This relates gauge field and worldsheet degrees of freedom. We propose a hypothesis according to which the large and small radius perturbative expansions can be smoothly matched with each other. As a test, we calculate the leading order corrections to the scaling dimensions and OPE coefficients of a set of defect operators at weak coupling in planar 3D Yang-Mills.</description>

Abstract: We develop the field space geometry of scalar-fermion effective field theories as a vector bundle supermanifold. We further establish a Fermi normal coordinate system on the bundle that clarifies the geometric content in scattering amplitudes, particularly the imprints of field space non-analyticities. Specializing to the Standard Model Higgs sector, we examine the geometric consequences of custodial symmetry violation, including implications for the physical Higgs field as a distinguished scalar axis and deformations in the fermionic sector. Our results enable a systematic and realistic geometric interpretation of Higgs sector phenomenology.</description>

      <title>A no-go theorem in bumblebee vector-tensor cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bumblebee models, a class of vector-tensor theories in which a vector field acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value that spontaneously breaks spacetime symmetries, are ubiquitous in the literature. By constructing the most general bumblebee action from all diffeomorphism-invariant marginal operators together with a general potential, aiming to cover all the bumblebee models studied in the literature, we perform a complete linear perturbation analysis on a spatially flat FLRW background. We show that for generic marginal couplings, the scalar sector propagates extra degrees of freedom beyond the single scalar expected for a massive vector. Enforcing the correct number of propagating modes in a cosmological setup forces degeneracy relations between the marginal couplings, which in turn completely fix the potential at the background level and render the remaining scalar infinitely strongly coupled already at linear order of perturbations. We establish a no-go theorem stating that the following conditions cannot be simultaneously satisfied: (i) the most general marginal action, (ii) a homogeneous and isotropic background, (iii) no extra propagating degrees of freedom around a spatially flat FLRW background, and (iv) healthy cosmological perturbations.</description>

      <title>How to get an interacting conformal line defect for free theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that interacting conformal line defects in free quantum field theories can exist, provided that inversion symmetry is broken. Important for our demonstration is the existence of a special cross ratio for bulk-defect-defect three point functions that is invariant under the conformal group but picks up a sign under inversion. We examine the particular case of a free scalar field in detail, and provide a toy model example where this bulk field interacts via a Yukawa term with fermions on the line. We expect nontrivial line defects may also exist for free Maxwell theory in four dimensions and free bulk fermions.</description>

      <title>A Soft Theorem from vertex-like operators in BFSS Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a soft theorem at leading and subleading orders within the context of BFSS matrix theory. Specifically, we consider the effective field theory describing interactions between bound states of D0-branes at leading order, which are dual to supergraviton interactions in the eleven-dimensional target space. This theory is obtained from BFSS theory by integrating out heavy degrees of freedom in the large-distance limit at one loop. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that when treated as a one-dimensional quantum field theory with a UV cutoff, the theory is super-renormalizable and all Feynman diagrams converge. Our main result shows that the theory admits vertex-like operators with the correct quantum numbers to represent supergravitons in target space and that their correlation functions exhibit soft factorisation at both leading and subleading orders.</description>

      <title>Scattering Gravitons off General Spinning Compact Objects to $\mathcal{O}(G^2 S^4)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the classical one-loop gravitational Compton amplitude describing the scattering of a graviton off a massive spinning compact object at the second post-Minkowskian order, including terms through the quartic order in spin. Our analysis includes spin-induced finite-size effects up to the hexadecapolar order, and extends recent results obtained for minimal couplings at the quadratic order in spin. From the amplitude, we determine the scattering phase in momentum space, applicable in both the eikonal and wave regimes. In the eikonal limit, we then isolate the spin-independent contribution of the graviton field, explicitly linking it to the dynamics of a massless scalar probe in a Kerr background. This constitutes the first complete description of classical one-loop Compton scattering for generic spinning compact objects at the second post-Minkowskian and hexadecapolar orders.</description>

      <title>Towards spinning $U(1)$ gauged non-topological solitons in the model with Chern-Simons term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain localized field configurations with finite energy in a ($2+1$)-dimensional model with Maxwell and Chern-Simons gauge terms coupled to a massive complex scalar field. These non-topological solitons are characterized by the $U(1)$ frequency and a winding number. Thus, the solutions possess Noether charge and non-trivial angular momentum, which is not quantized in contrast to the topological case. We study the solitons and their integral characteristics numerically and demonstrate that they are kinematically stable. The obtained solutions allow for the thin-wall approximation in some region of frequencies. For each winding number, the Noether charge has a lower bound that coincides with an isolated point, where the non-relativistic conformal symmetry seems to be restored.</description>

      <title>Integral constraints for $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills from a squashed sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersymmetric localization and Ward identities have been used in the past several years to derive two integral constraints on the four-point function of the stress-tensor multiplet in $\mathcal{N} = 4$ super-Yang-Mills theory. These constraints are powerful tools for studying the theory, especially when used in tandem with analytic and/or numerical bootstrap techniques. In this paper, we consider three additional integral constraints that can be derived starting from the $\mathcal{N} = 4$ super-Yang-Mills theory placed on a squashed four-sphere. These constraints are technically much more challenging to derive than the ones in the literature, and much of the paper is devoted to developing techniques to make this computation tractable. Our end result is that these three constraints are implied by the two constraints already appearing in the literature.</description>

      <title>$E$ and $J$ type $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ disordered models and higher-spin symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the emergence of higher-spin structure in 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ disordered models. While previous studies focused on the $J$-type model where the $E$-term in the Fermi multiplet was discarded. We extend the discussion to $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ disordered models with $E$-type potential. In terms of (disordered) $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ Landau-Ginzburg theory, we establish a duality between two models. By solving the Schwinger-Dyson equations and the ladder kernel matrix for 4-point functions, we verify that the $E$-type model is dynamically equivalent to the $J$-type model in the IR regime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the $E$-type model also exhibits emergent higher-spin symmetry in certain limits. Our results reveal a larger region of the moduli space of 2D $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ disordered theories and provides insights into the holographic transition from finite to tensionless strings that can be diagnosed by the emergence of higher-spin symmetries.</description>

      <title>Reheating and relic gravitational waves as remedies for degeneracies of non-canonical natural inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, a natural non-canonical inflationary model based on a power-law Lagrangian is investigated. We analyze the scalar spectral index $n_{\rm s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of the model and identify their degeneracies with respect to the free parameters. Notably, $n_{\rm s}$ and $r$ show effective independence from the model parameters due to degeneracies in the slow-roll parameters that leads to unresolved parameter degeneracies. Employing the constraints on reheating parameters such as the reheating duration $N_{\rm{reh}}$, the reheating temperature $T_{\rm{reh}}$, and the equation of state parameter $\omega_{\rm{reh}}$, is found to be insufficient to fully break these degeneracies. However, the relic gravitational wave spectrum provides a way to break degeneracy with respect to the non-canonical parameter $\alpha$, degeneracy with respect to the potential parameter $f$ persist. Finally, we specify the allowed ranges for the inflationary duration $N$ and the parameter $\alpha$, in light of the latest observational data. These results highlight the role of relic gravitational waves in refining inflationary models and illustrate the challenges in fully resolving parameter degeneracies.</description>

Abstract: The gravimagnetic dipole spacetime consists of two counter-rotating black holes of equal mass connected by a Misner string. For a particular distance in between them, the string is tensionless with the black holes at equilibrium with each other.
  The geodesics of relativistic massive, or massless particles are considered, leading to the identification of circular rotation trajectories. The velocities of these trajectories are computed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear radial stability of boson stars with a solitonic potential across the entire parameter space, focusing especially on families of solutions that support ultracompact models on the perturbatively stable branch. Using a dimensional reduction of the CCZ4 formulation of numerical relativity, we dynamically evolve these models with both internal and external perturbations. We find in particular that there are perturbatively stable models with positive binding energy that do not effectively disperse even under explicit perturbations, challenging the conventional wisdom that negative binding energy is a necessary condition for the dynamical stability of boson stars and other compact objects.</description>

      <title>Quantum Suppression of Mass Inflation in Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m Interiors via Wheeler-DeWitt Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a canonical quantization, the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, of the interior geometry of static and spherically symmetric black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$ framework, focusing on Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m. The wave function of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole is set to be on-shell and exhibiting exponential damping away from the classical locus. Horizon boundary conditions for the wave function generate two regimes: a single inward mode from event horizon yields monotonic decay, while superpositions produce either a quantum bounce (single time arrow) or interference-driven annihilation-to-nothing (two time arrows). We show that these are generic features of static black hole interiors. Furthermore, the wave function of the Schwarzschild black hole, obtained as the charge-neutral limit of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole, is monotonically decaying and no longer unbounded. Moreover, this framework unifies classical and quantum interiors, suggests a quantum gravitational suppression to the mass inflation, and motivates extensions to Kerr and regular black holes.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits and their gravitational waves in EMRIs: supermassive black hole affected by galactic dark matter halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits exhibiting zoom-whirl behavior have become attractive topics for studying particle dynamics and gravitational wave emission in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). This study systematically investigates periodic orbits around black holes and their gravitational wave radiation in three dark matter halo environments: NFW, Beta, and Moore models. The dark matter distribution in these models can be effectively incorporated using two parameters -- the dark matter characteristic mass and halo characteristic radius. Our results reveal that for a larger dark matter mass and a smaller characteristic radius, the shapes of the periodic orbits and the corresponding gravitational waveforms show more significant deviations from the Schwarzschild case. As the halo characteristic radius increases, the orbital shapes and waveform characteristics gradually converge with the Schwarzschild black hole results. Furthermore, our results also suggest that the NFW and Beta models produce nearly indistinguishable results, while the Moore model shows distinct signatures compared with Beta/NFW models. These findings deepen our understanding of dark matter halo effects on periodic motions and gravitational wave signatures.

      <description>arXiv:2512.05200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that extremal black holes can act as amplifiers of new physics, due to horizon instabilities that enhance the effects of ultraviolet corrections. In this paper, we revisit some of these claims and investigate the viability of a class of non-spherical extremal black holes. In particular, we revisit the regularity of perturbed extremal Reissner--Nordstr\"om AdS black holes showing that, while some certain components of the scalar stress energy tensor diverge, the backreaction remains finite. We also study geodesic completeness, identifying a simple geometric constraint which, if satisfied, ensures that null geodesics cross the horizon smoothly. This analysis suggests the existence of a broad class of spacetimes with regular non-spherical horizons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18637v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine classical radiation reaction by combining the covariant Lorentz--Dirac formulation, its Landau--Lifshitz (LL) order reduction, and a post-Newtonian (PN) Hamiltonian treatment of interacting and radiating charges. After reviewing the LL reduction and its removal of runaway and preacceleration behavior, we verify energy balance in several relativistic single-particle scenarios by demonstrating agreement between the LL Larmor power and the loss of mechanical energy. We then construct an N-body framework based on the conservative Darwin Hamiltonian supplemented with the leading 1.5PN radiation--reaction term. Numerical simulations of charge-neutral binary systems of both symmetric and asymmetric mass configurations show orbital decay, circularization, and monotonic Hamiltonian decrease consistent with dipole radiative losses. The resulting framework provides a simple analogue of gravitational PN radiation reaction and a tractable system for studying dissipative and potentially chaotic electromagnetic dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge-$4e$ superconductors are phases where quartets of electrons condense in the absence of Cooper pairing condensation. They exhibit distinctive signatures including fractional flux quantization and anomalous Josephson effects, and are actively being explored in strongly correlated systems, such as moir\'e materials. In this work we develop a general framework for topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors based on both wavefunction and field theory approaches. In particular, we generate topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors from charge-$2e$ ingredients, and by breaking the charge $U(1)$ symmetry in certain classes of quantum Hall states, in both spinless and spinful systems. Via bulk-edge correspondence, we further construct the corresponding edge conformal field theory and bulk topological quantum field theory for topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors that suggests fermionic nonabelian topological orders. Our results provide a unified low-energy description of the topological charge-$2ne$ superconductivity, offer a concrete platform for studying symmetry breaking and enrichment in interacting topological phases of matter, and have direct implications for experimental probes such as quasiparticle interferometry.</description>

      <title>Origin of the nucleon gravitational form factor $B_N(t)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent lattice QCD simulations and phenomenological models indicate that the nucleon's gravitational form factor $B_N(t)$ remains remarkably small at finite momentum transfer $t$. While $B_N(0) = 0$ is a known consequence of the equivalence principle, the physical origin of its suppression at finite $t$ has not been fully elucidated. In this work, we demonstrate that the smallness of $B_N(t)$ arises from a fundamental cancellation within the nucleon's wave functions. Using light-front holographic QCD, we show that $B_N(t)$ is governed by an antisymmetric factor in the longitudinal dynamics that leads to an exact vanishing in the symmetric limit and significant suppression for realistic nucleon structures. Our results suggest that the smallness of $B_N(t)$ is a signature of the nucleon's dominant S-wave character, providing a formal justification for its frequent omission in practical applications like near-threshold $J/\psi$ production.</description>

      <title>Strong CP and the QCD Axion: Lecture Notes via Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes provide a self-contained, graduate-level introduction to the strong $CP$ problem and QCD axion physics from an effective field theory (EFT) viewpoint. We review the construction of the chiral EFT of QCD yielding a $\theta$-dependent potential, from which vacuum alignment, $\theta$ periodicity and branch structure follow. We further show how the framework leads to the Witten-Veneziano relation highlighting the role of the pure-glue topological susceptibility in organizing $\theta$-dependent hadronic observables. Using these tools, we show how to extract representative $CP$-odd mesonic and baryonic amplitudes, including the chiral estimate underlying the neutron EDM bound, and how to generalize the effective framework to confining SU(N) theories with fermions in arbitrary representations. We further show how to employ the Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective Lagrangian for N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to extract salient information on the $\theta$-dependent physics of one-flavour QCD via orientifold planar equivalence. We also revisit a recent no strong $CP$ claim based on an ordering of limits in the sum over topological sectors and show, in the EFT language, that it amounts to introducing an extra non-propagating axion-like degree of freedom not required by QCD. We then present the standard dynamical resolution to the strong $CP$ problem, i.e. the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, the resulting axion potential and mass from chiral EFT and briefly review associated time-honored UV completions, and the axion quality problem from gravitational corrections.</description>

      <title>Resurrecting the coherent state variational algorithm for large $N$ gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The feasibility of studying, numerically, properties of infinite volume QCD-like theories in the large $N$ limit using coherent state variational methods is reassessed. An entirely new implementation of this approach is described, applicable to SU($N$) lattice gauge theories, with or without fundamental representation fermions, on cubic lattices of up to four dimensions. In addition to various test cases, initial results are presented for Hamiltonian Yang-Mills theory on an infinite two-dimensional spatial lattice.</description>
