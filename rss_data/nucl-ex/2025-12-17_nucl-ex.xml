      <title>Drell-Yan at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photon is arguably the most universally important particle across all fields of physics. Despite its status as a fundamental particle, at high energies the photon can be seen as a hadronic source of partons. The partonic content of the photon is very poorly constrained compared to that of the proton, with photon PDF uncertainties typically one or two orders of magnitude larger than their proton counterparts, despite the fact that its source, the $\gamma\to q\bar{q}$ splitting, is perturbatively calculable. The high luminosity, excellent particle identification, and far-backward electron tagging capabilities of the Electron-Ion Collider make it an ideal environment for studying photon parton distribution functions. Similar to the $p+p$ or $\pi+p$ systems, photoproduction at the EIC can be thought of as two parton distributions colliding. One of the most powerful processes in such collisions is production of lepton pairs, i.e. $h+p\rightarrow l^+l^-+X$, known as the Drell--Yan process. This process has the ability to access for the first time the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions of the photon. The transversely polarized proton beam of the EIC additionally provides a possible means of accessing the transversity distribution of the proton without relying on fragmentation functions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-preserving calculation of pion light-front wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poincar\'e-covariant Bethe-Salpeter wave functions are used to calculate light-front wave functions (LFWFs) of the pion, $\pi$, and an analogue state, $\pi_{s\bar s}$. The current masses of the degenerate valence constituents in the $\pi_{s\bar s}$ are around $25$-times larger than those of the pion's valence constituents. Both valence spin-antialigned ($\mathcal L=0$) and valence spin-aligned ($\mathcal L=1$) components are obtained and combined to produce the complete LFWF for each system. Comparing predictions delivered by two distinct Bethe-Salpeter kernels, the impact of nonperturbative dynamical effects contained in the more sophisticated (bRL) kernel are seen to be significant; and contrasts between $\pi$, $\pi_{s \bar s}$ results reveal the interplay between emergent hadron mass and mass effects owing to Higgs-boson couplings. Amongst the results, one finds that for $\pi$, $\pi_{s\bar s}$, the LFWFs can be approximated by a separable form, with that representation being pointwise reliable in the bRL cases. Moreover, the $\mathcal L=1$ component is important; so a LFWF obtained after omission of this piece is typically a poor representation of the system. These features are naturally expressed in $\pi$, $\pi_{s\bar s}$ transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs). In this connection, it is found that a Gaussian \textit{Ansatz} can only provide a rough guide to TMD pointwise behaviour: magnitude deviations between \textit{Ansatz} and prediction exceed a factor of two on $k_\perp^2 \gtrsim 0.55\,$GeV$^2$. One should therefore be cautious in interpreting conclusions drawn from phenomenological analyses based upon Gaussian \textit{Ans\"atze}.</description>

      <title>Impact of experimental mass of $^{70}$Kr on the $^{68}$Se waiting-point in $rp$-process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent mass measurement of $^{70}$Kr using the $B\rho$-defined isochronous mass spectrometry yields a mass excess of $-41320(140)$ keV, indicating a 220-keV increase in binding energy compared to the AME2020 prediction. We utilize this experimental mass -- the last piece of information needed -- to model the potential waiting point $^{68}$Se in $rp$-process and quantitatively constrain the sequential $p$-capture reaction flow bypassing this waiting point. Our investigation shows that the more tightly bound nature of $^{70}$Kr enhances this reaction flow up to a factor of four. This enhancement reduces the effective half-life of $^{68}$Se. {A} one-zone X-ray burst model calculations reveal that the higher flow of $^{70}$Kr has distinct effects on the tail structure of light curve and the final SnSbTe abundances in the ashes due to a stronger $rp$-process heating.</description>

      <title>Modeling Short-Range Nucleon Pair and Triplet Abundances in Atomic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short-range correlated (SRC) nucleon pairs provide a sensitive probe of the short-distance structure of atomic nuclei and the underlying nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction. We present a simple numerical method to estimate the number of two- and three-nucleon SRC clusters using an independent-particle shell model with a harmonic-oscillator basis. The relative abundances of proton-neutron (pn), proton-proton (pp), and neutron-neutron (nn) SRC pairs are calculated for Al, Fe, and Pb nuclei, normalized to carbon, and compared with existing analytical predictions and available extractions from experimental data. We extend the analysis to the isotopes 40Ca, 48Ca, and 54Fe (collectively, the CaFe nuclei), which have been recently measured but whose SRC results are not yet published. These isotopes provide insight into the role of 1f7/2 shell occupancy in SRC pair formation. Finally, we present a reference baseline for three-nucleon SRC cluster abundances across the studied nuclei, assuming 3N clusters originate from independent two-nucleon interactions. The predicted baseline is about 2.5% 3N-SRC/2N-SRC ratio for all medium and heavy nuclei. Deviations from this baseline may indicate the presence of additional short-range nuclear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Production of Light Nuclei in Au+Au Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 7.7-27$ GeV from STAR BES-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The studies of the production of light nuclei, such as deuteron and helium nuclei, in heavy-ion collisions are essential for understanding the dynamics of nuclear matter under extreme conditions. The yields and ratios of light nuclei serve as an effective method to distinguish between the thermal and coalescence models of light nuclei formation. Within the coalescence framework, the energy dependence of the coalescence parameters reflects the effective volume of the collision system, while in the thermal model yields are governed by chemical freeze-out conditions. The significantly larger datasets from the STAR Beam Energy Scan Phase II (BES-II), combined with enhanced detector capabilities, allow more precise and comprehensive measurements than phase I.
  In these proceedings, we present measurements of light nuclei production, including p, $\rm \bar{p}$, d, $\rm \bar{d}$, $\rm ^3He$, in Au+Au collisions at BES-II energies of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 7.7 - 27$ GeV. The results include centrality-dependent transverse momentum spectra and yields ($\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}y$), along with coalescence parameters $B_\mathrm{A}$ and particle yield ratios. The physics implications of these results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Jet momentum reconstruction in the QGP background with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply a Dense Neural Network (DNN) approach to reconstruct jet momentum within a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) background, using simulated data from PYTHIA and Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) Models for comparative analysis. We find that medium response particles from the LBT simulation, scattered out of the QGP background but belonging to medium-modified jets, lead to oversubtraction of the background if the DNN model is trained on vacuum jets from PYTHIA simulation. By training the DNN model on quenched jets generated using LBT or the combination of jet samples from PYTHIA and LBT, we significantly reduce this prediction bias and achieve more accurate background subtraction compared to conventional Area-based and Constituent Subtraction methods widely adopted in experimental measurements. We further study the performance of these machine learning models on evaluating the nuclear modification factor of jets, and find that while the unfolding procedure is necessary for correcting residuals in reconstructed jet momenta, models trained on samples incorporating quenched jets still achieve superior accuracy than those trained on vacuum jets even after unfolding.</description>
