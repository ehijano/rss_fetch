      <title>Piecewise linear circle maps and conjugation to rigid rational rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Criteria for piecewise linear circle homeomorphisms to be conjugate to a rigid rotation, $x\to x+\omega~({\rm mod}~1)$, with rational rotation number $\omega$ are given. The consequences of the existence of such maps in families of maps is considered and the results are illustrated using two examples: Herman's classic family of piecewise linear maps with two linear components, and a map derived from geometric optics which has four components. These results show how results for piecewise smooth circle homeomorphisms with irrational rotation numbers have natural correspondences with the case of rational rotation numbers for piecewise linear maps. In natural families of maps the existence of a parameter value at which the map is conjugate to a rigid rotation implies linear scaling of the rotation number in a neighbourhood of the critical parameter value and no mode-locked intervals, in contrast to the behaviour of generic families of circle maps.</description>

      <title>Precompactness notions in Kaplansky--Hilbert modules and extensions with discrete spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of our work on the functional-analytic core of the classical Furstenberg-Zimmer theory. We introduce and study (in the framework of lattice-ordered spaces) the notions of total order-boundedness and uniform total order-boundedness. Either one generalizes the concept of ordinary precompactness known from metric space theory. These new notions are then used to define and characterize "compact extensions" of general measure-preserving systems (with no restrictions on the underlying probability spaces nor on the acting groups). In particular, it is (re)proved that compact extensions and extensions with discrete spectrum are one and the same thing. Finally, we show that under natural hypotheses a subset of a Kaplansky-Banach module is totally order bounded if and only if it is cyclically compact (in the sense of Kusraev).</description>

      <title>Structure theorems of commuting transformations and minimal $\mathbb{R}$-flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop several structure theorems concerning commuting transformations and minimal $\mathbb{R}$-flows. Specifically, we show that if $(X,S)$, $(X,T)$ are minimal systems with $S$ and $T$ being commutative, then they possess an identical higher-order regionally proximal relation. Consequently, both $(X, S)$ and $(X, T)$ share the same increasing sequence of pro-nilfactors. For minimal $\mathbb{R}$-flows, we introduce the concept of higher-order regionally proximal relations and nilfactors, and establish that nilfactors are characteristic factors for minimal $\mathbb{R}$-flows, up to almost one to one extensions.</description>

      <title>Subshifts on groups and computable analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of subshifts on groups different from $\mathbb{Z}$, such as $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 2$, has been a subject of intense research in recent years. These investigations have unveiled aremarkable connection between dynamics and recursion theory. Different questions about the dynamics of these systems have been answered in recursion-theoretical terms. In this work we further explore this connection. We use the framework of computable analysis to explore the class of effective dynamical systems on metric spaces, and relate these systems to subshifts of finite type (SFTs) on groups. We prove that every effective dynamical system on a general metric space is the topological factor of an effective dynamical system with topological dimension zero. We combine this result with existing simulation results to obtain new examples of systems that are factors of SFTsWe also study a conjugacy invariant for subshifts on groups called Medvedev degree. This invariant is a complexity measure of algorithmic nature. We develop the basic theory of these degrees for subshifts on arbitrary finitely generated groups. Using these tools we are able to classify the values that this invariant attains for SFTs and other classes of subshifts on several groups. Furthermore, we establish a connection between these degrees and the distribution of isolated points in the space of all subshifts. Motivated by the study of Medvedev degrees of subshifts, we also consider translation-like actions of groups on graphs. We prove that every connected, locally finite, and infinite graph admits a translation by $\mathbb{Z}$, and that this action can be chosen transitive exactly when the graph has one or two ends. This generalizes a result of Seward about translation-like actions of $\mathbb{Z}$ on finitely generated groups.</description>

      <title>A Garden of Eden theorem for Smale spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a dynamical system $(X,f)$ consisting of a compact metrizable space $X$ and a homeomorphism $f \colon X \to X$, an endomorphism of $(X,f)$ is a continuous map of $X$ into itself which commutes with $f$. One says that a dynamical system $(X,f)$ is surjunctive if every injective endomorphism of $(X,f)$ is surjective. An endomorphism of $(X,f)$ is called pre-injective if its restriction to each $f$-homoclinicity class of $X$ is injective. One says that a dynamical system has the Moore property if every surjective endomorphism of the system is pre-injective and that it has the Myhill property if every pre-injective endomorphism is surjective. One says that a dynamical system satisfies the Garden of Eden theorem if it has both the Moore and the Myhill properties. We prove that every irreducible Smale space satisfies the Garden of Eden theorem and that every non-wandering Smale space is surjunctive and has the Moore property.</description>

      <title>Separatrix configurations in holomorphic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of boundary orbits (separatrices) of basins of simple equilibria and global elliptic sectors in holomorphic flows with real time. We elucidate whether a blow-up scenario provides an appropriate characterization of separatrices. The continuity of transit times along the boundaries of open, flow-invariant subsets, which we establish in this paper, acts as the central tool in deriving the following three main results: First, we prove that the boundary of basins of centers is entirely composed of double-sided separatrices (blow-up in finite positive and finite negative time). Second, we show that boundary orbits of node and focus basins exhibit finite-time blow-up in the same time direction in which the orbits within the basin tend towards the equilibrium. Additionally, we provide a counterexample to the claim in Theorem 4.3 (3) in [The structure of sectors of zeros of entire flows, K. Broughan (2003)], demonstrating that such a blow-up does not necessarily have to occur in both time directions. Third, we describe the boundary structure of global elliptic sectors. It consists of the multiple equilibrium, one incoming and one outgoing separatrix attached to it, and at most countably many double-sided separatrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the shift space of $1$-Lipschitz functions from $\mathbb{R}^k$ to the unit interval is a topological model for all free measurable $\mathbb{R}^k$-flows. This generalizes a theorem from 1973 by Eberlein for $\mathbb{R}$-flows. For $k\geq 2$ the proof relies on an $\mathbb{R}^k$-generalization of a Lipschitz refinement of the Bebutov--Kakutani theorem proven by Gutman, Jin and Tsukamoto. A separate expository proof of Eberlein's theorem ($k=1$) is included (differing from the original proof).</description>

      <title>Analysis of COVID-19 Infection Dynamics: Extended SIR Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a detailed mathematical investigation into the dynamics of COVID-19 infections through extended Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiological models. By incorporating demographic factors such as birth and death rates, we enhance the classical Kermack-McKendrick framework to realistically represent long-term disease progression. Using empirical data from four COVID-19 epidemic waves in Orange County, California, between January 2020 and March 2022, we estimate key parameters and perform stability and bifurcation analyses. Our results consistently indicate endemic states characterized by stable spiral equilibria due to reproduction numbers (R0) exceeding unity across all waves. Additionally, the inclusion of vaccination demonstrates the potential to reduce the effective reproduction number below one, shifting the system towards a stable disease-free equilibrium. Our analysis underscores the critical role of latency periods in shaping epidemic dynamics and highlights actionable insights for public health interventions aimed at COVID-19 control and eventual eradication.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Lie-Hamilton systems: $t$-Dependent curved oscillators and Kepler-Coulomb Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lie-Hamilton approach for $t$-dependent Hamiltonians is extended to cover the so-called nonlinear Lie-Hamilton systems, which are no longer related to a linear $t$-dependent combination of a basis of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra of functions $\mathcal{W}$, but an arbitrary $t$-dependent function on $\mathcal{W}$. This novel formalism is accomplished through a detailed analysis of related structures, such as momentum maps and generalized distributions, together with the extension of the Poisson coalgebra method to a $t$-dependent frame, in order to systematize the construction of constants of the motion for nonlinear systems. Several relevant relations between nonlinear Lie-Hamilton systems, Lie-Hamilton systems, and collective Hamiltonians are analyzed. The new notions and tools are illustrated with the study of the harmonic oscillator, H\'enon-Heiles systems and Painlev\'e trascendents within a $t$-dependent framework. In addition, the formalism is carefully applied to construct oscillators with a $t$-dependent frequency and Kepler-Coulomb systems with a $t$-dependent coupling constant on the $n$-dimensional sphere, Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, as well as on some spaces of non-constant curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the well-posedness and long-time behavior of a general continuum neural field model with Gaussian noise on possibly unbounded domains. In particular, we give conditions for the existence of invariant probability measures by restricting the solution flow to an invariant subspace with a nonlocal metric. Under the assumption of a sufficiently large decay parameter relative to the noise intensity, the growth of the connectivity kernel, and the Lipschitz regularity of the activation function, we establish exponential ergodicity and exponential mixing of the associated Markovian Feller semigroup and the uniqueness of the invariant measure with second moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let A be an evolution algebra (possibly infinite-dimensional) equipped with a fixed natural basis B, and let E be the associated graph defined by Elduque and Labra. We describe the group of automorphisms of A that are diagonalizable with respect to B. This group arises as the inverse limit of a functor (a diagram) from the category associated with the graph E to the category of groups. In certain cases, this group can be realized as a dyadic solenoid. Additionally, we investigate the automorphisms that permute (and possibly scale) the elements of B. In particular, for algebras satisfying the 2LI condition, we provide a complete description of their automorphism group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We will construct ``higher-dimensional" versions of the Wiener-Wintner dynamical system that was originally studied by I. Assani in 2003. We will show that on these systems we can provide very simple proofs of the a.e. convergence of the multiple recurrence averages, as well as the multiple recurrence return times averages. We will do so by obtaining a quantitative control of the multiple ergodic averages by extending the estimate for the double recurrence that was attained by J. Bourgain. We will also observe that this class of dynamical systems contains numerous examples that are not bounded by the standard classifications (e.g. entropy, mixing), such as Kolmogorov systems, classical skew products, as well as systems for which the a.e. convergence of multiple recurrence is not currently known. Along our way, we will also provide alternative characteristics of the Host-Kra-Ziegler factors from the point of view of the uniform Wiener-Wintner theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A smooth conservative DA-diffeomorphism is smoothly conjugated to its Anosov linear part if and only if all Lyapunov exponents coincide almost everywhere with those of its linear part. A more general result for entropy maximizing measures of $C^{1+\alpha}$ partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms isotopic to Anosov (DA-diffeomorphisms) on $T^3$ is that they are SRB measures if and only if the sum of its positive Lyapunov exponents coincides with that of the linear Anosov map on all periodic orbits of the support of the measure. In that case, the measure is also the unique physical measure. This rigidity result is not as strong as in the A. Katok rigidity conjecture. Examples are provided.</description>

Abstract: We study the Dirichlet dynamical zeta function $\eta_D(s)$ for billiard flow corresponding to several strictly convex disjoint obstacles. For large ${\rm Re}\: s$ we have $\eta_D(s) =\sum_{n= 1}^{\infty} a_n e^{-\lambda_n s}, \: a_n \in \mathbb R$ and $\eta_D$ admits a meromorphic continuation to $\mathbb C$. We obtain some conditions of the frequencies $\lambda_n$ and some sums of coefficients $a_n$ which imply that $\eta_D$ cannot be prolonged as entire function.</description>

      <title>$L^q$ approximate controllability frequency criterion for linear difference delay equations with distributed delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on an algebraic point of view and the realization theory developed by Y. Yamamoto, the present paper states a necessary and sufficient criterion, given in the frequency domain, for the $L^q$ approximate controllability in finite time of linear difference delay equations with distributed delays. Furthermore, an upper bound for the minimal time of the $L^q$ approximate controllability is obtained.</description>

      <title>Uniform estimates for random matrix products and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For certain natural families of topologies, we study continuity and stability of statistical properties of random walks on linear groups over local fields. We extend large deviation results known in the Archimedean case to non-Archimedean local fields and also demonstrate certain large deviation estimates for heavy tailed distributions unknown even in the Archimedean case. A key technical result, which may be of independent interest, establishes lower semi-continuity for the gap between the first and second Lyapunov exponents. As applications, we are able to obtain a key technical step towards a localization proof for heavy tailed Anderson models (the full proof appearing in a companion article), and show continuity/stability (taking the geometric data as input) of various statistical data associated to hyperbolic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Counting totally real units and eigenvalue patterns in $\rm{SL}_n(\mathbb Z)$ and $\rm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb Z)$ along thin tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fix a vector $(v=(v_1,\dots ,v_n)$ with $v_1&gt;\cdots&gt;v_n$ and $\sum v_i=0$, and let $B_\varepsilon(Tv)$ be the $\varepsilon$-ball around $Tv$ for $T&gt;1$. As $T\to\infty$, (1) the number of degree-$n$ totally real units whose logarithmic embeddings lie in $B_\varepsilon(Tv)$, and (2) the number of eigenvalue patterns of $\rm{SL}_n(\mathbb Z)$ whose logarithmic embeddings lie in $B_\varepsilon(Tv)$, both grow like $$\exp\left(\rho_{\rm{SL}_n}(v)\,T\right)$$ where $ \rho_{\rm{SL}_n}(v)=\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(n-i)\,v_i$ is the half-sum of positive roots of $\rm{SL}_n(\mathbb R)$. Hence the two arithmetic problems share the same "directional entropy". Because each eigenvalue pattern determines an $\rm{SL}_n(\mathbb R)$-conjugacy class, this yields a lower bound of order $\exp\left(\rho_{\rm{SL}_n}(v)T\right)$ for the number of $\rm{SL}_n(\mathbb Z)$-conjugacy classes with a prescribed eigenvalue pattern; we also obtain an upper bound of order $\exp \left(2\rho_{\rm{SL}_n}(v)T\right)$. A parallel argument for the symplectic lattice $\rm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb Z)$ and $v=(v_1,\dots ,v_n,-v_n,\dots ,-v_1), v_1&gt;\cdots&gt;v_n&gt;0,$ gives growth $\exp\left(\rho_{\rm{Sp}_{2n}}(v)T\right)$ with $\rho_{\rm{Sp}_{2n}}(v)=\sum_{i=1}^n(n+1-i)v_i$, the half-sum of positive roots of $\rm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb R)$.</description>
