      <title>StarCast: A Secure and Spectrum-Efficient Group Communication Scheme for LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks serve as a cornerstone infrastructure for providing ubiquitous connectivity in areas where terrestrial infrastructure is unavailable. With the emergence of Direct-to-Cell (DTC) satellites, these networks can provide direct access to mobile phones and IoT devices without relying on terrestrial base stations, leading to a surge in massive connectivity demands for the serving satellite. To address this issue, group communication is an effective paradigm that enables simultaneous content delivery to multiple users and thus optimizes bandwidth reuse. Although extensive research has been conducted to improve group communication performance, securing this communication without compromising its inherent spectrum efficiency remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce StarCast, a secure group encryption scheme for LEO satellite networks. Our solution leverages ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) to implement fine-grained access control by embedding access policies directly within the ciphertext. Unlike standard secure communication approaches that require dedicated per-user channels and significantly deplete limited satellite spectrum resources, StarCast maintains efficient spectrum reuse within user groups while ensuring that only authorized users can access transmitted data. Additionally, it significantly reduces the costly key management overhead associated with conventional encryption schemes.</description>

      <title>Energy-as-a-Service for RF-Powered IoE Networks: A Percolation Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the involved massive number of devices, radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting is indispensable to realize the foreseen Internet-of-Everything (IoE) within 6G networks. Analogous to the cellular networks concept, shared energy stations (ESs) are foreseen to supply energy-as-a-service (EaaS) in order to recharge devices that belong to different IoE operators who are offering diverse use cases. Considering the capital expenditure (CAPEX) for ES deployment along with their finite wireless energy transfer (WET) zones, spatial energy gaps are plausible. Furthermore, the ESs deployment cannot cover 100% of the energy-harvesting devices of all coexisting IoE use cases. In this context, we utilize percolation theory to characterize the feasibility of large-scale device-to-device (D2D) connectivity of IoE networks operating under EaaS platforms. Assuming that ESs and IoE devices follow independent Poisson point processes (PPPs), we construct a connectivity graph for the IoE devices that are within the WET zones of ESs. Continuum percolation on the construct graph is utilized to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for large-scale RF-powered D2D connectivity in terms of the required IoE device density and communication range along with the required ESs density and WET zone size. Fixing the IoE network parameters along with the size of WET zones, we obtain the approximate critical value of the ES density that ensures large-scale connectivity using the inner-city and Gilbert disk models. By imitating the bounds and combining the approximations, we construct an approximate expression for the critical ES density function, which is necessary to minimize the EaaS CAPEX under the IoE connectivity constraint.</description>

      <title>Connectivity of LEO Satellite Mega Constellations: An Application of Percolation Theory on a Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of the 6G era, global connectivity has become a common goal in the evolution of communications, aiming to bring Internet services to more unconnected regions. Additionally, the rise of applications such as the Internet of Everything and remote education also requires global connectivity. Non-terrestrial networks (NTN), particularly low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, play a crucial role in this future vision. Although some literature already analyze the coverage performance using stochastic geometry, the ability of generating large-scale continuous service area is still expected to analyze. Therefore, in this paper, we mainly investigate the necessary conditions of LEO satellite deployment for large-scale continuous service coverage on the earth. Firstly, we apply percolation theory to a closed spherical surface and define the percolation on a sphere for the first time. We introduce the sub-critical and super-critical cases to prove the existence of the phase transition of percolation probability. Then, through stereographic projection, we introduce the tight bounds and closed-form expression of the critical number of LEO satellites on the same constellation. In addition, we also investigate how the altitude and maximum slant range of LEO satellites affect percolation probability, and derive the critical values of them. Based on our findings, we provide useful recommendations for companies planning to deploy LEO satellite networks to enhance connectivity.</description>

      <title>The MoE-Empowered Edge LLMs Deployment: Architecture, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The powerfulness of LLMs indicates that deploying various LLMs with different scales and architectures on end, edge, and cloud to satisfy different requirements and adaptive heterogeneous hardware is the critical way to achieve ubiquitous intelligence for 6G. However, the massive parameter scale of LLMs poses significant challenges in deploying them on edge devices due to high computational and storage demands. Considering that the sparse activation in Mixture of Experts (MoE) is effective on scalable and dynamic allocation of computational and communications resources at the edge, this paper proposes a novel MoE-empowered collaborative deployment framework for edge LLMs, denoted as CoEL. This framework fully leverages the properties of MoE architecture and encompasses four key aspects: Perception, Deployment, Compression, and Updating. Edge servers broadcast their resource status and the specific resource requirements of LLMs to their neighbors. Then, utilizing this data, two sophisticated deployment strategies are proposed for satisfying varying model scales, ensuring that each model is deployed effectively. One for deploying LLMs on a single edge device through intra-device resource collaboration, and another for a distributed deployment across multiple edge devices via inter-device resource collaboration. Furthermore, both the models and the intermediate data are compressed for reducing memory footprint by quantization and reducing the volume of intermediate data by token fusion and pruning. Finally, given the dynamic of network topology, resource status, and user requirements, the deployment strategies are regularly updated to maintain its relevance and effectiveness. This paper also delineates the challenges and potential research directions for the deployment of edge LLMs.</description>

      <title>Testbed Development: An Intelligent O-RAN based Cell-Free MIMO Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free multiple input multiple output (CF-MIMO) systems improve spectral and energy efficiencies using distributed access points (APs) to provide reliable service across an area equivalent to multiple conventional cells. This paper presents a novel design and implementation of a CF-MIMO network leveraging the open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture based testbed to enhance the performance of interference-prone user. The proposed prototype is developed based on open source software components and unlike many other prototypes, our testbed is able to serve commercial 5G user equipment (UE). The RAN intelligent controller (RIC) allows the cell-free (CF) network to access the embedded artificial intelligence and benefit from the network optimisation techniques that O-RAN brings. The testbed includes an intelligent antenna association xApp which determines the antenna group that serves each UE based on the live key performance measurements. The paper demonstrates the deployment and operation of the CF network and the xApp and discusses how the CF networks can benefit from the O-RAN architecture.</description>

      <title>The Forest Behind the Tree: Revealing Hidden Smart Home Communication Patterns via Strategic Traffic Blocking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network-connected Smart Home devices are becoming increasingly common, creating potential security and privacy risks. Previous research has shown these devices follow predictable network communication patterns, allowing researchers to model their normal network behavior and detect potential security breaches. However, existing approaches only observe traffic passively rather than actively trying to disturb it. We present a framework that generates comprehensive network signatures for Smart Home devices by systematically blocking previously observed traffic patterns to reveal new, hidden patterns that other methods miss. These signatures are structured as behavior trees, where each child node represents network flows that occur when the parent node's traffic is blocked. We applied this framework on ten real-world devices under 26 usage scenarios, discovering 138 unique flows, of which 27 (20%) are information gained through our multi-level tree approach, compared to state-of-the-art single-level traffic analysis.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models such as LLMs, GPTs, and Diffusion Models have recently gained widespread attention from both the research and the industrial communities. This survey explores their application in network monitoring and management, focusing on prominent use cases, as well as challenges and opportunities. We discuss how network traffic generation and classification, network intrusion detection, networked system log analysis, and network digital assistance can benefit from the use of GenAI models. Additionally, we provide an overview of the available GenAI models, datasets for large-scale training phases, and platforms for the development of such models. Finally, we discuss research directions that potentially mitigate the roadblocks to the adoption of GenAI for network monitoring and management. Our investigation aims to map the current landscape and pave the way for future research in leveraging GenAI for network monitoring and management.</description>

      <title>Future Resource Bank for ISAC: Achieving Fast and Stable Win-Win Matching for Both Individuals and Coalitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future wireless networks must support emerging applications where environmental awareness is as critical as data transmission. Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) enables this vision by allowing base stations (BSs) to allocate bandwidth and power to mobile users (MUs) for communications and cooperative sensing. However, this resource allocation is highly challenging due to: (i) dynamic resource demands from MUs and resource supply from BSs, and (ii) the selfishness of MUs and BSs. To address these challenges, existing solutions rely on either real-time (online) resource trading, which incurs high overhead and failures, or static long-term (offline) resource contracts, which lack flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Future Resource Bank for ISAC, a hybrid trading framework that integrates offline and online resource allocation through a level-wise client model, where MUs and their coalitions negotiate with BSs. We introduce two mechanisms: (i) Role-Friendly Win-Win Matching (offRFW$^2$M), leveraging overbooking to establish risk-aware, stable contracts, and (ii) Effective Backup Win-Win Matching (onEBW$^2$M), which dynamically reallocates unmet demand and surplus supply. We theoretically prove stability, individual rationality, and weak Pareto optimality of these mechanisms. Through simulations, we show that our framework improves social welfare, latency, and energy efficiency compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Take What You Need: Flexible Multi-Task Semantic Communications with Channel Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for efficient semantic communication systems capable of managing diverse tasks and adapting to fluctuating channel conditions has driven the development of robust, resource-efficient frameworks. This article introduces a novel channel-adaptive and multi-task-aware semantic communication framework based on a masked auto-encoder architecture. Our framework optimizes the transmission of meaningful information by incorporating a multi-task-aware scoring mechanism that identifies and prioritizes semantically significant data across multiple concurrent tasks. A channel-aware extractor is employed to dynamically select relevant information in response to real-time channel conditions. By jointly optimizing semantic relevance and transmission efficiency, the framework ensures minimal performance degradation under resource constraints. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our framework compared to conventional methods in tasks such as image reconstruction and object detection. These results underscore the framework's adaptability to heterogeneous channel environments and its scalability for multi-task applications, positioning it as a promising solution for next-generation semantic communication networks.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Stable Matching between Workers and Time-Dependent Tasks for Dynamic MCS: A Stagewise Service Trading Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing proper incentives in mobile crowdsensing (MCS) networks represents a critical mechanism in engaging distributed mobile users (workers) to contribute heterogeneous data for diverse applications (tasks). We develop a novel stagewise trading framework to reach efficient and stable matching between tasks and workers, upon considering the diversity of tasks and the dynamism of MCS networks. This framework integrates futures and spot trading stages, where in the former, we propose futures trading-driven stable matching and pre-path-planning (FT-SMP^3) for long-term task-worker assignment and pre-planning of workers' paths based on historical statistics and risk analysis. While in the latter, we investigate spot trading-driven DQN path planning and onsite worker recruitment (ST-DP^2WR) mechanism to enhance workers' and tasks' practical utilities by facilitating temporary worker recruitment. We prove that our proposed mechanisms support crucial properties such as stability, individual rationality, competitive equilibrium, and weak Pareto optimality theoretically. Also, comprehensive evaluations confirm the satisfaction of these properties in practical network settings, demonstrating our commendable performance in terms of service quality, running time, and decision-making overheads.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: FlexRDZ is an online, autonomous manager for radio dynamic zones (RDZ) that seeks to enable the safe operation of RDZs through real-time control of deployed test transmitters. FlexRDZ leverages Hierarchical Task Networks and digital twin modeling to plan and resolve RDZ violations in near real-time. We prototype FlexRDZ with GTPyhop and the Terrain Integrated Rough Earth Model (TIREM). We deploy and evaluate FlexRDZ within a simulated version of the Salt Lake City POWDER testbed, a potential urban RDZ environment. Our simulations show that FlexRDZ enables up to a 20 dBm reduction in mobile interference and a significant reduction in the total power of leaked transmissions while preserving the overall communication capabilities and uptime of test transmitters. To our knowledge, FlexRDZ is the first autonomous system for RDZ management.</description>

      <title>Offline to Online Learning for Real-Time Bandwidth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13481v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time video applications require accurate bandwidth estimation (BWE) to maintain user experience across varying network conditions. However, increasing network heterogeneity challenges general-purpose BWE algorithms, necessitating solutions that adapt to end-user environments. While widely adopted, heuristic-based methods are difficult to individualize without extensive domain expertise. Conversely, online reinforcement learning (RL) offers ease of customization but neglects prior domain expertise and suffers from sample inefficiency. Thus, we present Merlin, an imitation learning-based solution that replaces the manual parameter tuning of heuristic-based methods with data-driven updates to streamline end-user personalization. Our key insight is that transforming heuristic-based BWE algorithms into neural networks facilitates data-driven personalization. Merlin utilizes Behavioral Cloning to efficiently learn from offline telemetry logs, capturing heuristic policies without live network interactions. The cloned policy can then be seamlessly tailored to end user network conditions through online finetuning. In real intercontinental videoconferencing calls, Merlin matches our heuristic's policy with no statistically significant differences in user quality of experience (QoE). Finetuning Merlin's control policy to end-user environments enables QoE improvements of up to 7.8% compared to the heuristic policy. Lastly, our IL-based design performs competitively with current state-of-the-art online RL techniques but converges with 80% fewer videoconferencing samples, facilitating practical end-user personalization.</description>

      <title>Joint Mobile IAB Node Positioning and Scheduler Selection in Locations With Substantial Obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) in cellular networks combines access and backhaul within a wireless infrastructure reducing reliance on fibre-based backhaul. This enables faster and more cost-effective network expansion, especially in hard-to-reach areas. Positioning a mobile IAB node (MIAB) in a seaport environment, in order to ensure ondemand, resilient wireless connectivity, presents unique challenges due to the high density of User Equipments (UEs) and potential shadowing effects caused by obstacles. This paper addresses the problem of positioning MIABs within areas containing UEs, IAB donors (CFs), and obstacles. Our approach considers user associations and different types of scheduling, ensuring MIABs and CFs meet the capacity requirements of a special team of served UEs, while not exceeding backhaul capacity. Using Genetic Algorithm (GA) solver, we achieve capacity improvement gains, by up to 200% for the 90th percentile. The proposed solution improves network performance, particularly during emergency capacity demands.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Video Analytics in Cloud-Edge-Terminal Collaborative Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The explosive growth of video data has driven the development of distributed video analytics in cloud-edge-terminal collaborative (CETC) systems, enabling efficient video processing, real-time inference, and privacy-preserving analysis. Among multiple advantages, CETC systems can distribute video processing tasks and enable adaptive analytics across cloud, edge, and terminal devices, leading to breakthroughs in video surveillance, autonomous driving, and smart cities. In this survey, we first analyze fundamental architectural components, including hierarchical, distributed, and hybrid frameworks, alongside edge computing platforms and resource management mechanisms. Building upon these foundations, edge-centric approaches emphasize on-device processing, edge-assisted offloading, and edge intelligence, while cloud-centric methods leverage powerful computational capabilities for complex video understanding and model training. Our investigation also covers hybrid video analytics incorporating adaptive task offloading and resource-aware scheduling techniques that optimize performance across the entire system. Beyond conventional approaches, recent advances in large language models and multimodal integration reveal both opportunities and challenges in platform scalability, data protection, and system reliability. Future directions also encompass explainable systems, efficient processing mechanisms, and advanced video analytics, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in this dynamic field.</description>

Abstract: The sixth generation of wireless networks envisions intelligent and adaptive environments capable of meeting the demands of emerging applications such as immersive extended reality, advanced healthcare, and the metaverse. However, this vision requires overcoming critical challenges, including the limitations of conventional wireless technologies in mitigating path loss and dynamically adapting to diverse user needs. Among the proposed reconfigurable technologies, pinching antenna systems (PASs) offer a novel way to turn path loss into a programmable parameter by using dielectric waveguides to minimize propagation losses at high frequencies. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive analytical framework that derives closed-form expressions for the outage probability and average rate of PASs while incorporating both free-space path loss and waveguide attenuation under realistic conditions. In addition, we characterize the optimal placement of pinching antennas to maximize performance under waveguide losses. Numerical results show the significant impact of waveguide losses on system performance, especially for longer waveguides, emphasizing the importance of accurate loss modeling. Despite these challenges, PASs consistently outperform conventional systems in terms of reliability and data rate, underscoring their potential to enable high-performance programmable wireless environments.</description>

      <title>EDM: An Ultra-Low Latency Ethernet Fabric for Memory Disaggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08300</link>

Abstract: Achieving low remote memory access latency remains the primary challenge in realizing memory disaggregation over Ethernet within the datacenters. We present EDM that attempts to overcome this challenge using two key ideas. First, while existing network protocols for remote memory access over the Ethernet, such as TCP/IP and RDMA, are implemented on top of the MAC layer, EDM takes a radical approach by implementing the entire network protocol stack for remote memory access within the Physical layer (PHY) of the Ethernet. This overcomes fundamental latency and bandwidth overheads imposed by the MAC layer, especially for small memory messages. Second, EDM implements a centralized, fast, in-network scheduler for memory traffic within the PHY of the Ethernet switch. Inspired by the classic Parallel Iterative Matching (PIM) algorithm, the scheduler dynamically reserves bandwidth between compute and memory nodes by creating virtual circuits in the PHY, thus eliminating queuing delay and layer 2 packet processing delay at the switch for memory traffic, while maintaining high bandwidth utilization. Our FPGA testbed demonstrates that EDM's network fabric incurs a latency of only $\sim$300 ns for remote memory access in an unloaded network, which is an order of magnitude lower than state-of-the-art Ethernet-based solutions such as RoCEv2 and comparable to emerging PCIe-based solutions such as CXL. Larger-scale network simulations indicate that even at high network loads, EDM's average latency remains within 1.3$\times$ its unloaded latency.</description>
