      <title>Topological $\Delta G$ homology of rings with twisted $G$-action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a unifying framework for studying variants of topological Hochschild homology such as Real topological Hochschild homology. Associated to a crossed simplicial group $\Delta G$, a category that generalizes Connes' cyclic category, we introduce an invariant of rings with twisted $G$-action, which we call topological $\Delta G$-homology. Here a ring with twisted $G$-action is a common generalization of a ring with involution and a ring with $G$-action.
  Our construction provides homotopical analogues of quaternionic homology, symmetric homology, braid homology, and hyperoctahedral homology defined by Fiedorowicz--Loday. In the quaternionic case our construction, called quaternionic topological Hochschild homology, is equipped with a left Pin(2)-action and we compute it for loop spaces with a twisted $C_4$-action. As an important step along the way, we introduce a new family of crossed simplicial groups called the twisted symmetric crossed simplicial groups and we prove that they corresponds to operads for algebras with twisted $G$-action.</description>

      <title>Deformation maps in proto-twilled Leibniz algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to find a unified approach to studying the cohomology theories of various operators on Leibniz algebras. We first introduce deformation maps in a proto-twilled Leibniz algebra to do this. Such maps generalize various well-known operators (such as homomorphisms, derivations, crossed homomorphisms, Rota-Baxter operators, modified Rota-Baxter operators, twisted Rota-Baxter operators, Reynolds operators etc) defined on Leibniz algebras and embedding tensors on Lie algebras. We define the cohomology of a deformation map unifying the existing cohomologies of all the operators mentioned above. Then we construct a curved $L_\infty$-algebra whose Maurer-Cartan elements are precisely deformation maps in a given proto-twilled Leibniz algebra. In particular, we get the Maurer-Cartan characterizations of modified Rota-Baxter operators, twisted Rota-Baxter operators and Reynolds operators on a Leibniz algebra. Finally, given a proto-twilled Leibniz algebra and a deformation map $r$, we construct two governing $L_\infty$-algebras, the first one controls the deformations of the operator $r$ while the second one controls the simultaneous deformations of both the proto-twilled Leibniz algebra and the operator $r$.</description>

      <title>A [Chern] character defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cohomology rings of tiling spaces $\Omega$ given by cubical substitutions. While there have been many calculations before of cohomology groups of such tiling spaces, the innovation here is that we use computer-assisted methods to compute the cup-product structure. This leads to examples of substitution tilings with isomorphic cohomology groups but different cohomology rings. Part of the interest in studying the cup product comes from Bellissard's gap-labeling conjecture, which is known to hold in dimensions $\le 3$, but where a proof is known in dimensions $\ge 4$ only when the Chern character from $K^0(\Omega)$ to $H^*(\Omega,\mathbb{Q})$ lands in $H^*(\Omega,\mathbb{Z})$. Computation of the cup product on cohomology often makes it possible to compute the Chern character. We introduce a natural generalization of the gap-labeling conjecture, called the equivariant gap-labeling conjecture, which applies to tilings with a finite symmetry group. Again this holds in dimensions $\le 3$, but we are able to show that it fails in general in dimensions $\ge 4$. This, plus some of our cup product calculations, makes it plausible that the gap-labeling conjecture might fail in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Equivariant K-theory, affine Grassmannian and perfection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study torus-equivariant algebraic $K$-theory of affine Schubert varieties in the perfect affine Grassmannians over $\mathbb{F}_p$. We further compare it to the torus-equivariant Hochschild homology of perfect complexes, which has a geometric description in terms of global functions on certain fixed-point schemes. We prove that $\mathbb{F}_p$-linearly, this comparison is an isomorphism. Our approach is quite constructive, resulting in new computations of these $K$-theory rings. We establish various structural results for equivariant perfect algebraic $K$-theory on the way; we believe these are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjecture for spaces that admit an A-by-FCE coarse fibration structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a concept of A-by-FCE coarse fibration structure for metric spaces, which serves as a generalization of the A-by-CE structure for a sequence of group extensions proposed by Deng, Wang, and Yu. We prove that the maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjecture holds for metric spaces with bounded geometry that admit an A-by-FCE coarse fibration structure. As an application, the relative expanders constructed by Arzhantseva and Tessera, as well as the box spaces derived from an ``amenable-by-Haagerup'' group extension, admit the A-by-FCE coarse fibration structure. Consequently, the maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjecture holds for these spaces, which may not admit an FCE structure, i.e. fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space.</description>
