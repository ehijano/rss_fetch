      <title>Hybrid Models for Financial Forecasting: Combining Econometric, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research systematically develops and evaluates various hybrid modeling approaches by combining traditional econometric models (ARIMA and ARFIMA models) with machine learning and deep learning techniques (SVM, XGBoost, and LSTM models) to forecast financial time series. The empirical analysis is based on two distinct financial assets: the S&amp;P 500 index and Bitcoin. By incorporating over two decades of daily data for the S&amp;P 500 and almost ten years of Bitcoin data, the study provides a comprehensive evaluation of forecasting methodologies across different market conditions and periods of financial distress. Models' training and hyperparameter tuning procedure is performed using a novel three-fold dynamic cross-validation method. The applicability of applied models is evaluated using both forecast error metrics and trading performance indicators. The obtained findings indicate that the proper construction process of hybrid models plays a crucial role in developing profitable trading strategies, outperforming their individual components and the benchmark Buy&amp;Hold strategy. The most effective hybrid model architecture was achieved by combining the econometric ARIMA model with either SVM or LSTM, under the assumption of a non-additive relationship between the linear and nonlinear components.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of financial data differentiation techniques using LSTM neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare traditional approach of computing logarithmic returns with the fractional differencing method and its tempered extension as methods of data preparation before their usage in advanced machine learning models. Differencing parameters are estimated using multiple techniques. The empirical investigation is conducted on data from four major stock indices covering the most recent 10-year period. The set of explanatory variables is additionally extended with technical indicators. The effectiveness of the differencing methods is evaluated using both forecast error metrics and risk-adjusted return trading performance metrics. The findings suggest that fractional differentiation methods provide a suitable data transformation technique, improving the predictive model forecasting performance. Furthermore, the generated predictions appeared to be effective in constructing profitable trading strategies for both individual assets and a portfolio of stock indices. These results underline the importance of appropriate data transformation techniques in financial time series forecasting, supporting the application of memory-preserving techniques.</description>
