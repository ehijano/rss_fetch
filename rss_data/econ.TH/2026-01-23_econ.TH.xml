      <title>Ecosystem Competition and Cross-Market Subsidization: A Dynamic Theory of Platform Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Platform giants in China have operated with persistently compressed margins in highly concentrated markets for much of the past decade, despite market shares exceeding 60\% in core segments. Standard theory predicts otherwise: either the weaker firm exits, or survivors raise prices to monopoly levels. We argue the puzzle dissolves once firms are viewed as ecosystem optimizers rather than single-market profit maximizers. We develop a dynamic game in which a firm's willingness to subsidize depends on the spillover value its users generate in adjacent markets -- what we call \textit{ecosystem complementarity}. When this complementarity is strong enough, perpetual below-cost pricing emerges as the unique stable equilibrium. The result is not predation in the classical sense; there is no recoupment phase. It is a permanent state of subsidized competition, rational for each firm individually but potentially inefficient in aggregate. We characterize the equilibrium, establish its dynamic stability, and show that welfare losses compound over time as capital flows into subsidy wars rather than innovation. The model's predictions are consistent with observed patterns in Chinese platform markets and suggest that effective antitrust intervention should target cross-market capital flows rather than prices.</description>

      <title>Pairwise Beats All-at-Once: Behavioral Gains from Sequential Choice Presentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the Sequential Rationality Hypothesis, which argues that consumers are better able to make utility-maximizing decisions when products appear in sequential pairwise comparisons rather than in simultaneous multi-option displays. Although this involves higher cognitive costs than the all-at-once format, the current digital market, with its diverse products listed by review ratings, pricing, and paid products, often creates inconsistent choices. The present work shows that preparing the list sequentially supports more rational choice, as the consumer tries to minimize cognitive costs and may otherwise make an irrational decision. If the decision remains the same on both offers, then that is a consistent preference. The platform uses this approach by reducing cognitive costs while still providing the list in an all-at-once format rather than sequentially. To show how sequential exposure reduces cognitive overload and prevents context-dependent errors, we develop a bounded attention model and extend the monotonic attention rule of the random attention model to theorize the sequential rational hypothesis. Using a theoretical design with common consumer goods, we test these hypotheses. This theoretical model helps policymakers in digital market laws, behavioral economics, marketing, and digital platform design consider how choice architectures may improve consumer choices and encourage rational decision-making.</description>

      <title>Bundling and Price-Matching in Competitive Complementary Goods Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mixed bundling and competitive price-matching guarantees (PMGs) in a duopoly selling complementary products to heterogeneous customers. One retailer offers mixed bundling while the rival sells only a bundle. We characterize unique pure-strategy Nash equilibria across subgames and compare them to a no-bundling benchmark. Mixed bundling strictly dominates whenever an equilibrium exists. Conditional on bundling, PMG adoption trades off strategic demand capture against margin losses on loyal customers and varies systematically with relative demand responsiveness to prices and complementarities.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Welfare-Maximizing Decisions via Endogenous Transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many multiagent systems rely on collective decision-making among self-interested agents, which raises deep questions about coalition formation and stability. We study social choice with endogenous, outcome-contingent transfers, where agents voluntarily form contracts that redistribute utility depending on the collective decision, allowing fully strategic, incentive-aligned coalition formation. We show that under consensus rules, individually rational strong Nash equilibria (IR-SNE) always exist, implementing welfare-maximizing outcomes with feasible transfers, and provide a simple, efficient algorithm to construct them. For more general anonymous, monotonic, and resolute rules, we identify necessary conditions for profitable deviations, sharply limiting destabilizing coalitions. By bridging cooperative and noncooperative perspectives, our approach shows that transferable utility can achieve core-like stability, restoring efficiency and budget balance even where classical impossibility results apply. Overall, this framework offers a practical and robust way to coordinate large-scale strategic multiagent systems.</description>

      <title>Screening for Choice Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a screening problem in which an agent privately observes a set of feasible technologies and can strategically disclose only a subset to the principal. The principal then takes an action whose payoff consequences for both players are publicly known. Under the assumption that the possible technology sets are ordered by set inclusion, we show that the optimal mechanism promises the agent a utility that is weakly increasing as the reported set expands, and the choice of the principal maximizes her own utility subject to this promised utility constraint. Moreover, the optimal promised utility either coincides with the agent's utility under the complete information benchmark or remains locally constant, with the number of constant segments bounded by the number of downward-sloping segments of the complete information benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I propose a new approach to solving standard screening problems when the monotonicity constraint binds. A simple geometric argument shows that when virtual values are quasi-concave, the optimal allocation can be found by appropriately truncating the solution to the relaxed problem. I provide an algorithm for finding this optimal truncation when virtual values are concave.</description>

      <title>Misperception and informativeness in statistical discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interplay of information and prior (mis)perceptions in a Phelps-Aigner-Cain-type model of statistical discrimination in the labor market. We decompose the effect on average pay of an increase in how informative observables are about workers' skills into a non-negative instrumental component, reflecting increased surplus due to better matching of workers with tasks, and a perception-correcting component capturing how extra information diminishes the importance of prior misperceptions about the distribution of skills in the worker population. We sign the perception-correcting term: it is non-negative (non-positive) if the population was ex-ante under-perceived (over-perceived). We then consider the implications for pay gaps between equally-skilled populations that differ in information, perceptions, or both, and identify conditions under which improving information narrows pay gaps.</description>

      <title>The comparative statics of dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In finite problems comprising objects, situations, and an object- and situation-contingent payoff function, we study the comparative statics of the set of undominated objects, meaning those for which there exists no mixture over objects that is superior whatever the situation. We consider both weak and strict dominance (corresponding to different degrees of 'strictness' in the definition of superiority). Our main theorem characterises those payoff transformations which robustly expand the not-weakly-dominated and not-strictly-dominated sets: the necessary and sufficient condition is that payoffs be transformed separately across situations, in either a monotone-concave or a constant manner. We apply our results to Pareto frontiers and games.</description>

      <title>An $\Omega(\log(N)/N)$ Lookahead is Sufficient to Bound Costs in the Overloaded Loss Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study the simplest model of revenue management with reusable resources: admission control of two customer classes into a loss queue. This model's long-run average collected reward has two natural upper bounds: the deterministic relaxation and the full-information offline problem. With these bounds, we can decompose the costs faced by the online decision maker into (i) the \emph{cost of variability}, given by the difference between the deterministic value and the offline value, and (ii) the \emph{cost of uncertainty}, given by the difference between the offline value and the online value. \cite{Xie2025} established that the sum of these two costs is $\Theta(\log N)$, as the number of servers, $N$, goes to infinity. I show that we can entirely attribute this $\Theta(\log N)$ rate to the cost of uncertainty, as the cost of variability remains $O(1)$ as $N \rightarrow \infty$. In other words, I show that anticipating future fluctuations is sufficient to bound operating costs -- smoothing out these fluctuations is unnecessary. In fact, I show that an $\Omega(\log(N)/N)$ lookahead window is sufficient to bound operating costs.</description>

      <title>The Subtlety of Optimal Paternalism in a Population with Bounded Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the subtlety of optimal paternalism when a utilitarian planner has the power to design a discrete choice set for a heterogeneous population with bounded rationality. We first consider the planning problem in abstraction. We show that the policy that most effectively constrains or influences choices depends multiplicatively on the preferences of the population and the choice probabilities conditional on preferences that measure the suboptimality of behavior. We then study two settings in which the planner may mandate an action or decentralize decision making. One setting supposes that individuals measure utility with additive random error and maximize mismeasured rather than actual utility. Then optimal planning requires knowledge of the distribution of measurement errors. The other setting studies binary treatment choice when the planner can mandate a treatment conditional on publicly observed personal covariates or can enable individuals to choose their own treatments conditional on private information. Here we focus on situations where bounded rationality takes the form of deviations between subjective and objective probabilities of uncertain outcomes. To illustrate, we consider clinical decision making in medicine. In toto, our cautionary analysis shows that determination of optimal policy requires the planner to possess extensive knowledge that is rarely available. We warn that research in behavioral public economics should avoid overoptimistic claims regarding the nature of optimal paternalistic policies. We argue that credible study of utilitarian planning should consider not only the population but also the planner to be boundedly rational.</description>

      <title>Bipartiteness in Progressive Second-Price Multi-Auction Networks with Perfect Substitute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a bipartite network of buyers and sellers, where the sellers run locally independent Progressive Second-Price (PSP) auctions, and buyers may participate in multiple auctions, forming a multi-auction market with perfect substitute. The paper develops a projection-based influence framework for decentralized PSP auctions. We formalize primary and expanded influence sets using projections on the active bid index set and show how partial orders on bid prices govern allocation, market shifts, and the emergence of saturated one-hop shells. Our results highlight the robustness of PSP auctions in decentralized environments by introducing saturated components and a structured framework for phase transitions in multi-auction dynamics. This structure ensures deterministic coverage of the strategy space, enabling stable and truthful embedding in the larger game. We further model intra-round dynamics using an index to capture coordinated asynchronous seller updates coupled through buyers' joint constraints. Together, these constructions explain how local interactions propagate across auctions and gives premise for coherent equilibria--without requiring global information or centralized control.</description>
