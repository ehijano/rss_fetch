      <title>Understanding the chemical and structural variability in the efficiency of band edge optical transitions of 2D monolayer materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted a high-throughput density functional theory calculation and comprehensive analysis of the momentum matrix elements between the band edges across a wide range of nonmagnetic two-dimensional monolayer materials with direct band gaps. The primary objectives of our study were twofold: (i) to identify and rank the materials as potential optical emitters and (ii) to enhance our understanding of the physical and chemical factors that determine the strength of the optical coupling. The momentum matrix elements range from nearly 0 to 1.13 at.u., depending on the specific structure and composition of the materials. By comparison, the most prominent group III-V bulk semiconductors have momentum matrix elements on the order of 1 at.u., indicating the high potential of two-dimensional monolayer materials as optical emitters. We applied a criterion derived from the atomic orbital selection rules for electronic transitions. Finally, we examined the prominent family of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, which exhibited high optical coupling and low criterion values. We propose a connection between the significant contribution to the momentum matrix elements for interband optical transitions and the anomalous Born effective charge phenomena. The implications of this phenomenon are such that, unlike materials that exhibit conventional Born effective charges, in which increased ionicity leads to diminished optical coupling. If the anomalous situation is present, it arises from a distinctive charge transfer and bonding mechanism, resulting in a positive correlation between ionicity and the optical coupling.</description>

      <title>Scientific Machine Learning Seismology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific machine learning (SciML) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates machine learning, particularly deep learning, with physics theory to understand and predict complex natural phenomena. By incorporating physical knowledge, SciML reduces the dependency on observational data, which is often limited in the natural sciences. In this article, the fundamental concepts of SciML, its applications in seismology, and prospects are described. Specifically, two popular methods are mainly discussed: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators (NOs). PINNs can address both forward and inverse problems by incorporating governing laws into the loss functions. The use of PINNs is expanding into areas such as simultaneous solutions of differential equations, inference in underdetermined systems, and regularization based on physics. These research directions would broaden the scope of deep learning in natural sciences. NOs are models designed for operator learning, which deals with relationships between infinite-dimensional spaces. NOs show promise in modeling the time evolution of complex systems based on observational or simulation data. Since large amounts of data are often required, combining NOs with physics-informed learning holds significant potential. Finally, SciML is considered from a broader perspective beyond deep learning: statistical (or mathematical) frameworks that integrate observational data with physical principles to model natural phenomena. In seismology, mathematically rigorous Bayesian statistics has been developed over the past decades, whereas more flexible and scalable deep learning has only emerged recently. Both approaches can be considered as part of SciML in a broad sense. Theoretical and practical insights in both directions would advance SciML methodologies and thereby deepen our understanding of earthquake phenomena.</description>

      <title>Strain-tunable Dirac semimetal phase transition and emergent superconductivity in a borophane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A two-dimensional (2D) Dirac semimetal with concomitant superconductivity has been long sought but rarely reported. It is believed that light-element materials have the potential to realize this goal owing to their intrinsic lightweight and metallicity. Here, based on the recently synthesized $\beta_{12}$ hydrogenated borophene [Science 371, 1143 (2021)], we investigate its counterpart named $\beta_{12}$-$ \rm {B_5H_3}$. Our first-principles calculations suggest it has good stability. $\beta_{12}$-$ \rm {B_5H_3}$ is a scarce Dirac semimetal demonstrating a strain-tunable phase transition from three Dirac cones to a single Dirac cone. Additionally, $\beta_{12}$-$ \rm {B_5H_3}$ is also a superior phonon-mediated superconductor with a superconducting critical temperature of 32.4 K and can be further boosted to 42 K under external strain. The concurrence of Dirac fermions and superconductivity, supplemented with dual tunabilities, reveals $\beta_{12}$-$ \rm {B_5H_3}$ is an attractive platform to study either quantum phase transition in 2D Dirac semimetal or the superconductivity or the exotic physics brought about by their interplay.</description>

      <title>Robustness of AI-based weather forecasts in a changing climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven machine learning models for weather forecasting have made transformational progress in the last 1-2 years, with state-of-the-art ones now outperforming the best physics-based models for a wide range of skill scores. Given the strong links between weather and climate modelling, this raises the question whether machine learning models could also revolutionize climate science, for example by informing mitigation and adaptation to climate change or to generate larger ensembles for more robust uncertainty estimates. Here, we show that current state-of-the-art machine learning models trained for weather forecasting in present-day climate produce skillful forecasts across different climate states corresponding to pre-industrial, present-day, and future 2.9K warmer climates. This indicates that the dynamics shaping the weather on short timescales may not differ fundamentally in a changing climate. It also demonstrates out-of-distribution generalization capabilities of the machine learning models that are a critical prerequisite for climate applications. Nonetheless, two of the models show a global-mean cold bias in the forecasts for the future warmer climate state, i.e. they drift towards the colder present-day climate they have been trained for. A similar result is obtained for the pre-industrial case where two out of three models show a warming. We discuss possible remedies for these biases and analyze their spatial distribution, revealing complex warming and cooling patterns that are partly related to missing ocean-sea ice and land surface information in the training data. Despite these current limitations, our results suggest that data-driven machine learning models will provide powerful tools for climate science and transform established approaches by complementing conventional physics-based models.</description>

      <title>On Adaptive Frequency Sampling for Data-driven MOR Applied to Antenna Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency domain sweeps of array antennas are well-known to be time-intensive, and different surrogate models have been used to improve the performance. Data-driven model order reduction algorithms, such as the Loewner framework and vector fitting, can be integrated with these adaptive error estimates, in an iterative algorithm, to reduce the number of full-wave simulations required to accurately capture the requested frequency behavior of multiport array antennas. In this work, we propose two novel adaptive methods exploiting a block matrix function which is a key part of the Loewner framework generating system approach. The first algorithm leverages an inherent matrix parameter freedom in the block matrix function to identify frequency points with large errors, whereas the second utilizes the condition number of the block matrix function. Both methods effectively provide frequency domain error estimates, essential for improved performance. Numerical experiments on multiport array antenna S-parameters demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms within the Loewner framework.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Thermodynamic Foundation of the Grand-potential Phase Field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Choosing the correct free energy functional is critical when developing thermodynamically-consistent phase field models. We show that the grand-potential phase field model minimizes the Helmholtz free energy. While both functionals are at a minimum at equilibrium, the Helmholtz free energy decreases monotonically with time in the grand-potential phase field model, whereas the grand potential does not. Minimizing the grand potential implies a different problem where a system can exchange mass with its surroundings at every point, leading to a condition of iso-chemical-potential and invalidating mass conservation of the system.</description>

      <title>A multi-ion non-equilibrium solver for ionised astrophysical plasmas with arbitrary elemental abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While many astrophysical plasmas can be modelled successfully assuming ionisation and thermal equilibrium, in some cases this is not appropriate and a non-equilibrium approach is required. In nebulae around evolved stars the local elemental abundances may also strongly vary in space and time. Here we present a non-equilibrium multi-ion module developed for the fluid-dynamics code \textsc{pion}, describing the physical processes included and demonstrating its capabilities with some test calculations. A non-equilbrium ionisation solver is developed that allows arbitrary elemental abundances for neutral and ionised (but not molecular) gas, for the elements H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Si, S and Fe. Collisional ionisation and recombination, photoionisation and charge-exchange reactions are included, and ion-by-ion non-equilibrium radiative cooling is calculated based on the instantaneous ion fractions of each element. Element and ion mass-fractions are advected using passive scalars, operator-split from the microphysical processes. The module is validated by comparing with equilibrium and non-equilibrium calculations in the literature. Effects of charge exchange on ion abundances in cooling plasmas are discussed. Application to modelling shocks and photoionised H~\textsc{ii} regions is demonstrated. The time-dependent expansion of a Wolf-Rayet nebula is studied, including photoionisation and collisional processes, and spectral-line luminosities calculated for non-equilibrium and equilibrium plasma states. The multi-ion module enables simulation of ionised plasmas with spatially varying elemental abundances using self-consistent ion abundances and thermal evolution. This allows prediction of spectral lines in UV, optical, IR and X-ray even in cases where the plasma is out of ionisation equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Generalised tangent stabilised nonlinear elasticity: An automated framework for controlling material and geometric instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tangent stabilised large strain isotropic elasticity was recently proposed by Poya et al. [1] wherein by working directly with principal stretches the entire eigenstructure of constitutive and geometric/initial stiffness terms were found in closed-form, giving fresh insights into exact convexity conditions of highly non-convex functions in discrete settings. Consequently, owing to these tangent eigenvalues an analytic tangent stabilisation was proposed bypassing incumbent numerical approaches routinely used in nonlinear finite element analysis. This formulation appears to be extremely robust for quasi-static simulation of complex deformations even with no load increments and time stepping while still capturing instabilities automatically in ways that are infeasible for path-following techniques in practice. In this work, we generalise the notion of tangent stabilised elasticity to virtually all known invariant formulations of nonlinear elasticity. We show that, closed-form eigen-decomposition of tangents is easily available irrespective of invariant formulation or integrity basis. In particular, we work out closed-form tangent eigensystems for isotropic Total Lagrangian deformation gradient (F )-based and right Cauchy-Green (C)-based as well as Updated Lagrangian left Cauchy-Green (b)-based formulations and present their exact convexity conditions postulated in terms of their corresponding tangent and initial stiffness eigenvalues. In addition, we introduce the notion of geometrically stabilised polyconvex large strain elasticity for models that are materially stable but exhibit geometric instabilities for whom we construct their initial stiffness in a spectrally-decomposed form analytically. We further extend this framework to the case of transverse isotropy where once again, closed-form tangent eigensystems are found for common transversely isotropic invariants.</description>

      <title>Improving the convergence of an iterative algorithm for solving arbitrary linear equation systems using classical or quantum binary optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing and quantum-inspired algorithms have sparked renewed interest in binary optimization. These hardware and software innovations promise to revolutionize solution times for complex problems. In this work, we propose a novel method for solving linear systems. Our approach leverages binary optimization, making it particularly well-suited for problems with large condition numbers. We transform the linear system into a binary optimization problem, drawing inspiration from the geometry of the original problem and resembling the conjugate gradient method. This approach employs conjugate directions that significantly accelerate the algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by leveraging partial knowledge of the problem's intrinsic geometry, we can decompose the original problem into smaller, independent sub-problems. These sub-problems can be efficiently tackled using either quantum or classical solvers. While determining the problem's geometry introduces some additional computational cost, this investment is outweighed by the substantial performance gains compared to existing methods.</description>

Abstract: For the solution of time-dependent nonlinear differential equations, we present variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) that encode both space and time in qubit registers. The spacetime encoding enables us to obtain the entire time evolution from a single ground-state computation. We describe a general procedure to construct efficient quantum circuits for the cost function evaluation required by VQAs. To mitigate the barren plateau problem during the optimization, we propose an adaptive multigrid strategy. The approach is illustrated for the nonlinear Burgers equation. We classically optimize quantum circuits to represent the desired ground-state solutions, run them on IBM Q System One and Quantinuum System Model H1, and demonstrate that current quantum computers are capable of accurately reproducing the exact results.</description>

      <title>LUCIE: A Lightweight Uncoupled ClImate Emulator with long-term stability and physical consistency for O(1000)-member ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a lightweight, easy-to-train, low-resolution, fully data-driven climate emulator, LUCIE, that can be trained on as low as $2$ years of $6$-hourly ERA5 data. Unlike most state-of-the-art AI weather models, LUCIE remains stable and physically consistent for $100$ years of autoregressive simulation with $100$ ensemble members. Long-term mean climatology from LUCIE's simulation of temperature, wind, precipitation, and humidity matches that of ERA5 data, along with the variability. We further demonstrate how well extreme weather events and their return periods can be estimated from a large ensemble of long-term simulations. We further discuss an improved training strategy with a hard-constrained first-order integrator to suppress autoregressive error growth, a novel spectral regularization strategy to better capture fine-scale dynamics, and finally an optimization algorithm that enables data-limited (as low as $2$ years of $6$-hourly data) training of the emulator without losing stability and physical consistency. Finally, we provide a scaling experiment to compare the long-term bias of LUCIE with respect to the number of training samples. Importantly, LUCIE is an easy to use model that can be trained in just $2.4$h on a single A-100 GPU, allowing for multiple experiments that can explore important scientific questions that could be answered with large ensembles of long-term simulations, e.g., the impact of different variables on the simulation, dynamic response to external forcing, and estimation of extreme weather events, amongst others.</description>

      <title>A Novel Quantum-Classical Hybrid Algorithm for Determining Eigenstate Energies in Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing efficient quantum computing algorithms is essential for tackling computationally challenging problems across various fields. This paper presents a novel quantum algorithm, XZ24, for efficiently computing the eigen-energy spectra of arbitrary quantum systems. Given a Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ and an initial reference state $|\psi_{\text{ref}} \rangle$, the algorithm extracts information about $\langle \psi_{\text{ref}} | \cos(\hat{H} t) | \psi_{\text{ref}} \rangle$ from an auxiliary qubit's state. By applying a Fourier transform, the algorithm resolves the energies of eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with significant overlap with the reference wavefunction.
  We provide a theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, showing XZ24's superior efficiency and accuracy compared to existing algorithms. XZ24 has three key advantages:
  1. It removes the need for eigenstate preparation, requiring only a reference state with non-negligible overlap, improving upon methods like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver. 2. It reduces measurement overhead, measuring only one auxiliary qubit. For a system of size $L$ with precision $\epsilon$, the sampling complexity scales as $O(L \cdot \epsilon^{-1})$. When relative precision $\epsilon$ is sufficient, the complexity scales as $O(\epsilon^{-1})$, making measurements independent of system size. 3. It enables simultaneous computation of multiple eigen-energies, depending on the reference state.
  We anticipate that XZ24 will advance quantum system simulations and enhance applications in quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking of quantum fidelity kernels for Gaussian process regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing algorithms have been shown to produce performant quantum kernels for machine-learning classification problems. Here, we examine the performance of quantum kernels for regression problems of practical interest. For an unbiased benchmarking of quantum kernels, it is necessary to construct the most optimal functional form of the classical kernels and the most optimal quantum kernels for each given data set. We develop an algorithm that uses an analog of the Bayesian information criterion to optimize the sequence of quantum gates used to estimate quantum kernels for Gaussian process models. The algorithm increases the complexity of the quantum circuits incrementally, while improving the performance of the resulting kernels, and is shown to yield much higher model accuracy with fewer quantum gates than a fixed quantum circuit ansatz. We demonstrate that quantum kernels thus obtained can be used to build accurate models of global potential energy surfaces (PES) for polyatomic molecules. The average interpolation error of the six-dimensional PES obtained with a random distribution of 2000 energy points is 16 cm$^{-1}$ for H$_3$O$^+$, 15 cm$^{-1}$ for H$_2$CO and 88 cm$^{-1}$ for HNO$_2$. We show that a compositional optimization of classical kernels for Gaussian process regression converges to the same errors. This indicates that quantum kernels can achieve the same, though not better, expressivity as classical kernels for regression problems.</description>

Abstract: Strong $E\times B$ plasma flow shear is beneficial for reducing turbulent transport. However, traditional methods of driving flow shear do not scale well to large devices such as future fusion power plants. In this paper, we use a large number of nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations to study a novel approach to increase flow shear: decreasing the momentum diffusivity to make the plasma ``easier to push''. We first use an idealized circular geometry and find that one can obtain low momentum diffusivity at tight aspect ratio, low safety factor, high magnetic shear and low temperature gradient. This is the so-called Low Momentum Diffusivity (LMD) regime. To drive intrinsic momentum flux, we then tilt the flux surface, making it up-down asymmetric. In the LMD regime, this intrinsic momentum flux drives strong flow shear that can significantly reduce the heat flux and increase the critical temperature gradient. We also consider the actual experimental geometry of the MAST tokamak to illustrate that this strategy can be practical and create experimentally significant flow shear. Lastly, a preliminary prediction for the SMART tokamak is made.</description>
