      <title>Terrestrial space weather protection through human-produced mass-loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While humans become more reliant on Earth's space environment, the potential for significant harm from severe space weather continues to grow. As structures from the sun reach Earth's magnetosphere and space environment, they deposit energy that fuels geomagnetic storms. Currently, space weather researchers work to predict the timing and intensity of space weather events, often providing warnings of several days prior to the initiation of a strong geomagnetic storm. Here a new paradigm is presented where, rather than prediction, active steps are taken to mitigate the impact of solar wind structures through temporarily modifying Earth's magnetosphere. Global magnetohydrodynamic simulations are used to demonstrate that artificial mass-loading Earth's dayside magnetosphere can fortify Earth's space environment against strong space weather events. The simulations and supporting analysis use realistic mass-loading from model spacecraft at geosynchronous orbit to show the validity of the enabling physics as well as technical feasibility with current technology. The results demonstrate that with modern technology, the intensity of a major geomagnetic storm could be actively reduced by 50 percent or more, protecting technology and human life.</description>

      <title>Granular jamming and rheology in microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how granular materials behave in low gravity is crucial for planetary science and space exploration. It can also help us understand granular phenomena usually hidden by gravity. On Earth, gravity dominates granular behavior, but disentangling its role from intrinsic particle interactions is challenging. We present a series of compression and shear experiments conducted in microgravity using the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM) drop tower and GraviTower Bremen (GTB). Our in-house developed experimental setup enables precise measurement of packing density and in-situ shear stress via a Taylor-Couette rheometer. We find that the jamming transition occurs at lower packing density in microgravity than on Earth, confirming that gravity promotes densification. Rheological measurements further reveal that in microgravity, the lack of a secondary force field and predominance of cohesive interparticle forces increase the stress needed for granular media to flow. These findings highlight gravity's dual role in enhancing both compaction and flow, and demonstrate the need for tailored granular models, valid in low- and microgravity environments.</description>
