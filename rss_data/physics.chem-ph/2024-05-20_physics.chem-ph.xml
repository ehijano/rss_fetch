      <title>Heisenberg dynamics of mixed quantum-classical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of interacting quantum and classical systems in the Heisenberg representation. Unlike the usual construction in standard quantum mechanics, mixed quantum-classical systems involve the interplay of unitary operators acting on the quantum observables and the Lagrangian trajectories sweeping the classical degrees of freedom. This interplay reflects an intricate structure which is made particularly challenging by the backreaction excerpted on the classical trajectories by the quantum degrees of freedom. While the backreaction is underestimated in the common Ehrenfest model, more recent methodologies succeed in capturing this important effect by resorting to Koopman wavefunctions in classical mechanics. Luckily, both Ehrenfest and Koopman models enjoy a variational framework which is exploited here to unfold the geometric structure underlying quantum-classical coupling. A special role is played by the action of the diffeomorphic Lagrangian paths on a non-Abelian pure-gauge potential which comprises statistical correlations. After presenting the treatment in the simple case of Ehrenfest dynamics, we move on to the Koopman model and present the role of the backreaction terms therein. Finally, we compare both models in the context of pure-dephasing systems.</description>

      <title>Limitations of the rate-distribution formalism in describing luminescence quenching in the presence of diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When encountering complex fluorescence decays that deviate from exponentiality, a very appealing and powerful approach is to use lifetime (or equivalent rate constant) distributions. These are related by Laplace transform to multi-exponential functions, stretched exponentials, Becquerel's law, and others. In the case of bimolecular quenching, time-independent probability distributions of the rate constants have occasionally been used. Here we show that this mathematical formalism has a clear physical interpretation only when the fluorophore and quencher molecules are immobile, as in the solid state. However, such an interpretation is no longer possible once we consider the motion of fluorophores with respect to quenchers. Therefore, for systems in which the relative motion of fluorophores and quenchers cannot be neglected, it is not appropriate to use the time-independent continuous reaction rate or decay time distributions to describe, fit, or rationalize experimental results.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic transfer learning methodology to expedite high fidelity simulation of reactive flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced order models based on the transport of a lower dimensional manifold representation of the thermochemical state, such as Principal Component (PC) transport and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, have been developed to reduce the computational cost associated with the Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of reactive flows. Both PC transport and ML normally require an abundance of data to exhibit sufficient predictive accuracy, which might not be available due to the prohibitive cost of DNS or experimental data acquisition. To alleviate such difficulties, similar data from an existing dataset or domain (source domain) can be used to train ML models, potentially resulting in adequate predictions in the domain of interest (target domain). This study presents a novel probabilistic transfer learning (TL) framework to enhance the trust in ML models in correctly predicting the thermochemical state in a lower dimensional manifold and a sparse data setting. The framework uses Bayesian neural networks, and autoencoders, to reduce the dimensionality of the state space and diffuse the knowledge from the source to the target domain. The new framework is applied to one-dimensional freely-propagating flame solutions under different data sparsity scenarios. The results reveal that there is an optimal amount of knowledge to be transferred, which depends on the amount of data available in the target domain and the similarity between the domains. TL can reduce the reconstruction error by one order of magnitude for cases with large sparsity. The new framework required 10 times less data for the target domain to reproduce the same error as in the abundant data scenario. Furthermore, comparisons with a state-of-the-art deterministic TL strategy show that the probabilistic method can require four times less data to achieve the same reconstruction error.</description>

      <title>Using Partial Structure R1 to Determine Small-Molecule Crystal Structures at the Lowest Resolution Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the lowest data resolution at which the partial structure R1 (pR1) method can determine a small-molecule crystal structure. Three specific structures have been studied. For a structure having 4 S atoms out of total 32 atoms in its unit cell, the lowest structure-solvable resolution is 1.5 A, and at this resolution all the atoms are individually searchable by the sR1 method (a specialized form of the pR1 method in which the partial structure contains a single atom). For the other two samples, which have 46 and 156 C atoms in their unit cells, respectively, the lowest structure-solvable resolutions are 1.5 A and 1.2 A, respectively, and both require a combination of the pR1 and the sR1 methods to determine their structures at these resolution limits. In all three cases, the usual choice of method for solving a small-molecule crystal structure, namely, the SHELXT program, is not applicable. Therefore, the pR1 method complements the SHELXT for determination of a small-molecule crystal structure at these lowest resolution limits.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty and Exploration of Deep Learning-based Atomistic Models for Screening Molten Salt Properties and Compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to extreme chemical, thermal, and radiation environments, existing molten salt property databases lack the necessary experimental thermal properties of reactor-relevant salt compositions. Meanwhile, simulating these properties directly is typically either computationally expensive or inaccurate. In recent years, deep learning (DL)-based atomistic simulations have emerged as a method for achieving both efficiency and accuracy. However, there remain significant challenges in assessing model reliability in DL models when simulating properties and screening new systems. In this work, structurally complex LiF-NaF-ZrF$_4$ salt is studied. We show that neural network (NN) uncertainty can be quantified using ensemble learning to provide a 95% confidence interval (CI) for NN-based predictions. We show that DL models can successfully extrapolate to new compositions, temperatures, and timescales, but fail for significant changes in density, which is captured by ensemble-based uncertainty predictions. This enables improved confidence in utilizing simulated data for realistic reactor conditions, and guidelines for training deployable DL models.</description>

      <title>Trapped-Ion Quantum Simulation of Electron Transfer Models with Tunable Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron transfer is at the heart of many fundamental physical, chemical, and biochemical processes essential for life. Exact simulation of reactions in these systems is often hindered by the large number of degrees of freedom and by the essential role of quantum effects. In this work, we experimentally simulate a paradigmatic model of molecular electron transfer using a multi-species trapped-ion crystal, where the donor-acceptor gap, the electronic and vibronic couplings, and the bath relaxation dynamics can all be controlled independently. We employ the ground-state qubit of one ion to simulate the electronic degree of freedom and the optical qubit of another ion to perform reservoir engineering on a collective mode encoding a reaction coordinate. We observe the real-time dynamics of the spin excitation, measuring the transfer rate in several regimes of adiabaticity and relaxation dynamics. The setup allows access to the electron transfer dynamics in the non-perturbative regime, where there is no clear hierarchy among the energy scales in the model, as has been suggested to be optimal for many rate phenomena, including photosynthesis. Our results provide a testing ground for increasingly rich models of molecular excitation transfer processes that are relevant for molecular electronics and light-harvesting systems.</description>

      <title>Equivalent circuit modeling of electron-hole recombination in semiconductor and mixed ionic-electronic conductor based devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The understanding and optimization of solar energy conversion and light emitting devices can greatly benefit from equivalent circuit models describing their response. However, a general model of electron-hole recombination in semiconductors is currently missing. This study presents equivalent circuit models of radiative and non-radiative electron-hole recombination based on their linearized analytical treatment. These are integrated in a circuit model of complete devices that is equivalent to the linearized drift-diffusion equations in one dimension. The analysis shows that, for most situations involving semiconductors without mobile ions, approximated models that do not account for local electrostatics are sufficient to describe non-radiative recombination. The influence of local electrostatics becomes essential in mixed conducting devices, and it should be included explicitly in equivalent circuit models. Recombination resistors used for traditional semiconductors are indeed a special case of the general model, for which transistors implement a more accurate representation. For mixed conducting devices, such as hybrid metal-halide perovskite solar cells, appropriate simplifications of the complete model provide analytical solutions describing the bulk and interfacial polarization effects that influence local electrostatics, recombination currents and overall impedance. The resulting analysis is relevant for a wide range of materials and devices used for solar energy conversion as well as other optoelectronic and photo-electrochemical applications.</description>

      <title>Binding energy referencing in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy: expanded data set confirms that adventitious carbon aligns to the vacuum level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correct referencing of the binding energy (BE) scale is essential for the accuracy of chemical analysis by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The C 1s C C/C-H peak from adventitious carbon (AdC), most commonly used for that purpose, was previously shown to shift by several eVs following changes in the sample work function, thus indicating that AdC aligns to the sample vacuum level (VL). Here, results from a much larger sample set are presented including 360 specimens of thin-film samples comprising metals, nitrides, carbides, borides, oxides, carbonitrides, and oxynitrides. Irrespective of the material system the C 1s peak of AdC is found to follow changes in the sample work function fully confirming previous results. Several observations exclude differential charging as plausible explanation. All experimental evidence points instead to the VL alignment at the AdC/sample interface as the source of shifts. Should the C 1s peak of AdC be used for spectra referencing the measurement of sample work function is necessary, irrespective of whether samples are measured grounded or insulated from the spectrometer.</description>

      <title>Ab initio simulation of single vibronic level fluorescence spectra of anthracene using Hagedorn wavepackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence spectroscopy contributes to the understanding of molecular vibrational structures and relaxation processes. Here, we present a practical method for computing SVL fluorescence spectra of polyatomic molecules from arbitrary initial vibrational levels. This method, which combines a time-dependent approach using Hagedorn wavepackets with accurate evaluation of electronic structure, captures both mode distortion and Duschinsky rotation. We apply the method to compute SVL spectra of anthracene by performing wavepacket dynamics on a 66- dimensional harmonic potential energy surface constructed from density functional theory calculations. With the Hagedorn approach, we not only reproduce the previously reported simulation results for singly excited $12^{1}$ and $\overline{11}^{1}$ levels, but also are able to compute SVL spectra from multiply excited levels in good agreement with experiments. All spectra were obtained from the same wavepacket trajectory without any additional propagation beyond what is required for ground-state emission spectra.</description>

      <title>On Hagedorn wavepackets associated with different Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hagedorn functions are carefully constructed generalizations of Hermite functions to the setting of many-dimensional squeezed and coupled harmonic systems. Wavepackets formed by superpositions of Hagedorn functions have been successfully used to solve the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation exactly in harmonic systems and variationally in anharmonic systems. For evaluating typical observables, such as position or kinetic energy, it is sufficient to consider orthonormal Hagedorn functions with a single Gaussian center. Here, we instead derive various relations between Hagedorn bases associated with different Gaussians, including their overlaps, which are necessary for evaluating quantities nonlocal in time, such as time correlation functions needed for computing spectra. First, we use the Bogoliubov transformation to obtain commutation relations between the ladder operators associated with different Gaussians. Then, instead of using numerical quadrature, we employ these commutation relations to derive exact recurrence relations for the overlap integrals between Hagedorn functions with different Gaussian centers. Finally, we present numerical experiments that demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our algebraic method as well as its suitability to treat problems in spectroscopy and chemical dynamics.</description>
