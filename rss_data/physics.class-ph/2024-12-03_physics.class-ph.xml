      <title>Analyzing lump-type solutions in scalar field models through configurational information measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we employ a configurational information measure, specifically the differential configurational complexity (DCC), to quantify the information content of lump-type solutions in various scalar field models, including two modified inverted $\phi^{4}$ models, the modified $\phi^{3}$ model, as well as two additional families of lump models. Our objective is to complement previous studies by providing an informational perspective that distinguishes different solutions based on their energy configurations. We explore how the DCC measure relates to energy and its applicability in analyzing degenerate states. Our findings indicate that DCC effectively correlates with the energy parameters of the solutions, offering significant insights into their informational properties. This study underscores the value of using informational metrics like DCC to deepen our understanding of the structural and dynamic characteristics of complex systems in theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom for Radiating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic degrees of freedom are instrumental in antenna design, wireless communications, imaging, and scattering. Larger number of degrees of freedom enhances control in antenna design, influencing radiation patterns and directivity, while in communication systems, it links to spatial channels for increased data rates and reliability, and resolution in imaging. The correlation between computed degrees of freedom and physical quantities is not fully understood, prompting a comparison between classical estimates, Weyl's law, modal expansions, and optimization techniques. In this paper, it is shown that the number of degrees of freedom for arbitrary shaped radiating structures approaches the shadow area measured in squared wavelengths asymptotically as the wavelength decreases.</description>
