      <title>Myhill-Nerode Theorem for Higher-Dimensional Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08298v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a Myhill-Nerode type theorem for higher-dimensional automata (HDAs), stating that a language is regular if and only if it has finite prefix quotient. HDAs extend standard automata with additional structure, making it possible to distinguish between interleavings and concurrency. We also introduce deterministic HDAs and show that not all HDAs are determinizable, that is, there exist regular languages that cannot be recognised by a deterministic HDA. Using our theorem, we develop an internal characterisation of deterministic languages. Lastly, we develop analogues of the Myhill-Nerode construction and of determinacy for HDAs with interfaces.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Power of Particle Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the computational power of particle methods, a well-established class of algorithms with applications in scientific computing and computer simulation. The computational power of a compute model determines the class of problems it can solve. Automata theory allows describing the computational power of abstract machines (automata) and the problems they can solve. At the top of the Chomsky hierarchy of formal languages and grammars are Turing machines, which resemble the concept on which most modern computers are built. Although particle methods can be interpreted as automata based on their formal definition, their computational power has so far not been studied. We address this by analyzing Turing completeness of particle methods. In particular, we prove two sets of restrictions under which a particle method is still Turing powerful, and we show when it loses Turing powerfulness. This contributes to understanding the theoretical foundations of particle methods and provides insight into the powerfulness of computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Multiband linear cellular automata and endomorphisms of algebraic vector groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a correspondence between certain multiband linear cellular automata - models of computation widely used in the description of physical phenomena - and endomorphisms of certain algebraic unipotent groups over finite fields. The correspondence is based on the construction of a universal element specialising to a normal generator for any finite field. We use this correspondence to deduce new results concerning the temporal dynamics of such automata, using our prior, purely algebraic, study of the endomorphism ring of vector groups. These produce 'for free' a formula for the number of fixed points of the $n$-iterate in terms of the $p$-adic valuation of $n$, a dichotomy for the Artin-Mazur dynamical zeta function, and an asymptotic formula for the number of periodic orbits. Since multiband linear cellular automata simulate higher order linear automata (in which states depend on finitely many prior temporal states, not just the direct predecessor), the results apply equally well to that class.</description>
