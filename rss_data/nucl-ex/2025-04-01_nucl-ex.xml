      <title>Bayesian and Monte Carlo approaches to estimating uncertainty for the measurement of the bound-state $\beta$ decay of $^{205}\mathrm{Tl}^{81+}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of the bound-state $\beta$ decay of $^{205}\mathrm{Tl}^{81+}$ at the Experimental Storage Ring at GSI, Darmstadt, has recently been reported with substantial impact on the use of $^{205}\mathrm{Pb}$ as an early Solar System chronometer and the low-energy measurement of the solar neutrino spectrum via the LOREX project. Due to the technical challenges in producing a high-purity $^{205}\mathrm{Tl}^{81+}$ secondary beam, a robust statistical method needed to be developed to estimate the variation in the contaminant $^{205}\mathrm{Pb}^{81+}$ produced during the fragmentation reaction. Here we show that Bayesian and Monte Carlo methods produced comparable estimates for the contaminant variation, each with unique advantages and challenges given the complex statistical problems for this experiment. We recommend the adoption of such methods in future experiments that exhibit unknown statistical fluctuations.</description>

      <title>To examine the variation in dissipation near the shell closure using neutron multiplicity as a probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pre and post-scission neutron multiplicities have been determined for the fission of the compound nucleus (CN) 206Rn, induced by the reaction 28Si+178Hf within the excitation energy interval of 61.0-90.0 MeV. We intentionally formed CN 206 Rn, which is below the shell closure CN, to examine the variation in N/Z with total neutron multiplicity, as data for other CNs of 208,210,212,214,216Rn have already been published in the literature. We identified a new trend in the N/Z ratio, where the total neutron multiplicity initially decreases as we approach the shell closure of the compound nucleus and then starts to increase as we move away from the shell closure. Furthermore, we have observed that below the neutron shell closure, the dissipation in compound nuclei (CN) escalates with rising excitation energy, remains stable at the shell closure CN, and thereafter diminishes with increasing excitation energy above the shell closure CN.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Kaon Directed Flow in Au+Au Collisions in the High Baryon Density Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapidity-odd directed flow $v_1$ measurements are presented for $K^{\pm}$ and $K^0_S$ in Au$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}$ = 3.0, 3.2, 3.5, and 3.9 GeV with the STAR experiment. For comparison, $v_1$ of $\pi^{\pm}$, protons, and $\Lambda$ from the same collisions are also discussed. The mid-rapidity $v_1$ slope $\text{d}v_1/\text{d}y|_{y=0}$ for protons and $\Lambda$ is positive in these collisions. On the other hand, $v_1$ slope of kaons exhibits a strong $p_\text{T}$ dependence: negative at $p_\text{T} &lt;$ 0.6 GeV/$c$ and positive at higher $p_\text{T}$. A similar $p_\text{T}$ dependence is also evident for the $v_1$ slope of charged pions. Compared to the spectator-removed calculations in Au$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} =$ 3.0-3.9 GeV, the JAM model demonstrates a pronounced shift of the $v_1$ slopes of mesons towards the negative direction. It suggests that the shadowing effect of the spectators plays an important role in the observed kaon anti-flow at low $p_\text{T}$ in the high baryon density region of non-central collisions.</description>

      <title>Universality of Shell Effects in Fusion-Fission Mass Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a broad, systematic study of heavy-ion induced fission mass distributions for every even-Z compound nucleus ($Z_\mathrm{CN}$) from $^{144}$Gd to $^{212}$Th. We find systematic evidence of shell-driven structure in every fission mass distribution. The change in shape of the mass distributions with $Z_\mathrm{CN}$ is consistent with the results of quantitative simultaneous fitting in mass and total kinetic energy, demonstrating that fragment proton shell gaps at $Z_\mathrm{FF} = 34, 36$ and $Z_\mathrm{FF} = 44, 46$ are \textit{both} major drivers of fission mass distributions below the actinide region. The mass distributions show enhanced yields at mass symmetry for values of $Z_\mathrm{CN}$ equal to two times these favoured $Z_\mathrm{FF}$ values. Thus, the same shell gaps that are drivers of mass-asymmetric fission also affect mass distributions at and near mass-symmetry. For all systems a second, more mass-asymmetric, fission mode is required to fit the fission mass distributions. If driven by a single shell gap, it appears to be in the light fragment around $Z_\mathrm{FF} = 28, 30$.</description>

      <title>Event-activity dependence of heavy-flavor production at the ALICE experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy-flavor production at the LHC offers valuable tests of quantum-chromodynamics calculations, owing to the large masses of heavy quarks. Measurements of charm production as a function of event activity reveal new features of charm production and fragmentation, providing insights to the interplay between soft and hard processes. In addition, charm production in heavy-ion collisions addresses flavor-dependent quark transport properties in both hot and cold nuclear matter, helping to clarify the roles of coalescence and fragmentation in heavy-flavor hadron formation. This contribution summarizes recent measurements from the ALICE experiment on charm production as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in pp collisions at various energies, including the measurements of charm baryon-to-meson production yield ratios in pp, p--Pb and Pb--Pb collisions. New results on ${\rm D}^0$ production in pp collisions as a function of the transverse spherocity of the event, as well as of the transverse event-activity classifier $R_{\rm T}$, are also presented.</description>

      <title>European Strategy for Particle Physics 2026: the NA60+/DiCE experiment at the SPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of the phase diagram of Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD) is carried out by studying ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. The energy range covered by the CERN SPS ($\sqrt{s_{\rm {NN}}} \sim 6-17$ GeV) is ideal for the investigation of the region corresponding to finite baryochemical potential ($\mu_{\rm B}$), and was little explored up to now. We propose in this document a new experiment, NA60+/DiCE (Dilepton and Charm Experiment), that will address several observables which are fundamental for the understanding of the phase transition from hadronic matter towards a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) at finite $\mu_B$. In particular, we propose to study, in Pb-Pb collisions, as a function of the collision energy, the production of thermal dimuons, from which one can obtain a caloric curve of the QCD phase diagram that may be sensitive to the order of the phase transition. In addition, the measurement of a $\rho-{\rm a}_1$ mixing contribution will provide conclusive insights into the restoration of the chiral symmetry of QCD. Studies of open charm and charmonium production will also be carried out, addressing the measurement of transport properties of the QGP and the investigation of the onset of the deconfinement transition. Reference measurements with proton-nucleus collisions are an essential part of this program. The experimental set-up couples a vertex telescope based on monolithic active pixel sensors (MAPS) to a muon spectrometer with MWPC detectors. Two existing CERN dipole magnets, MEP48 and MNP33, will be used for the vertex and muon spectrometers, respectively. The continuing availability of Pb ion beams in the CERN SPS is a crucial requirement for the experimental program. After the submission of a LoI, the experiment proposal is currently in preparation and is due by mid 2025. The start of the data taking is foreseen by 2029/2030, and should last about 7 years.</description>

      <title>Experimental and theoretical research of photoneutron reactions in the 181Ta nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bremsstrahlung fluxes for irradiating tantalum samples were formed by irradiating a tungsten converter with an electron beam with energy up to 130 MeV. The relative yields and flux-averaged cross-sections of multinucleon photonuclear reactions with the emission of up to 9 neutrons in 181Ta nuclei were determined. Monte Carlo simulations to study the yields of photonuclear reactions were performed using Geant4 and TALYS-2.0 codes. The obtained experimental results were compared with the available literature data and calculated results. The comparison showed that the values of the relative reaction yield and the flux-averaged cross-section coincide with the literature data, taking into account the different geometry of the experiments. The calculated results coincide with the experimental ones only for reactions with the emission of up to 5 neutrons from the nucleus.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the collective nature of radial flow in Pb+Pb collisions with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic flow and radial flow are two key probes of the expansion dynamics and properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). While anisotropic flow has been extensively studied, radial flow, which governs the system's radial expansion, has received less attention. Notably, experimental evidence for the global and collective nature of radial flow has been lacking. This Letter presents the first measurement of transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) dependence of radial flow fluctuations ($v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$) over $0.5&lt;p_{\mathrm{T}}&lt;10$ GeV, using a two-particle correlation method in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV. The data reveal three key features supporting the collective nature of radial flow: long-range correlation in pseudorapidity, factorization in $p_{\mathrm{T}}$, and centrality-independent shape in $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. The comparison with a hydrodynamic model demonstrates the sensitivity of $v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$ to bulk viscosity, a crucial transport property of the QGP. These findings establish a new, powerful tool for probing collective dynamics and properties of the QGP.</description>

      <title>Half-life and precision shape measurement of 2{\nu}{\beta}{\beta} decay of $^{130}$Te</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new measurement of the 2nbb half-life of 130Te (T1/2) using the first complete model of the CUORE data, based on 1038 kg yr of collected exposure. Thanks to optimized data selection, we achieve a factor of two improvement in precision, obtaining T1/2 = (9.32 +0.05 -0.04 (stat.) +0.07 -0.07 (syst.)) x10^20 yr. The signal-to-background ratio is increased by 70% compared to our previous results, enabling the first application of the improved 2nbb formalism to 130Te. Within this framework, we determine a credibility interval for the effective axial coupling in the nuclear medium as a function of nuclear matrix elements. We also extract values for the higher-order nuclear matrix element ratios: second-to-first and third-to-first. The second-to-first ratio agrees with nuclear model predictions, while the third-to-first ratio deviates from theoretical expectations. These findings provide essential tests of nuclear models and key inputs for future 0nbb searches.</description>

      <title>Effects of perturbation for transition operator of double-${\beta}$ decay on nuclear matrix element, effective axial-vector current coupling, and half-life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the nuclear matrix element (NME), effective axial-vector current coupling $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$, and half-life of the double-$\beta$ ($\beta\beta$) decay using the transition operator perturbed by the nuclear interaction. The correction terms for the NME are obtained by extending the hadron sector to a higher order in terms of the Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger perturbation theory. The NME calculations are performed for the neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) and the two-neutrino $\beta\beta$ ($2\nu\beta\beta$) decays of $^{136}$Xe. The nuclear wave functions are calculated by the quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) with the Skyrme, the Coulomb, and the contact pairing interactions. Sufficiently large single-particle valence spaces are used. The correction terms for the NME are comparable with the leading term in absolute value, and the sum of the corrections has the opposite sign to that of the leading term. The $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$'s for the $\beta\beta$ NME are calculated by a few methods depending on the truncation of the NME and the half-life referred to. Similarities are found between some of these $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$'s including those of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME. This leads to the conclusion that the value of $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$ can indeed be determined by the perturbed transition operator. It is in a comparable range of the $g_A$ for the $2\nu\beta\beta$ NME. The perturbation effect on the $2\nu\beta\beta$ half-life is discussed by comparing the calculated half-lives with the different $g_A$'s and the NME components.</description>

      <title>Crossover between the zeptosecond and attosecond physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear orbiting resonances have been revealed at the sub-barrier energies as an atomic phenomenon by means of x-ray spectroscopy experiments. This interpretation is supported by several phenomenological models and theoretical estimates of the nuclear orbiting timescale and cross-section, inelastic scattering cross section including both nuclear and Coulomb excitation, and the Wigner-Smith time delay. We demonstrate that a multi-photon exchange during nuclear orbiting is responsible for an atomic excitation. Furthermore, proximity of the projectile and target nucleus during the nuclear orbiting modifies the effective charge of the projectile. Even though this orbiting induced excitation is triggered in zeptoseconds, it can still be observed in the attosecond time scale because of the Wigner-Smith time delay inherent to autoionization. Thus, we demonstrate the crossover between the zeptosecond and attosecond time scales which are native to nuclear and atomic physics, respectively. Markedly, this crossover may be the reason for x-ray production from ultra short nuclear processes ($\leq 10^{-21}$ sec). This explanation is likely to resolve the fission time scale anomaly and can stimulate cross-disciplinary research ranging from solid state to high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Studies of Directed Flow with Event Plane Method in the HIRFL-CSR External-target Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cooling-Storage-Ring External-target Experiment (CEE) at Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL) is designed to study the properties of nuclear matter created in heavy-ion collisions at a few hundred MeV/$u$ to 1 GeV/$u$ beam energies, facilitating the research of quantum chromodynamics phase structure in the high-baryon-density region. Collective flow is one of the most important observables in heavy-ion collision experiments to study the bulk behavior of the created matter. Even though the standard event plane method has been widely used for collective flow measurements, it remains crucial to validate and optimize this method for the CEE spectrometer. In this paper, we study the experimental procedures of measuring directed flow in $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U collisions at 500 MeV/$u$ using event planes reconstructed by Multi Wire Drift Chamber and Zero Degree Calorimeter, respectively. Jet AA Microscopic (JAM) transport generator is used to generate events, and the detector response is simulated by the CEE Fast Simulation (CFS) package. Finally, the optimal kinetic region for proton directed flow measurements is discussed for the future CEE experiment.</description>

      <title>Heavy ion physics with LHCb Upgrade II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A second major LHCb detector upgrade will be installed during long shutdown 4 (LS4) of the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The new detector will provide excellent performance for studies of Quantum Chromodynamics at high temperature and density, as achieved in collisions of heavy nuclei. The high granularity of the tracking system will allow lead-lead collisions to be reconstructed across the full range of centrality at far forward rapidity for the first time. Moreover, the forward acceptance of the detector, covering the pseudorapidity region close to the beamline, and the capability to reconstruct a wide range of hadrons containing strange, charm, and beauty quarks result in unique potential to probe the medium produced in the collisions. In this document, the heavy ion physics programme that will be pursued in LHCb Upgrade II is summarised, including precision studies of the partonic structure of nuclei, probes of the conditions allowing deconfinement, and measurements of plasma properties.</description>

      <title>Bayesian method for quantifying the non-Gaussian fluctuations in low-intermediate energy heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a model-independent method to quantify the non-Gaussian fluctuations in the observable distributions, which are assessed by the difference between the measured observable distributions and reconstructed observable distributions via the Bayesian method. Our results indicate that the strength of non-Gaussian fluctuation increases with the beam energy, and is primarily driven by non-central collision mechanisms. The experimental measurement of the strength of non-Gaussian fluctuation of the observable distributions will provide valuable insights into understanding the nonequilibrium effects in heavy ion collisions and the liquid-gas phase transition in finite nuclei.</description>

Abstract: In this document drafted by the Neutrino Scattering Theory Experiment Collaboration (NuSTEC), we provide input on the synergies between theoretical and experimental efforts that can provide critical input to the prediction accuracy needed for the forthcoming high-precision neutrino measurements. These efforts involve a wide range of energies and interaction processes, as well as target nuclei and interaction probes. The challenges discussed will be overcome only through the active support of integrated collaboration across strong and electroweak physics from both the nuclear and high energy physics communities.</description>

      <title>Enhanced signal of momentum broadening in hard splittings for $\gamma$-tagged jets in a multistage approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate medium-induced modifications to jet substructure observables that characterize hard splitting patterns in central Pb-Pb collisions at the top energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Using a multistage Monte Carlo simulation of in-medium jet shower evolution, we explore flavor-dependent medium effects through simulations of inclusive and $\gamma$-tagged jets. The results show that quark jets undergo a non-monotonic modification compared to gluon jets in observables such as the Pb-Pb to $p$-$p$ ratio of the Soft Drop prong angle $r_g$, the relative prong transverse momentum $k_{T,g}$ and the groomed mass $m_g$ distributions. Due to this non-monotonic modification, $\gamma$-tagged jets, enriched in quark jets, provide surprisingly clear signals of medium-induced structural modifications, distinct from effects dominated by selection bias. This work highlights the potential of hard substructures in $\gamma$-tagged jets as powerful tools for probing the jet-medium interactions in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. All simulations for $\gamma$-tagged jet analyses carried out in this paper used triggered events containing at least one hard photon, which highlights the utility of these observables for future Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Nuclear clustering process in heavy-ion collisions : experimental constraints on the low-temperature region of the QCD phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the production of Hydrogen and Helium isotopes in heavy-ion collisions in the incident energy range between 80 and 150 MeV/nucleon. We compare their inclusive multiplicities emitted in the transverse plane of the reaction with the predictions given by the thermal model. As a first step, we validate the choice of this approach to describe the experimental measurements. We also show that the transient states have to be explicitly taken into account for a good statistical description of the experimental multiplicities. From the thermodynamical parameter values obtained we complete the existing database built with the use of thermal-statistical models to reproduce particle production in the (ultra-)relativistic-energy measurements. We then proposed a new constraint on the so-called freeze-out region in the temperature (T) versus baryonic chemical potential (muB) phase diagram of the quantum chromodynamics. These new results indicate that there is a common framework to describe the hadron production and nuclear clustering processes in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>NUMEXO2: a versatile digitizer for nuclear physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NUMEXO2 is a 16 channels 14bit/200MHz digitizer and processing board initially developed for gamma-ray spectroscopy (for EXOGAM: EXOtic nuclei GAMma ray). Numexo2 has been gradually extended and improved as a general purpose digitizer to fulfill various needs in nuclear physics detection at GANIL. This was possible thanks to reprogrammable components like FPGAs and the optimization of different algorithms. The originality of this work compared to similar systems is that all numerical operations follow the digital data flow from ADCs, without any storage step of samples. Some details are given on digital processing of the signals, delivered by a large variety of detectors: HPGe, silicon strip detector, ionisation chamber, liquid and plastic scintillators read-out with photomultipliers, Multi Wire Proportional Counter and drift chamber.</description>

      <title>Leading qT/Q correction for Drell-Yan in TMD factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization theorem accommodates various types of power corrections. Among them, the least studied are qT/Q corrections, which become significant at large values of transverse momentum. These corrections partially originate from higher-twist TMD distributions, which exhibit singularity at small transverse distances. We propose a decomposition that reveals this singularity explicitly, and makes the qT/Q correction manifest. As a concrete application, we consider the next-to-leading power correction for the angular distributions in Drell-Yan, and determine the leading qT/Q corrections. These corrections are significant for the angular distributions A1 and A3, in complete agreement with the data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the recent decades of high energy physics research, it was demonstrated that strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) is created in ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. Investigation and understanding of properties of the hadronic matter is among the important goals of NA61/SHINE collaboration at CERN SPS. Mapping of the phase diagram is achieved by varying the collision energy (5 GeV $&lt;\sqrt{s_{\textrm{NN}}}&lt;$17 GeV) and by changing the collision system (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb). We report on the measurement of femtoscopic correlations in intermediate system at intermediate SPS energies. Interpreting the results of measurements within the symmetric L\'evy source formalism, we discuss the values of L\'evy source parameters as a function of average pair transverse mass. One of the physical parameters is particularly important, the L\'evy exponent $\alpha$, which describes the shape of the source and may be related to the critical exponent $\eta$ in the proximity of the critical point. Therefore, measuring it may shed light on the location of the critical endpoint of the QCD phase diagram.</description>

Abstract: The Young-Koppel model (YK) describes comprehensively the interaction of slow neutrons with diatomic gases such as H$_2$ and D$_2$. This paper reports on the first experimental results of ultracold neutron (UCN) scattering over a wide temperature range vindicating the YK model for gaseous D$_2$ and showing an important difference in the temperature dependence to a low-energy low-temperature approximation (LETA). LETA is confirmed, however, to be valid for monoatomic gases such as Ne. Calculated cross sections for other noble gases were also confirmed for ultracold neutrons. Finally, the total cross section of UCNs in H$_2$ gas was measured and analyzed applying the Young-Koppel model, however, in a more limited temperature range, confirming the theoretical prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CERN AD/ELENA Antimatter program studies the fundamental charge, parity, time (CPT) reversal invariance through high-precision studies of antiprotons, antihydrogen, and antiprotonic atoms. Utilizing the world-unique Antiproton Decelerator (AD) and the Extra Low Energy Antiproton (ELENA) decelerator, the program supports multiple groundbreaking experiments aimed at testing fundamental symmetries, probing gravity with antimatter, and investigating potential asymmetric antimatter/dark matter interactions. Some experiments focus on precision spectroscopy of antihydrogen, while others conduct the most precise tests of CPT invariance in the baryon sector by comparing proton and antiproton properties. Other efforts are dedicated to measure the ballistic properties of antihydrogen under gravity and performing antiproton-based studies of neutron skins in exotic nuclei. These efforts have led to major breakthroughs, including the first trapped antihydrogen, antihydrogen's first gravitational acceleration measurement, and record-breaking precision CPT-tests in the baryon sector.
  With continuous advancements in antimatter cooling, trapping, and transport, CERN's program is opening new frontiers in fundamental physics. Future goals, described in this document and reaching to timelines beyond 2040, include further improving the precision of antimatter studies, developing transportable antimatter traps, and advancing our understanding of quantum field theory, gravity, and dark matter interactions. Furthermore, new areas of hadron physics with antiprotons will be explored through studies of the Pontecorvo reaction, antineutron annihilation dynamics and hypernuclei decays. The CERN AD/ELENA Antimatter program remains at the forefront of experimental physics, pushing the limits of precision measurements to unravel the mysteries of the universe.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity and net-electric charge fluctuations in central Ar+Sc interactions at 13A, 19A, 30A, 40A, 75A, and 150A GeV/c beam momenta measured by NA61/SHINE at the CERN SPS</title>

Abstract: This paper presents results on multiplicity fluctuations of positively and negatively charged hadrons as well as net-electric charge fluctuations measured in central Ar+Sc interactions at beam momenta 13A, 19A, 30A, 40A, 75A, and 150A GeV/c. The fluctuation analysis is one of the tools to search for the predicted critical point of strongly interacting matter. Results are corrected for the experimental biases and quantified using cumulant ratios. In most instances, multiplicity and net-charge distributions appear narrower than the corresponding Poisson or Skellam distributions. Cumulant ratios are compared with the EPOS1.99 model predictions, which provide a qualitative description that aligns with observations for positively and negatively charged particles. The obtained results are also compared to earlier NA61/SHINE results from inelastic p+p interactions in the same analysis acceptance.</description>

      <title>First Extraction of Transverse Momentum Dependent Helicity Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the first global analysis of transverse momentum dependent helicity distributions of the proton. The analysis is performed at next-to-leading order with the evolution factor at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy. Nonzero signals are determined for up and down quarks and their $k_T$-integrated polarization are consistent with analyses in collinear factorization, while the distributions of other flavors are loosely constrained by existing data. With increasing transverse momentum, quarks at large $x$ become less polarized while those at small $x$ become more polarized.</description>

      <title>Projective imaging of high-energy nuclei through coherent exclusive vector meson production in electron-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the major goals of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is to better understand the distributions of quarks and gluons inside nuclei at high-energy. A principal measurement is coherent exclusive vector meson (VM) production in diffractive $eA$ collisions. The gluon spatial distribution inside the nucleus can be obtained through a Fourier transform of the nuclear momentum transfer ($|t|$) distribution for these VMs. However, the $|t|$ distribution is one of the most challenging measurements at the EIC. This research aims to overcome one of the main obstacles in this measurement: limited precision in measuring $|t|$, making it difficult to resolve the diffractive pattern from coherent events. We employ a method for reconstructing $|t|$ by utilizing the electron beam polarization in $eA$ collisions and measuring the projected $|t|$ distribution to overcome this complication. Through the study of diffractive VM production, we carry out an experimental simulation of how the detector effect would change the extracted nuclear geometry and how to use projective techniques to avoid defects. This technique will allow us to measure the diffractive pattern in coherent events more precisely, providing a potential solution for a critical measurement that is difficult for the EIC baseline detector.</description>
