      <title>Micro-Electro-Mechanical System Vapor Cells With Passivated Internal Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-Electro-Mechanical, so called 'MEMs,' vapor cells are a key component in atom-based quantum sensors, such as clocks, gyroscopes, electric field sensors and magnetometers. MEMs vapor cell fabrication for Rydberg atom radio frequency sensors is particularly demanding. The Rydberg states used for the sensor can shift in a constant electric field which can be generated by the internal surfaces of the vapor cell cavity. The ratio of the detection wavelength to vapor cell size can span a large range, meaning that the radio frequency field-vapor cell interaction is a critical design consideration. In many radio frequency sensing cases, there is a desire to minimize the interaction between the vapor cell and the target radio frequency field, as well as assure that every vapor cell behaves uniformly. These criterion favor MEMs vapor cells with low background electric fields. Known inert, organic coatings cannot survive the bonding temperatures required for conventional anodic bonding of a MEMs vapor cell. Applying inert, organic coatings to the internal cavities of MEMs vapor cells is a longstanding challenge. In this paper, we present a low temperature bonding scheme that is compatible with coating the internal cavity of a MEMs vapor cell with Octadecyltrichlorosilane (CH$_3\,$(CH$_2$)$_{17}\,$SiCl$_3$, OTS). The coating prevents the Cs used in the vapor cell from sticking to the walls. Spectral linewidths of $\sim300\,$kHz are obtained using Rydberg spectroscopy, with energy shifts corresponding to electric fields $&lt;$10$\,$mV$\,$cm$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Improved QED correction model for the GRASP2018 package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rci-Q package is an extension to the GRASP2018 suite, improving the model of estimating the quantum-electrodynamics (QED) corrections to the energy levels. The Flambaum-Ginges radiative potential method is used to estimate the leading self-energy correction to electron energy in many electron atoms. The new fitting prefactors to parameterize radiative potential are presented. The correction to self-energy originating from finite nucleus size is included. The Wichmann-Kroll part of the vacuum polarization potential is also implemented.</description>

      <title>A Platform for Evanescently Trapping Rb-87 Using Silicon Nitride Strip Waveguides Buried in Silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold-atom systems have emerged as a highly promising avenue for quantum-enhanced position, navigation, and timing applications. However, their wider adoption is currently hampered in part by the large footprint of the systems. In leveraging the miniaturisation possible through photonic integrated circuits, cold-atom sensors would be able to reach much wider commercial adoption. In this paper, we introduce a platform for evanescently trapping 87Rb using strip silicon nitride waveguides buried in silica using red- and blue-detuned fundamental and higher-order modes, providing a three-dimensional adjustable trap for BEC-based, chip-scale work in quantum science and technologies.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous optical and multi-band terahertz imaging using an atomic quantum sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate simultaneous imaging at 0.549 THz and 1.012 THz with an optical overlay using a two-species atomic-vapour-based technique. The atomic vapour, comprising laser-pumped rubidium and caesium atoms contained within the same cell, is used to convert two narrowband terahertz signals to optical frequencies which can then be detected using standard CMOS sensors. We use the system to image and perform spectral analysis of material samples. As atomic vapour is optically transparent, by using optically-transparent terahertz lenses, we can achieve simultaneous optical imaging, allowing for potential integration of terahertz sensitivity into a range of optical imaging devices.</description>

      <title>Multi-Mode Quantum Memories for High-Throughput Satellite Entanglement Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networking seeks to enable global entanglement distribution through terrestrial and free space channels; however, the exponential loss in these channels necessitates quantum repeaters with efficient, long lived quantum memories (QMs). Space based architectures, particularly satellite assisted links, offer a path to truly global connectivity, yet they demand QMs that are compatible with orbital factors such as infrared radiation and the unique challenges of operating aboard a satellite. In this work, we propose a multimode quantum memory (MMQM) for low Earth orbit (LEO) repeaters based on the atomic frequency comb (AFC) protocol. Our design integrates a hybrid alkali noble gas ensemble in an optical cavity, using alkali atoms for strong photon matter coupling and noble gas nuclear spins for minutes to hours coherence, all without the need for cryogenics. The architecture natively supports temporal and spectral multiplexing, enabling the storage of 100 modes to parallelize probabilistic operations and overcome light limited round trip times. Representative link budgets at $h = 500$ km with realistic apertures, $\eta_{\text{mem}}\gtrsim 70%$, and $t_{\text{buffer}}$ of several minutes predict improvements of up to two orders of magnitude in per pass success probability and instantaneous SKR relative to a memoryless dual downlink, with clear scaling in $N$. Our contributions are (i) a non cryogenic, space ready multimode memory, (ii) a systems analysis coupling mode count, storage time, and orbital geometry to achievable rate, and (iii) a near term implementation roadmap. Together, these results indicate feasibility with current to near term technology and provide a practical path toward a high rate, space enabled quantum internet.</description>

      <title>Dual Role of Nb in Defect-Mediated Strength and Ductility of {\gamma}-TiAl Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the superior high-temperature strength of {\gamma}-TiAl with high Nb addition remains highly controversial, largely due to the unclear role of Nb atoms. Using large-scale hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations with a self-developed neural network potential,we show that Nb atoms predominantly occupy Ti sites and form short-range order with neighboring Al atoms, but a non-negligible fraction also occupies Al sites (NbAl) and promotes the formation of antisite defects (TiAl). Both the NbAl and TiAl antisites exceptionally reduce stacking fault energies and facilitate deformation twinning, thereby enhancing plasticity. Meanwhile, these substitutional and antisite defects also increase the Peierls stress of both screw and edge dislocations, which hinders dislocation motion to cause pronounced solid-solution strengthening. This work provides mechanistic insights into the dual role of Nb in enhancing both strength and ductility in {\gamma}-TiAl and further offers guidance for defect and composition engineering in advanced alloy systems.</description>

      <title>Inductive van der Waals Force between Two Quantum Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the van der Waals-London force, which is typically associated with fluctuating dipoles in atoms, in a mesoscopic circuit consisting of two inductively coupled superconducting loops. We investigate the ``inductive" van der Waals-London interaction using both semiclassical and quantum electrodynamic (QED) approaches. The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations. In contrast, the QED framework, which incorporates virtual photon exchange, reveals a predominantly attractive force. A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy. Our study introduces a new experimental platform for measuring the van der Waals force between individual artificial atoms via controlled mesoscopic circuits.</description>

      <title>Long nuclear spin coherence times for molecules trapped in high-purity solid parahydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the ensemble transverse relaxation time (T2*) and spin-echo coherence time (T2) of the proton spin of HD molecules trapped in solid parahydrogen. By using high-purity parahydrogen matrices, we are able to measure significantly longer T2 and T2* times than seen in prior work. We also measure the longitudinal spin relaxation time T1. We examine how these parameters scale with the matrix purity and find limits on the coherence time from the parahydrogen matrix itself.</description>

      <title>Quantum-mechanical numerical model of interaction between dark atom and nucleus of substance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hypothesis of composite $XHe$ dark atoms may provide solution to the long-standing problem of direct searches for dark matter particles. The main problem of the $XHe$ dark atom is its ability to strongly interact with the nucleus of substance, arising from the unshielded nuclear attraction between the helium nucleus and the nucleus of matter. It is assumed that in order to prevent the destruction of the bound structure of dark atom, the effective potential of interaction between $XHe$ and the nucleus of substance must have dipole Coulomb barrier that prevents the fusion of dark matter atom particles with the nucleus of substance. The problem in describing the interaction between dark atom and substance nucleus is the three-body problem, for which an exact analytical solution is not available. Consequently, to assess the physical meaning of the proposed scenario, it is essential to develop a numerical approach. Our approach involves consistently developing an accurate quantum mechanical description of this three-body system, comprising bound dark atom and the external nucleus of substance. We incorporate the necessary effects and interactions to enhance the precision of the results, which helps to elucidate the most significant aspects of the proposed dark atom scenario.</description>

      <title>Enantiosensitive exceptional points in open chiral systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are remarkable spectral degeneracies in a non-Hermitian system's parameter space, where both eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce. Here, we show that in non-Hermitian molecular chiral systems the position of EPs in the parameter space is enantiomer-specific. First, we show that encircling the EP of one enantiomer drives robust topological population transfer in the chiral molecule while its mirror twin remains unaffected, offering a new route for selective chiral control. Second, we reveal how resonant excitation of EPs in chiral molecules can amplify weak chiral effects, offering an alternative approach to the enhancement of chiral interactions. Third, we demonstrate that a twisted chiral fiber immersed in a liquid solution of chiral molecules exhibits topologically different behavior depending on the solution's enantiomeric excess, offering a new approach to the detection of molecular chirality. Our results combine high enantiosensitivity with topological robustness in chiral discrimination and control, paving the way for new approaches in the exploration of non-Hermitian and chiral phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the influence of collisions on the dynamics of an ultracold gas whose constituents interact via dipolar forces. This dynamics is governed by the elastic scattering cross section of the molecules, which is to some extent under the experimentalist's control. We compare side-by-side several different situations, highlighting their similarities and differences. These situations are collisions between: 1) point dipoles; 2) electric-field-shielded polar molecules; and 3) microwave-shielded polar molecules, including the effect of microwave ellipticity.</description>
