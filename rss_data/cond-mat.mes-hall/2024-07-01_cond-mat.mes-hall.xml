      <title>Kramers Nonlinearity in PT Symmetric Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kramers degeneracies play an essential role in the spectrum of electronic materials. Here we argue that beyond spectral properties, Kramers degeneracy plays a critical role in the nonlinear response of PT symmetric magnets. In particular, we uncover a class of second-order Kramers nonlinearities that only arise in the presence of Kramers degeneracy, vanishing in non-degenerate PT symmetric materials. Kramers nonlinearties depend on a circular dichroism between PT related Kramers states and enable to trace out the quantum geometry of the degenerate band structure. We find pronounced Kramers nonlinearitites in the nonlinear polarization responses of even layer antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ that enable to identify its antiferromagnetic order. This provides novel means for diagnosing Kramers pairs and addressing the internal Kramers degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Spin Injection Route to Magnon Berry Curvature Dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Berry curvature of Bloch bands arising in lattice systems can induce a Hall response even in the absence of topology due to the so-called Berry-curvature dipole (BCD). Such a response is universal and, in principle, should occur as a thermal-Hall effect in magnon systems under the application of a temperature gradient. However, this effect intrinsically appears as a non-linear (second-order) response to the temperature gradient making experimental detection difficult. Here, we propose an alternate route to access BCD in magnons. By utilizing the process of spin-injection in conjunction with a temperature gradient, we uncover two previously unreported contributions to the BCD-induced Hall response for magnons -- one that is linear in temperature gradient, and the other is non-linear in the magnon-chemical potential gradient arising from spin injection. As an added benefit of our approach, both these responses extract distinct moments of the genuine BCD distribution over the magnon bands, as opposed to the recently reported extended BCD in magnons. We use Boltzmann transport theory to derive the expression for the magnon-Hall response in the presence of a thermal gradient and spin injection. Furthermore, using this expression, we offer predictions for the BCD-induced magnon-Hall effect to be observed in experiments for ferro, anti-ferro and ferri magnetically-ordered models on various lattices, including the honeycomb lattice, the kagome lattice, and the dice lattice.</description>

      <title>Effects of Strain Compensation on Electron Mobilities in InAs Quantum Wells Grown on InP(001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: InAs quantum wells (QWs) grown on InP substrates are interesting for their applications in devices with high spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and their potential role in creating topologically nontrivial hybrid heterostructures. The highest mobility QWs are limited by interfacial roughness scattering and alloy disorder scattering in the cladding and buffer layers. Increasing QW thickness has been shown to reduce the effect of both of these scattering mechanisms. However, for current state-of-the-art devices with As-based cladding and barrier layers, the critical thickness is limited to $\leq7$ nm. In this report, we demonstrate the use of strain compensation techniques in the InGaAs cladding layers to extend the critical thickness well beyond this limit. We induce tensile strain in the InGaAs cladding layers by reducing the In concentration from In$_{0.81}$Ga$_{0.19}$As to In$_{0.70}$Ga$_{0.30}$As and we observe changes in both the critical thickness of the well and the maximum achievable mobility. The peak electron mobility at 2 K is $1.16\times10^6$ cm$^2/$Vs, with a carrier density of $4.2\times10^{11}$ /cm$^2$. Additionally, we study the quantum lifetime and Rashba spin splitting in the highest mobility device as these parameters are critical to determine if these structures can be used in topologically nontrivial devices.</description>

      <title>Effects of ballistic transport on the thermal resistance and temperature profile in nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effects of ballistic transport on the temperature profiles and thermal resistance in nanowires are studied. Computer simulations of nanowires between a heat source and a heat sink have shown that in the middle of such wires the temperature gradient is reduced compared to Fourier's law with steep gradients close to the heat source and sink. In this work, results from molecular dynamics and phonon Monte Carlo simulations of the heat transport in nanowires are compared to a radiator model which predicts a reduced gradient with discrete jumps at the wire ends. The comparison shows that for wires longer than the typical mean free path of phonons the radiator model is able to account for ballistic transport effects. The steep gradients at the wire ends are then continuous manifestations of the discrete jumps in the model.</description>

      <title>Tunable corner-like modes in generalized quadrupole topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators harbor unique corner modes that hold immense potential for applications in information storage. However, the practical manipulation of these states has been constrained by the fixed positions and energies of conventional corner modes. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for generating topologically protected corner-like modes in higher-order topological insulators, exhibiting unprecedented tunability in their positions. These corner-like modes are characterized by a quantized generalized quadrupole moment, indicative of the presence of fractional charges. Moreover, we demonstrate the remarkable ability to modulate the energy of these topological corner modes. Our findings pave the way for the controlled manipulation of corner modes in higher-order topological insulators, opening up new avenues for their applications in advanced information technologies.</description>

      <title>Unconventional p-wave magnets as sources of nonlinear photocurrents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel application for the recently catalogued unconventional p-wave magnets as generators of nonlinear optical currents. The noncollinear spin configuration breaks the inversion symmetry of the crystal and acts as the primary driver of nonlinear photogalvanic effects such as the so-called shift current. Besides elucidating the microscopic origin of the process in a minimal model, we present a concrete material realization of this effect in the noncollinear magnet Mn$_{5}$Si$_{3}$. This material features the two possible classes of unconventional p-wave magnetism in the form of two competing spin structures proposed in existing literature. Based on their markedly distinct symmetries and guided by $\textit{ab-initio}$ calculations, we argue that a measure of their photocurrent response can help discern the underlying spin configuration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a numerical tool to mimic the pulsed deposition of nanoparticles, a technique used to fabricate thin films from the deposition of nanoparticles upon a substrate. We employ such tool under different initial conditions, in particular exploring the effect of depositing an heterogeneous/homogenenous sample of nanoparticles in terms of their morphology (size and shape). We monitor how changing the nature of the building block affects the porosity and roughness of the grown nanofilms. We found a strong dependence on the size of the nanoparticles, following, in the low size regime, a growth of the porosity following a power law.</description>

      <title>Correlated insulators in twisted mono-mono-bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene-based moir\'e superlattice featuring flat bands is a promising platform for studying strongly correlated states. By tuning two twist angles and displacement fields in twisted mono-mono-bilayer graphene (TMMBG), we observed a correlated metallic state evolved into a valley-polarized correlated insulator at the filling factor of $\nu = -2$, with the coupling strength between the top two monolayer graphene intensifying. Moreover, the corresponding effective g-factor obtained from fitting the thermal activation gap is enhanced with the coupling strength, suggesting that TMMBG can be harnessed for developing valleytronics devices. In addition, the observation of an unconventional correlated electron-hole insulator suggests that this state might be a candidate for an excitonic insulator, which may generated by the correlation from band nesting, which encourages further research in non-Fermi liquid physics. Our work reveals that tuning multiple twist angles can provide a unique route for studying quantum many-body states in twistronics.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of layer skyrmions in twisted WSe2 bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) twisted homobilayers have been established as an ideal platform for studying strong correlation phenomena, as exemplified by the recent discovery of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states in twisted MoTe2 and Chern insulators (CI) and unconventional superconductivity in twisted WSe2. In these systems, nontrivial topology in the strongly layer-hybridized regime can arise from a spatial patterning of interlayer tunneling amplitudes and layer-dependent potentials that yields a lattice of layer skyrmions. Here we report the direct observation of skyrmion textures in the layer degree of freedom of Rhombohedral-stacked (R-stacked) twisted WSe2 homobilayers. This observation is based on scanning tunneling spectroscopy that separately resolves the {\Gamma}-valley and K-valley moir\'e electronic states. We show that {\Gamma}-valley states are subjected to a moir\'e potential with an amplitude of ~ 120 meV. At ~150 meV above the {\Gamma}-valley, the K-valley states are subjected to a weaker moir\'e potential of ~30 meV. Most significantly, we reveal opposite layer polarization of the K-valley at the MX and XM sites within the moir\'e unit cell, confirming the theoretically predicted skyrmion layer-texture. The dI/dV mappings allow the parameters that enter the continuum model for the description of moir\'e bands in twisted TMD bilayers to be determined experimentally, further establishing a direct correlation between the shape of LDOS profile in real space and topology of topmost moir\'e band.</description>

      <title>Twist angle driven electronic structure evolution of twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) devices, local strains often coexist and entangle with the twist-angle dependent moir\'e superlattice, both of which can significantly affect the electronic properties of TBG. Here, using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we investigate the fine evolution of the electronic structures of a TBG device with continuous variation of twist angles from 0.32{\deg} to 1.29{\deg}, spanning the first (1.1{\deg}), second (0.5{\deg}) and third (0.3{\deg}) magic angles. We reveal the exotic behavior of the flat bands and remote bands in both the energy space and real space near the magic angles. Interestingly, we observe an anomalous spectral weight transfer between the two flat band peaks in the tunneling spectra when approaching the first magic angle, suggesting strong inter-flat-bands interactions. The position of the remote band peak can be an index for the twist angle in TBG, since it positively correlates with the twist angle but is insensitive to the strain. Moreover, influences of the twist angle gradient on symmetry breaking of the flat bands are also studied.</description>

      <title>Determination of the current-phase relation of an InAs 2DEG Josephson junction with a microwave resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor-superconductor hybrid nanocircuits are of high interest due to their potential applications in quantum computing. Semiconductors with a strong spin-orbit coupling and large $g$-factor are particularly attractive since they are the basic building blocks of novel qubit architectures. However, for the engineering of these complex circuits, the building blocks must be characterized in detail. We have investigated a Josephson junction where the weak link is a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) hosted in an InAs/InGaAs heterostructure grown on a GaAs substrate. We employed the in-situ epitaxially grown Al layer as superconducting contacts to form an rf SQUID, and also to create a microwave resonator for sensing the Josephson inductance. We determined the gate-dependent current-phase relation, and observed supercurrent interference in out-of-plane magnetic fields. With the application of an in-plane magnetic field, we induced asymmetry in the interference pattern, which was found to be anisotropic in the device plane.</description>

      <title>The hybrid Josephson rhombus: A superconducting element with tailored current-phase relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the current-phase relation (CPR) of Josephson elements is essential for tailoring the eigenstates of superconducting qubits, tuning the properties of parametric amplifiers, and designing nonreciprocal superconducting devices. Here, we introduce the hybrid Josephson rhombus, a highly tunable superconducting circuit containing four semiconductor-superconductor hybrid Josephson junctions embedded in a loop. Combining magnetic frustration with gate-voltage-controlled tuning of individual Josephson couplings provides deterministic control of the harmonic content of the rhombus CPR. We show that for balanced Josephson couplings at full frustration, the hybrid rhombus displays a $\pi$-periodic $\cos(2\varphi)$ potential, indicating coherent charge-$4e$ transport. Tuning away from the balanced configuration, we observe a superconducting diode effect with efficiency exceeding 25%. These results showcase the potential of hybrid Josephson rhombi as fundamental building blocks for noise-resilient qubits and quantum devices with custom transport properties.</description>

      <title>Strong atomic reconstruction in twisted bilayers of highly flexible InSe: Machine-Learned Interatomic Potential and continuum model approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relaxation of atomic positions to their optimal structural arrangement is crucial for understanding the emergence of new physical behavior in long scale superstructures in twisted bilayers of two-dimensional materials. The amount of deviation from a rigid moir\'e structure will depend on the elastic properties of the constituent monolayers which for the twisted bilayer - the more flexible the monolayers are, the lower the energy required to deform the layers to maximize the areas with an energetically optimal interlayer arrangement of atoms. We investigate this atomic reconstruction for twisted bilayers of highly flexible InSe. Results using two methods are demonstrated - first we train a machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) to enable fully atomistic relaxations of small-twist-angle large-length-scale moir\'e supercells while retaining density functional theory (DFT) level accuracy. We find substantial out-of-plane corrugation and in-plane domain formation for a wide range of twist angles and moir\'e length scales. We then adapt an existing continuum approach and show that it can reproduce some, but not all, features of the fully atomistic calculations.</description>

      <title>Effect of interfacial Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the microstructure and mechanical properties of textured alumina densified by ultrafast high-temperature sintering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alumina microplatelets coated with a small amount of Fe3O4 can be oriented via a rotating magnetic field to create texture. After ultrafast high-temperature sintering (UHS), Fe atoms are found at the grain boundaries and within the grains, influencing the mechanical properties. Here, we compare the microstructure and mechanical properties of textured alumina prepared with and without Fe3O4 and sintered using UHS or conventional sintering (CS). Microstructural analysis using electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) indicates that Fe3O4 induces crystallographic defects in the ceramic after UHS. Nanoindentation measurements enlighten that the presence of Fe3O4 leads to plastic flow that increases the energy dissipation, reaching ~122 % at a maximum load of 1900 mN compared to pristine samples. Overall, due to the concentrated effects of Fe3O4 after UHS, the flexural strength and fracture toughness values are higher than the other two samples, reaching values of ~287 MPa and 7 MPa.m0.5, respectively. These results could be leveraged to produce stronger and tougher ceramics.</description>

      <title>Saturation Dynamics in Non-Hermitian Topological Sensing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A class of non-Hermitian topological sensors (NTOSs) was recently proposed in which the NTOS comprises a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain with a measurant-dependent coupling between the two ends of the chain. The smallest eigenenergy of the system, which serves as the readout signal, has an exponential dependence on the system size at small system sizes but saturates above a critical size. In this study, we further elucidate the dependence of the sensor sensitivity and saturation behavior on the system parameters. We explain how the behavior of the NTOS is characterized by a winding number, which indicates whether the smallest eigenenergy decreases to zero exponentially with the system size or grows exponentially up to a critical size. Interestingly, we further show that by imposing unidirectionality on the coupling between the two ends of a sensor, we can flip the size dependence of the smallest eigenenergy value from an exponentially increasing trend to an exponentially decreasing one. Our findings provide important insights into the saturation phenomenon and the impact of terminal couplings on the sensing characteristics of NTOSs.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast carrier dynamics in epitaxial graphene nanoribbons studied by time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical pump-terahertz probe spectroscopy has been used to investigate ultrafast photo-induced charge carrier transport in epitaxial graphene nanoribbons. The picosecond THz photoconductivity first increases with an increasing pump fluence and then it saturates at high fluences. This behavior is due to an interplay between contributions of the directly photoexcited carriers and the secondary carriers, which are equilibrium conduction band carriers strongly heated by the carrier-carrier scattering process after the photoexcitation. This phenomenon leads to a non-monotonic variation of the carrier mobility and plasmonic resonance frequency as a function of the pump fluence and, at higher fluences, to a balance between a decreasing carrier scattering time and an increasing Drude weight. In addition, a weak carrier localization occurring at low pump fluences is progressively lifted as a result of increasing initial carrier temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayers host many emergent phenomena in which the electronic excitations (quasiparticles - QPs) are closely intertwined with the local stacking order. By inspecting twisted hexagonal boron nitride (t-hBN), we show that non-local long-range interactions in large twisted systems cannot be reliably described by the local (high-symmetry) stacking and that the band gap variation (typically associated with the moir\'e excitonic potential) shows multiple minima with variable depth depending on the twist angle. We investigate twist angles of 2.45$^\circ$, 2.88$^\circ$, 3.48$^\circ$ and 5.09$^\circ$ using the GW approximation together with stochastic compression to analyze the QP state interactions. We find that band-edge QP hybridization is suppressed for intermediate angles which exhibit two distinct local minima in the moir\'e potential (at AA region and saddle point (SP)) which become degenerate for the largest system (2.45$^\circ$).</description>

Abstract: Chirality, an inherent property of most objects of the universe, is a dynamic research topic in material science, physics, chemistry, and biology. The fundamental appeal of this extensive study is supported by the technological quest to manufacture materials with configurable chiralities for emerging applications ranging from optoelectronics and photonics to pharmaceutics and medicine. Recent advances put forth ferroelectrics as a host of chiral topological states in the form of Bloch domain walls, skyrmions, merons, and Hopfions, offering thus a unique ground for making chirality switchable and tunable. Here we review current developments, milestones achieved, and future routes of chiral ferroelectric materials. We focus on insights into the topological origin of the chirality in the nanostructured ferroelectrics, bringing new controllable functionalities. We pay special attention to novel developments enabling tunability and manipulating the chiroptical response and enantioselectivity, leading to new applications in nano-optoelectronics, plasmonics, pharmaceutics, and bio-medical industries.</description>

      <title>Mixing of counterpropagating signals in a traveling-wave Josephson device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light waves do not interact in vacuum, but may mix through various parametric processes when traveling in a nonlinear medium. In particular, a high-amplitude wave can be leveraged to frequency convert a low-amplitude signal, as long as the overall energy and momentum of interacting photons are conserved. These conditions are typically met when all waves propagate in the medium with identical phase velocity along a particular axis. In this work, we investigate an alternative scheme by which an input microwave signal propagating along a 1-dimensional Josephson metamaterial is converted to an output wave propagating in the opposite direction. The interaction is mediated by a pump wave propagating at low phase velocity. In this novel regime, the input signal is exponentially attenuated as it travels down the device. We exploit this process to implement a robust on-chip microwave isolator that can be reconfigured into a reciprocal and tunable coupler. The device mode of operation is selected in situ, along with its working frequency over a wide microwave range. In the 5.5-8.5 GHz range, we measure an isolation over 15 dB on a typical bandwidth of 100 MHz, on par with the best existing on-chip isolators. Substantial margin for improvement exists through design optimization and by reducing fabrication disorder, opening new avenues for microwave routing and processing in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>A Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier Isolator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting traveling-wave parametric amplifiers have emerged as highly promising devices for near-quantum-limited broadband amplification of microwave signals and are essential for high quantum-efficiency microwave readout lines. Built-in isolation, as well as gain, would address their primary limitation: lack of true directionality due to potential backward travel of electromagnetic radiation to their input port. Here, we demonstrate a Josephson-junction-based traveling-wave parametric amplifier isolator. It utilizes third-order nonlinearity for amplification and second-order nonlinearity for frequency upconversion of backward propagating modes to provide reverse isolation. These parametric processes, enhanced by a novel phase matching mechanism, exhibit gain of up to 20~dB and reverse isolation of up to 30~dB over a static 3~dB bandwidth greater than 500~MHz, while keeping near-quantum limited added noise. This demonstration of a broadband truly directional amplifier ultimately paves the way towards broadband quantum-limited microwave amplification lines without bulky magnetic isolators and with inhibited back-action.</description>

      <title>Large spin-charge interconversion induced by interfacial spin-orbit coupling in a highly conducting all-metallic system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.10409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-charge interconversion in systems with spin-orbit coupling has provided a new route for the generation and detection of spin currents in functional devices for memory and logic such as spin-orbit torque switching in magnetic memories or magnetic state reading in spin-based logic. Disentangling the bulk (spin Hall effect) from the interfacial (inverse spin galvanic effect) contribution has been a common issue to properly quantify the spin-charge interconversion in these systems, being the case of Au paradigmatic. Here, we obtain a large spin-charge interconversion at a highly conducting Au/Cu interface which is experimentally shown to arise from the inverse spin galvanic effect of the interface and not from the spin Hall effect of bulk Au. We use two parameters independent of the microscopic details to properly quantify the spin-charge interconversion and the spin losses due to the interfacial spin-orbit coupling, providing an adequate benchmarking to compare with any spin-charge interconversion system. The good performance of this metallic interface, not based in Bi, opens the path to the use of much simpler light/heavy metal systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12712v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider magnetic Weyl semimetals. First of all we review relation of intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity, band contribution to intrinsic magnetic moment, and the conductivity of chiral separation effect (CSE) to the topological invariants written in terms of the Wigner transformed Green functions (with effects of interaction and disorder taken into account). Next, we concentrate on the CSE. The corresponding bulk axial current is accompanied by the flow of the states in momentum space along the Fermi arcs. Together with the bulk CSE current this flow forms closed Weyl orbits. Their detection can be considered as experimental discovery of chiral separation effect. Previously it was proposed to detect Weyl orbits through the observation of quantum oscillations \cite{Potter_2014} . We propose the alternative way to detect existence of Weyl orbits through the observation of their contributions to Hall conductance.</description>

      <title>Giant asymmetric proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling in twisted graphene/SnTe heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the spin-orbit coupling effects in a three-degree twisted bilayer heterostructure made of graphene and an in-plane ferroelectric SnTe, with the goal of transferring the spin-orbit coupling from SnTe to graphene, via the proximity effect. Our results indicate that the point-symmetry breaking due to the incompatible mutual symmetry of the twisted monolayers and a strong hybridization has a massive impact on the spin splitting in graphene close to the Dirac point, with the spin splitting values greater than 20 meV. The band structure and spin expectation values of graphene close to the Dirac point can be described using a symmetry-free model, triggering different types of interaction with respect to the threefold symmetric graphene/transition-metal dichalcogenide heterostructure. We show that the strong hybridization of the Dirac cone's right movers with the SnTe band gives rise to a large asymmetric spin splitting in the momentum space. Furthermore, we discover that the ferroelectricity-induced Rashba spin-orbit coupling in graphene is the dominant contribution to the overall Rashba field, with the effective in-plane electric field that is almost aligned with the (in-plane) ferroelectricity direction of the SnTe monolayer. We also predict an anisotropy of the in-plane spin relaxation rates. Our results demonstrate that the group-IV monochalcogenides MX (M=Sn, Ge; X=S, Se, Te) are a viable alternative to transition-metal dichalcogenides for inducing strong spin-orbit coupling in graphene.</description>

      <title>Even-integer Quantum Hall Effect in an Oxide Caused by Hidden Rashba Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of high magnetic field, quantum Hall systems usually host both even- and odd-integer quantized states because of lifted band degeneracies. Selective control of these quantized states is challenging but essential to understand the exotic ground states and manipulate the spin textures. Here, we study the quantum Hall effect in Bi2O2Se thin films. In magnetic fields as high as 50 T, we observe only even-integer quantum Hall states, but no sign of odd-integer states. However, when reducing the thickness of the epitaxial Bi2O2Se film to one unit cell, we observe both odd- and even-integer states in this Janus (asymmetric) film grown on SrTiO3. By means of a Rashba bilayer model based on ab initio band structures of Bi2O2Se thin films, we can ascribe the absence of odd-integer states in thicker films to the hidden Rasbha effect, where the local inversion symmetry breaking in two sectors of the [Bi2O2]2+ layer yields opposite Rashba spin polarizations, which compensate with each other. In the one unit cell Bi2O2Se film grown on SrTiO3, the asymmetry introduced by top surface and bottom interface induces a net polar field. The resulting global Rashba effect lifts the band degeneracies present in the symmetric case of thicker films.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (MX$_2$) occur in 2H and rhombohedral (3R) polytypes, respectively distinguished by anti-parallel and parallel orientation of consecutive monolayer lattices. In its bulk form, 3R-MX$_2$ is ferroelectric, hosting an out-of-plane electric polarisation, the direction of which is dictated by stacking. Here, we predict that twin boundaries, separating adjacent polarization domains with reversed built-in electric fields, are able to host two-dimensional electrons and holes with an areal density reaching $\sim 10^{13} {\rm cm}^{-2}$. Our modelling suggests that n-doped twin boundaries have a more promising binding energy than p-doped ones, whereas hole accumulation is stable at external surfaces of a twinned film. We also propose that assembling pairs of mono-twin films with a `magic' twist angle $\theta^*$ that provides commensurability between the moir\'e pattern at the interface and the accumulated carrier density, should promote a regime of strongly correlated states of electrons, such as Wigner crystals, and we specify the values of $\theta^*$ for homo- and heterostructures of various TMDs.</description>

Abstract: We prove that two formulas of the orbital magnetic susceptibility, namely, Koshino-Ando's formula and G\'{o}mez-Santos and Stauber's formula, are equivalent for the tight-binding models. The difference between these two formulas can be written in a form containing the surface terms arising from the momentum-space integration, and we show that the surface terms are exactly vanishing although the primitive functions are seemingly non-periodic with respect to the translation by the reciprocal lattice vector.</description>

Abstract: Quench dynamics of topological phases have been studied in the past few years and dynamical topological invariants are formulated in different ways. Yet most of these invariants are limited to minimal systems in which Hamiltonians are expanded by Gamma matrices. Here we generalize the dynamical 3-winding-number in two-band systems into the one in generic multi-band Chern insulators and prove that its value is equal to the difference of Chern numbers between post-quench and pre-quench Hamiltonians. Moreover we obtain an expression of this dynamical 3-winding-number represented by gapless fermions in phase bands depending only on the phase and its projectors, so it is generic for the quench of all multi-band Chern insulators. Besides, we obtain a multifold fermion in the phase band in (k, t) space by quenching a three-band model, which cannot happen for two band models.</description>

Abstract: Magnons are one of the carriers of angular momentum that are involved in the ultrafast magnetization dynamics in ferromagnets, but their contribution to the electronic dynamics and their interplay with other scattering process that occur during ultrafast demagnetization has not yet been studied in the framework of a microscopic dynamical model. The present paper presents such an investigation of electronic scattering dynamics in itinerant ferromagnets at the level of Boltzmann scattering integrals for the magnon distributions and spin-dependent electron distributions. In addition to electron-magnon scattering, we include spin-conserving and effective Elliott-Yafet like spin-flip electron-electron scattering processes and the influence of phonons. In our model system, the creation or annihilation of magnons leads to transitions between two spin-split electronic bands with energy and momentum conservation. Due to the presence of spin-orbit coupling, Coulomb scattering transitions between these bands are also possible, and we describe them on an equal footing in terms of Boltzmann scattering integrals. For an instantaneous carrier excitation process we analyze the influence of both interaction processes on the magnon and spin-dependent electron dynamics, and show that their interplay gives rise to an efficient creation of magnons at higher energies and wave vectors accompanied by only a small increase of the electronic spin polarization. These results present a microscopic dynamical scenario that shows how non-equilibrium magnons may decisively influence the magnetic response of a ferromagnet on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scattering of light by plasmonic nanoparticles is classically described using bulk material properties with infinitesimally thin boundaries. However, due to the quantum nature of electrons, real interfaces have finite thickness, leading to non-classical surface effects that influence light scattering in small particles. Electrical gating offers a promising route to control and study these effects, as static screening charges reside at the boundary. We investigate the modulation of the surface response upon direct electrical charging of single plasmonic nanoresonators. By analyzing measured changes in light scattering within the framework of surface-response functions, we find the resonance shift well accounted for by modulation of the classical in-plane surface current. Surprisingly, we also observed a change in the resonance width, indicating reduced losses for negatively charged resonators. This effect is attributed to a non-classical out-of-plane surface response, extending beyond pure spill-out effects. Our experiments pave the way for electrically driven plasmonic modulators and metasurfaces, leveraging control over non-classical surface effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking of a U(1) symmetry in interacting systems leads to superfluidity of a corresponding conserved charge. We generalize the superfluidity to systems with U(1) symmetries acting on both matter fields and 2D spatial coordinates. Such systems can be effectively realized in easy-plane ferromagnetic systems with spin-orbit coupling where the conserved charge is a total angular momentum. We clarify that under a steady injection of spin angular momentum, the superfluid of the total angular momentum shows spacetime oscillations of the spin density and geometry-dependent spin hydrodynamics. We also demonstrate that the steady spin injection destabilizes the superfluid of total angular momentum, causing a dissipation effect in its spin hydrodynamic properties. Although a stability analysis shows that the superfluid under the spin injection is nonideal, the unique spin-transport features persist with weak dissipation of the spin angular momentum. Our study broadens the comprehension of superfluidity and sheds new light on the interplay between symmetries and phases of matter.</description>

The parent model hosts three species of Majorana fermions, thereby serving as an extension of the two-dimensional Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice. The non-Hermitian couplings represent generic situations when the system is coupled to the environment and, thus, undergoes dissipation. The resulting eigenvalue spectrum and the eigenmodes show a rich structure of exceptional points as well as non-Hermitian skin effects. We chart out such exotic behaviour for some representative parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Entanglement</title>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamentally non-local correlation between particles. In its simplest realisation, a measurement on one particle is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple particles, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we show that all forms of multipartite entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a system as it heats up, evolves in time, or as its parts become separated. These results follow from the nature of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that protects bipartite quantum correlations. However, truly collective fermionic entanglement disappears during typical evolution, thus sharing the same fate as in bosonic systems. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.</description>
