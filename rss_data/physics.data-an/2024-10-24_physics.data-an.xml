      <title>Datatractor: Metadata, automation, and registries for extractor interoperability in the chemical and materials sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two key issues hindering the transition towards FAIR data science are the poor discoverability and inconsistent instructions for the use of data extractor tools, i.e., how we go from raw data files created by instruments, to accessible metadata and scientific insight. If the existing format conversion tools are hard to find, install, and use, their reimplementation will lead to a duplication of effort, and an increase in the associated maintenance burden is inevitable. The Datatractor framework presented in this work addresses these issues. First, by providing a curated registry of such extractor tools their discoverability will increase. Second, by describing them using a standardised but lightweight schema, their installation and use is machine-actionable. Finally, we provide a reference implementation for such data extraction. The Datatractor framework can be used to provide a public-facing data extraction service, or be incorporated into other research data management tools providing added value.</description>

      <title>Super-resolved anomalous diffusion: deciphering the joint distribution of anomalous exponent and diffusion coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The molecular motion in heterogeneous media displays anomalous diffusion by the mean-squared displacement $\langle X^2(t) \rangle = 2 D t^\alpha$. Motivated by experiments reporting populations of the anomalous diffusion parameters $\alpha$ and $D$, we aim to disentangle their respective contributions to the observed variability when this last is due to a true population of these parameters and when it arises due to finite-duration recordings. We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation $D\propto\exp(\alpha c_1+c_2)$ for which we provide the exact expression. We finally compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.</description>

      <title>Dreaming Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating novelties into deep learning systems remains a challenging problem. Introducing new information to a machine learning system can interfere with previously stored data and potentially alter the global model paradigm, especially when dealing with non-stationary sources. In such cases, traditional approaches based on validation error minimization offer limited advantages. To address this, we propose a training algorithm inspired by Stuart Kauffman's notion of the Adjacent Possible. This novel training methodology explores new data spaces during the learning phase. It predisposes the neural network to smoothly accept and integrate data sequences with different statistical characteristics than expected. The maximum distance compatible with such inclusion depends on a specific parameter: the sampling temperature used in the explorative phase of the present method. This algorithm, called Dreaming Learning, anticipates potential regime shifts over time, enhancing the neural network's responsiveness to non-stationary events that alter statistical properties. To assess the advantages of this approach, we apply this methodology to unexpected statistical changes in Markov chains and non-stationary dynamics in textual sequences. We demonstrated its ability to improve the auto-correlation of generated textual sequences by $\sim 29\%$ and enhance the velocity of loss convergence by $\sim 100\%$ in the case of a paradigm shift in Markov chains.</description>

      <title>Optimal Equivariant Architectures from the Symmetries of Matrix-Element Likelihoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Matrix-Element Method (MEM) has long been a cornerstone of data analysis in high-energy physics. It leverages theoretical knowledge of parton-level processes and symmetries to evaluate the likelihood of observed events. In parallel, the advent of geometric deep learning has enabled neural network architectures that incorporate known symmetries directly into their design, leading to more efficient learning. This paper presents a novel approach that combines MEM-inspired symmetry considerations with equivariant neural network design for particle physics analysis. Even though Lorentz invariance and permutation invariance overall reconstructed objects are the largest and most natural symmetry in the input domain, we find that they are sub-optimal in most practical search scenarios. We propose a longitudinal boost-equivariant message-passing neural network architecture that preserves relevant discrete symmetries. We present numerical studies demonstrating MEM-inspired architectures achieve new state-of-the-art performance in distinguishing di-Higgs decays to four bottom quarks from the QCD background, with enhanced sample and parameter efficiencies. This synergy between MEM and equivariant deep learning opens new directions for physics-informed architecture design, promising more powerful tools for probing physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Partition function approach to non-Gaussian likelihoods: macrocanonical partitions and replicating Markov-chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monte-Carlo techniques are standard numerical tools for exploring non-Gaussian and multivariate likelihoods. Many variants of the original Metropolis-Hastings algorithm have been proposed to increase the sampling efficiency. Motivated by Ensemble Monte Carlo we allow the number of Markov chains to vary by exchanging particles with a reservoir, controlled by a parameter analogous to a chemical potential $\mu$, which effectively establishes a random process that samples microstates from a macrocanonical instead of a canonical ensemble. In this paper, we develop the theory of macrocanonical sampling for statistical inference on the basis of Bayesian macrocanonical partition functions, thereby bringing to light the relations between information-theoretical quantities and thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm for macrocanonical sampling, $\texttt{Avalanche Sampling}$, and apply it to various toy problems as well as the likelihood on the cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$ and $w$ on the basis of data from the supernova distance redshift relation.</description>

      <title>Mathematical methods for neutrino cross-section extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise modeling of neutrino-nucleus scattering is becoming increasingly important as accelerator-based oscillation experiments seek definitive answers to open questions about neutrino properties. To guide the needed model refinements, a growing number of experimental collaborations are pursuing a wide-ranging program of neutrino interaction measurements at GeV energies. A key step in most such analyses is cross-section extraction, in which measured event counts are corrected for background contamination and imperfect detector performance to yield cross-section results that are directly comparable to theoretical predictions. In this paper, I review the major approaches to cross-section extraction in the literature using representative examples from the MINERvA, MicroBooNE, and T2K experiments. I then present two mathematical techniques, blockwise unfolding and the conditional covariance background constraint, which overcome some limitations of typical cross-section extraction procedures.</description>

      <title>An Open-Source Data Storage and Visualization Platform for Collaborative Qubit Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing collaborative research platforms for quantum bit control is crucial for driving innovation in the field, as they enable the exchange of ideas, data, and implementation to achieve more impactful outcomes. Furthermore, considering the high costs associated with quantum experimental setups, collaborative environments are vital for maximizing resource utilization efficiently. However, the lack of dedicated data management platforms presents a significant obstacle to progress, highlighting the necessity for essential assistive tools tailored for this purpose. Current qubit control systems are unable to handle complicated management of extensive calibration data and do not support effectively visualizing intricate quantum experiment outcomes. In this paper, we introduce QubiCSV (Qubit Control Storage and Visualization), a platform specifically designed to meet the demands of quantum computing research, focusing on the storage and analysis of calibration and characterization data in qubit control systems. As an open-source tool, QubiCSV facilitates efficient data management of quantum computing, providing data versioning capabilities for data storage and allowing researchers and programmers to interact with qubits in real time. The insightful visualization are developed to interpret complex quantum experiments and optimize qubit performance. QubiCSV not only streamlines the handling of qubit control system data but also improves the user experience with intuitive visualization features, making it a valuable asset for researchers in the quantum computing domain.</description>
