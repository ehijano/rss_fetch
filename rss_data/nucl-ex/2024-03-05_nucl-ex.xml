      <title>Five-dimensional collective Hamiltonian with improved inertial functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: To describe shape fluctuations associated with large-amplitude collective motion in the quadrupole degrees of freedom, the five-dimensional collective Hamiltonian (5DCH) has been widely used. The inertial functions in the 5DCH are microscopically calculated with the energy density functional (EDF) theory employing the cranking formula. However, since the cranking formula ignores dynamical residual effects, it is known to fail to reproduce the correct inertial functions, for instance, the total mass for the translational motion.
  Purpose: We aim to resolve problems of the insufficient description of the inertial functions in the 5DCH. We provide a practical method to include the dynamical residual effects in the inertial functions that depend on the quadrupole deformation parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$.
  Methods: We use the local quasiparticle random-phase approximation (LQRPA) based on the constrained Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov states in the $\beta$--$\gamma$ plane with the Skyrme EDF. The finite-amplitude method is used for efficient computations of the LQRPA.
  Results: The inertial functions evaluated with the LQRPA significantly increase from the ones with the cranking formula due to the dynamical residual effects. This increase also shows a strong $\beta$--$\gamma$ dependence. We show an application of the present method to a transitional nucleus $^{110}$Pd. The low-lying positive-parity spectra are well reproduced with the LQRPA inertial functions.
  Conclusions: We clarify the importance of the dynamical residual effects in the inertial functions of the 5DCH for the description of the low-lying spectra. The 5DCH with the improved inertial functions provides a reliable and efficient description of low-lying spectra in nuclei associated with the quadrupole shape fluctuation.</description>

      <title>A Light-Front Model for the Transition Distribution Amplitudes for Backward Timelike Compton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To access information on the internal structure of the nucleon, data from a variety of scattering experiments can be analyzed, in regimes where the information factorizes from an otherwise known scattering amplitude. A recent development, promising new insight, is the study of exclusive reactions in the backward kinematical region, where the information can be encoded in Transition Distribution Amplitudes (TDAs). We model the photon-to-nucleon TDAs, entering the factorized description of backward Timelike Compton Scattering, using techniques of light-front dynamics to integrate information from a quark model for the photon and the nucleon. We include the results of numerical predictions that could inform further experiments at Jefferson Lab and the future Electron--Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>J/psi-pair production at NLL in TMD factorisation at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: J/psi-pair production at the LHC is currently one of the few tools available to probe gluon transverse momentum distributions (TMDs). In this context, data from LHCb in the collider mode have the potential to probe the evolution of the unpolarised-gluon TMDs and to measure the distribution of the linearly-polarised gluon in unpolarised protons for the first time. In this proceedings contribution, improved predictions obtained for the LHC (at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV) up to next-to-leading logarithm (NLL) in TMD factorisation are presented. We show the obtained predictions of transverse-momentum distributions at different invariant masses and rapidities computed in the LHCb acceptance along with PDF uncertainty. We predict the azimuthal modulations of the cross section that arise from linearly-polarised gluons.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Collins-Soper Kernel from Chiral Quarks with Physical Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the rapidity anomalous dimension of quark transverse-momentum-dependent distributions, i.e., the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel, up to transverse separations of about 1 fm. This unitary lattice calculation is conducted, for the first time, employing the chiral-symmetry-preserving domain wall fermion discretization and physical values of light and strange quark masses. The CS kernel is extracted from the ratios of pion quasi-transverse-momentum-dependent wave functions (quasi-TMDWFs) at next-to-leading logarithmic perturbative accuracy. Also for the first time, we utilize the recently proposed Coulomb-gauge-fixed quasi-TMDWF correlator without a Wilson line. We observe significantly slower signal decay with increasing quark separations compared to the established gauge-invariant method with a staple-shaped Wilson line. This enables us to determine the CS kernel at large nonperturbative transverse separations and find its near-linear dependence on the latter. Our result is consistent with the recent lattice calculation using gauge-invariant quasi-TMDWFs, and agrees with various recent phenomenological parametrizations of experimental data.</description>

      <title>Hydra: Computer Vision for Data Quality Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydra is a system which utilizes computer vision to perform near real time data quality management, initially developed for Hall-D in 2019. Since then, it has been deployed across all experimental halls at Jefferson Lab, with the CLAS12 collaboration in Hall-B being the first outside of GlueX to fully utilize Hydra. The system comprises back end processes that manage the models, their inferences, and the data flow. The front-end components, accessible via web pages, allow detector experts and shift crews to view and interact with the system. This talk will give an overview of the Hydra system as well as highlight significant developments in Hydra's feature set, acute challenges with operating Hydra in all halls, and lessons learned along the way.</description>

      <title>Recoil-Order and Radiative Corrections to the aCORN Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aCORN experiment measures the electron-antineutrino $a$-coefficient in free neutron decay. We update the previous aCORN results to include radiative and recoil corrections to first order, and discuss a key issue in the comparison of results from different $a$-coefficient experimental methods when these effects are considered. The corrected combined result is $\overline{a} = -0.10779 \pm 0.00125\, ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.00133\, ({\rm sys})$, averaged over the full Fermi neutron beta spectrum. The corresponding corrected result for the ratio of weak coupling constants $\lambda = G_A/G_V$ is $\lambda = -1.2712 \pm 0.0061$. This improves agreement with previous $a$-coefficient experiments, in particular the 2020 aSPECT result</description>

      <title>Double-pion electroproduction off protons in deuterium: quasi-free cross sections and final state interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The single-differential and fully integrated cross sections for quasi-free $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ electroproduction off protons bound in deuterium have been extracted for the first time. The experimental data were collected at Jefferson Laboratory with the CLAS detector. The measurements were performed in the kinematic region of the invariant mass $W$ from 1.3 GeV to 1.825 GeV and photon virtuality $Q^{2}$ from 0.4 GeV$^2$ to 1.0 GeV$^2$. Sufficient experimental statistics allowed for narrow binning in all kinematic variables, while maintaining a small statistical uncertainty. The extracted cross sections were compared with the corresponding cross sections off free protons, which allowed us to obtain an estimate of the contribution from events in which interactions between the final-state hadrons and the spectator neutron took place.</description>

      <title>Impact of nuclear deformation on collective flow observables in relativistic U+U collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model is used to investigate the efficacy of several flow observables to constrain the initial-state deformation of the Uranium nuclei in U$+$U collisions at nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{\textit{s}_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV. The multiparticle azimuthal cumulant method is used to investigate the sensitivity of (I) a set of quantities that are sensitive to both initial- and final-state effects as well as (II) a set of dimensionless quantities that are more sensitive to initial-state effects to the Uranium nuclei quadrupole shape deformation. We find that the combined use of the flow harmonics, flow fluctuations and correlations, linear and non-linear flow correlations to the quadrangular flow harmonic, and the correlations between elliptic flow and the mean-transverse momentum could serve to constrain the nuclear deformation of the Uranium nuclei. Therefore, a comprehensive set of measurements of such observables can provide a quantifying tool for the quadrupole shape deformation via data-model comparisons.</description>

      <title>Excitation of the $^{229}$Th nucleus by the hole in the inner electronic shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $^{229}$Th nucleus has a long-lived isomeric state $A^*$ at 8.338(24) eV [Kraemer et al, Nature, \textbf{617}, 706 (2023)]. This state is connected to the ground state by an M1 transition. For a hydrogenlike Th ion in the $1s$ state the hyperfine structure splitting is about 0.7 eV. This means that the hyperfine interaction can mix the nuclear ground state with the isomeric state with a mixing coefficient $\beta$ about 0.03. If the electron is suddenly removed from this system, the nucleus will be left in the mixed state. The probability to find the nucleus in the isomeric state $A^*$ is equal to $\beta^2\sim 10^{-3}$. For the $2s$ state the effect is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller. An atom with a hole in the $1s$ or $2s$ shell is similar to the hydrogenlike atom, only the hole has a short lifetime $\tau$. After the hole is filled, there is a non-zero probability to find the nucleus in the $A^*$ state. Estimates of this probability are presented along with a discussion of possible experiments on Th-doped xenotime-type orthophosphate crystals and other broad band gap materials.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-neutrino versus recoil formalism for 4-body phase space and applications to nuclear decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the traditional treatment of radiative corrections that utilizes the "true" neutrino momentum $\vec{p}_\nu$ in the differential decay rate formula could lead to a $\sim \alpha/\pi$ systematic error in certain observables due to the mistreatment of 4-body kinematics. We investigate the theory structure of one of the proposed solutions, the "$\nu'$-formalism", in the non-recoil limit appropriate for neutron and nuclear beta decays. We derive an elegant master formula for the 4-body phase space and use it to re-analyze the spectrum-dependent "outer" radiative corrections to the beta decay of a polarized spin-half nucleus; a complete set of analytic expressions is provided for readers to straightforwardly obtain the final numerical results. We compare it to the "recoil formalism" where the energy of the recoil nucleus is fixed.</description>

      <title>Optical Transmission Enhancement of Ionic Crystals via Superionic Fluoride Transfer: Growing VUV-Transparent Radioactive Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 8 eV first nuclear excited state in $^{229}$Th is a candidate for implementing an nuclear clock. Doping $^{229}$Th into ionic crystals such as CaF$_2$ is expected to suppress non-radiative decay, enabling nuclear spectroscopy and the realization of a solid-state optical clock. Yet, the inherent radioactivity of $^{229}$Th prohibits the growth of high-quality single crystals with high $^{229}$Th concentration; radiolysis causes fluoride loss, increasing absorption at 8 eV. We overcome this roadblock by annealing $^{229}$Th doped CaF$_2$ at 1250$\unicode{x2103}$ in CF$_4$. The technique presented here allows to adjust the fluoride content without crystal melting, preserving its single-crystal structure. Superionic state annealing ensures rapid fluoride distribution, creating fully transparent and radiation-hard crystals. This approach enables control over the charge state of dopants which can be used in deep UV optics, laser crystals, scintillators, and nuclear clocks.</description>
