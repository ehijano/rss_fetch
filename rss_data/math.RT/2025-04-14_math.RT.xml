      <title>Decomposing Multiparameter Persistence Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dey and Xin (J.Appl.Comput.Top., 2022, arXiv:1904.03766) describe an algorithm to decompose finitely presented multiparameter persistence modules using a matrix reduction algorithm. Their algorithm only works for modules whose generators and relations are distinctly graded. We extend their approach to work on \emph{all} finitely presented modules and introduce several improvements that lead to significant speed-ups in practice. Our algorithm is fixed parameter tractable with respect to the maximal number of relations with the same degree and with further optimisation we obtain an $O(n^3)$ algorithm for interval-decomposable modules. In particular, we can decide interval-decomposability in this time. As a by-product to the proofs of correctness we develop a theory of parameter restriction for persistence modules. Our algorithm is implemented as a software library \textsc{aida} which is the first to enable the decomposition of large inputs. We show its capabilities via extensive experimental evaluation.</description>

      <title>On certain Lagrangian subvarieties in minimal resolutions of Kleinian singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kleinian singularities are quotients of $\mathbb{C}^2$ by finite subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$. They are in bijection with the simply-laced Dynkin diagrams via the McKay correspondence. Anti-Poisson involutions and their fixed point loci appear naturally when we want to classify irreducible Harish-Chandra modules over Kleinian singularities. There are three goals of this paper. The first is to classify anti-Poisson involutions of Kleinian singularities up to conjugation by graded Poisson automorphisms. The second is to describe the scheme-theoretic fixed point loci of Kleinian singularities under anti-Poisson involutions. The last and the main goal is to describe the scheme-theoretic preimages of the fixed point loci under minimal resolutions of Kleinian singularities, which are singular Lagrangian subvarieties in the minimal resolutions whose irreducible components are $\mathbb{P}^1$'s and $\mathbb{A}^1$'s.</description>

      <title>Holographic duality from Howe duality: Chern-Simons gravity as an ensemble of code CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the holographic correspondence between 3d "Chern-Simons gravity" and an ensemble of 2d Narain code CFTs. Starting from 3d abelian Chern-Simons theory, we construct an ensemble of boundary CFTs defined by gauging all possible maximal subgroups of the bulk one-form symmetry. Each maximal non-anomalous subgroup is isomorphic to a classical even self-dual error-correcting code over $\mathbb Z_p\times \mathbb Z_p$, providing a way to define a boundary "code CFT." The average over the ensemble of such theories is holographically dual to Chern-Simons gravity, a bulk theory summed over 3d topologies sharing the same boundary. In the case of prime $p$, the sum reduces to that over handlebodies, i.e. becomes the Poincar\'e series akin to that in semiclassical gravity. As the main result of the paper, we show that the mathematical identity underlying this holographic duality can be understood and rigorously proven using the framework of Howe duality over finite fields. This framework is concerned with the representation theory of two commuting groups forming a dual pair: the symplectic group of modular transformations of the boundary, and an orthogonal group mapping codes to each other. Finally, we reformulate the holographic duality as an identity between different averages over quantum stabilizer states, providing an interpretation in terms of quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>On the noncommutative Poisson geometry of certain wild character varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.10117v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To show that certain wild character varieties are multiplicative analogues of quiver varieties, Boalch introduced colored multiplicative quiver varieties. They form a class of (nondegenerate) Poisson varieties attached to colored quivers whose representation theory is controlled by fission algebras: noncommutative algebras generalizing the multiplicative preprojective algebras of Crawley-Boevey and Shaw. Previously, Van den Bergh exploited the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle to prove that the natural Poisson structure of any (non-colored) multiplicative quiver variety is induced by an $H_0$-Poisson structure on the underlying multiplicative preprojective algebra; indeed, it turns out that this noncommutative structure comes from a Hamiltonian double quasi-Poisson algebra constructed from the quiver itself. In this article we conjecture that, via the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle, the natural Poisson structure on each colored multiplicative quiver variety is induced by an $H_0$-Poisson structure on the underlying fission algebra which, in turn, is obtained from a Hamiltonian double quasi-Poisson algebra attached to the colored quiver. We study some consequences of this conjecture and we prove it in two significant cases: the interval and the triangle.</description>

      <title>Harish-Chandra modules for map and affine Lie superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.07517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a classification of simple modules with finite weight multiplicities over basic classical map superalgebras. Any such module is parabolic induced from a simple cuspidal bounded module over a cuspidal map superalgebra. Further on, any simple cuspidal bounded module is isomorphic to an evaluation module. As an application, we obtain a classification of all simple Harish-Chandra modules for basic classical loop superalgebras. Extending these results to affine Kac-Moody Lie superalgebras obtained by adding the degree derivation, we construct a family of bounded simple modules of level zero, and conjecture that all bounded simple cuspidal modules belong to this family. Finally, we show that for affine Kac-Moody Lie superalgebras of type I the Kac induction functor reduces the classification of all simple bounded modules to the classification of the same class of modules over the even part, whose classification is claimed by Dimitrov and Grantcharov.</description>

      <title>Representation theory of the group of automorphisms of a finite rooted tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the ordinary irreducible representations of the group of automorphisms of a finite rooted tree and we get a natural parametrization of them. To achieve this goals, we introduce and study the combinatorics of tree compositions, a natural generalization of set compositions but with new features and more complexity. These combinatorial structures lead to a family of permutation representations which have the same parametrization of the irreducible representations. Our trees are not necessarily spherically homogeneous and our approach is coordinate free.</description>

      <title>Gamma factors and root numbers of pairs for the Galois and the linear model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using harmonic analysis on Harish-Chandra Schwartz spaces of various spherical spaces, we extend a relative local converse theorem of Youngbin Ok for the Galois model of p-adic GLn, from the class of cuspidal representations to that of square integrable representations, which is its optimal form. We also prove a variant of this result for linear models by the same method. The above statements are luckily non empty as we verify triviality results for gamma and epsilon factors of pairs of distinguished representations at the central value s=1/2. Along the way, we offer a new proof of conjectures of D. Prasad and D. Ramakrishnan on local components of symplectic cuspidal automorphic representations, and root numbers of pairs of symplectic representations.</description>

      <title>Representations of $p$-adic groups and orbits with smooth closure in a variety of Langlands parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the forward direction of the conjecture of Gross-Prasad that an L-packet $\Pi_\phi(G)$ contains a generic representation if and only if $L(s, \phi, \mathrm{Ad})$ is regular at $s=1$, by assuming the local Langlands correspondence and the $p$-adic Kazhdan-Lusztig hypothesis. We then prove an analogous statement for ABV-packets, which together with Vogan's conjecture on ABV-packets implies that if Arthur's conjectures for $G$ are known, then one direction of Shahidi's enhanced genericity conjecture holds: If Arthur packet $\Pi_\psi(G)$ contains a generic representation, then $\phi_\psi$ is tempered. We also offer some speculation about the relationship between Arthur type representations, and singularities in varieties of Langlands parameters defined by Vogan. Finally, we recover some facts about central characters using the results above.</description>

      <title>Tropical Fock-Goncharov coordinates for $\mathrm{SL}_3$-webs on surfaces II: naturality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.14202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a companion paper (arXiv 2011.01768), we constructed nonnegative integer coordinates $\Phi_\mathscr{T}(\mathscr{W}_{3, \hat{S}}) \subset \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}^N$ for the collection $\mathscr{W}_{3, \hat{S}}$ of reduced $\mathrm{SL}_3$-webs on a finite-type punctured surface $\hat{S}$, depending on an ideal triangulation $\mathscr{T}$ of $\hat{S}$. We show that these coordinates are natural with respect to the choice of triangulation, in the sense that if a different triangulation $\mathscr{T}^\prime$ is chosen, then the coordinate change map relating $\Phi_\mathscr{T}(\mathscr{W}_{3, \hat{S}})$ to $\Phi_{\mathscr{T}^\prime}(\mathscr{W}_{3, \hat{S}})$ is a tropical $\mathcal{A}$-coordinate cluster transformation. We can therefore view the webs $\mathscr{W}_{3, \hat{S}}$ as a concrete topological model for the Fock-Goncharov-Shen positive integer tropical points $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{PGL}_3, \hat{S}}^+(\mathbb{Z}^t)$.</description>

      <title>Abelian p-groups with a fixed elementary subgroup or with a fixed elementary quotient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In his 1934 paper, G.\ Birkhoff poses the problem of classifying pairs $(G,U)$ where $G$ is an abelian group and $U\subset G$ a subgroup, up to automorphisms of $G$. In general, Birkhoff's Problem is not considered feasible. In this note, we fix a prime number $p$ and assume that $G$ is a direct sum of cyclic $p$-groups and $U\subset G$ is a subgroup. Under the assumption that the factor group $G/U$ is an elementary abelian $p$-group, we show that the pair $(G,U)$ always has a direct sum decomposition into pairs of type $(\mathbb Z/(p^n),\mathbb Z/(p^n))$ or $(\mathbb Z/(p^n), (p))$. Surprisingly, in the dual situation we need an additional condition. If we assume that $U$ itself is an elementary subgroup of $G$, then we show that the pair $(G,U)$ has a direct sum decomposition into pairs of type $(\mathbb Z/(p^n),0)$ or $(\mathbb Z/(p^n), (p^{n-1}))$ if and only if $G/U$ is a~direct sum of cyclic $p$-groups. We generalize the above results to modules over commutative discrete valuation rings.</description>

      <title>Gaussian measure on the dual of $\mathrm{U}(N)$, random partitions, and topological expansion of the partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a Gaussian measure with parameter $q\in(0,1)$ on the dual of the unitary group of size $N$: we prove that a random highest weight under this measure is the coupling of two independent $q$-uniform random partitions $\alpha,\beta$ and a random highest weight of $\mathrm{U}(1)$. We prove deviation inequalities for the $q$-uniform measure, and use them to show that the coupling of random partitions under the Gaussian measure vanishes in the limit $N\to\infty$. We also prove that the partition function of this measure admits an asymptotic expansion in powers of $1/N$, and that this expansion is topological, in the sense that its coefficients are related to the enumeration of ramified coverings of elliptic curves. It provides a rigorous proof of the gauge/string duality for the Yang-Mills theory on a 2D torus with gauge group $\mathrm{U}(N),$ advocated by Gross and Taylor \cite{GT,GT2}.</description>

Abstract: We obtain explicit formulas for capped descendent vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ for descendents given by the exterior algebra of the tautological bundle. This formula provides a one-parametric deformation of the generating function for normalized Macdonald polynomials. In particular, we show that the capped vertex functions are rational functions of the quantum parameter.</description>
