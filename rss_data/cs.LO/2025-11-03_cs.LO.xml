      <title>Internalizing Extensions in Lattices of Type Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many proof assistants allow the use of features and axioms that increase their expressive power. However, these extensions must be used with care, as some combinations are known to lead to logical inconsistencies. Therefore, proof assistants include mechanisms that track which extensions are used in a proof development or module, ensuring that incompatible extensions are not used simultaneously.
  Unfortunately, existing extension tracking mechanisms are external to the type system. This means that we cannot specify precisely which extensions a definition depends on. Having the ability to write more precise specifications means we are not picking an overapproximation of the extensions needed, which prevents reusing definitions in the presence of incompatible extensions. Furthermore, we cannot refer to definitions that use incompatible extensions even if they are never used in inconsistent ways. The reasoning principles of one extension therefore cannot be used as a metatheory to reason about the properties of an incompatible extension.
  In this report, I explore the use of the Dependent Calculus of Indistinguishability (DCOI) by Liu et al. for extension tracking. DCOI is a dependent type system with dependency tracking, where terms and variables are assigned dependency levels alongside their types. These dependency levels form a lattice that describes which levels are permitted to access what. To instead track extensions, each set of extensions would correspond to a dependency level, and the lattice would describe how extensions are permitted to interact.</description>

      <title>Cut-free Deductive System for Continuous Intuitionistic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and develop propositional continuous intuitionistic logic and propositional continuous affine logic via complete algebraic semantics. Our approach centres on AC-algebras, which are algebras $USC(\mathcal{L})$ of sup-preserving functions from $[0,1]$ to an integral commutative residuated complete lattice $\mathcal{L}$ (in the intuitionistic case, $\mathcal{L}$ is a locale). We give an algebraic axiomatisation of AC-algebras in the language of continuous logic and prove, using the Macneille completion, that every Archimedean model embeds into some AC-algebra. We also show that (i) $USC(\mathcal{L})$ satisfies $v \dot + v = 2v$ exactly when $\mathcal{L}$ is a locale, (ii) involutiveness of negation in $USC(\mathcal{L})$ corresponds to that in $\mathcal{L} $, and that (iii) adding those conditions recovers classical continuous logic. For each variant -affine, intuitionistic, involutive, classical -we provide a sequent style deductive system and prove completeness and cut admissibility. This yields the first sequent style formulation of classical continuous logic enjoying cut admissibility.</description>

      <title>The Skolem Problem in rings of positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Skolem Problem is decidable in finitely generated commutative rings of positive characteristic. More precisely, we show that there exists an algorithm which, given a finite presentation of a (unitary) commutative ring $\mathcal{R} = \mathbb{Z}_{/T}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]/I$ of characteristic $T &gt; 0$, and a linear recurrence sequence $(\gamma_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in \mathcal{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$, determines whether $(\gamma_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ contains a zero term. Our proof is based on two recent results: Dong and Shafrir (2025) on the solution set of S-unit equations over $p^e$-torsion modules, and Karimov, Luca, Nieuwveld, Ouaknine, and Worrell (2025) on solving linear equations over powers of two multiplicatively independent numbers. Our result implies, moreover, that the zero set of a linear recurrence sequence over a ring of characteristic $T = p_1^{e_1} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$ is effectively a finite union of $p_i$-normal sets in the sense of Derksen (2007).</description>

      <title>SpotIt: Evaluating Text-to-SQL Evaluation with Formal Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community-driven Text-to-SQL evaluation platforms play a pivotal role in tracking the state of the art of Text-to-SQL performance. The reliability of the evaluation process is critical for driving progress in the field. Current evaluation methods are largely test-based, which involves comparing the execution results of a generated SQL query and a human-labeled ground-truth on a static test database. Such an evaluation is optimistic, as two queries can coincidentally produce the same output on the test database while actually being different. In this work, we propose a new alternative evaluation pipeline, called SpotIt, where a formal bounded equivalence verification engine actively searches for a database that differentiates the generated and ground-truth SQL queries. We develop techniques to extend existing verifiers to support a richer SQL subset relevant to Text-to-SQL. A performance evaluation of ten Text-to-SQL methods on the high-profile BIRD dataset suggests that test-based methods can often overlook differences between the generated query and the ground-truth. Further analysis of the verification results reveals a more complex picture of the current Text-to-SQL evaluation.</description>

      <title>The calculus of neo-Peircean relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The calculus of relations was introduced by De Morgan and Peirce during the second half of the 19th century, as an extension of Boole's algebra of classes. Later developments on quantification theory by Frege and Peirce himself, paved the way to what is known today as first-order logic, causing the calculus of relations to be long forgotten. This was until 1941, when Tarski raised the question on the existence of a complete axiomatisation for it. This question found only negative answers: there is no finite axiomatisation for the calculus of relations and many of its fragments, as shown later by several no-go theorems. In this paper we show that -- by moving from traditional syntax (cartesian) to a diagrammatic one (monoidal) -- it is possible to have complete axiomatisations for the full calculus. The no-go theorems are circumvented by the fact that our calculus, named the calculus of neo-Peircean relations, is more expressive than the calculus of relations and, actually, as expressive as first-order logic. The axioms are obtained by combining two well known categorical structures: cartesian and linear bicategories.</description>

      <title>Building Trustworthy AI by Addressing its 16+2 Desiderata with Goal-Directed Commonsense Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current advances in AI and its applicability have highlighted the need to ensure its trustworthiness for legal, ethical, and even commercial reasons. Sub-symbolic machine learning algorithms, such as the LLMs, simulate reasoning but hallucinate and their decisions cannot be explained or audited (crucial aspects for trustworthiness). On the other hand, rule-based reasoners, such as Cyc, are able to provide the chain of reasoning steps but are complex and use a large number of reasoners. We propose a middle ground using s(CASP), a goal-directed constraint-based answer set programming reasoner that employs a small number of mechanisms to emulate reliable and explainable human-style commonsense reasoning. In this paper, we explain how s(CASP) supports the 16 desiderata for trustworthy AI introduced by Doug Lenat and Gary Marcus (2023), and two additional ones: inconsistency detection and the assumption of alternative worlds. To illustrate the feasibility and synergies of s(CASP), we present a range of diverse applications, including a conversational chatbot and a virtually embodied reasoner.</description>
