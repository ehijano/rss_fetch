      <title>Fundamental role of Dirac supersingletons in particle theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As shown in the famous Dyson's paper "Missed Opportunities", even from purely mathematical considerations (without any physics) it follows that Poincare quantum symmetry is a special degenerate case of de Sitter quantum symmetries. Then the question arises why in particle physics Poincare symmetry works with a very high accuracy. The usual answer to this question is that a theory in de Sitter space becomes a theory in Minkowski space in the formal limit when the radius of de Sitter space goes to infinity. However, de Sitter and Minkowski spaces are purely classical concepts, and in quantum theory the answer to this question must be given only in terms of quantum concepts. At the quantum level, Poincare symmetry is a good approximate symmetry if the eigenvalues of the representation operators M4a of the anti-de Sitter algebra are much greater than the eigenvalues of the representation operator Mab (a, b=0,1,2,3). We show that an explicit solution with such properties exists within the framework of the approach proposed by Flato and Fronsdal where standard elementary particles are bound states of two Dirac singletons.</description>

      <title>Quantum Universe and its Elusive Classicality</title>

Abstract: The article explores challenges presented by revelations in physics and the questions they provoke concerning reality. It sheds light on the disparity between the indefinite nature of quantum reality and our perception of classical reality. The necessity for transition from the quantum to classical reality is underscored, alongside difficulties of observer intervention and the complexities introduced by the objective collapse theory. The work introduces a pioneering approach of decoherence within the framework of universal wave function density matrices. It deploys entanglement among three primary quantum subsystems: mass particles, massless particles, and the human body system. This gives rise to a Von Neumann chain of correlated systems, wherein neglecting one system renders the other two in mixed states. Here the cohered massless system and the animate being constitute subjects of our perceptions. Within the body, the distributions of quantum particle wave packets are highly localized due to entanglement and chemical potential, satisfying the Ehrenfest condition, wherein the thermal deBroglie wavelength scale is considerably smaller than their domain in the body. Thus, each microstate of the body quantum particle ensemble can be analogously represented as a statistical mechanics particle ensemble or likened to microstates in the Debye statistical model. In the statistical mechanics perspective, life represents a macrostate characterized by thermodynamics parameters, and chemical potential. The life macrostate autonomously processes an environment corresponding to a mixed state alternative of its entangled quantum world counterpart, which appears in the stream of consciousness. The quantum universe persists, evolving deterministically, and the classical (macroscopic) universe is its realization statistical by the fundamental predicate of life discerned by the brain; our elusive world.</description>
