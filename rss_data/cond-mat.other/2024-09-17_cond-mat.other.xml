      <title>hklhop: a Selection Tool for Asymmetric Reflections of Spherically Bent Crystal Analysers for High Resolution X-ray Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High resolution, hard x-ray spectroscopy at synchrotron x-ray light sources commonly uses spherically bent crystal analyzers (SBCAs) formed by shaping a single crystal wafer to a spherical backing. These Rowland circle optics are almost always used in a 'symmetric' (or nearly symmetric) configuration wherein the reciprocal lattice vector used for energy selectivity via diffraction is coincident with the normal vector to the curved wafer surface. However, Gironda, et al., recently proposed that asymmetric operation of SBCA, wherein the reciprocal lattice vector is no longer normal to the wafer surface, has significant operational benefits and has been an underutilized opportunity. First, those authors find improved energy resolution through decreased Johann error, or equivalently find increased solid angle at a chosen experimental tolerance for energy broadening. Second, they find productive, high-resolution use of a large number of reciprocal lattice vectors from a single SBCA, thus enabling operation over a wide energy range without need to exchange SBCA upon making large changes in desired photon energy. These observations hold the potential to improve performance, increase flexibility and decrease cost for both laboratory and synchrotron applications. Given these motivations, we report an open-source software package, hklhop, that enables exploration of the complex space of analyzer wafer choice, experimental energy range or ranges, and desired suppression of Johann error. This package can guide both the design and the day-to-day operations of Rowland spectrometers enabled for asymmetric use.</description>

      <title>Universally non-diverging Gr\"uneisen parameter at critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistical mechanics, the thermodynamic response, such as the isothermal susceptibility, at critical points (CPs) presents a divergent-like behavior. An appropriate parameter to probe both classical and quantum CPs is the so-called Gr\"uneisen ratio $\Gamma$. Motivated by the results reported in Phys. Rev. B $\textbf{108}$, L140403 (2023), we extend the quantum version of $\Gamma$ to the non-additive $q$-entropy $S_q$. Our findings indicate that using $S_q$ at the unique value of $q$ restoring the extensivity of the entropy, $\Gamma$ is universally non-diverging at CPs. We unprecedentedly introduce $\Gamma$ in terms of $S_q$, being BG recovered for $q \rightarrow 1$. We thus solve a long-standing problem related to the $\textit{illusory}$ diverging susceptibilities at CPs.</description>

      <title>Competing topological phases in a non-Hermitian time-reversal symmetry-broken Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model, which serves as a cornerstone in the study of the quantum spin Hall insulators, showcases robust spin-filtered helical edge states in a nanoribbon geometry. In the presence of an in-plane magnetic field, these (first-order) helical states gap out to be replaced by second-order corner states under suitable open-boundary conditions. Here, we show that the inclusion of a spin-dependent non-Hermitian balanced gain/loss potential induces a competition between these first and second-order topological phases. Surprisingly, the previously dormant first-order helical edge states in the nanoribbon resurface as the non-Hermitian effect intensifies, effectively neutralizing the role played by the magnetic field. By employing the projected spin spectra and the spin Chern number, we conclusively explain the resurgence of the first-order topological properties in the time-reversal symmetry-broken BHZ model in presence of non-Hermiticity. Finally, the biorthogonal spin-resolved Berry phase, exhibiting a non-trivial winding, definitively establishes the topological nature of these revived edge states, emphasizing the dominance of non-Hermiticity over the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Simulation of depth-dose curves and water equivalent ratios of energetic proton beams in cortical bone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have determined the depth-dose curve, the penetration range, and the water equivalent ratio (WER), for proton beams of clinical energies in cortical bone, by means of a detailed and accurate simulation that combines molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo techniques. The fundamental input quantities (stopping power and energy loss straggling) for the simulation were obtained from a reliable electronic excitation spectrum of the condensed-phase target, which takes into account the organic and mineral phases that form it. Our simulations with these inputs, that are in excellent agreement with the scarce data available for a cortical bone target, deviate from simulations performed using other stopping quantities, such as those provided by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) in its widely used Report 49. The results of this work emphasize the importance of an accurate determination of the stopping quantities of cortical bone in order to advance towards the millimetric precision for the proton penetration ranges and deposited dose needed in radiotherapy.</description>
