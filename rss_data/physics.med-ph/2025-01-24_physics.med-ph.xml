      <title>A simple method for deriving the birdcage coil magnetic field with experimental validation at 4 T, 7 T and 15.2 T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy rely on the magnetic fields generated by radiofrequency volume coils to acquire high-quality data. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of electromagnetic field behavior in RF volume coils is essential for optimizing imaging techniques and designing advanced coils. This study introduces a theoretical model for the magnetic field generated by a birdcage coil, based on a spherical geometry approach. To validate the proposed model, phantom images were acquired at different resonant frequencies, and the magnetic field produced by the RF coil was compared with experimental data. The results demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the theoretical model, offering valuable insights into the behavior of electromagnetic fields in RF coils. This study provides a promising framework for further analysis and development of RF coil design, with significant implications for advancing both MRI and spectroscopy technologies.</description>

Abstract: The complexity of human biology and its intricate systems holds immense potential for advancing human health, disease treatment, and scientific discovery. However, traditional manual methods for studying biological interactions are often constrained by the sheer volume and complexity of biological data. Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its proven ability to analyze vast datasets, offers a transformative approach to addressing these challenges. This paper explores the intersection of AI and microscopy in life sciences, emphasizing their potential applications and associated challenges. We provide a detailed review of how various biological systems can benefit from AI, highlighting the types of data and labeling requirements unique to this domain. Particular attention is given to microscopy data, exploring the specific AI techniques required to process and interpret this information. By addressing challenges such as data heterogeneity and annotation scarcity, we outline potential solutions and emerging trends in the field. Written primarily from an AI perspective, this paper aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers working at the intersection of AI, microscopy, and biology. It summarizes current advancements, key insights, and open problems, fostering an understanding that encourages interdisciplinary collaborations. By offering a comprehensive yet concise synthesis of the field, this paper aspires to catalyze innovation, promote cross-disciplinary engagement, and accelerate the adoption of AI in life science research.</description>

      <title>Particle migration in areas of constricted flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death globally. Among them, some are linked to stenosis, which is an abnormal narrowing of blood vessels, as well as other factors. Smart drug delivery systems based on micro- and nanoparticles are a promising method to offer non/minimal-invasive therapeutic mechanisms. Here we investigate the propensity of particles with different shapes and sizes to drift laterally (marginate) towards an occlusion area in a two-dimensional (2D) parallel plate laminar flow using the Lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM). To verify the outcomes on both sides of the stenosis, a probability of adhesion to the borders was calculated. Analysis was done on the impact of wall-shear stress on both sides of the stenosis. Our results show that non-circular particles migrate in larger amounts and earlier than circular ones.</description>

      <title>Morphing the left atrium geometry: The role of the pulmonary veins on flow patterns and thrombus formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Despite the significant advances made in the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the left atrium (LA) in atrial fibrillation (AF) conditions, the connection between atrial structure, flow dynamics, and blood stagnation in the left atrial appendage (LAA) remains unclear. Deepening our understanding of this relationship would have important clinical implications, as the thrombi formed within the LAA are one of the main causes of stroke.
  Aim: To highlight and better understand the fundamental role of the PV orientation in forming atrial flow patterns and systematically quantifying its effect on blood stasis within the LAA.
  Methods: Two patients with opposite atrial flow patterns were selected for the study. The atria were segmented and subsequently morphed to modify the pulmonary vein (PV) orientations in a highly controlled manner. CFD analysis were performed using a kinematic model able to reproduce AF conditions. Results were projected into the universal left atrial appendage coordinate (ULAAC) system to enhance data visualization and comparison.
  Results: The position of the main atrial vortex can be modified by controlled changes in the PV orientations, which to the best of our knowledge was not demonstrated before. This finding may have important clinical implications, as the behavior and position of the main atrial vortex is crucial to define the LA flow patterns and thus the LAA washing, making possible to assess the stroke risk for a particular patient.</description>

      <title>Robust Simultaneous Multislice MRI Reconstruction Using Deep Generative Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging is a powerful technique for accelerating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions. However, SMS reconstruction remains challenging due to complex signal interactions between and within the excited slices. In this study, we introduce ROGER, a robust SMS MRI reconstruction method based on deep generative priors. Utilizing denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), ROGER begins with Gaussian noise and gradually recovers individual slices through reverse diffusion iterations while enforcing data consistency from measured k-space data within the readout concatenation framework. The posterior sampling procedure is designed such that the DDPM training can be performed on single-slice images without requiring modifications for SMS tasks. Additionally, our method incorporates a low-frequency enhancement (LFE) module to address the practical issue that SMS-accelerated fast spin echo (FSE) and echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences cannot easily embed fully-sampled autocalibration signals. Extensive experiments on both retrospectively and prospectively accelerated datasets demonstrate that ROGER consistently outperforms existing methods, enhancing both anatomical and functional imaging with strong out-of-distribution generalization. The source code and sample data for ROGER are available at https://github.com/Solor-pikachu/ROGER.</description>

      <title>Unified 3D MRI Representations via Sequence-Invariant Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised deep learning has accelerated 2D natural image analysis but remains difficult to translate into 3D MRI, where data are scarce and pre-trained 2D backbones cannot capture volumetric context. We present a sequence-invariant self-supervised framework leveraging quantitative MRI (qMRI). By simulating multiple MRI contrasts from a single 3D qMRI scan and enforcing consistent representations across these contrasts, we learn anatomy-centric rather than sequence-specific features. This yields a robust 3D encoder that performs strongly across varied tasks and protocols. Experiments on healthy brain segmentation (IXI), stroke lesion segmentation (ARC), and MRI denoising show significant gains over baseline SSL approaches, especially in low-data settings (up to +8.3% Dice, +4.2 dB PSNR). Our model also generalises effectively to unseen sites, demonstrating potential for more scalable and clinically reliable volumetric analysis. All code and trained models are publicly available.</description>
