      <title>A general formalism for machine-learning models based on multipolar-spherical harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formulation of descriptors of the local chemical environment, enabling the construction of machine-learning models, is usually obtained by studying the properties of the expansion coefficients of a neighborhood density. In this work, we show that all the transformation properties of the descriptors and their behaviour under rotation, inversion and complex conjugation, are derived from the choice of the basis over which the density is expanded. Furthermore, crucially they are independent from the explicit mathematical form of the neighborhood density. In particular, we show that all the descriptors investigated, can be obtained by an expansion in multipolar spherical harmonics, which constitutes the core of this work, and which is introduced and analysed in great detail. By exploiting the orthogonality and the transformation rules of the multipolar spherical harmonics, we show that several formulations are simplified, such as the one needed to obtain the $\lambda-$SOAP kernel and its properties. We close this work by applying our framework to several multi-body descriptors available in literature, providing an in-depth analysis of their main properties, as made clear from the vantage viewpoint of a basis-centered approach.</description>

      <title>Rothe Time Propagation for Coupled Electronic and Rovibrational Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When time-propagating a wave packet representing a molecular system interacting with strong attosecond laser pulses, one needs to use an approach that is capable of describing intricate coupled electronic-nuclear events that require departure from the conventional adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation. Hence, the propagation should be carried out simultaneously for the electrons and nuclei, treating both particle types on an equal footing \emph{without} invoking the BO approximation. In such calculations, in order to achieve high accuracy, the wave packet needs to be expanded in basis functions that explicitly depend on interparticle distances, such as all-particle explicitly correlated Gaussians (ECGs). In our previous work, we employed basis sets consisting of ECGs with optimizable complex exponential parameters to fit time-dependent wave functions obtained from grid-based propagations of two model systems: a nucleus in a Morse potential and an electron in a central-field Coulomb-like potential, subjected to intense laser pulses. In this work, we present a proof-of-principle study of the time propagation of linear combinations of ECGs for these two models using Rothe's method. It is shown that the approach very closely reproduce the virtually exact results of grid-based propagation for both systems. This provides further evidence that ECGs constitute a viable alternative to purely grid-based simulations of coupled nuclear-electronic dynamics driven by intense laser pulses.</description>

      <title>Investigating ferromagnetic response in monolayer CVD grown MoS$_{2}$ flakes using quantum weak measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We synthesize MoS$_{2}$ atomic layer flakes at different growth conditions to tailor S-terminated and Mo-terminated edge defect states that are investigated for their ferromagnetic response. We leverage quantum weak measurement principles to construct a spin Hall effect of light-based magneto-optic Kerr effect (SHEL-MOKE) setup to sense the ultra-small magnetic response from the synthesized atomic layers. Our findings demonstrate that Mo-terminated edge states are the primary source of ferromagnetic response from MoS$_{2}$ flakes, which is consistent with X-ray photoelectron, Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopic results. In the process, we demonstrate SHEL-MOKE to be a robust technique to investigate ultra weak properties in novel atomic-scale materials.</description>

      <title>Predicting Chemical Reaction Outcomes Based on Electron Movements Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting chemical reaction outcomes and potential byproducts is a fundamental task of modern chemistry, enabling the efficient design of synthetic pathways and driving progress in chemical science. Reaction mechanism, which tracks electron movements during chemical reactions, is critical for understanding reaction kinetics and identifying unexpected products. Here, we present Reactron, the first electron-based machine learning model for general reaction prediction. Reactron integrates electron movement into its predictions, generating detailed arrow-pushing diagrams that elucidate each mechanistic step leading to product formation. We demonstrate the high predictive performance of Reactron over existing product-only models by a large-scale reaction outcome prediction benchmark, and the adaptability of the model to learn new reactivity upon providing a few examples. Furthermore, it explores combinatorial reaction spaces, uncovering novel reactivities beyond its training data. With robust performance in both in- and out-of-distribution predictions, Reactron embodies human-like reasoning in chemistry and opens new frontiers in reaction discovery and synthesis design.</description>

      <title>Distributed implementation of tensor-product selected configuration interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the hybrid "QC+HPC" strategy - where quantum computers screen important determinants, followed by exact diagonalization on classical computers - has shown great potential in the study of strongly correlated systems in quantum chemistry. Last year, an IBM team proposed a novel scheme that utilizes quantum computers to select important bit strings that are then used to construct a spin-adapted determinant space via tensor products. Inspired by this, we have specifically designed a completely new algorithm for this tensor-product selected configuration interaction (SCI). Moreover, for the first time worldwide, we have implemented distributed storage of the CI vector in an SCI program, enabling efficient handling of large-scale computation. Since this study is independent and does not involve determinant selection by quantum computers, we employed our SCI program to conduct full configuration interaction (FCI) computations. Our FCI calculations for N$_2$ (aug-cc-pVDZ) under D$_{2h}$ symmetry and CN (cc-pVTZ) under C$_{2v}$ symmetry, involving $1.47 \times 10^{11}$ and $4.86 \times 10^{11}$ determinants, respectively, exceed the previous record of $2 \times 10^{9}$ determinants computed with the DICE program [J. Chem. Phys. 149, 214110 (2018)] by more than two orders of magnitude. These results set a new benchmark for SCI computations and lay the groundwork for further advancements in SCI methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Using Matrix-Free Tensor Decompositions to Systematically Improve Approximate Tensor-Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a novel means to eliminate the propagation of error in approximated tensor-networks via the exact, matrix-free decomposition of full tensor-networks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, we replace the exact contraction of the particle particle ladder (PPL) tensor diagram in the popular coupled-cluster with single and double excitation (CCSD) method with a low-rank tensor decomposition, namely the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD). In this way, we replace an $\mathcal{O}(N^6)$ tensor contractions with a reduced-scaling $\mathcal{O}(N^5)$ optimization problem. Additionally, we utilize the iterative structure of CCSD to efficiently initialize the CPD optimization, minimizing the cost of the CPD optimization. We show that accurate chemically-relevant energy values can be computed with an error less than 1 kcal/mol using with a CP rank significantly smaller than the effective rank of the popular the tensor hyper-contraction approach. Importantly, this novel method does not rely on cancellation of errors, is not dependent on a specific tensor-network, index (physical) ordering of tensors or the choice of tensor decomposition.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models for Atomistic Simulation of Chemistry and Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the power of large language and large vision models, it is of profound and fundamental interest to ask if a foundational model based on data and parameter scaling laws and pre-training strategies is possible for learned simulations of chemistry and materials. The scaling of large and diverse datasets and highly expressive architectures for chemical and materials sciences should result in a foundation model that is more efficient and broadly transferable, robust to out-of-distribution challenges, and easily fine-tuned to a variety of downstream observables, when compared to specific training from scratch on targeted applications in atomistic simulation. In this Perspective we aim to cover the rapidly advancing field of machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIP), and to illustrate a path to create chemistry and materials MLIP foundation models at larger scale.</description>

      <title>On the generalized eigenvalue problem in subspace-based excited state methods for quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving challenging problems in quantum chemistry is one of the leading promised applications of quantum computers. Within the quantum algorithms proposed for problems in excited state quantum chemistry, subspace-based quantum algorithms, including quantum subspace expansion (QSE), quantum equation of motion (qEOM) and quantum self-consistent equation-of-motion (q-sc-EOM), are promising for pre-fault-tolerant quantum devices. The working equation of QSE and qEOM requires solving a generalized eigenvalue equation with associated matrix elements measured on a quantum computer. Our quantitative analysis of the QSE method shows that the errors in eigenvalues increase drastically with an increase in the condition number of the overlap matrix when a generalized eigenvalue equation is solved in the presence of statistical sampling errors. This makes such methods unstable to errors that are unavoidable when using quantum computers. Further, at very high condition numbers of overlap matrix, the QSE's working equation could not be solved without any additional steps in the presence of sampling errors as it becomes ill-conditioned. It was possible to use the thresholding technique in this case to solve the equation, but the solutions achieved had missing excited states, which may be a problem for future chemical studies. We also show that excited-state methods that have an eigenvalue equation as the working equation, such as q-sc-EOM, do not have such problems and could be suitable candidates for excited-state quantum chemistry calculations using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>A first principles approach to electromechanics in liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromechanics in fluids describes the response of the number density to electric fields, and thus provides a powerful means by which to control the behavior of liquids. While continuum approaches have proven successful in describing electromechanical phenomena in macroscopic bodies, their use is questionable when relevant length scales become comparable to a system's natural correlation lengths, as commonly occurs in, e.g., biological systems, nanopores, and microfluidics. Here, we present a first principles theory for electromechanical phenomena in fluids. Our approach is based on the recently proposed hyperdensity functional theory [Samm\"uller et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 098201 (2024)] in which we treat the charge density as an observable of the system, with the intrinsic Helmholtz free energy functional dependent upon both density and electrostatic potential. Expressions for the coupling between number and charge densities emerge naturally in this formalism, avoiding the need to construct density-dependent and spatially-varying material parameters such as the dielectric constant. Furthermore, we make our theory practical by deriving a connection between hyperdensity functional theory and local molecular field theory, which facilitates machine learning explicit representations for the free energy functionals of systems with short-ranged electrostatic interactions, with long-ranged effects accounted for in a well-controlled mean field fashion.</description>

      <title>Estimating complete basis set extrapolation error through random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method of estimating the uncertainty of a result obtained through extrapolation to the complete basis set limit. The method is based on an ensemble of random walks which simulate all possible extrapolation outcomes that could have been obtained if results from larger basis sets had been available. The results assembled from a large collection of random walks can be then analyzed statistically, providing a route for uncertainty prediction at a confidence level required in a particular application. The method is free of empirical parameters and compatible with any extrapolation scheme. The proposed technique is tested in a series of numerical trials by comparing the determined confidence intervals with reliable reference data. We demonstrate that the predicted error bounds are reliable, tight, yet conservative at the same time.</description>

      <title>Dielectrocapillarity for exquisite control of fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially varying electric fields are prevalent throughout nature and technology, arising from heterogeneity inherent to all physical systems. Inhomogeneous electric fields can originate naturally, such as in nanoporous materials and biological membranes, or be engineered, e.g., with patterned electrodes or layered van der Waals heterostructures. While uniform fields cause free ions to migrate, for polar fluids they simply act to reorient the constituent molecules. In contrast, electric field gradients (EFGs) induce a dielectrophoretic force, offering exquisite electrokinetic control of a fluid, even in the absence of free charge carriers. EFGs, therefore, offer vast potential for optimizing fluid behavior under confinement, such as in nanoporous electrodes, nanofluidic devices, and chemical separation materials. Yet, EFGs remain largely unexplored at the microscopic level owing to the absence of a rigorous, first principles theoretical treatment of electrostrictive effects. By integrating state-of-the-art advances in liquid state theory and deep learning, we reveal how EFGs modulate fluid structure and capillary phenomena. We demonstrate, from first principles, that dielectrophoretic coupling enables tunable control over the liquid-gas phase transition, capillary condensation, and fluid uptake into porous media. Our findings establish "dielectrocapillarity'' -- the use of EFGs to control confined fluids -- as a powerful tool for controlling volumetric capacity in nanopores, which holds immense potential for optimizing energy storage in supercapacitors, selective gas separation, and tunable hysteresis in neuromorphic nanofluidic devices.</description>

      <title>Memory effect by coupling between translational and rotational Brownian motion in water-ethanol mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Brownian motion in water-ethanol mixtures exhibits abnormally large displacements. Using falling-ball viscometry applied to colloidal particles, we experimentally verified that no anomaly exists in the viscosity coefficient of the solution. Our findings reveal that the anomalous Brownian motion can be attributed to the memory effect arising from the coupling between rotational and translational motion. It was deduced that the relaxation time of sub-microsecond rotational motion serves as a memory effect, influencing translational motion and leading to anomalously large Brownian displacements over a timescale of seconds. This study demonstrates that short-time memory effects can be effectively investigated through long-duration measurements.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg dynamics of mixed quantum-classical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of interacting quantum and classical systems in the Heisenberg representation. Unlike the usual construction in standard quantum mechanics, mixed quantum-classical systems involve the interplay of unitary operators acting on the quantum observables and the Lagrangian trajectories sweeping the classical degrees of freedom. This interplay reflects an intricate structure which is made particularly challenging by the backreaction excerpted on the classical trajectories by the quantum degrees of freedom. While the backreaction is underestimated in the common Ehrenfest model, more recent methodologies succeed in capturing this important effect by resorting to Koopman wavefunctions in classical mechanics. Luckily, both Ehrenfest and Koopman models enjoy a variational framework which is exploited here to unfold the geometric structure underlying quantum-classical coupling. A special role is played by the action of the diffeomorphic Lagrangian paths on a non-Abelian pure-gauge potential which comprises statistical correlations. After presenting the treatment in the simple case of Ehrenfest dynamics, we move on to the Koopman model and present the role of the backreaction terms therein. Finally, we compare both models in the context of pure-dephasing systems.</description>

      <title>Numerically Stable Resonating Hartree-Fock</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation of excited states at low computational cost remains an open challenge for electronic structure (ES) methods. While much attention has been given to orthogonal ES methods, relatively little work has been done to develop nonorthogonal ES methods for excited states, particularly those involving nonorthogonal orbital optimization. We present here a numerically stable formulation of the Resonating Hartree-Fock (ResHF) method that uses the matrix adjugate to remove numerical instabilities in ResHF arising from nearly orthogonal orbitals, and we demonstrate improvements to ResHF wavefunction optimization as a result. We then benchmark the performance of ResHF against Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field in the avoided crossing of LiF, the torsional rotation of ethene, and the singlet-triplet energy gaps of a selection of small molecules. ResHF is a promising excited state method because it incorporates the orbital relaxation of state-specific methods, while retaining the correct state crossings of state-averaged approaches. Our open-source ResHF implementation, yucca, is available on GitLab.</description>

      <title>Impact of Parametrizations of the One-Body Reduced Density Matrix on the Energy Landscape</title>

Abstract: Many electronic structure methods rely on the minimization of the energy of the system with respect to the one-body reduced density matrix (1-RDM). To formulate a minimization algorithm, the 1-RDM is often expressed in terms of its eigenvectors via an orthonormal transformation and its eigenvalues. This transformation drastically alters the energy landscape. Especially in 1-RDM functional theory this means that the convexity of the energy functional is lost. We show that degeneracies in the occupation numbers can lead to additional critical points which are classified as saddle points. Using a Cayley or Householder parametrization for the orthonormal transformation, no extra critical points arise. In case of Given's rotations or the exponential, additional critical points can arise, which are of no concern in practical minimization. These findings provide an explanation for the success of recent minimization procedures using second-order information.</description>

      <title>Optimal Symbolic Construction of Matrix Product Operators and Tree Tensor Network Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research introduces an improved framework for constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) and tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), crucial tools in quantum simulations. A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.</description>

      <title>Unsaturated Dinitrogen Difluoride under Pressure: toward high-Energy Density Polymerized NF Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, the polymerisation of the unsaturated cis dinitrogen-difluoride (cis-N2F2) molecular compound is investigated. The thermodynamic, dynamical and thermal stabilities of the nitrogen fluorine NF system are investigated at conditions of 0-3000 K and 0-200 GPa. The cis-N2F2 molecule is a suitable precursor to obtain one-dimensional polymerized nitrogen-fluorine (poly-NF) chains at a pressure above 90 GPa and at a temperature around 1900 K. Importantly, these poly-NF chains can be quenched to room conditions, and potentially serve as a High-energy-density materials (HEDM). It has been established that when Al is utilised as a reducing agent, poly-NF chains exhibit a gravimetric energy density of 13.55 kJ/g, which exceeds that of cubic gauche nitrogen (cg-N, 9.70 kJ/g). This is attributable to the presence of both polymerised nitrogen and strong oxidising F atoms.</description>
