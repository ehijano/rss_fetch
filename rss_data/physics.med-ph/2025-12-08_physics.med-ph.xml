      <title>Fate of gadolinium in inflamed mouse brain: Release and phosphate interaction post-contrast agent administration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mounting evidence for markedly increased cerebellar Gd retention under neuroinflammatory conditions after repeated linear gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) administration in vivo, makes necessary a discrimination between Gd retained within the GBCA complex and forms dissociated form the complex and to characterize the chemical environment of the released Gd$^{3+}$. We employed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy, which enable direct detection of Gd$^{3+}$ release and evaluation of its molecular surroundings in intact cerebellar tissue from inflamed and non-inflamed brain sections exposed to either linear or macrocyclic GBCAs. The experiments were performed on sub-mm brain samples taken after administration of linear gadopentetate and macrocyclic gadobutrol in vivo in a murine multiple sclerosis model and ex vivo in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures under inflammatory conditions. EPR detected {\mu}M range Gd levels in intact cerebellar biopsies and slices and distinguished between complex-bound and released Gd following linear GBCA administration in vivo. In biopsies, we detected by ENDOR phosphorus-containing molecules in the microenvironment of released Gd. Complementary mass spectrometry (MS) and MRI calibration experiments on Gd-spiked homogenized mouse brain tissue were used to assess the relaxation-active fraction of retained Gd evidencing binding to inorganic ligands. Our findings demonstrate inflammation-promoted Gd retention, underscore the importance of integrating in vivo and ex vivo analyses to unravel mechanisms of long-term Gd retention, and suggest that conventional MRI may underestimate the true extent of Gd accumulation, especially under neuroinflammatory conditions.</description>

      <title>Fast and Robust Diffusion Posterior Sampling for MR Image Reconstruction Using the Preconditioned Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: The Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA) in combination with diffusion models can generate high quality MRI reconstructions with uncertainty estimation from highly undersampled k-space data. However, sampling methods such as diffusion posterior sampling or likelihood annealing suffer from long reconstruction times and the need for parameter tuning. The purpose of this work is to develop a robust sampling algorithm with fast convergence.
  Theory and Methods: In the reverse diffusion process used for sampling the posterior, the exact likelihood is multiplied with the diffused prior at all noise scales. To overcome the issue of slow convergence, preconditioning is used. The method is trained on fastMRI data and tested on retrospectively undersampled brain data of a healthy volunteer.
  Results: For posterior sampling in Cartesian and non-Cartesian accelerated MRI the new approach outperforms annealed sampling in terms of reconstruction speed and sample quality.
  Conclusion: The proposed exact likelihood with preconditioning enables rapid and reliable posterior sampling across various MRI reconstruction tasks without the need for parameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Functional dual-slope frequency-domain near-infrared spectroscopy data interpreted with two- and three-layer models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is impacted by signal contamination from superficial hemodynamics. It is important to develop methods that account for such contamination and provide accurate measurements of cerebral hemodynamics. This work aims to investigate whether simulated data with two-layer or three-layer tissue models are able to reproduce in vivo data collected with dual-slope (DS) frequency-domain (FD) near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) on human subjects during brain activation. We performed Monte Carlo simulations to generate DS FD-NIRS data from two- and three-layer media with a range of layer thicknesses and optical properties. We collected in vivo data with DS FD-NIRS (source-detector distances: 25, 37 mm; wavelengths: 690, 830 nm; modulation frequency: 140 MHz) over the occipital lobe of human subjects during visual stimulation. Simulated and in vivo data were analyzed with diffusion theory for a homogeneous medium and results were compared for each DS FD-NIRS data type. We found that the main qualitative features of in vivo data could be reproduced by simulated data from a three-layer medium, with a second layer (representing the cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space) that is less absorbing and less scattering than the other two layers, and with a top layer thickness that represents the combined scalp and skull thickness. A three-layer model is a viable improvement over a homogeneous model to analyze DS FD-NIRS data (or any other fNIRS data) to generate more accurate measurements of cerebral hemodynamic changes without a need for large data sets for tomographic reconstructions.</description>

      <title>CATNUS: Coordinate-Aware Thalamic Nuclei Segmentation Using T1-Weighted MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of thalamic nuclei from magnetic resonance images is important due to the distinct roles of these nuclei in overall brain function and to their differential involvement in neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, segmentation remains challenging given the small size of many nuclei, limited intrathalamic contrast and image resolution, and inter-subject anatomical variability. In this work, we present CATNUS (Coordinate-Aware Thalamic Nuclei Segmentation), segmenting 13 thalamic nuclei (or nuclear groups) using a 3D U-Net architecture enhanced with coordinate convolution layers, which provide more precise localization of both large and small nuclei. To support broad clinical applicability, we provide pre-trained model variants that can operate on quantitative T1 maps as well as on widely used magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) and fast gray matter acquisition T1 inversion recovery (FGATIR) sequences. We benchmarked CATNUS against established methods, including FreeSurfer, THOMAS and HIPS-THOMAS, demonstrating improved segmentation accuracy and robust test-retest reliability across multiple nuclei. Furthermore, CATNUS demonstrated strong out-of-distribution generalization on traveling-subject datasets spanning multiple scanners, field strengths, and vendors, producing reliable and anatomically coherent segmentations across diverse acquisition conditions. Overall, CATNUS provides an accurate and generalizable solution for thalamic nuclei segmentation, with strong potential to facilitate large-scale neuroimaging studies and support real-world clinical assessment.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis-Based Particle Detection for Accurate Nanoparticle Counting and Digital Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital assays represent a shift from traditional diagnostics and enable the precise detection of low-abundance analytes, critical for early disease diagnosis and personalized medicine, through discrete counting of biomolecular reporters. Within this paradigm, we present a particle counting algorithm for nanoparticle based imaging assays, formulated as a multiple-hypothesis statistical test under an explicit image-formation model and evaluated using a penalized likelihood rule. In contrast to thresholding or machine learning methods, this approach requires no training data or empirical parameter tuning, and its outputs remain interpretable through direct links to imaging physics and statistical decision theory.
  Through numerical simulations we demonstrate robust count accuracy across weak signals, variable backgrounds, magnification changes and moderate PSF mismatch. Particle resolvability tests further reveal characteristic error modes, including under-counting at very small separations and localized over-counting near the resolution limit. Practically, we also confirm the algorithm's utility, through application to experimental dark-field images comprising a nanoparticle-based assay for detection of DNA biomarkers derived from SARS-CoV-2. Statistically significant differences in particle count distributions are observed between control and positive samples. Full count statistics obtained further exhibit consistent over-dispersion, and provide insight into non-specific and target-induced particle aggregation. These results establish our method as a reliable framework for nanoparticle-based detection assays in digital molecular diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Insights into Exchange and Restriction in Gray Matter Diffusion MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biophysical models in diffusion MRI (dMRI) hold promise for characterizing gray matter tissue microstructure. Yet, the reliability of their parameter estimates remains largely under-studied, especially in models that incorporate water exchange. In this study, we investigate the accuracy, precision, and presence of degeneracy of two recently proposed gray matter models, NEXI and SANDIX, using established acquisition protocols, on both simulated and \textit{in vivo} data. We employ $\mu$GUIDE, a Bayesian inference framework based on deep learning, to quantify parameter uncertainty and detect degeneracies, enabling a more interpretable assessment of model fits. Our results show that while some microstructural parameters, such as extra-cellular diffusivity and neurite signal fraction, are robustly estimated, others, including exchange time and soma radius, are often associated with high uncertainty and estimation bias, particularly under realistic noise conditions and reduced acquisition protocols. Comparison with non-linear least squares fitting highlights the critical advantage of uncertainty-aware methods: the ability to flag and filter out unreliable estimates. Together, these findings emphasize the need to report uncertainty and account for model degeneracies when interpreting model-based estimates. Our study advocates for the integration of probabilistic fitting approaches into imaging pipelines to improve reproducibility and biological interpretability.</description>

      <title>OPTIKS: Optimized Gradient Properties Through Timing in K-Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A customizable method (OPTIKS) for designing fast trajectory-constrained gradient waveforms with optimized time domain properties was developed. Given a specified multidimensional k-space trajectory, the method optimizes traversal speed (and therefore timing) with position along the trajectory. OPTIKS facilitates optimization of objectives dependent on the time domain gradient waveform and the arc-length domain k-space speed. OPTIKS is applied to design waveforms which limit peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), minimize mechanical resonance excitation, and reduce acoustic noise. A variety of trajectory examples are presented including spirals, circular echo-planar-imaging, and rosettes. Design performance is evaluated based on duration, standardized PNS models, field measurements, gradient coil back-EMF measurements, and calibrated acoustic measurements. We show reductions in back-EMF of up to 94% and field oscillations up to 91.1%, acoustic noise decreases of up to 9.22 dB, and with efficient use of PNS models speed increases of up to 11.4%. The design method implementation is made available as an open source Python package through GitHub.</description>
