      <title>Probing galaxy evolution from $z=0$ to $z\simeq10$ through galaxy scaling relations in three L-Galaxies flavours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive examination of the three most recent versions of the L-Galaxies semi-analytic galaxy formation model, focusing on the evolution of galaxy properties across a broad stellar mass range ($10^7\:{\rm M}_{\odot}\lesssim{M_\star}\lesssim10^{12}\:{\rm M}_{\odot}$) from $z=0$ to $z\simeq10$. We compare the predictions with the latest multiband data from key astronomical surveys, including SDSS, CANDELS, and COSMOS along with HST, JWST, and ALMA. We assess the models' ability to reproduce various time-dependent galaxy scaling relations for star-forming and quenched galaxies. Key focus areas include global galaxy properties such as stellar mass functions, cosmic star formation rate density, and the evolution of the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. Additionally, we examine resolved morphological properties such as the galaxy mass-size relation, alongside core $(R&lt;1\,{\rm{kpc}})$ and effective $(R&lt;R_{\rm{e}})$ stellar-mass surface densities as a function of stellar mass. This analysis reveals that the \textsc{L-Galaxies} models are in qualitatively good agreement with observed global galaxy scaling relations up to $z\simeq10$. However, significant discrepancies exist at both low and high redshifts in accurately reproducing the number density, size, and surface density evolution of quenched galaxies. These issues are most pronounced for massive galaxies, where the simulations underpredict the abundance of quenched galaxies at $z\geq1.5$, reaching a discrepancy of a factor of 60 by $z\approx3$, with sizes several times larger than observed. Therefore, we propose that the physical prescriptions governing the cessation of star formation in galaxies, such as AGN feedback and processes related to merging, require improvement to be better supported by observational data.</description>

      <title>The BoRG-$JWST$ Survey: Abundance and Mass-to-light Ratio of Luminous $z=7-9$ Galaxies from Independent Sight Lines with NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new results on the rest-frame UV luminosity function (UVLF) and stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratio of bright (M$_{\rm UV}\lesssim-20$ mag) spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at $z=7-9$ derived from the BoRG-$JWST$ survey, a unique data set of NIRSpec prism follow up of $HST$-selected sources from random-pointing imaging. By selecting galaxies from over 200 independent sight lines, the survey minimizes cosmic variance ensuring a statistically robust sample of the bright-galaxy population during the epoch of reionization. The data is used to constrain, for the first time, the bright end of the UVLF at $z=7-9$ from spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies over eight independent fields. We find that the bright end of the UVLF is higher than found using imaging over $JWST$ legacy fields, suggesting the latter may be significantly affected by cosmic variance, and thus reducing the tension with recent findings from $JWST$ at $z&gt;10$ and comparable to models invoking little dust attenuation and bursty star formation. Additionally, we use the galaxies' $JWST$ spectra to infer their stellar masses and M/L ratios relative to other $HST$ and $JWST$ studies. We show that the stellar mass scales almost linearly with UV luminosity (M$_* \propto L_{\rm UV}^{0.85\pm0.12}$), albeit with large ($\sim0.5$ dex) intrinsic scatter, consistent with stochastic bursts of star formation in early galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>An HI-absorption-selected cold rotating disk galaxy at $z\approx2.193$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to map CO(3-2) emission from a galaxy, DLA-B1228g, associated with the high-metallicity damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorber at $z \approx 2.1929$ towards the QSO PKS B1228-113. At an angular resolution of $\approx0.32''\times0.24''$, DLA-B1228g shows extended CO(3-2) emission with a deconvolved size of $\approx0.78''\times0.18''$, i.e. a spatial extent of $\approx6.4$ kpc. We detect extended stellar emission from DLA-B1228g in a Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 F160W image, and find that H$\alpha$ emission is detected in a Very Large Telescope SINFONI image from only one side of the galaxy. While the clumpy nature of the F160W emission and the offset between the kinematic and physical centers of the CO(3-2) emission are consistent with a merger scenario, this appears unlikely due to the lack of strong H$\alpha$ emission, the symmetric double-peaked CO(3-2) line profile, the high molecular gas depletion timescale, and the similar velocity dispersions in the two halves of the CO(3-2) image. Kinematic modelling reveals that the CO(3-2) emission is consistent with arising from an axisymmetric rotating disk, with an exponential profile, a rotation velocity of $v_{rot}=328\pm7$ km s$^{-1}$, and a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{v}=62\pm7$ km s$^{-1}$. The high value of the ratio $v_{rot}/\sigma_v$, $\approx5.3$, implies that DLA-B1228g is a rotation-dominated cold disk galaxy, the second case of a high-$z$ HI-absorption-selected galaxy identified with a cold rotating disk. We obtain a dynamical mass of $M_{dyn}= (1.5\pm0.1)\times10^{11}~M_\odot$, similar to the molecular gas mass of $\approx10^{11} M_\odot$ inferred from earlier CO(1-0) studies; this implies that the galaxy is baryon-dominated in its inner regions.</description>

      <title>A Pride of Satellites in the Constellation Leo? Discovery of the Leo VI Milky Way Satellite Galaxy with DELVE Early Data Release 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of an ultra-faint Milky Way (MW) satellite in the constellation of Leo. This system was discovered as a spatial overdensity of resolved stars observed with Dark Energy Camera (DECam) data from an early version of the third data release of the DECam Local Volume Exploration survey (DELVE EDR3). The low luminosity ($M_V = -3.56_{-0.37}^{+0.47}$; $L_V = 2300_{-800}^{+1000} L_\odot$), large size ($r_{1/2} = 90_{-30}^{+30}$ pc), and large heliocentric distance ($D = 111_{-4}^{+7}$ kpc) are all consistent with the population of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs). Using Keck/DEIMOS observations of the system, we were able to spectroscopically confirm 11 member stars, while measuring a mass to light ratio of $1000_{-700}^{+1900} M_\odot/L_\odot$ and a non-zero metallicity dispersion of $\sigma_{[\rm Fe/H]}=0.33_{-0.14}^{+0.19}$, further confirming Leo VI's identity as an UFD. While the system has an highly elliptical shape, $\epsilon = 0.54_{-0.29}^{+0.19}$, we do not find any evidence that it is tidally disrupting. Moreover, despite its apparent on-sky proximity to members of the proposed Crater-Leo infall group, its relatively lower heliocentric distance and inconsistent position in energy-angular momentum space with the other group members make it unlikely for it to be part of the proposed infall group.</description>

      <title>New constraints on the central mass contents of Omega Centauri from combined stellar kinematics and pulsar timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a combined analysis of stellar kinematics and line-of-sight accelerations of millisecond pulsars to investigate the mass contents of Omega Centauri. We consider multiple mass components: the visible photometric distribution, a central cluster of dark remnants, an intermediate-mass black hole, and a distribution of intermediate extension traced by the pulsars. By self-consistently incorporating multiple independent datasets, including the effects of different centers, we obtain significant constraints on these mass distributions. Our results strongly favor an extended central mass of ~ 2 - 3 x 10^5 Msun, emulating a cluster of heavy stellar remnants, over an IMBH, with a 3-sigma upper limit of 6 x 10^3 Msun on its mass. Pulsar timing observations provide significant constraints, favoring a central mass distribution that is ~ 20% more massive and extended. Notably, we observe a clear linear scaling between the pulsar distribution and stellar encounter rates, showing excellent agreement with the expectation from millisecond pulsar formation models and motivating a profile for their distribution, providing the first validation of its kind where positions are linked to their place of formation in globular clusters. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of this novel methodology in exploring the structure of star clusters, setting a promising precedent amid the advent of the rapidly growing number of observations and discoveries currently being experienced in this field.</description>

      <title>Inverse Raman scattering and the diffuse interstellar bands: an exploration of the systemic interconnections between spontaneous and inverse Raman scattering and extended red emission, Red Rectangle bands, and diffuse interstellar bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First identified in 1964, inverse Raman scattering (IRS) is a nonlinear stimulated phenomenon that induces Raman scattered absorptions where Raman emissions would be expected. While IRS is less well-known than stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), this study highlights its significance in analyzing the spectra of stars located in the distant background of HI interstellar clouds. Specifically, ultraviolet emission lines Raman scattered by atomic hydrogen, typically observed in emission at wide scattering angles in the optical spectra of symbiotic stars and nebulae, should appear as IRS absorption features in the optical spectra of the background stars. I show that all known interstellar Raman scattered emission lines in the H-alpha wavelength region are detected in absorption as diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) in the spectra of reddened stars, and conclude that IRS by atomic hydrogen resolves the longstanding puzzle of the processes involved in producing these bands, and perhaps also explains the equally mysterious 2200A bump of ultraviolet extinction curves. This identification of DIBs as IRS HI absorptions sheds new light on the perplexing relationship between DIBs and the Red Rectangle nebula emission bands (RRBs).
  The conditions under which DIBs are detected highlight the importance of considering the physical relationship between the observer, the HI medium, and the direction of the illuminating radiation field (i.e., the geometry of the observation) in observations of HI interstellar matter. Observing in the direction of the radiation field or on its side determines whether IRS, yielding DIBs and the 2200A bump, or spontaneous Raman scattering at wide scattering angles, resulting in ERE, Raman scattered emission lines (including RRBs), and the unidentified infrared bands, will be observed.</description>

      <title>Is quasar variability regulated by the close environment of accretion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UV/optical variability in quasars is a well-observed phenomenon, yet its primeval origins remain unclear. This study investigates whether the accretion disk turbulence, which is responsible for UV/optical variability, is influenced by the close environment of the accretion by analyzing the correlation between variability and infrared emission for two luminous SDSS quasar samples. The first sample includes light curves from SDSS, Pan-STARRS, and ZTF $g$ band photometry, while the second sample utilizes SDSS Stripe 82 $g$ band light curves. We explore the correlation between the $g$ band excess variance ($\sigma_{rms}$) and the wavelength-dependent infrared covering factor ($L_{\rm IR}(\lambda)/L_{\rm bol}$), controlling for the effects of redshift, luminosity, and black hole mass. An anti-correlation between two variables is observed in both samples, which is strongest at wavelengths of 2-3$\mu$m but gradually weakens towards longer wavelength. This suggests the equatorial dusty torus (which dominates near-infrared emission) plays a significant role in influencing the UV/optical variability, while the cooler polar dust (which contributes significantly to mid-infrared emission) does not. The findings indicate that quasar variability may be connected to the physical conditions within the dusty torus which feeds the accretion, and support the notion that the close environment of the accretion plays an important role in regulating the accretion disk turbulence.</description>

      <title>A study of the dynamical structures in a Dark Matter Halo using UMAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a dimension reduction algorithm, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), to study dynamical structures inside a dark matter halo. We use a zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way mass dark matter halo, and apply UMAP on the 6 dimensional phase space in the dark matter field at z = 0. We find that particles in the field are mapped to distinct clusters in the lower dimensional space in a way that is closely related to their accretion history. The largest cluster in UMAP space does not contain the entire mass of the Milky Way virial region and neatly separates the older halo from the recently accreted matter. Particles within this cluster, which only comprise $\sim 70\%$ of the Milky Way particles, have had several pericenter passages and are, therefore, likely to be phase mixed, becoming dynamically uniform. The infall region and recently accreted particle and substructure, even up to splashback, form distinct components in the lower dimensional space; additionally, higher angular momentum particles also take longer times to mix. Our work shows that the current state of the Milky Way halo retains historical information, particularly about the recent accretion history, and even a relatively old structure is not dynamically uniform. We also explore UMAP as a pre-processing step to find coherent subhalos in dark matter simulations.</description>

      <title>Dark Dwarfs: Dark Matter-Powered Sub-Stellar Objects Awaiting Discovery at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of dark matter annihilation on objects with masses close to the sub-stellar limit, finding that the minimum mass for stable hydrogen burning is larger than the $\sim0.075 M_\odot $ value predicted in the Standard Model. Below this limit, cooling brown dwarfs evolve into stable dark matter-powered objects that we name dark dwarfs. The timescale of this transition depends on the ambient dark matter density $\rho_{\rm DM}$ and circular velocity $v_{\rm DM}$ but is independent of the dark matter mass. We predict a population of dark dwarfs close to the galactic center, where the dark matter density is expected to be $\rho_{\rm DM}\gtrsim 10^{3}$ GeV/cm$^3$. At larger galactic radii the dark matter density is too low for these objects to have yet formed within the age of the universe. Dark dwarfs retain their initial lithium-7 in mass ranges where brown/red dwarfs would destroy it, providing a method for detecting them.</description>

      <title>Diverse dark matter haloes in Two-field Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) is a compelling candidate for dark matter, offering a natural explanation for the structure of diffuse low-mass haloes. However, the canonical FDM model with a mass of $10^{-22}~{\rm eV}$ encounters challenges in reproducing the observed diversity of dwarf galaxies, except for possibly scenarios where strong galactic feedback is invoked. The introduction of multiple-field FDM can provide a potential resolution to this diversity issue. The theoretical plausibility of this dark matter model is also enhanced by the fact that multiple axion species with logarithmically-distributed mass spectrum exist as a generic prediction of string theory. In this paper we consider the axiverse hypothesis and investigate non-linear structure formation in the two-field fuzzy dark matter (2FDM) model. Our cosmological simulation with an unprecedented resolution and self-consistent initial conditions reveals the diverse structures of dark matter haloes in the 2FDM model for the first time. Depending on the formation time and local tidal activities, late-time haloes can host solitons of nested cores or solitons of one dominant species.</description>

      <title>Measuring the ICM velocity structure within the A3266 galaxy cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the velocity structure of the hot intracluster medium (ICM) within the A3266 galaxy cluster, including new observations taken between June and November 2023. Firstly, morphological structures within the galaxy cluster were examined using a Gaussian Gradient Magnitude (GGM) and adaptively smoothed GGM filter applied to the EPIC-pn X-ray image. Then, we applied a novel {\it XMM-Newton} EPIC-pn energy scale calibration, which uses instrumental Cu K$\alpha$ as reference for the line emission, to measure line-of-sight velocities of the hot gas within the system. This approach enabled us to create two-dimensional projected maps for velocity, temperature, and metallicity, showing that the hot gas displays a redshifted systemic velocity relative to the cluster redshift across all fields of view. Further analysis of the velocity distribution through non-overlapping circular regions demonstrated consistent redshifted velocities extending up to 1125 kpc from the cluster core. Additionally, the velocity distribution was assessed along regions following surface brightness discontinuities, where we observed redshifted velocities in all regions, with the largest velocities reaching $768 \pm 284$ km/s. Moreover, we computed the velocity Probability Density Function (PDF) from the velocity map. We applied a normality test, finding that the PDF adheres to an unimodal normal distribution consistent with theoretical predictions. Lastly, we computed a velocity structure function (VSF) for this system using the measured line-of-sight velocities. These insights advance our understanding of the dynamic processes within the A3266 galaxy cluster and contribute to our broader knowledge of ICM behavior in merging galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Detection of a new sample of Galactic White Dwarfs in the direction of the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) in identifying and characterizing white dwarfs (WDs) within the Milky Way Galaxy. Leveraging the UVIT point source catalogue towards SMC and crossmatching with Gaia DR3 data, we identified 43 single WDs (37 new detections), 13 new WD+main sequence (MS) candidates and 161 UV bright MS stars by analysing their Spectral Energy Distributions (SED). Using the WD evolutionary models, we determine the masses, effective temperatures, and cooling ages of these identified WDs. Masses of these WDs range from 0.2 to 1.3 M$_{\odot}$ and effective temperatures (T$_{eff}$) between 10000 K to 15000 K, with cooling ages spanning 0.1 to 2 Gyr. Notably, we detect hotter WDs compared to literature values, which is attributed to the sensitivity of UVIT. Furthermore, we report the detection of 20 new extremely low-mass (ELM) candidates from our analysis. Future spectroscopic studies of the ELM candidates will help us understand the formation scenarios of these exotic objects. Despite limitations in Gaia DR3 distance measurements for optically faint WDs, we provide a crude estimate of the WD space density within 1kpc as 1.3 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ pc$^{-3}$, which is higher than previous estimates in the literature. Our results underscore the instrumental capabilities of UVIT and anticipate the forthcoming UV missions like INSIST for systematic WD discovery. Our methodology sets a precedent for future analyses in other UVIT fields to find more WDs and perform spectroscopic studies to verify their candidacy.</description>

      <title>Host Galaxy Properties of Gamma-ray Bursts Involving Neutron Star Binary Mergers and Its Impact on Kilonovae Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the upcoming gravitational wave (GW) observing runs, identifying host galaxies is crucial as it provides essential redshift information and enables the use of GW events as standard sirens. However, pinpointing host galaxies remains challenging due to the large localization uncertainties and the rapidly fading nature of their optical counterparts. Analyzing the host galaxies of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) offers an alternative approach to deepen our understanding of the environments where binary neutron stars (BNS) primarily merge. This study compiles archival photometric data for the host galaxies of 76 sGRBs and 4 hybrid GRBs that are long GRBs accompanied by kilonova-like signals. We use this data to evaluate their physical properties through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. To assess the characteristics of the host galaxies, we utilized a volume-limited sample ($z&lt;0.5$) from the COSMOS field as a control group. Contrary to expectations that the BNS merger rate is proportional to host stellar mass, the short and hybrid GRB population appears less massive than the mass-weighted distribution of the control sample. Instead, we propose a formulation for the expected BNS merger rate from a galaxy as $\log(n_{\mathrm{BNS}}/\mathrm{Gyr}) = 0.86 \times \log(M_*/M_{\odot}) + 0.44 \times \log(\mathrm{sSFR}/\mathrm{yr}) + 0.857$, which optimally explains the deviation between the stellar mass distributions of the GRB host galaxies and the control sample. These insights provide a strategic framework for targeted GW follow-ups and enhance our ability to identify potential host galaxies for future GW events.</description>

      <title>Searching for Pulsars, Magnetars, and Fast Radio Bursts in the Sculptor Galaxy using MeerKAT</title>

Abstract: The Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253), located in the Southern Hemisphere, far off the Galactic Plane, has a relatively high star-formation rate of about 7 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and hosts a young and bright stellar population, including several super star clusters and supernova remnants. It is also the first galaxy, apart from the Milky Way Galaxy to be associated with two giant magnetar flares. As such, it is a potential host of pulsars and/or fast radio bursts in the nearby Universe. The instantaneous sensitivity and multibeam sky coverage offered by MeerKAT therefore make it a favourable target. We searched for pulsars, radio-emitting magnetars, and fast radio bursts in NGC 253 as part of the TRAPUM large survey project with MeerKAT. We did not find any pulsars during a four-hour observation, and derive a flux density limit of 4.4 $\mu$Jy at 1400 MHz, limiting the pseudo-luminosity of the brightest putative pulsar in this galaxy to 54 Jy kpc$^2$. Assuming universality of pulsar populations between galaxies, we estimate that detecting a pulsar as bright as this limit requires NGC 253 to contain a pulsar population of $\gtrsim$20 000. We also did not detect any single pulses and our single pulse search flux density limit is 62 mJy at 1284\,MHz. Our search is sensitive enough to have detected any fast radio bursts and radio emission similar to the brighter pulses seen from the magnetar SGR J1935+2154 if they had occurred during our observation.</description>

      <title>Metrics of Astrometric Variability in the International Celestial Reference Frame: I. Statistical analysis and selection of the most variable sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using very long baseline interferometry data for the sources that comprise the third International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF3), we examine the quality of the formal source position uncertainties of ICRF3 by determining the excess astrometric variability (unexplained variance) for each source as a function of time. We also quantify multiple qualitatively distinct aspects of astrometric variability seen in the data, using a variety of metrics. Average position offsets, statistical dispersion measures, and coherent trends over time as explored by smoothing the data are combined to characterize the most and least positionally stable ICRF3 sources. We find a notable dependence of the excess variance and statistical variability measures on declination, as is expected for unmodeled ionospheric delay errors and the northern hemisphere dominated network geometries of most astrometric and geodetic observing campaigns.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic survey of faint planetary-nebula nuclei VI. Seventeen hydrogen-rich central stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of 17 H-rich central stars of planetary nebulae (PNe) observed in our spectroscopic survey of nuclei of faint Galactic PNe carried out at the 10-m Hobby-Eberly Telescope. Our sample includes ten O(H) stars, four DAO white dwarfs (WDs), two DA WDs, and one sdOB star. The spectra were analyzed by means of NLTE model atmospheres, allowing us to derive the effective temperatures, surface gravities, and He abundances of the central stars. Sixteen of them were analyzed for the first time, increasing the number of hot H-rich central stars with parameters obtained through NLTE atmospheric modeling by approximately 20%. We highlight a rare hot DA WD central star, Abell 24, which has a $T_\mathrm{eff}$ likely in excess of 100kK, as well as the unusually high gravity mass of $0.70 \pm 0.05 \mathrm{M}_\odot$ for the sdOB star Pa 3, which is significantly higher than the canonical extreme horizontal-branch star mass of $\approx 0.48\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. By investigating Zwicky Transient Facility light curves, which were available for our 15 northern objects, we found none of them show a periodic photometric variability larger than a few hundredths of a magnitude. This could indicate that our sample mainly represents the hottest phase during the canonical evolution of a single star when transitioning from an asymptotic giant branch star into a WD. We also examined the spectral energy distributions, detecting an infrared excess in six of the objects, which could be due to a late-type companion or to hot ($\approx 10^3$ K) and\or cool ($\approx 100$ K) dust. We confirm previous findings that spectroscopic distances are generally higher than found through Gaia astrometry, a discrepancy that deserves to be investigated systematically.</description>

      <title>Effects of multi-channel AGN feedback in FIRE cosmological simulations of massive galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feedback from supermassive black holes is believed to be a critical driver of the observed color bimodality of galaxies above the Milky Way mass scale. AGN feedback has been modeled in many galaxy formation simulations, but most implementations have involved simplified prescriptions or a coarse-grained interstellar medium (ISM). We present the first set of FIRE-3 cosmological zoom-in simulations with AGN feedback evolved to $z\sim0$, examining the impact of AGN feedback on a set of galaxies with halos in the mass range $10^{12}-10^{13} M_{\odot}$. These simulations combine detailed stellar and ISM physics with multi-channel AGN feedback including radiative feedback, mechanical outflows, and in some simulations, cosmic rays (CRs). We find that massive (&gt;L*) galaxies in these simulations can match local scaling relations including the stellar mass-halo mass relation and the $M_{\rm BH}$-$\sigma$ relation; in the stronger model with CRs, they also match the size-mass relation and the Faber-Jackson relation. Many of the massive galaxies in the simulations with AGN feedback have quenched star formation and elliptical morphologies, in qualitative agreement with observations. In contrast, simulations at the massive end without AGN feedback produce galaxies that are too massive and form stars too rapidly, are order-of-magnitude too compact, and have velocity dispersions well above Faber-Jackson. Despite these successes, the AGN models analyzed do not produce uniformly realistic galaxies when the feedback parameters are held constant: while the stronger model produces the most realistic massive galaxies, it tends to over-quench the lower-mass galaxies. This indicates that further refinements of the AGN modeling are needed.</description>

Abstract: We present and discuss the results of the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) HI 21-cm line mapping for five isolated low-mass (M_bary ~(2--8)*10^7 Mo) eXtremely Metal Poor (XMP) dwarfs [12+log(O/H)=7.13-7.28], selected from the Nearby Void Galaxy (NVG) sample. All the studied void dwarfs show the disturbed morphology in the HI maps with the angular resolutions of ~11" to ~40". We examine the HI morphology and velocity field and the relative orientation of their stellar and gas body spins. We discuss the overall non-equilibrium state of their gas and the possible origin and evolution of the studied void dwarfs. The most straightforward interpretation of the ubiquitous phenomenon of the gas component non-equilibrium state in these and similar void dwarfs is the cold accretion from the void filaments and/or minor mergers. The cold gas accretion in voids could be linked to the presence of small filaments that constitute the substructure of voids.</description>

      <title>The detection and characterization of highly magnified stars with JWST: Prospects of finding Population III</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing may render individual high-mass stars detectable out to cosmological distances, and several extremely magnified stars have in recent years been detected out to redshifts $z\approx 6$. Here, we present Muspelheim, a model for the evolving spectral energy distributions of both metal-enriched and metal-free stars at high redshifts. Using this model, we argue that lensed stars should form a highly biased sample of the intrinsic distribution of stars across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and that this bias will typically tend to favour the detection of lensed stars in evolved stages characterized by low effective temperatures, even though stars only spend a minor fraction of their lifetimes in such states. We also explore the prospects of detecting individual, lensed metal-free (Population III) stars at high redshifts using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that very massive ($\gtrsim 100\ M_\odot$) Population III stars at $z\gtrsim 6$ may potentially be detected by JWST in surveys covering large numbers of strong lensing clusters, provided that the Population III stellar initial mass function is sufficiently top-heavy, that these stars evolve to effective temperatures $\leq 15000$ K, and that the cosmic star formation rate density of Pop III stars reaches $\gtrsim 10^{-4}\ M_\odot$ cMpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ at $z\approx$ 6-10. Various ways to distinguish metal-free lensed stars from metal-enriched ones are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Diverse Oxygen Abundance in Early Galaxies Unveiled by Auroral Line Analysis with JWST</title>

Abstract: We present deep JWST NIRSpec observations in the sightline of MACS J1149.5+2223, a massive cluster of galaxies at $z=0.54$. We report the spectroscopic redshift of 28 sources at $3&lt;z&lt;9.1$, including 9 sources with the detection of the [OIII]4363 auroral line. Combining these with 16 [OIII]4363-detected sources from publicly available JWST data, our sample consists of 25 galaxies with robust gas-phase metallicity measurements via the direct method. We observe a positive correlation between stellar mass and metallicity, with a $\sim0.5$\,dex offset down below the local relation. Interestingly, we find a larger than expected scatter of $\sim0.3$\,dex around the relation, which cannot be explained by redshift evolution among our sample or other third parameter. The scatter increases at higher redshift, and we attribute this to the enrichment process having higher stochasticity due to shallower potential wells, more intense feedback processes, and a higher galaxy merger rate. Despite reaching to a considerably low-mass regime ($\log M_*/M_\odot \sim7.3$), our samples have metallicity of $\log$(O/H)$+12&gt;7$, i.e. comparable to the most metal poor galaxies in the local Universe. The search of primordial galaxies may be accomplished by extending toward a lower mass and/or by investigating inhomogeneities at smaller spatial scales. Lastly, we investigate potential systematics caused by the limitation of JWST's MSA observations. Caution is warranted when the target exceeds the slit size, as this situation could allow an overestimation of "global" metallicity, especially under the presence of strong negative metallicity gradient.</description>

      <title>New AGN diagnostic diagrams based on the [OIII]$\lambda 4363$ auroral line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our understanding of black holes formation and growth in the early Universe. However, JWST has also revealed that some of the classical diagnostics, such as the BPT diagrams and X-ray emission, often fail to identify narrow line TypeII active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshift. Here we present three new rest-frame optical diagnostic diagrams leveraging the [OIII]$\lambda4363$ auroral line, which has been detected in several JWST spectra. Specifically, we show that high values of the [OIII]$\lambda4363/$H$\gamma$ ratio provide a sufficient (but not necessary) condition to identify the presence of an AGN, both based on empirical calibrations (using local and high-redshift sources) and a broad range of photoionization models. These diagnostics are able to separate much of the AGN population from Star Forming Galaxies (SFGs). This is because the average energy of AGN's ionizing photons is higher than that of young stars in SFGs, hence AGN can more efficiently heat the gas, therefore boosting the [OIII]$\lambda4363$ line. We also found independent indications of AGN activity in some high-redshift sources that were not previously identified as AGN with the traditional diagnostics diagrams, but that are placed in the AGN region of the diagnostics presented in this work. We note that, conversely, low values of [OIII]$\lambda4363/$H$\gamma$ can be associated either with SFGs or AGN excitation. We note that the fact that strong auroral lines are often associated with AGN does not imply that they cannot be used for direct metallicity measurements (provided that proper ionization corrections are applied), but it does affect the calibration of strong line metallicity diagnostics.</description>

      <title>A hidden population of active galactic nuclei can explain the overabundance of luminous $z&gt;10$ objects observed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first wave of observations with JWST has revealed a striking overabundance of luminous galaxies at early times ($z&gt;10$) compared to models of galaxies calibrated to pre-JWST data. Early observations have also uncovered a large population of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at $z&gt;6$. Because many of the high-$z$ objects appear extended, the contribution of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to the total luminosity has been assumed to be negligible. In this work, we use a semi-empirical model for assigning AGNs to galaxies to show that active galaxies can boost the stellar luminosity function (LF) enough to solve the overabundance problem while simultaneously remaining consistent with the observed morphologies of high-$z$ sources. We construct a model for the composite AGN+galaxy LF by connecting dark matter halo masses to galaxy and SMBH masses and luminosities, accounting for dispersion in the mapping between host galaxy and SMBH mass and luminosity. By calibrating the model parameters -- which characterize the $M_\bullet-M_\star$ relation -- to a compilation of $z&gt;10$ JWST UVLF data, we show that AGN emission can account for the excess luminosity under a variety of scenarios, including one where 10\% of galaxies host BHs of comparable luminosities to their stellar components. Using a sample of simulated objects and real observations, we demonstrate that such low-luminosity AGNs can be `hidden' in their host galaxies and be missed in common morphological analyses. We find that for this explanation to be viable, our model requires a population of BHs that are overmassive ($M_\bullet/M_\star\sim10^{-2}$) with respect to their host galaxies compared to the local relation and are more consistent with the observed relation at $z=4-8$. We explore the implications of this model for BH seed properties and comment on observational diagnostics necessary to further investigate this explanation.</description>

      <title>The Supersonic Project: Early Star Formation with the Streaming Velocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At high redshifts ($z\gtrsim12$), the relative velocity between baryons and dark matter (the so-called streaming velocity) significantly affects star formation in low-mass objects. Streaming substantially reduces the abundance of low-mass gas objects while simultaneously allowing for the formation of supersonically-induced gas objects (SIGOs) and their associated star clusters outside of dark matter halos. Here, we present a study of the population-level effects of streaming on star formation within both halos and SIGOs in a set of simulations with and without streaming. Notably, we find that streaming actually enhances star formation within individual halos of all masses at redshifts between $z=12$ and $z=20$. This is demonstrated both as an increased star formation rate per object as well as an enhancement of the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation for objects with streaming. We find that our simulations are consistent with some observations at high redshift, but on a population level, they continue to under-predict star formation relative to the majority of observations. Notably, our simulations do not include feedback, and so can be taken as an upper limit on the star formation rate, exacerbating these differences. However, simulations of overdense regions (both with and without streaming) agree with observations, suggesting a strategy for extracting information about the overdensity and streaming velocity in a given survey volume in future observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent hydrodynamical simulations of the late stages of supernova remnant (SNR) evolution have revealed that as they merge with the ambient medium, SNRs implode, leading to the formation of dense clouds in their center. While being highly chemically enriched by their host SNR, these clouds appear to have similar properties as giant molecular clouds, which are believed to be the main site of star formation. Here, we develop a simple model, in order to estimate the efficiency of the star formation that might be triggered by the implosion of SNRs. We separately consider two cases, cyclic star formation, maintained by the episodic driving of feedback from new generations of stars; and a single burst of star formation, triggered by a single explosion. We find that in the cyclic case, star formation is inefficient, with implosion-triggered star-formation contributing a few percent of the observed star-formation efficiency per free-fall timescale. In the single-burst case, higher star-formation efficiencies can be obtained. However, while the implosion-triggered process might not contribute much to the overall star-formation, due to the high chemical enrichment of the birth clouds, it can explain the formation of a significant fraction of metal-rich stars.</description>

      <title>Implications for Galactic Electron Density Structure from Pulsar Sightlines Intersecting HII Regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent radio surveys have revealed pulsars with dispersion and scattering delays induced by ionized gas that are larger than the rest of the observed pulsar population, in some cases with electron column densities (or dispersion measures; DMs) larger than the maximum predictions of Galactic electron density models. By cross-matching the observed pulsar population against HII region catalogs, we show that the majority of pulsars with $\rm DM &gt; 600$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and scattering delays $\tau(1\ {\rm GHz}) &gt; 10$ ms lie behind HII regions, and that HII region intersections may be relevant to as much as a third of the observed pulsar population. The fraction of the full pulsar population with sightlines intersecting HII regions is likely larger. Accounting for HII regions resolves apparent discrepancies where Galactic electron density models place high-DM pulsars beyond the Galactic disk. By comparing emission measures (EMs) inferred from recombination line observations to pulsar DMs, we show that HII regions can contribute tens to hundreds of pc cm$^{-3}$ in electron column density along a pulsar LOS. We find that nearly all pulsars with significant excess (and deficit) scattering from the mean $\tau$-DM relation are spatially coincident with known discrete ionized gas structures, including HII regions. Accounting for HII regions is critical to the interpretation of radio dispersion and scattering measurements as electron density tracers, both in the Milky Way and in other galaxies.</description>

      <title>Improved constraints on Galactic Centre ejection of hypervelocity stars based on novel search method</title>

Abstract: Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are stars which have been ejected from the Galactic Centre (GC) at velocities of up to a few thousand km/s. They are tracers of the Galactic potential and can be used to infer properties of the GC, such as the initial-mass function and assembly history. HVSs are rare, however, with only about a dozen promising candidates discovered so far. In this work we make use of a novel, highly efficient method to identify new HVS candidates in Gaia. This method uses the nearly radial trajectories of HVSs to infer their distances and velocities based on their position and Gaia proper motion alone. Through comparison of inferred distances with Gaia parallaxes and photometry we identified 600 HVS candidates with G&lt;20 including the previously discovered S5-HVS1, out of which we obtained ground-based follow-up observations for 196 stars. As we found no new HVSs based on their radial velocity, we used detailed HVS ejection simulations to significantly improve previous HVS ejection rate constraints. In particular, the ejection rate of HVSs more massive than 1 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ cannot be higher than $10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ at $2\sigma$ significance. Additionally, we predict that there are 5-45 unbound HVSs in the complete Gaia catalogue ($1\sigma$ interval), most of which will be main-sequence stars of a few M$_\odot$ at heliocentric distances of tens to hundreds of kpc. By comparing our results to literature HVS candidates, we find an indication of either a time-dependent ejection rate of HVSs or a non-GC origin of previously identified HVS candidates.</description>

      <title>Silencing the Giant: Evidence of AGN Feedback and Quenching in a Little Red Dot at z = 4.13</title>

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a ubiquitous population of dust-obscured compact sources at $z\gtrsim 4$. Many of these objects exhibit signs of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, making their study crucial for understanding the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their growth with host galaxies. In this work, we examine low and medium resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectra from the JADES GTO public data release in the GOODS-N field of a red, luminous ($M_{\rm B}\sim-22.2$ mag) and compact ($&lt;500$ pc) source at $z=4.13$. The rest-optical ($\lambda_{\rm rest} &gt; 4000$ A) continuum of this source is strongly dominated by a massive (log$_{10}$[$M_*/M_\odot] \sim 10.6$), quenched (log$_{10}$[sSFR/yr$^{-1}$] $&lt; -11$) galaxy, as indicated by the clear presence of a Balmer break and stellar absorption lines. Star-formation history modeling reveals a starburst episode followed by rapid quenching about 200 Myr ago. The spectrum shows extremely broad (FWHM $\sim 2500$ km/s) H$\alpha$ emission and elevated optical line ratios, indicating an actively accreting SMBH. Moreover, our work has potentially revealed clear AGN signatures in the rest-UV in LRDs for the first time, via a detection of a strong Ly$\alpha$ emission and a broad MgII, doublet. The derived black hole mass of log$_{10}$($M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot) \sim 7.3$ results in $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\sim 0.04$ %, consistent with the local relations, unlike the elevated ratios in other high-$z$ reddened AGN. Finally, we use JWST data from AGN at $z=4-10$ to explore an evolutionary link between high-$z$ reddened AGN, early quiescent galaxies, and local ellipticals.</description>

      <title>LoVoCCS. II. Weak Lensing Mass Distributions, Red-Sequence Galaxy Distributions, and Their Alignment with the Brightest Cluster Galaxy in 58 Nearby X-ray-Luminous Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS) is an on-going program to observe nearly a hundred low-redshift X-ray-luminous galaxy clusters (redshifts $0.03&lt;z&lt;0.12$ and X-ray luminosities in the 0.1-2.4 keV band $L_{{\rm X500c}}&gt;10^{44}$ erg/s) with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), capturing data in $u,g,r,i,z$ bands with a $5\sigma$ point source depth of approximately 25-26th AB magnitudes. Here, we map the aperture masses in 58 galaxy cluster fields using weak gravitational lensing. These clusters span a variety of dynamical states, from nearly relaxed to merging systems, and approximately half of them have not been subject to detailed weak lensing analysis before. In each cluster field, we analyze the alignment between the 2D mass distribution described by the aperture mass map, the 2D red-sequence (RS) galaxy distribution, and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We find that the orientations of the BCG and the RS distribution are strongly aligned throughout the interiors of the clusters: the median misalignment angle is 19 deg within 2 Mpc. We also observe the alignment between the orientations of the RS distribution and the overall cluster mass distribution (by a median difference of 32 deg within 1 Mpc), although this is constrained by galaxy shape noise and the limitations of our cluster sample size. These types of alignment suggest long-term dynamical evolution within the clusters over cosmic timescales.</description>

      <title>KMT-2023-BLG-2669: Ninth Free-floating Planet Candidate with $\theta_{\rm E}$ measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a free-floating planet (FFP) candidate identified from the analysis of the microlensing event KMT-2023-BLG-2669. The lensing light curve is characterized by a short duration $(\lesssim 3\,{\rm days})$ and a small amplitude $(\lesssim 0.7\,{\rm mag})$. From the analysis, we find the Einstein timescale of $t_{\rm E} \backsimeq 0.33\,{\rm days}$ and the Einstein radius of $\theta_{\rm E} \backsimeq 4.41\,{\mu}{\rm as}$. These measurements enable us to infer the lens mass as $M = 8\,M_{\oplus} (\pi_{\rm rel} / 0.1\,{\rm mas})^{-1}$, where $\pi_{\rm rel}$ is the relative lens-source parallax. The inference implies that the lens is a sub-Neptune- to Saturn-mass object depending on its unknown distance. This is the ninth isolated planetary-mass microlens with $\theta_{\rm E} &lt; 10\,{\mu}{\rm as}$, which (as shown by \citealt{gould22}) is a useful threshold for a FFP candidate. We conduct extensive searches for possible signals of a host star in the light curve, but find no strong evidence for the host. We investigate the possibility of using late-time high-resolution imaging to probe for possible hosts. In particular, we discuss that for the case of finite-source point-lens FFP candidates, it would be possible to search for very wide separation hosts immediately, although such searches are "high-risk, high-reward".</description>

      <title>SDSSJ0018-0939: A Clear Signature of Sub-Chandrasekhar Mass Type 1a Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very metal-poor (VMP) stars (${\rm [Fe/H]}\leq -2$) that have sub-solar values of ${\rm [X/Fe]}$ for $\alpha$ elements such as Mg, Si, and Ca, are referred to as $\alpha$-poor VMP stars. They are quite rare among VMP stars and are thought to have formed from gas enriched predominantly by a single Type Ia supernovae (SN1a) in contrast to most VMP stars which are $\alpha$-enhanced and usually associated with core-collapse supernovae. The observed abundance pattern in such stars can provide a direct way to probe the nucleosynthesis in individual SN1a. Although the abundance patterns in some $\alpha$-poor VMP stars have been shown to be consistent with SN1a ejecta, a clear nucleosynthetic signature for SN1a resulting from the explosion of a near Chandrasekhar mass (near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) or a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) white dwarf, has not been unambiguously detected. We perform a detailed analysis of various formation channels of VMP stars and find that the $\alpha$-poor VMP star SDSSJ0018-0939, which was earlier reported as a star with potential pair-instability supernova origin, provides almost a smoking-gun signature of a sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN1a resulting from He detonation. We find that compared to other $\alpha$-poor VMP stars that were previously identified with SN1a, SDSSJ0018-0939 is the only star that has a clear and unambiguous signature of SN1a. Interestingly, our results are consistent with constraints on SN1a from recent galactic chemical evolution studies that indicate that sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN1a account for $\sim 50\hbox{--}75\,\%$ of all SN1a and are possibly the dominant channel in the early Galaxy.</description>

      <title>On the suppression of giant planet formation around low-mass stars in clustered environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: Current exoplanet formation studies tend to overlook the birth environment of stars in clustered environments. The effect of this environment on the planet-formation process, however, is important, especially in the earliest stage. Aims: We investigate the differences in planet populations forming in star-cluster environments through pebble accretion and compare these results with the planet formation around isolated stars. We try to provide potential signatures on the young planetary systems to guide future observation. Methods: We design and present a new planet population synthesis code for clustered environments. The planet formation model is based on pebble accretion and includes migration in the circumstellar disk. The disk's gas and dust are evolved in 1D simulations considering the effects of photo-evaporation of the nearby stars. Results: Planetary systems in a clustered environment are different than those born in isolation; the environmental effects are important for a wide range of observable parameters and the eventual architecture of the planetary systems. Planetary systems born in a clustered environment lack cold Jupiters compared to isolated planetary systems. This effect is more pronounced for low-mass stars ($\lesssim$0.2 $M_\odot$). On the other hand, planetary systems born in clusters show an excess of cold Neptune around these low-mass stars. Conclusions: In future observations, finding an excess of cold Neptunes and a lack of cold Jupiters could be used to constrain the birth environments of these planetary systems. Exploring the dependence of cold Jupiter's intrinsic occurrence rate on stellar mass provides insights into the birth environment of their proto-embryos.</description>
