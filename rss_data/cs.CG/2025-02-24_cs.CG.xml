      <title>The Euclidean $3$-Matching Problem is NP-hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $3$-matching of a graph is a partition of its vertices into $3$-element subsets; this generalizes the idea of matchings in graphs. Let $G$ be a complete edge-weighted graph; to each $3$-set of vertices of $G$ assign the sum of its minimum spanning tree as its weight. The $3$-Matching Problem is the combinatorial optimization problem of finding a minimum weight $3$-matching of $G$, where the weight of a $3$-matching is the sum of the weights of its $3$-sets. While the $3$-Matching Problem is known to be NP-hard, the complexity of its Euclidean variant remains open. In the Euclidean $3$-Matching Problem, the vertices of $G$ are a set of points in the plane, and the weight of an edge is given by the distance between its endpoints. In this paper we show that the Euclidean $3$-Matching Problem is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Sheaf theory: from deep geometry to deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an overview of the applications of sheaf theory in deep learning, data science, and computer science in general. The primary text of this work serves as a friendly introduction to applied and computational sheaf theory accessible to those with modest mathematical familiarity. We describe intuitions and motivations underlying sheaf theory shared by both theoretical researchers and practitioners, bridging classical mathematical theory and its more recent implementations within signal processing and deep learning. We observe that most notions commonly considered specific to cellular sheaves translate to sheaves on arbitrary posets, providing an interesting avenue for further generalization of these methods in applications, and we present a new algorithm to compute sheaf cohomology on arbitrary finite posets in response. By integrating classical theory with recent applications, this work reveals certain blind spots in current machine learning practices. We conclude with a list of problems related to sheaf-theoretic applications that we find mathematically insightful and practically instructive to solve. To ensure the exposition of sheaf theory is self-contained, a rigorous mathematical introduction is provided in appendices which moves from an introduction of diagrams and sheaves to the definition of derived functors, higher order cohomology, sheaf Laplacians, sheaf diffusion, and interconnections of these subjects therein.</description>

      <title>ZigzagNetVis: Suggesting temporal resolutions for graph visualization using zigzag persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal graphs are commonly used to represent complex systems and track the evolution of their constituents over time. Visualizing these graphs is crucial as it allows one to quickly identify anomalies, trends, patterns, and other properties that facilitate better decision-making. In this context, selecting an appropriate temporal resolution is essential for constructing and visually analyzing the layout. The choice of resolution is particularly important, especially when dealing with temporally sparse graphs. In such cases, changing the temporal resolution by grouping events (i.e., edges) from consecutive timestamps -- a technique known as timeslicing -- can aid in the analysis and reveal patterns that might not be discernible otherwise. However, selecting an appropriate temporal resolution is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose ZigzagNetVis, a methodology that suggests temporal resolutions potentially relevant for analyzing a given graph, i.e., resolutions that lead to substantial topological changes in the graph structure. ZigzagNetVis achieves this by leveraging zigzag persistent homology, a well-established technique from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). To improve visual graph analysis, ZigzagNetVis incorporates the colored barcode, a novel timeline-based visualization inspired by persistence barcodes commonly used in TDA. We also contribute with a web-based system prototype that implements suggestion methodology and visualization tools. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of ZigzagNetVis through a usage scenario, a user study with 27 participants, and a detailed quantitative evaluation.</description>

      <title>Simpler algorithmically unrecognizable 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov proved that there exists an unrecognizable 4-manifold, that is, a 4-manifold for which the homeomorphism problem is undecidable. In this paper we consider the question how close we can get to S^4 with an unrecognizable manifold. One of our achievements is that we show a way to remove so-called Markov's trick from the proof of existence of such a manifold. This trick contributes to the complexity of the resulting manifold. We also show how to decrease the deficiency (or the number of relations) in so-called Adian-Rabin set which is another ingredient that contributes to the complexity of the resulting manifold. Altogether, our approach allows to show that the connected sum #_9(S^2 x S^2) is unrecognizable while the previous best result is the unrecognizability of #_12(S^2 x S^2) due to Gordon.</description>
