      <title>Sucrose ester surfactants: current understanding and emerging perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sucrose esters (SEs), derived from sucrose and fatty acids, are biodegradable and non-toxic surfactants increasingly favored as substitutes for petrochemically-synthesized ones in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. SEs provide versatile hydrophilic-lipophilic properties, determined by the degree of sucrose esterification ranging from one to eight. The length of the fatty acid residues further influences the phase behavior of SEs, allowing creation of tailored formulations for specific applications. This review provides insights about our current understanding of the SEs phase behavior, their aggregation in aqueous and oily solutions, and its correlation with formulation outcomes. Furthermore, an overview of recent studies investigating SEs in various colloidal systems, incl. emulsions, foams, oleogels, and others, is provided. Novel concepts are discussed alongside future research directions, emphasizing the SEs potential as sustainable, functional ingredients.</description>

      <title>Interpolating between pair-potential systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies liquid-model systems with almost identical constant-potential-energy hypersurfaces. We simulated continuous interpolations between such systems, specifically between the Lennard-Jones (LJ), Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA), exponent 12 inverse-power-law (IPL), and Yukawa (YK) pair-potential systems. Structure and dynamics were monitored via the radial distribution function and the time-dependent mean-square displacement, respectively. In terms of the interpolation parameter lambda, we argue that two systems have very similar constant-potential-energy hypersurfaces if the potential energies of configurations rarely cross when plotted as functions of lambda. Such absence of "level crossing" applies to a very good approximation for the LJ to WCA transformation, and it also applies to a quite good approximation for the LJ to IPL and the YK to YK transformations (the latter varies the screening length). In all cases, structure and dynamics are shown to be almost invariant as functions of lambda. The density is kept constant when lambda is varied. Temperature must be generally adjusted with lambda, which is done by an iterative "reduced-force-matching" method with no free parameters. We also apply the interpolation strategy to two versions of the Kob-Andersen (KA) binary LJ system and show that a recently introduced shifted-force-cutoff version of this system has constant-potential-energy hypersurfaces, which are almost identical to those of the original KA system. This result rationalizes the previously established fact that the two KA versions have virtually identical physics.</description>

      <title>Subdiffusion of sticky dendrimers in an associative polymer network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the static and dynamic properties of dendrimers diffusing through a network of linear associative polymers using coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations. Both dendrimers and network chains are modelled as bead-spring chain polymers, with hydrodynamic interactions incorporated for the accurate prediction of dynamic properties. Linear chains form a network via the associating groups distributed along their backbones, and the dendrimers interact attractively or repulsively with the network, enabling a direct comparison of sticky and non-sticky behaviour of dendrimers. Structural analysis reveals that while non-sticky dendrimers shrink with increasing network concentration, similar to linear polymer behaviour, sticky dendrimers exhibit stretching at low concentrations due to binding interactions. Dendrimer dynamics are largely insensitive to network architecture but are strongly influenced by the strength of dendrimer-network interactions. Increasing attraction to the network leads to subdiffusive motion and non-Gaussian displacement statistics, even when dendrimers are smaller than the average mesh size. The long-time diffusivity aligns with theoretical predictions for nanoparticle transport in polymer networks. Additionally, dendrimers deform the network locally, altering the mesh size distribution depending on their stickiness. These findings offer insight into the interplay between macromolecular architecture, binding interactions, and transport in polymeric environments.</description>

      <title>Static and dynamic theory of polarization under internal and directing electric fields: Fixed-charge and fixed-potential conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a continuum theory on statics and dynamics of polar fluids, where the orientational polarization ${\bi p}_1$ and the induced polarization ${\bi p}_2$ are governed by
  the Onsager directing field ${\bi E}_d$ and the Lorentz internal field $\bi F$, respectively. We start with a dielectric free energy functional $\cal F$ with a cross term $\propto \int\hspace{-0.5mm} d{\bi r}~{\bi p}_1\cdot{\bi p}_2$, which was proposed by
  Felderhof $[$J. Phys. C: Solid State Phys. {\bf 12}, 2423 (1979)$]$. With this cross-coupling, our theory can
  yield the theoretical results by Onsager and Kirkwood.
  We also present dynamic equations
  using the functional derivatives $\delta {\cal F}/\delta {\bi p}_i$ to calculate the space-time correlations of ${\bi p}_i$. We then obtain analytic expressions for
  various frequency-dependent quantities including the Debye formula. We find that the fluctuations of the total polarization drastically depend on whether we fix the electrode charge or the applied potential difference between parallel metal electrodes.
  In the latter fixed-potential condition, we obtain a nonlocal (long-range) polarization correlation
  inversely proportional to the cell volume $V$, which
  is crucial to understand the dielectric response. It is produced by nonlocal charge fluctuations on the electrode surfaces and
  is sensitive to the potential drops in the Stern layers in small systems. These nonlocal correlations in the bulk and on the surfaces are closely related due to the global constraint of fixed potential difference. We also add some results in other boundary conditions including the periodic one, where nonlocal correlations also appear.</description>

      <title>Finite Membrane Thickness Influences Hydrodynamics on the Nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many lipid membrane-mediated transport processes--such as mechanically-gated channel activation and solute transport--involve structural and dynamical features on membrane thickness length scales. Most existing membrane models, however, tend to adopt (quasi-)two-dimensional descriptions that neglect thickness-dependent phenomena relevant to internal membrane mechanics, and thus do not fully account for the complex coupling of lipid membranes with their surrounding fluid media. Therefore, explicitly incorporating membrane thickness effects in lipid membrane models will enable a more accurate description of the influence of membrane/fluid coupling on transport phenomena in the vicinity of the bilayer surfaces. Here, we present a continuum model for membrane fluctuations that accounts for finite membrane thickness and resolves hydrodynamic interactions between the bilayer and its surrounding fluid. By applying linear response analysis, we observe that membrane thickness-mediated effects, such as bending-induced lipid reorientations, can generate shear flows close to the membrane surface that slow down the relaxation of nanometer scale shape fluctuations. Additionally, we reveal the emergence of pressure inversion and flow reversal near the membrane interfaces, accompanied by localized stagnation points. Among these, extensional stagnation points give rise to a novel mode of bulk dissipation, originating from bending-induced compression and expansion of the membrane surfaces and their coupling to shear stresses in the fluid. Our findings identify membrane thickness as a key factor in nanoscale hydrodynamics and suggest that its effects may be detectable in fluctuation spectra and can be relevant to interfacial processes such as solute permeability and contact with solid boundaries or other membranes.</description>

      <title>Surface mobility of a glass-forming polymer in an ionic liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The free surface of glassy polymers exhibits enhanced segmental dynamics compared to the bulk, forming a liquid-like layer that lowers the glass transition temperature (Tg) in nanometersized polymer samples. Recent studies have shown that immersing polymers in ionic liquids can suppress this enhanced surface dynamics. To investigate how ionic liquids influence polymer dynamics near the ionic-liquid-polymer interface, we measure the surface leveling of nanometersized stepped polystyrene films immersed in ionic liquids, and compared the results to the case of films in vacuum. Our results reveal that ionic liquids significantly slow the leveling process both above and below Tg. However, our results indicate that the liquid-like surface layer below Tg does exist in ionic liquids. Numerical solutions of the thin-film equation, incorporating appropriate boundary conditions, show that the surface mobility of PS films in ionic liquids can match that of PS films in vacuum. Thus, while ionic liquids alter the polymer flow process, they do not eliminate the dynamical heterogeneity inherent to glassy polymers.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the Antimicrobial Action Mechanism of Ribosomal Protein S30</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ribosomal protein S30 (RS30) exhibits potent antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria. Despite its efficacy, the underlying action mechanism remained elusive. In this study, we unravel the fundamental mechanism by which RS30 exerts its bactericidal effects, using a combination of microbiological assays and advanced biophysical techniques. Microbiological analyses reveal that RS30 kills bacteria primarily through membrane depolarization, despite limited membrane permeabilization, indicating an unconventional mode of action involving no or partial lysis of the membrane. Importantly, RS30 demonstrates time-dependent bactericidal activity with no detectable cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells, underscoring its high selectivity. This selective action was further confirmed using biophysical experiments on model membrane systems composed of anionic (bacterial mimic) and zwitterionic (mammalian mimic) phospholipids. Our measurements suggested that RS30 preferentially binds to anionic membranes via electrostatic interactions, undergoes a conformational transition from a random coil to an {\alpha}-helix upon binding, and induces vesicle aggregation. Quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements provide microscopic insights, showing that RS30 significantly restricts the lateral diffusion of anionic lipids, thereby perturbing membrane dynamics and increasing susceptibility to external stress. Together, our findings uncover important insights into the antimicrobial action mechanism of RS30, characterized by selective membrane interaction, structural transformation, and dynamic modulation of lipid membranes.</description>

      <title>Engineering Morphologies of Metal Colloidal Assemblies via Colloid Jamming at Liquid-Liquid Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06026v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-assemblies, structured via nanoparticles, show promise as materials for advanced applications, like photonic devices, electrochemical energy storage units and catalysis support. Despite observing diverse morphologies, a comprehensive understanding of the formation mechanism remains elusive. In this work, we show that the coordination interaction between metal sulfide nanoparticles (MS NPs) and the fluorosurfactants at the droplet interface influences the morphology during the evaporation-induced self-assembly facilitated by droplet microfluidics. Further investigation into fluorosurfactants with various chemical groups and MS NPs reveals that the strength of coordination interactions significantly influences assembly morphology. The interfacial interactions can be eliminated through coating a SiO2 layer on the metal colloid (M@SiO2 NPs). In addition, we demonstrate that the morphologies of the self-assemblies can be engineered via the coordination interactions between the MS NPs and fluorosurfactants, and by varying the concentrations of MS NPs. Utilizing these interfacial interactions, assemblies with core-shell and homogeneous distribution of binary nanoparticles were constructed. Our findings offer novel insights into the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles at the droplet interface through evaporation-induced self-assembly, and into the design of metal colloidal assemblies with diverse morphologies, crucial for developing novel functional assemblies for catalysis, plasmonic, and porous materials in a controlled manner.</description>

      <title>Surface Nematic Uniformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ant-like observer confined to a two-dimensional surface traversed by stripes would wonder whether this striped landscape could be devised in such a way as to appear to be the same wherever they go. Differently stated, this is the problem studied in this paper. In a more technical jargon, we determine all possible uniform nematic fields on a smooth surface. It was already known that for such a field to exist, the surface must have constant negative Gaussian curvature. Here, we show that all uniform nematic fields on such a surface are parallel transported (in Levi-Civita's sense) by special systems of geodesics, which (with scant inventiveness) are termed uniform. We prove that, for every geodesic on the surface, there are two systems of uniform geodesics that include it; they are conventionally called right and left, to allude at a possible intrinsic definition of handedness. We found explicitly all uniform fields for Beltrami's pseudosphere. Since both geodesics and uniformity are preserved under isometries, by a classical theorem of Minding, the solution for the pseudosphere carries over all other admissible surfaces, thus providing a general solution to the problem (at least in principle).</description>

      <title>Modeling complex particle suspensions: perspectives on the rigid multiblob method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many suspensions contain particles with complex shapes that are affected not only by hydrodynamics, but also by thermal fluctuations, internal kinematic constraints and other long-range non-hydrodynamic interactions. Modeling these systems represents a significant numerical challenge due to the interplay between different effects and the need to accurately capture multiscale phenomena. In this article we review recent developments to model large suspensions of particles of arbitrary shapes and multiple couplings with controllable accuracy within the rigid multiblob framework. We discuss the governing equations, highlight key numerical developments, and illustrate applications ranging from microswimmers to complex colloidal suspensions. This review illustrates the effectiveness and versatility of the rigid multiblob method in tackling a wide range of physical problems in fluid mechanics, soft matter physics, biophysics, materials and colloidal science.</description>

      <title>Validating Griffith fracture propagation in the phase-field approach to fracture: The case of Mode III by means of the trousers test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At present, there is an abundance of results showing that the phase-field approach to fracture in elastic brittle materials -- when properly accounting for material strength -- describes the \emph{nucleation} of fracture from large pre-existing cracks in a manner that is consistent with the Griffith competition between bulk deformation energy and surface fracture energy. By contrast, results that demonstrate the ability of this approach to describe Griffith fracture \emph{propagation} are scarce and restricted to Mode I. Aimed at addressing this lacuna, the main objective of this paper is to show that the phase-field approach to fracture describes Mode III fracture propagation in a manner that is indeed consistent with the Griffith energy competition. This is accomplished via direct comparisons between phase-field predictions for fracture propagation in the so-called \emph{trousers} \emph{test} and the corresponding results that emerge from the Griffith energy competition. The latter are generated from full-field finite-element solutions that -- as an additional critical contribution of this paper -- also serve to bring to light the hitherto unexplored limitations of the classical Rivlin-Thomas-Greensmith formulas that are routinely used to analyze the trousers test.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates play a crucial role in the spatial organization of living matter. These membrane-less organelles, resulting from liquid-liquid phase separation, operate far from thermodynamic equilibrium, with their size and stability influenced by non-equilibrium chemical reactions. While condensates are frequently considered optimized nanoreactors that enhance molecular encounters, their actual impact on reaction kinetics remains unclear due to competing effects such as diffusion hindrance, and random trapping in non-specific condensates. In this study, we develop a microscopic, stochastic model for chemically active droplets, incorporating reaction-driven modulation of protein interactions. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate how protein interactions and active coupling to a free energy reservoir influence phase separation, molecular transport and reaction kinetics. We demonstrate that the intensity of the chemical drive governs surface dynamics, generating fluxes that modulate bimolecular reaction rates. Comparing active emulsions to homogeneous systems, we reveal that condensates can either accelerate or decelerate molecular encounters. Our findings provide key insights into the role of biomolecular condensates as potential regulators of intracellular reaction kinetics.</description>

      <title>Controlling the morphologies and dynamics in three-dimensional tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of factors, such as, cell-cell interactions and self-propulsion of cells driven by cytoskeletal forces determine tissue morphologies and dynamics. To explore the interplay between these factors in controlling the dynamics at the tissue scale, we created a minimal three dimensional model in which short-range repulsive elastic forces account for cell-cell interactions. Self-propulsion is modeled as active uncorrelated random stochastic forces, with strength $\mu$, that act on individual cells and is the only source of cell motility. Strikingly, variations in polydispersity in cell sizes ($\Sigma$) and cell elasticity ($E$), results in the formation of a variety of distinct ``phases", driven entirely by $\mu$. At low $E$, the tissue behaves like a liquid, at all values of $\Sigma$, whereas at high $E$ and $\Sigma$, it has the characteristics of a glass. The tissue crystallizes at low $\Sigma$ provided $E$ exceeds a critical value. Over a narrow range of $E$ and $\Sigma$, that lies between the boundaries of the liquid and glass phase, the effective viscosity increases like in a glass as the cell density increases and saturates as the cells are compressed beyond a certain value, creating the viscosity saturation (VS) phase. The VS phase does not form in systems at finite temperature in which the dynamics satisfies the Fluctuation Dissipation Theorem. In the glass phase, the tissue exhibits aging (relaxation times depend on the waiting time) behavior at high $E$ values. Our findings provide a framework for designing tissues with tunable material properties by controlling the physical characteristics of cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06057v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Narrowband emission is crucial for next generation optoelectronic devices to satisfy demands for high color brilliance. Microcavities can narrow emission spectra of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) through the creation of resonant standing waves, independent of emitter material, enabling flexibility in molecular and device design. However, they induce a strong angle-dependence of the perceived emission color. Utilizing strong light-matter coupling of cavity photons with the virtually angle-independent exciton, leads to exciton-polariton emission showing reduced linewidths and suppressed angular dispersion if tuned correctly. Creating polaritons in highly efficient materials such as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules is however difficult as their low oscillator strengths intrinsically disfavor light-matter interaction. Here, we present the successful combination of a highly efficient but intrinsically broadband TADF emitter with a strongly absorbing assistant strong coupling material in a modified microcavity structure. Through optimizing the assistant strong coupling layer architecture, we demonstrate polariton OLEDs with exceptionally narrowband, angle stable emission at external quantum efficiencies above 20% for both bottom- and top-emitting designs, more than doubling the performance of previous record devices. The results pave the way for utilizing polaritonic emission at practical device efficiencies for display applications.</description>

      <title>A Piezoelectric Molecular Cocrystal with Unconventional $\pi$-Stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the crystallization of a polar octafluoronaphthalene (OFN, \OFN)--phthalazine (Phth, \Phth) cocrystal, formed in a 1:2 ratio by slow evaporation. The crystal structure and vibrational properties of the cocrystal were determined using powder/single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and confirmed with density functional theory (DFT) and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations. The molecular $\pi$-stacking of aromatic rings is unconventional compared with other arene--perfluoroarene cocrystals. Phth molecules are offset and misaligned with respect to the major axis of OFN due to electrostatic repulsion between N and F atoms, enabling overall electric polarization attributed to the dipole moment of Phth. Our calculations show that OFN:2Phth is an insulator with a band gap of $\sim$2.4 eV. The electric polarization was calculated to be 7.1 \muC, while the shear piezoelectric coefficient ($d_{34}$) may be as large as 11.4 pC N$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Locomotion of Active Polymerlike Worms in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the locomotion of thin, living T. tubifex worms, which display active polymerlike behavior, within quasi-2D arrays of cylindrical pillars, examining varying spatial arrangements and densities. These active worms spread in crowded environments, with a dynamics dependent on both the concentration and arrangement of obstacles. In contrast to passive polymers, our results reveal that in disordered configurations, increasing the pillar density enhances the long-time diffusion of our active polymer-like worms, while we observe the opposite trend in ordered pillar arrays. We found that in disordered media, living worms reptate through available curvilinear tubes, whereas they become trapped within pores of ordered media. Intriguingly, we show that reducing the worm's activity significantly boosts its spread, enabling passive sorting of worms by activity level. Our experimental observations are corroborated through simulations of the tangentially driven polymer model with matched persistence length predicting the same trends.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics of densely confined active polar disks with self- and mutual alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the emerging collective states in a simple mechanical model of a dense group of self-propelled polar disks with off-centered rotation, confined within a circular arena. Each disk presents self-alignment towards the sum of contact forces acting on it, resulting from disk-substrate interactions, while also displaying mutual alignment with neighbors due to having its center of rotation located a distance R behind its centroid so that central contact forces can also introduce torques. The effect of both alignment mechanisms produces a variety of collective states that combine high-frequency localized circular oscillations with low-frequency milling around the center of the arena, in fluid or solid regimes. We consider cases with small/large R values, isotropic/anisotropic disk-substrate damping, smooth/rough arena boundaries, different densities, and multiple systems sizes, showing that the emergent collective states that we identify are robust, generic, and potentially observable in real-world natural or artificial systems.</description>
