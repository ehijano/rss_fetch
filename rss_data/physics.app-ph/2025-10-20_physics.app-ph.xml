      <title>Magnetophoretic long jump of magnetic microparticles in an engineered magnetic stray field landscape for highly localized and large throughput on-chip fractionation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common issue faced by magnetic particle-based Lab-on-a-chip systems, e.g, for medical diagnostics, is the intrinsic fabrication-related polydispersity in particle sizes and magnetic properties. Therefore, to reduce this variation, it is prudent to integrate a pre-separation procedure for the particles into the overall workflow of the system. In this work, a concept for the controlled on-chip fractionation of micron-sized superparamagnetic beads (SPBs) is introduced, which is applicable for sorting magnetic particles according to their properties in a continuous operation mode. A specifically designed magnetic domain pattern is imprinted into an exchange-biased thin film system to generate a tailored magnetic stray field landscape (MFL), enabling lateral transport of SPBs when superposing the MFL with external magnetic field pulses. The domain pattern consists of parallel stripes with gradually increasing and decreasing width, resulting in a step-wise jumping motion of SPBs with increasing/decreasing jump distance. SPBs with different magnetophoretic mobilities, determined, among others, by the particle size and magnetic susceptibility, discontinue their lateral motion at different jump distances, i.e., different lateral positions on the substrate. Thorough analysis of the motion using optical microscopy and particle tracking revealed that an increasing stripe width not only leads to a larger jump distance but also to a lowered jump velocity. As a consequence, particles are spatially separated according to their magnetic and structural properties with a large throughput and time efficiency, as simultaneous sorting occurs for all particles present on the substrate using a constant sequence of short external field pulses.</description>

      <title>Event Topology-based Visual Microphone for Amplitude and Frequency Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate vibration measurement is vital for analyzing dynamic systems across science and engineering, yet noncontact methods often balance precision against practicality. Event cameras offer high-speed, low-light sensing, but existing approaches fail to recover vibration amplitude and frequency with sufficient accuracy. We present an event topology-based visual microphone that reconstructs vibrations directly from raw event streams without external illumination. By integrating the Mapper algorithm from topological data analysis with hierarchical density-based clustering, our framework captures the intrinsic structure of event data to recover both amplitude and frequency with high fidelity. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over prior methods and enable simultaneous recovery of multiple sound sources from a single event stream, advancing the frontier of passive, illumination-free vibration sensing.</description>

      <title>Quench rate dependence of center formation in Er implanted Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Er implanted Si (Er:Si) is a promising candidate for scalable planar quantum memory (QM) applications. Er has a preference to coordinate with O impurities, and multiple types of Er center are typically formed after a post implant anneal. Float zone Si was implanted with 1018 cm-3 Er and separate samples were annealed using a rapid quench annealing technique at 950 degC for 10 min with quench rates of 5, 23, 46, 93, 185 and 400 degC/s. The evolution of photoluminescence (PL) peaks and their associated Er centers was tracked as a function of quench rate. Across all samples, five distinct Er centers were identified. Two centers, one with mixed Si and O coordination and one with Si-only coordination, exhibited fully resolved crystal-field splitting of the 4I15/2 ground state together with 2 to 3 hot lines from the 4I13/2 excited state; fitting of crystal-field parameters for both was consistent with C2v symmetry. The mixed Si and O coordinated center was suppressed at quench rates above 185 degC/s, while the Si-only coordinated center was progressively enhanced with increasing quench rate up to the maximum of 400 degC/s. These results demonstrate that rapid quench annealing has the potential to selectively stabilize a single, Si-coordinated Er center in Er:Si, which is required for QM applications.</description>

      <title>Frequency domain laser ultrasound for inertial confinement fusion target wall thickness measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion experiments hollow, spherical mm-sized capsules are used as a container for nuclear fuel. To achieve maximum implosion efficiency, a perfect capsule geometry is required. This paper presents a wall thickness measurement method based on zero-group velocity guided elastic wave resonances. They are measured with a non-destructive, contactless frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy system. Wall thickness measurements along the equator of a high-density carbon capsule with a diameter of around 2 mm and a wall thickness of around 80 $\unicode{x00B5}$m excellently agree with infrared interferometry reference measurements. In addition, the multi-resonant nature of a spherical shell is studied by complementing experimental observations with plate dispersion calculations and finite element wave propagation simulations. The presented method is scalable and can be applied to a broad range of target materials, including metals, or metal-doped targets.</description>

      <title>Frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy for nanometric layer thickness imaging with GHz elastic plate resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanometric layer thickness imaging is crucial for fundamental research and characterization of micro fabricated devices. Here, we assess the potential of a non-contact opto-acoustic frequency domain laser ultrasound (FreDomLUS) microscopy technique for imaging nanometric thickness variations via GHz zero-group velocity (ZGV) elastic plate resonances. The method exploits the ZGV's lateral energy confinement that leads to sharp resonance peaks which can be effectively probed with the FreDomLUS technique at GHz acoustic frequencies. For demonstration purposes we introduced sub-10 nm height variation patterns in the topmost layer of solidly mounted bulk-acoustic wave resonators with a design frequency of around 1.7 GHz. They are raster-scanned to retrieve ZGV-frequencies from local acoustic spectra as a contrast quantity for imaging. We show how to retrieve quantitative height information by numerically calibrating the factor which inversely relates ZGV frequency change with the layer thickness change. Height variations in stacks with nominal thickness changes of 8 nm, 4 nm, and 1 nm can be resolved and indicate sub-nanometer depth resolution capabilities. The lateral resolution is studied by measuring the method's step edge function and it is found to be in the micrometer range. Atomic force microscopy imaging is used to validate the results.</description>

      <title>Deterministic nanofabrication of quantum dot-circular Bragg grating resonators with high process yield using in-situ electron beam lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The controlled integration of quantum dots (QDs) as single-photon emitters into quantum light sources is essential for the implementation of large-scale quantum networks. In this study, we employ the deterministic in-situ electron-beam lithography (iEBL) nanotechnology platform to integrate individual QDs with high accuracy and process yield into circular Bragg grating (CBG) resonators. Notably, CBG devices comprising just 3 to 4 rings exhibit photon extraction efficiencies comparable to those of structures with more rings. This facilitates faster fabrication, reduces the device footprint, and enables compatibility with electrical contacting. To demonstrate the scalability of this process, we present results of 95 optically active QD-CBG devices fabricated across two lithography sessions. These devices exhibit bright, narrow-linewidth single-photon emission with excellent optical quality. To evaluate QD placement accuracy, we apply a powerful characterization technique that combines cathodoluminescence (CL) mapping and scanning electron microscopy. Statistical analysis of these devices reveals that our iEBL approach enables high alignment accuracy and a process yield of over &gt;90% across various CBG geometries. Our findings highlight a reliable route toward the scalable fabrication of high-performance QD-based single-photon sources for use in photonic quantum technology applications.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Antimodes in Multi-Drive Cavity Magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven-dissipative systems provide a natural setting for the emergence of exceptional points -- i.e. non-Hermitian degeneracies where eigenmodes coalesce. These points are important for applications such as sensing, where enhanced sensitivity is required, and exhibit interesting and useful phenomena that can be controlled with experimentally accessible parameters. In this regard a four-port, three-mode, cavity-magnonics platform is demonstrated in which two microwave excitations can be precisely phase shifted and/or attenuated relative to one another. Destructive interference between the hybridised cavity-magnon modes is shown to give rise to antimodes (antiresonances) in the transmission spectrum, enabling coherent perfect extinction of the outgoing signals at selected ports. This interference can be used to actively tune the position and properties of exceptional points, without the fine tuning conventionally required to obtain exceptional points. Such controllable, interference-based engineering of exceptional points provides a practical and flexible pathway toward next-generation, high-sensitivity sensing devices operating at microwave frequencies.</description>

      <title>A Compact Ultra-Wideband Circularly Polarized Antenna Based on Miniaturized Phase Shifter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, a compact wideband circularly polarized antenna based on a miniaturized phase shifter with ultra-wideband operation is proposed. The proposed antenna is comprised of a pair of compact orthogonal ultra-wideband Vivaldi antennas and a miniaturized phase shifter. To achieve wideband impedance matching and miniaturization, parasitic radiation structures, metal coupled plates, and {\Gamma}-type balun with high-impedance transmission lines are designed. After optimization, the final antenna dimensions are only 0.36 lambda x 0.36 lambda x 0.34 lambda, where lambda is the free-space wavelength at the lowest operating frequency. Additionally, the miniaturized 90 degrees wideband phase shifter of the antenna is designed by employing a PI-type network and a negative group delay (NGD) network with extremely compact dimensions of 0.071 lambda x 0.047 lambda. The simulated results indicate that the antenna exhibits a 10-dB impedance bandwidth within 0.32 - 1.2 GHz (3.75:1) and a 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth within 0.32 - 1.15 GHz (3.59:1). Finally, a prototype is fabricated and reasonable agreement is achieved between the simulated and measured results.</description>

      <title>Marginal Influence of Anomalous Josephson Current on Odd-Frequency Spin-Triplet Pairing in Ferromagnetic Josephson Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine how an anomalous Josephson current influences odd-frequency superconducting correlations in two distinct Josephson junction geometries. The first configuration consists of two ferromagnetic layers sandwiched between conventional s-wave superconductors, with the magnetization vectors of the ferromagnets misaligned. The second involves three ferromagnetic layers embedded between two s-wave superconductors, with their magnetizations oriented along the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively. In the first case, where the anomalous Josephson current is absent, odd-frequency spin-triplet correlations develop pronounced peaks at finite magnetization strengths in both the tunneling and transparent limits, while the equal-spin triplet component exhibits zeros at finite magnetizations in the transparent regime. In the second configuration, where an anomalous Josephson current is present, similar peaks in odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing appear at finite magnetizations under both transport regimes, and the spatial profile of these correlations remains largely unaffected by the current\rq{}s presence. The Josephson diode efficiency is finite and attains its maximum at magnetization values corresponding to the peaks of the anomalous current. Overall, our results demonstrate that the anomalous Josephson current has only a marginal effect on odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, suggesting that the emergence of odd-frequency correlations and the Josephson diode effect are largely independent phenomena, contrary to some earlier conjectures.</description>

      <title>Electrical and Thermal Performance Tuning of Spoof Plasmonic Interconnect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces an electromagnetic metastructure based interconnect design that could address the critical need for electrical bandwidth and heat dissipation in high-speed, chiplet integration. We leverage silicon as the substrate for its superior thermal properties, and to counteract its high dielectric constant that typically causes high mutual capacitance among interconnects, we've engineered a periodically corrugated, compact metallic structure enabling signal propagation via strongly confined spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs). By placing this engineered metal on a $50$ $\mu$m oxide layer atop Si substrate, we achieved a low insertion loss of $0.015$ dB/cm and a $10$ dB reduction in crosstalk noise within $5$ GHz, resulting in a bandwidth $2.5\times$ as high as that of a standard microstriplines of the same footprint. Furthermore, a $5$ ns input pulse showed minimal distortion and a $0.13$ ns/cm propagation delay in our proposed interconnect. Critically, the thin oxide layer minimally impacted the heat dissipation of Si substrate, demonstrating a fourfold reduction in temperature compared to an FR4 substrate. These full-wave simulation-supported findings present a viable pathway for high-density, thermally efficient interconnects in advanced packaging.</description>

      <title>Probing Flying-Focus Wakefields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flying-focus wakefields, which can propagate with a tunable velocity along the optical axis, are promising solutions to electron dephasing in laser-wakefield accelerators. This is accomplished by a combination of spatio-temporal couplings and focusing with an axiparabola, a specialized optical element which produces a quasi-Bessel beam. If implemented, dephasingless acceleration would allow for a hitherto unachievable mixture of high acceleration gradients and long acceleration lengths. Here, we conduct an in-depth study of the structure and behavior of such a flying-focus wakefield, through a combination of direct imaging and simulations. We show the stability of the wakefield structures, explore how the wakefield evolves with changes of density, study the effects of ionization on the wakefield structure with a variety of gases, and analyze the importance of the focusing position. These insights shed light onto this novel wakefield regime and bring understanding that is important to the realization of dephasingless acceleration.</description>

      <title>Ambush strategy impacts species predominance and coexistence in rock-paper-scissors models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the adaptive Ambush strategy in cyclic models following the rules of the spatial rock-paper-scissors game. In our model, individuals of one species possess cognitive abilities to perceive environmental cues and assess the local density of the species they dominate in the spatial competition for natural resources. Based on this assessment, they either initiate a direct attack or, if the local concentration of target individuals does not justify the risk, reposition strategically to prepare an ambush. To quantify the evolutionary consequences of these behavioural strategies, we perform stochastic simulations, analysing emergent spatial patterns and the dependence of species densities on the threshold used by individuals to decide between immediate attack or anticipation. Our findings reveal that, despite being designed to enhance efficiency, cognitive strategies can reduce the abundance of the species due to the constraints of cyclic dominance. We identify an optimal decision threshold: attacking only when the local density of target individuals exceeds 15% provides the best balance between selection risk and long-term persistence. Furthermore, the Ambush strategy benefits low-mobility organisms, increasing coexistence probabilities by up to 53%. These results deepen the understanding of adaptive decision-making in spatial ecology, linking cognitive complexity to ecosystem resilience and extinction risk.</description>

      <title>Achieving Empirical Potential Efficiency with DFT Accuracy: A Neuroevolution Potential for the $\alpha$-Fe--C--H System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A neuroevolution potential (NEP) for the ternary $\alpha$-Fe--C--H system was developed based on a database generated from spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations, achieving empirical potential efficiency with DFT accuracy. At the same power consumption, simulation speeds using NEP are comparable to, or even faster than, those with bond order potentials. The NEP achieves DFT-level accuracy across a wide range of scenarios commonly encountered in studies of $\alpha$-Fe- and $\alpha$-Fe--C under hydrogen environments. The NEP enables large-scale atomistic simulations with DFT-level accuracy at the cost of empirical potentials, offering a practical tool to study hydrogen embrittlement in steel.</description>

At the core of these processors are the photonic waveguide meshes that enable flexible light routing and manipulation. However, recirculating hexagonal waveguide meshes, which currently constitute the basic component of the mesh, are essentially limited by the fixed dimensions of their elementary cells, which consist of as many as six components, limiting their spectral and temporal resolution. These limitations have a detrimental effect on the processing of broadband signals and the application of high-precision delay lines. Here, we introduce the concept of shifted rectangular waveguide mesh architecture for programmable photonics by shifting the adjacent columns or rows by a certain specific value. The operation of these shifted rectangular cells is predicated on the rectangular shape of the cell, which is associated with a smaller number of tunable basic units (TBUs), i.e., four, compared to cells based on a hexagonal mesh, i.e., six. However, at the same time, they allow the signal to be redirected to the input port, which distinguishes them from the regular square mesh-based structure. This approach unlocks new degrees of freedom in programmable photonic circuits, offering enhanced spectral and temporal tunability. Additionally, it paves the way for advanced application in topological photonics, quantum information processing, neuromorphic and high-speed optical computing. The photonic chip arranged in this architecture is capable of implementing one or multiple simultaneous photonics circuits with optical feedback paths and/or linear multiport transformations by the appropriate programming of its resources and the selection of its input and output ports.</description>

      <title>Performance of artificial neural networks in an inverse problem of laser beam diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Results are presented for the numerical verification of a method devised to identify an unknown spatio-temporal distribution of heat flux that occurs at the surface of thin aluminum plate, as a result of pulsed, high-power laser beam excitation. The presented identification of boundary heat flux function is a part of newly-proposed laser beam profiling method and utilizes artificial neural networks trained on temperature distributions generated with the ANSYS Fluent solver. The paper focuses on the selection of the most effective neural network hyperparameters (Keras, Tensorflow) and compares the results of neural network identification with Levenberg-Marquardt method used earlier and discussed in our previous articles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing heterogeneous, self-assembling systems is a central challenge in soft matter and biology. We present a framework that uses gradient-based optimization to invert an analytical yield calculation, tuning systems toward target equilibrium yields. We design systems ranging from simple dimers to temperature-controlled shells to polymerizing systems, achieving precise control of self- and non-self-limiting assemblies. By operating directly on closed-form calculations, our framework bypasses trajectory-based instabilities and enables efficient optimization in otherwise challenging regimes.</description>

      <title>Circular Huygens Dipoles: Unidirectional Spin-Angular Momentum from Achiral Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous control over the directionality and spin of light at the nanoscale is a central goal in nanophotonics with applications ranging from quantum information to advanced biosensing. We introduce the concept of the Circular Huygens Dipole and numerically demonstrate its realization in a single Si nanocuboid. We show that the polarization of an incident linear wave controls the interference between co-located circular electric and magnetic dipoles excited in phase quadrature. This enables deterministic switching of the forward-scattered radiation between purely right- and left-circularly polarized states. The system also functions as a directional spin-to-linear polarization converter. Our findings establish a robust, passive method for reconfigurable spin-directional control in a simple, monolithic silicon nanostructure, opening avenues for chip-scale spin-optics, chiral quantum interfaces, and novel sensing platforms.</description>

      <title>Picosecond-scale Heterogeneous Melting of Metals at Extreme Non-equilibrium States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme electron-ion non-equilibrium states, generated by ultrafast laser excitation, lead to melting processes that are fundamentally different from those under conventional thermal equilibrium and remain not fully understood. Through neural network-enhanced multiscale simulations of tungsten and gold nanofilms, we identify electronic pressure relaxation as critical to heterogeneous phase transformations. This nonthermal expansion generates a density decrease that enable surface-initiated melting far below equilibrium melting temperatures, creating electronic pressure-driven solid-liquid interface propagation at a high speed of 2500 m/s -- tenfold faster than that of thermal heterogeneous melting mechanisms. Simulated time-resolved X-ray diffraction signatures distinguish this nonthermal expansion from thermal expansion dynamics driven by thermoelastic stress. These results establish hot-electron-mediated lattice destabilization as a universal pathway for laser-induced structural transformations, providing new insights for interpreting time-resolved experiments and controlling laser-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Inverse design for robust inference in integrated computational spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an inverse-design approach for computational spectrometers in which the scattering media are topology-optimized to achieve better performance in inference of unknown spectra. Unlike traditional end-to-end approaches, our inverse design of the scattering media does not need a training set of spectra, a distribution of detector noise, or an inference algorithm. Our approach allows the selection of the inference algorithm to be decoupled from that of the scatterer. For smooth spectra, we additionally devise a regularized reconstruction algorithm based on Chebyshev interpolation, which yields higher accuracy compared with conventional methods in which the spectra are sampled at equally spaced frequencies or wavelengths with equal weights. Our approaches are numerically demonstrated via inverse design of integrated computational spectrometers and reconstruction of example spectra. The inverse-designed spectrometers exhibit significantly better performance in the presence of noise than their counterparts with random scatterers. Our method provides a useful complement to end-to-end co-design methods.</description>

      <title>Tip-Based Proximity Ferroelectric Switching and Piezoelectric Response in Wurtzite Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proximity ferroelectricity is a novel paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity, where a non-ferroelectric polar material, which is unswitchable with an external field below the dielectric breakdown field, becomes a practically switchable ferroelectric in direct contact with a thin switchable ferroelectric layer. Here, we develop a Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach to study the proximity effect of local piezoelectric response and polarization reversal in wurtzite ferroelectric multilayers under a sharp electrically biased tip. Using finite element modeling we analyze the probe-induced nucleation of nanodomains, the features of local polarization hysteresis loops and coercive fields in the Al1-xScxN/AlN bilayers and three-layers. Similar to the wurtzite multilayers sandwiched between two parallel electrodes, the regimes of "proximity switching" (where the multilayers collectively switch) and the regime of "proximity suppression" (where they collectively do not switch) are the only two possible regimes in the probe-electrode geometry. However, the parameters and asymmetry of the local piezo-response and polarization hysteresis loops depend significantly on the sequence of the layers with respect to the probe. The physical mechanism of the proximity ferroelectricity in the local probe geometry is a depolarizing electric field determined by the polarization of the layers and their relative thickness. The field, whose direction is opposite to the polarization vector in the layer(s) with the larger spontaneous polarization (such as AlN), renormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier in the "otherwise unswitchable" polar layers. Tip-based control of domains in otherwise non-ferroelectric layers using proximity ferroelectricity can provide nanoscale control of domain reversal in memory, actuation, sensing and optical applications.</description>

      <title>Laboratory and Synchrotron Validation of $\mu$-XRF for Sulfur Mapping in CTMP Paper Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition toward renewable, fiber-based packaging requires an improved understanding of chemical modifications in high-yield pulps such as chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP). Sulfonation uniformity is essential for the energy-efficient production of high-strength CTMP pulp. However, laboratory methods only measure total sulfur and cannot illustrate its distribution at the fiber level, which can be visualized using $\mu$-XRF. In this work, we present a laboratory $\mu$-XRF system developed at Mid Sweden University and assess its capability to detect light elements in CTMP paper handsheets. A 32 $\times$ 32 point grid scan (1.6-1.6 mm$^2$ field of view, 50 $\mu$m step, 300 s/point) successfully resolved sulfur K$\alpha$ (2.31 keV) and calcium K$\alpha$ (3.69 keV) fluorescence without helium flushing. Comparative measurements at the Elettra synchrotron confirmed consistency of sulfur peak position and spatial distribution, with higher spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Histogram analysis using Wasserstein distance metrics demonstrated close agreement between datasets despite differing acquisition conditions. These results demonstrate that laboratory XRF can reproducibly detect and map sulfur in CTMP fibers under ambient conditions, providing a practical tool to complement synchrotron studies and supporting the development of energy-efficient, fiber-based packaging materials.</description>

      <title>Optimal swimming with body compliance in an overdamped medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elongate animals and robots use undulatory body waves to locomote through diverse environments. Geometric mechanics provides a framework to model and optimize such systems in highly damped environments, connecting a prescribed shape change pattern (gait) with locomotion displacement. However, the practical applicability of controlling compliant physical robots remains to be demonstrated. In this work, we develop a framework based on geometric mechanics to predict locomotor performance and search for optimal swimming strategies of compliant swimmers. We introduce a compliant extension of Purcell's three-link swimmer by incorporating series-connected springs at the joints. Body dynamics are derived using resistive force theory. Geometric mechanics is incorporated into movement prediction and into an optimization framework that identifies strategies for controlling compliant swimmers to achieve maximal displacement. We validate our framework on a physical cable-driven three-link limbless robot and demonstrate accurate prediction and optimization of locomotor performance under varied programmed, state-dependent compliance in a granular medium. Our results establish a systematic, physics-based approach for modeling and controlling compliant swimming locomotion, highlighting compliance as a design feature that can be exploited for robust movement in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments.</description>
