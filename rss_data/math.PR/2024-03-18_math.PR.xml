      <title>Existence and uniqueness for the solutions of non-autonomous stochastic differential algebraic equations with locally Lipschitz coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the well-posedness and regularity of non-autonomous stochastic differential algebraic equations (SDAEs) with nonlinear, locally Lipschitz and monotone (2) coefficients of the form (1). The main difficulty is the fact that the operator A(.) is non-autonomous, i.~e. depends on t and the matrix $A(t)$ is singular for all $t\in \left[0,T\right]$. Our interest is in SDAE of index-1. This means that in order to solve the problem, we can transform the initial SDAEs into an ordinary stochastic differential equation with algebraic constraints. Under appropriate hypothesizes, the main result establishes the existence and uniqueness of the solution in $\mathcal{M}^p(\left[0, T\right], \mathbb{R}^n)$, $p\geq 2$, $p\in \mathbb{N}$. Several strong estimations and regularity results are also provided. Note that, in this paper, we use various techniques such as It\^o's lemma, Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality, and Young inequality.</description>

      <title>Bicausal optimal transport for SDEs with irregular coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve constrained optimal transport problems between the laws of solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We consider SDEs with irregular coefficients, making only minimal regularity assumptions. We show that the so-called synchronous coupling is optimal among bicausal couplings, that is couplings that respect the flow of information encoded in the stochastic processes. Our results provide a method to numerically compute the adapted Wasserstein distance between laws of SDEs with irregular coefficients. Moreover, we introduce a transformation-based semi-implicit numerical scheme and establish the first strong convergence result for SDEs with exponentially growing and discontinuous drift.</description>

      <title>Long-time behavior for discretization schemes of Fokker-Planck equations via couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-time Markov chains associated to finite-volume discretization schemes of Fokker-Planck equations are constructed. Sufficient conditions under which quantitative exponential decay in the $\phi$-entropy and Wasserstein distance are established, implying modified logarithmic Sobolev, Poincar\'e, and discrete Beckner inequalities. The results are not restricted to additive potentials and do not make use of discrete Bochner-type identities. The proof for the $\phi$-decay relies on a coupling technique due to Conforti, while the proof for the Wasserstein distance uses the path coupling method. Furthermore, exponential equilibration for discrete-time Markov chains is proved, based on an abstract discrete Bakry-Emery method and a path coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for invariance of finite dimensional submanifolds for rough differential equations (RDEs) with values in a Banach space. Furthermore, we apply our findings to the particular situation of random RDEs driven by $Q$-Wiener processes and random RDEs driven by $Q$-fractional Brownian motion.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis for general Wigner-type matrices in the bulk of the self-consistent spectrum, with optimal control on the fluctuations for observables of arbitrary rank. As the main technical ingredient, we prove rank-uniform optimal local laws for one and two resolvents of a Wigner-type matrix with regular observables.</description>

      <title>Stochastic integration with respect to cylindrical L\'evy processes in Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive theory of stochastic integration with respect to arbitrary cylindrical L\'evy processes in Hilbert spaces. Since cylindrical L\'evy processes do not enjoy a semi-martingale decomposition, our approach relies on an alternative approach to stochastic integration by decoupled tangent sequences. The space of deterministic integrands is identified as a modular space described in terms of the characteristics of the cylindrical L\'evy process. The space of random integrands is described as the space of predictable processes whose trajectories are in the space of deterministic integrands almost surely. The derived space of random integrands is verified as the largest space of potential integrands, based on a classical definition of stochastic integrability. We apply the introduced theory of stochastic integration to establish a dominated convergence theorem.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for the derivatives of self-intersection local time for $d$-dimensional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{B_t,t\geq0\}$ be a d-dimensional Brownian motion. We prove that the approximation of the higher derivative of renormalized self-intersection local time $$ \int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{s}\left(p^{(|k|)}_{d,\epsilon}(B_{s}-B_{r})-E[p^{(|k|)}_{d,\epsilon}(B_{s}-B_{r})]\right)drds, $$ where the multiindex $k=(k_{1},\cdots,k_{d})$, $ p_{d,\epsilon}^{(|k|)}(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_d):=\partial^{k_1}_{x_1}\partial^{k_2}_{x_2}$ $\cdots\partial^{k_d}_{x_d}p_{d,\epsilon}(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_d)$ and $p_{d,\epsilon}(x)=\frac{1}{(2\pi\epsilon)^{d/2}}e^{-\frac{|x|^{2}}{2\epsilon}}, x\in\mathbb{R}^d$, satisfies the central limit theorems when renormalized by $(\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})^{-1}$ in the case $d=2$, $|k|=1$ and by $\epsilon^{\frac{d+|k|-3}{2}}$ in the case $d\geq 3$, $|k|\geq 1$, which gives a complete answer to the conjecture of Markowsky [In S\'{e}minaire de Probabiliti\'{e}s \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral10\romannumeral50\romannumeral4} (2012) 141-148 Springer]. We as well prove that its m-th Wiener chaotic component satisfies the central limit theorems when renormalized by a multiplicative factor in different cases.</description>

      <title>A Quasi-Stationary Approach to Metastability in a System of Spiking Neurons with Synaptic Plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After reviewing the behavioral studies of working memory and of the cellular substrate of the latter, we argue that metastable states constitute candidates for the type of transient information storage required by working memory. We then present a simple neural network model made of stochastic units whose synapses exhibit short-term facilitation. The Markov process dynamics of this model was specifically designed to be analytically tractable, simple to simulate numerically and to exhibit a quasi-stationary distribution (QSD). Since the state space is finite this QSD is also a Yaglom limit, which allows us to bridge the gap between quasi-stationarity and metastability by considering the relative orders of magnitude of the relaxation and absorption times. We present first analytical results: characterization of the absorbing region of the Markov process, irreducibility outside this absorbing region and consequently existence and uniqueness of a QSD. We then apply Perron-Frobenius spectral analysis to  obtain any specific QSD, and design an approximate method for the first moments of this QSD when the exact method is intractable. Finally we use these methods to study the relaxation time toward the QSD and establish numerically the memorylessness of the time of extinction.</description>

      <title>Cokernels of random matrix products and flag Cohen--Lenstra heuristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [NVP22], Nguyen and Van Peski raised the question of whether the surjective flag of $\mathbb Z_p$-modules modeled by $\mathrm{cok}(M_1\cdots M_k)\twoheadrightarrow \dots\twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{cok}(M_1)$ for independent random matrices $M_1,\dots,M_k\in \mathrm{Mat}_n(\mathbb Z_p)$ satisfies the Cohen--Lenstra heuristic. We answer the question affirmatively when $M_1,\dots,M_k$ follow the Haar measure, and our proof demonstrates how classical ideas in Cohen--Lenstra heuristic adapt naturally to the flag setting. We also prove an analogue for non-square matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a countable group whose action on a metric space $X$ involves a contracting isometry. This setting naturally encompasses groups acting on Gromov hyperbolic spaces, Teichm\"uller space, Culler-Vogtmann Outer space and CAT(0) spaces. We discuss continuity and differentiability of the escape rate of random walks on $G$. For mapping class groups, relatively hyperbolic groups, CAT(-1) groups and CAT(0) cubical groups, we further discuss analyticity of the escape rate. Finally, assuming that the action of $G$ on $X$ is weakly properly discontinuous (WPD), we discuss continuity of the asymptotic entropy of random walks on $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theorem of Hunter ensures that the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials of even degree are positive definite functions. A probabilistic interpretation of Hunter's theorem suggests a broad generalization: the construction of so-called random vector norms on square complex matrices. This paper surveys these ideas, starting from the fundamental notions and developing the theory to its present state. We study numerous examples and present a host of open problems.</description>

      <title>Model free collision aggregation for the computation of escape distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a heat radiative transport equation, we consider a particle undergoing collisions in a space-time domain and propose a method to sample its escape time, space and direction from the domain. The first step of the procedure is an estimation of how many elementary collisions is safe to take before chances of exiting the domain are too high; then these collisions are aggregated into a single movement. The method does not use any model nor any particular regime of parameters. We give theoretical results both under the normal approximation and without it and test the method on some benchmarks from the literature. The results confirm the theoretical predictions and show that the proposal is an efficient method to sample the escape distribution of the particle.</description>

      <title>The inhomogeneous $t$-PushTASEP and Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a multispecies $t$-PushTASEP system on a finite ring of $n$ sites with site-dependent rates $x_1,\dots,x_n$. Let $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n)$ be a partition whose parts represent the species of the $n$ particles on the ring. We show that for each composition $\eta$ obtained by permuting the parts of $\lambda$, the stationary probability of being in state $\eta$ is proportional to the ASEP polynomial $F_{\eta}(x_1,\dots,x_n; q,t)$ at $q=1$; the normalizing constant (or partition function) is the Macdonald polynomial $P_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n;q,t)$ at $q=1$. Our approach involves new relations between the families of ASEP polynomials and of non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials at $q=1$. We also use multiline diagrams, showing that a single jump of the PushTASEP system is closely related to the operation of moving from one line to the next in a multiline diagram. We derive symmetry properties for the system under permutation of its jump rates, as well as a formula for the current of a single-species system.</description>

      <title>On $r$-to-$p$ norms of random matrices with nonnegative entries: Asymptotic normality and $\ell_\infty$-bounds for the maximizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.14056v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an $n\times n$ matrix $A_n$, the $r\to p$ operator norm is defined as $$\|A_n\|_{r\to p}:= \sup_{\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n:\|\mathbf{x} \|_r\leq 1 } \|A_n\mathbf{x} \|_p\quad\text{for}\quad r,p\geq 1.$$ For different choices of $r$ and $p$, this norm corresponds to key quantities that arise in diverse applications including matrix condition number estimation, clustering of data, and construction of oblivious routing schemes in transportation networks. This article considers $r\to p$ norms of symmetric random matrices with nonnegative entries, including adjacency matrices of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, matrices with positive sub-Gaussian entries, and certain sparse matrices. For $1&lt;p\leq r&lt;\infty$, the asymptotic normality, as $n\to\infty$, of the appropriately centered and scaled norm $\|A_n\|_{r\to p}$ is established. When $p \geq 2$, this is shown to imply asymptotic normality of the solution to the $\ell_p$ quadratic maximization problem, also known as the $\ell_p$ Grothendieck problem. Furthermore, a sharp $\ell_\infty$-approximation bound for the unique maximizing vector in the definition of $\|A_n\|_{r\to p}$ is obtained, and may be viewed as an $\ell_\infty$-stability result of the maximizer under random perturbations of the matrix with mean entries. This result is in fact shown to hold for a broad class of deterministic sequences of matrices having certain asymptotic expansion properties. The results obtained can be viewed as a generalization of the seminal results of F\"{u}redi and Koml\'{o}s (1981) on asymptotic normality of the largest singular value of a class of symmetric random matrices. In the general case with $1&lt;p\leq r&lt; \infty$, spectral methods are no longer applicable, and so a new approach is developed involving a refined convergence analysis of a nonlinear power method and a perturbation bound on the maximizing vector, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study products of functions evaluated at self-adjoint polynomials in deterministic matrices and independent Wigner matrices; we compute the deterministic approximations of such products and control the fluctuations. We focus on minimizing the assumption of smoothness on those functions while optimizing the error term with respect to $N$, the size of the matrices. As an application, we build on the idea that the long-time Heisenberg evolution associated to Wigner matrices generates asymptotic freeness as first shown in $[9]$. More precisely given $P$ a self-adjoint non-commutative polynomial and $Y^N$ a $d$-tuple of independent Wigner matrices, we prove that the quantum evolution associated to the operator $P(Y^N)$ yields asymptotic freeness for large times.</description>

Abstract: We study asymptotic infinitesimal distribution of Gaussian Unitary Ensembles with permuted entries. We show that for random uniform permutation asymptotically permuted GUE matrix has null infinitesimal distribution. Moreover we show that asymptotically different permutations of the same GUE matrix are infinitesimally free. Besides this we study particular example of entry permutation - the transpose and we show that while a GUE matrix is asymptotically free from its transpose it is not infinitesimally free from it.</description>

Various functional inequalities follow including a local spectral gap inequality, the Lipschitz Feller property, the dimension-free Harnack inequality and the evolutional variation inequality. As a consequence, the infinite Dyson Brownian motion is characterised as a gradient flow of the Boltzmann-Shannon entropy associated with $\mathsf{sine}_\beta$ point processes with respect to a certain Benamou-Brenier-like Wasserstein distance. At the end, we provide a sufficient condition for $\mathsf{BE}(K, \infty)$ beyond the Dyson model and apply it to the infinite particle model of the $\beta$-Riesz gas.</description>

      <title>Estimates for exponential functionals of continuous Gaussian processes with emphasis on fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our aim in this article is to provide explicit computable estimates for the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) and the $p$-th order moment of the exponential functional of a fractional Brownian motion (fBM) with drift. Using elementary techniques, we prove general upper bounds for the c.d.f. of exponential functionals of continuous Gaussian processes. On the other hand, by applying classical results for extremes of Gaussian processes, we derive general lower bounds. We also find estimates for the $p$-th order moment and the moment-generating function of such functionals. As a consequence, we obtain explicit lower and upper bounds for the c.d.f. and the $p$-th order moment of the exponential functionals of a fBM, and of a series of independent fBMs. In addition, we show the continuity in law of the exponential functional of a fBM with respect to the Hurst parameter.</description>

      <title>The fractional free convolution of $R$-diagonal elements and random polynomials under repeated differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the free convolution of Brown measures of $R$-diagonal elements introduced by K\"{o}sters and Tikhomirov [Probab. Math. Statist. 38 (2018), no. 2, 359--384] to fractional powers. We then show how this fractional free convolution arises naturally when studying the roots of random polynomials with independent coefficients under repeated differentiation. When the proportion of derivatives to the degree approaches one, we establish central limit theorem-type behavior and discuss stable distributions.</description>

      <title>Localization of Random Surfaces with Monotone Potentials and an FKG-Gaussian Correlation Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The seminal 1975 work of Brascamp-Lieb-Lebowitz initiated the rigorous study of Ginzberg-Landau random surface models. It was conjectured therein that fluctuations are localized on $\mathbb Z^d$ when $d\geq 3$ for very general potentials, matching the behavior of the Gaussian free field. We confirm this behavior for all even potentials $U:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ satisfying $U'(x)\geq \min(\varepsilon x,\frac{1+\varepsilon}{x})$ on $x\in \mathbb R^+$. Given correspondingly stronger growth conditions on $U$, we show power or stretched exponential tail bounds on all transient graphs, which determine the maximum field value up to constants in many cases. Further extensions include non-wired boundary conditions and iterated Laplacian analogs such as the membrane model. Our main tool is an FKG-based generalization of the Gaussian correlation inequality, which is used to dominate the finite-volume Gibbs measures by mixtures of centered Gaussian fields.</description>

Abstract: This note is a continuation of the author's previous work on "Sharp bounds for the max-sliced Wasserstein distance." We use the same technique to obtain an upper bound for the expected max-sliced 2-Wasserstein distance between a compactly supported symmetric probability measure on a Euclidean space and its symmetrized empirical distribution.</description>

      <title>Hereditary subshifts whose measure of maximal entropy has no Gibbs property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.07643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the measure of maximal entropy for the hereditary closure of a $\mathscr{B}$-free subshift has the Gibbs property if and only if the Mirsky measure of the subshift is purely atomic. This answers an open question asked by Peckner. Moreover, we show that $\mathscr{B}$ is taut whenever the corresponding Mirsky measure $\nu_\eta$ has full support. This is the converse theorem to a recent result of Keller.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence of relaxed optimal controls in the weak formulation of stochastic control problems for stochastic Volterra equations (SVEs). Our study can be applied to rough processes that arise when the kernel appearing in the controlled SVE is singular at zero. The existence of relaxed optimal policies relies on the interaction between integrability hypotheses on the kernel and growth conditions on the running cost functional and the coefficients of the controlled SVEs. Under classical convexity assumptions, we can also deduce the existence of optimal strict controls.</description>

      <title>Post-Lie algebras of derivations and regularity structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a commutative algebra $A$, we exhibit a canonical structure of post-Lie algebra on the space $A\otimes Der(A)$ where $Der(A)$ is the space of derivations on $A$, in order to use the machinery given in [Guin &amp; Oudom 2008] and [Ebrahimi-Fard &amp; Lundervold &amp; Munthe-Kaas 2015] and to define a Hopf algebra structure on the associated enveloping algebra with a natural action on $A$. We apply these results to the setting of [Linares &amp; Otto &amp; Tempelmayr 2023], giving a simpler and more efficient construction of their action and extending the recent work [Bruned &amp; Katsetsiadis]. This approach gives an optimal setting to perform explicit computations in the associated structure group.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic fluctuation theory of local time in lattice gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local time in an ensemble of particles measures the amount of time the particles spend in the vicinity of a given point in space. Here we study fluctuations of the empirical time average $R= T^{-1}\int_{0}^{T}\rho\left(x=0,t\right)\,dt$ of the density $\rho\left(x=0,t\right)$ at the origin (so that $R$ is the local time spent at the origin, rescaled by $T$) for an initially uniform one-dimensional diffusive lattice gas. We consider both the quenched and annealed initial conditions and employ the Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory (MFT). For a gas of non-interacting random walkers (RWs) the MFT yields exact large-deviation functions of $R$, which are closely related to the ones recently obtained by Burenev \textit{et al.} (2023) using microscopic calculations for non-interacting Brownian particles. Our MFT calculations, however, additionally yield the most likely history of the gas density $\rho(x,t)$ conditioned on a given value of $R$. Furthermore, we calculate the variance of the local time fluctuations for arbitrary particle- or energy-conserving diffusive lattice gases. Better known examples of such systems include the simple symmetric exclusion process, the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti model and the symmetric zero-range process. Our results for the non-interacting RWs can be readily extended to a step-like initial condition for the density.</description>

      <title>Anomalous scaling of heterogeneous elastic lines: a new picture from sample to sample fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a discrete model of an heterogeneous elastic line with internal disorder, submitted to thermal fluctuations. The monomers are connected through random springs with independent and identically distributed elastic constants drawn from $p(k)\sim k^{\mu-1}$ for $k\to0$. When $\mu&gt;1$, the scaling of the standard Edwards-Wilkinson model is recovered. When $\mu&lt;1$, the elastic line exhibits an anomalous scaling of the type observed in many growth models and experiments. Here we derive and use the exact expression for the exact probability distribution of the line shape at equilibrium, as well as the spectral properties of the matrix containing the random couplings, to fully characterize the sample to sample fluctuations. Our results lead to novel scaling predictions that partially disagree with previous works, but which are corroborated by numerical simulations. We also provide a novel interpretation of the anomalous scaling in terms of the abrupt jumps in the line's shape that dominate the average value of the observable.</description>
