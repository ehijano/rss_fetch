      <title>Absorption, Scattering, Geodesics, Shadows and Lensing Phenomena of Black Holes in Effective Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the signatures of black holes within an effective quantum gravity framework recently proposed in the literature [1] . We begin by outlining the general setup, highlighting the two distinct models under consideration. This includes a discussion of their general properties, interpretations, and the structure of the event and inner horizons. We then examine the behavior of light in this context, analyzing geodesics, the photon sphere, and shadow formation. To validate our results, we estimate lower bounds for the shadow radius based on observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Subsequently, we derive the partial radial wave equation for scalar perturbations, enabling us to study the absorption cross section in both low and high frequency regimes. Additionally, we evaluate the greybody factors and provide bounds for both bosonic and fermionic fields. Finally, we present a detailed analysis of gravitational lensing in both the weak and strong deflection limits. For the weak deflection regime, the Gauss Bonnet theorem is employed, while for the strong deflection limit, the Tsukamoto approach is utilized.</description>

      <title>Study of Cosmic Evolution admitting Thermodynamic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines the cosmic evolution in the framework of symmetric teleparallel theory, characterized by the function of non-metricity scalar $(\mathcal{Q})$. We use the e-folding number and reconstruction method with a suitable parametrization of the scale factor to obtain the functional form of symmetric teleparallel theory. Using this reconstructed model, we examine the behavior of different cosmographic parameters to demonstrate the bouncing scenarios of the cosmos by considering the contraction and expansion phases of cosmos before and after the bouncing point, respectively. It is found that the null energy condition is violated which shows that the singularity issue can be resolved in this extended theoretical framework. Moreover, we observe that the acceleration occurs near the bouncing point and the reconstructed model aligns with the current cosmic expansion. Finally, we check the validity of second law of thermodynamics in the bouncing framework of our model.</description>

      <title>Probing deviations to Kerr geometry with extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the primary research aims of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission is to comprehensively map the Kerr spacetime, a fundamental pursuit in the realm of general relativity. To achieve this goal, it is essential to develop precise tools capable of discerning any deviations from the Kerr geometry. Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) stand out as particularly promising sources for probing the spacetime metric, offering profound insights into gravitational phenomena. In this direction, we analyze a deformed Kerr geometry, being the central source of an EMRI system, with an inspiralling object that exhibits eccentric equatorial motion. We conduct a leading-order post-Newtonian analysis and examine the deviations in gravitational wave flux and phase with their leading-order contributions. Our findings evaluate the detectability of these deviations through gravitational wave dephasing and mismatch, highlighting the pivotal role of LISA observations in advancing our understanding of spacetime geometry.</description>

      <title>Validity of black hole complementarity in an accelerating Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08548v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole complementarity has been well understood in spherically symmetric black holes. To study its validity for an accelerating Schwarzschild black hole, which has a preferred direction, we perform the thought experiment proposed by Susskind and Thorlacius and further investigate the criteria set by Hayden and Preskill. First, we derive thermodynamic quantities that satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. Using these quantities, we conduct thought experiments based on the Page time and the scrambling time, which show that black hole complementarity remains valid, although the energy required for the duplication of information depends on the angle due to the axisymmetric metric.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signal Denoising and Merger Time Prediction By Deep Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mergers of massive black hole binaries could generate rich electromagnetic emissions, which allow us to probe the environments surrounding these massive black holes and gain deeper insights into the high energy astrophysics. However, due to the short timescale of binary mergers, it is crucial to predict the time of the merger in advance to devise detailed observational plans. The significant noise and the slow accumulation of signal-to-noise ratio in the inspiral phase make this task particularly challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep neural denoising network in this study, capable of denoising continuous inspiral phase signals lasting up to 30 days. Following the denoising process, we perform the detection and merger time prediction based on the denoised signals. Our results demonstrate that for inspiral phase data with a signal-to-noise ratio between 10 and 50 occurring no more than 10 days before the merger, our prediction error for the merger time is generally within 24 hours.</description>

      <title>Tracing the nonlinear formation of an interfacial wave spectral cascade from one to few to many</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Far-from-equilibrium phenomena unveil the intricate principles of complex systems, including snowflake growth and fluid turbulence, with broad applications ranging from foreign exchange trading to climate modeling. A recurring feature across these systems is the emergence of a spectral cascade, where energy is transferred across the system's length scales, following a simple power law. The statistical theory of weak wave turbulence, in which only leading order interactions are considered, successfully predicts scaling laws for stationary states in idealised scenarios. Realistic conditions, such as finite size and amplitude effects, and strong dissipation, remain beyond our current understanding. Lacking comprehensive theoretical insight, we experimentally trace the formation of a spectral cascade under these conditions. Using an externally driven fluid-fluid interface, we successfully resolve individual wave modes and track their real-time evolution from one to few to many. This process culminates in a steady state whose power spectral density is fully characterised by a power-law scaling. We further quantify specific interactions through statistical correlations to reveal a hierarchy in the wave-mixing order, thus confirming a key assumption of weak-wave turbulence. We present a comprehensive time-evolution analysis that is crucial in identifying critical points where the interface undergoes significant changes. Our findings validate that the interfacial dynamics can be effectively modelled using a weakly nonlinear Lagrangian theory, enabling us to explore its applicability to other out-of-equilibrium systems. Notably, we uncover intriguing connections to reheating scenarios following cosmic inflation in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Connecting quasi-normal modes with causality in Lovelock theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eikonal correspondence between the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of asymptotically flat static spherically symmetric black holes and the properties of unstable null circular geodesics is studied in the case of higher dimensional Lovelock black holes (BHs). It is known that such correspondence does not generically hold for gravitational QNMs associated with BHs in Lovelock theories. In the present work, we revisit this correspondence and establish the relationship between the eikonal QNMs and the causal properties of the gravitational field equations in Lovelock theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous breaking of diffeomorphism invariance in conformally reduced quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spontaneous breaking of diffeomorphism invariance using the proper-time non-perturbative flow equation in quantum gravity. In particular, we analyze the structure of the UV critical manifold of conformally reduced Einstein-Hilbert theory and observe the occurrence of a non-trivial minimum for the conformal factor at Planckian energies. We argue that our result can be interpreted as the occurrence of a dynamically generated minimal length in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>The problem of time for non-deparametrizable models and quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article I introduce a distinction between two types of reparametrization invariant models and I argue that while both suffer from a problem of time at the time of applying canonical quantization methods to quantize them, its severity depends greatly on the type of model. Deparametrizable models are models that have time as a configuration or phase space variable and this makes it the case that the problem of time can be solved. In the case of non-deparametrizable models, we cannot find time in the configuration or phase space of the model, and hence the techniques that allow solving the problem in the deparametrizable case do not apply. This seems to signal that the canonical quantization techniques fail to give a satisfactory quantization of non-deparametrizable models. As I argue that general relativity is non-deparametrizable, this implies that the canonical quantization of this theory may fail to provide a successful theory of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Probing the warped vacuum geometry around a Kerr black hole by quasi-periodic oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the context of a new rotating black hole solution that incorporates a cosmological constant. Recent work by the authors in \cite{Ovalle:2022eqb} interpreted the cosmological constant, denoted as $\Lambda$, as a form of vacuum energy and employed a gravitational decoupling approach to derive an extended Kerr-de Sitter black hole solution, which is geometrically richer than the classical case. In this study, we derive the expressions for timelike circular geodesics within this solution and, using a relativistic precision model, calculate the corresponding frequencies of the QPOs. To constrain our model, we apply Bayesian formalism, utilizing data from three well-known microquasars: GRO 1655-40, XTE 1550-564, and GRS 1915+105. Our analysis reveals that$\Lambda$ is degenerate and correlated with other parameters. Finally, we perform a Bayesian model comparison with the Kerr metric and find that the Kerr metric is favored among the models considered.</description>

      <title>Precessions of spherical orbits in the rotating Melvin black hole spacetime and its constraints from the jet of M87*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate precessions of spherical orbits of timelike particles in the background of a rotating black hole immersed in the Melvin magnetic field, and probe effects of the magnetic field on the precession period. Our results show that effects of the magnetic field on the particles' motions gradually decrease with the titled angle and finally vanish as the titled angle tends to $\pi/2$. With the increase of the magnetic field parameter, we find that the precession becomes rapidly. Modelling the spherical orbit to the warp radius in the accretion disk and with the observed precession period from the jet of M87*, we analyze the allowed regions of the black hole parameters and the warp radius in the accretion disk. Especially, we find a novel degenerated phenomenon of precession periods arising from magnetic field for two different spherical orbits, which does not appear in the usual Kerr black hole case. Moreover, we also discuss the possibility of observing effects of the magnetic field on the precession periods of jets for astrophysical black holes. Our study could help to further understand the rotating Melvin black hole and the relationship between magnetic fields and precessions of jets.</description>

      <title>On the impact of neutrinos on the launching of relativistic jets from "magnetars" produced in neutron-star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant interest has emerged recently in assessing whether collimated and ultra-relativistic outflows can be produced by a long-lived remnant from a binary neutron-star (BNS) merger, with different approaches leading to different outcomes. To clarify some of the aspect of this process, we report the results of long-term (\ie $\sim~110\,{\rm ms}$) state-of-the-art general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the inspiral and merger of a BNS system of magnetized stars. We find that after $\sim~50\,{\rm ms}$ from the merger, an $\alpha$-$\Omega$~dynamo driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) sets-in in the densest regions of the disk and leads to the breakout of the magnetic-field lines from the accretion disk around the remnant. The breakout, which can be associated with the violation of the Parker-stability criterion, is responsible for the generation of a collimated, magnetically-driven outflow with only mildly relativistic velocities that is responsible for a violent eruption of electromagnetic energy. We provide evidence that this outflow is partly collimated via a Blandford-Payne mechanism driven by the open field lines anchored in the inner disk regions. Finally, by including or not the radiative transport via neutrinos, we determine the role they play in the launching of the collimated wind. In this way, we conclude that the mechanism of magnetic-field breakout we observe is robust and takes place even without neutrinos. Contrary to previous expectations, the inclusion of neutrinos absorption and emission leads to a smaller baryon pollution in polar regions, and hence accelerates the occurrence of the breakout, yielding a larger electromagnetic luminosity. Given the mildly relativistic nature of these disk-driven breakout outflows, it is difficult to consider them responsible for the jet phenomenology observed in short gamma-ray bursts.</description>

      <title>Generalized Euler Equation from Effective Action: Implications for the Smarr Formula in AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derived a generalized Euler equation, $\epsilon+p=sT+\mu q+y\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}$, using the effective field theory formulation of perfect fluids. This generalization was achieved by introducing a new variable $y$ into the effective action, which encodes geometrical information about the spacetime where the fluid is on. Notably, the generalized Euler equation is independent of the AdS/CFT correspondence. However, when applied to a holographic perfect fluid, this equation naturally recovers the Smarr formula for AdS black holes, thus situating the physical interpretation of the Smarr formula within the framework of Gauge/Gravity duality. Finally, our findings raise questions regarding the validity of the extended black hole thermodynamics proposal, which associates the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ with a thermodynamic variable.</description>

      <title>A test for LISA foreground Gaussianity and stationarity. I. Galactic white-dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upcoming space-based gravitational-wave detectors will be sensitive to millions and resolve tens of thousands of stellar-mass binary systems at mHz frequencies. The vast majority of these will be double white dwarfs in our Galaxy. The greatest part will remain unresolved, forming an incoherent stochastic foreground signal. Using state-of-the-art Galactic models for the formation and evolution of binary white dwarfs and accurate LISA simulated signals, we introduce a test for foreground Gaussianity and stationarity. We explain the former with a new analytical modulation induced by the LISA constellation motion and the intrinsic anisotropy of the source distribution. By demodulating the foreground signal, we reveal a deviation from Gaussianity in the 2-10 mHz frequency band. Our finding is crucial to design faithful data models, i.e. unbiased likelihoods for both individual sources and astrophysical foregrounds parameter estimation, and ultimately for an accurate interpretation of the LISA data.</description>

      <title>Unitarity through PT symmetry in Quantum Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theories described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are known to possess strictly positive energy eigenvalues and exhibit unitary time evolution if the Hamiltonian is symmetric under discrete parity and time (PT) transformation. In this work, we demonstrate how quantum quadratic gravity, a theory that generally violates unitarity when viewed as a Hermitian quantum field theory, can be complex-deformed into such a PT-symmetric theory with an action that consists of a ghost-less Hermitian free part and non-Hermitian interactions. Paying special attention to the gauge symmetry present in the theory, we quantize in the covariant operator formalism after suggesting how the framework might be extended to the pseudo-Hermitian picture. We find compelling evidence that the resulting quantum theory possesses a unitary inner product and a sensible interpretation of quantum probability, thus avoiding the ghost problem present in the Hermitian formulation of quadratic gravity.</description>

      <title>On a model of variable curvature that mimics the observed Universe acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new model based on General Relativity in where a subtle change of curvature at late times is able to produce the observed Universe acceleration and an oscillating behavior in the effective equation of state, similar to what has been claimed by recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation observations. This model is reassembled in the gap between traditional FLRW homogeneous and isotropic models and those Stephani models providing inhomogeneity functions in the time derivatives to explore other forms of varying curvature functions. Remarkably, in addition to an accelerated phase close to the usual $\Lambda$CDM equivalent transition from decelerated to accelerated Universe at $z \sim 0.6$, we also predict a slight decelerated behavior at $z=0$ in agreement with diverse Dark Energy parameterizations. To test our model, we considered the corresponding curvature transition to be sufficiently small (i.e., having $\dot{\kappa}\approx0$ preserved) and defined by a smooth step-like function with a slight change between two curvature values. We implemented a MCMC Likelihood analysis using cosmic chronometers and Type Ia supernovae (local Universe observations) data in order to constraint the free parameters of the model and reconstruct $H(z)$, $q(z)$, $w_{eff}(z)$ and its comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM model. As a result, our model provides an alternative to understand the Universe acceleration without the need of a cosmological constant, obtaining the same fraction of matter density as in the traditional standard model. The behavior of the proposed model points towards a new and intriguing way to test slight violations to the cosmological principle, in particular the case of inhomogenities during low phase transitions.</description>

      <title>GPS Observables in Newtonian Spacetime or Why We Do Not Need 'Physical' Coordinate Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some authors have defended the claim that one needs to be able to define 'physical coordinate systems' and 'observables' in order to make sense of general relativity. Moreover, in Rovelli (Physical Review D, 65(4), 044017 2002), Rovelli proposes a way of implementing these ideas by making use of a system of satellites that allows defining a set of 'physical coordinates', the GPS coordinates. In this article I oppose these views in four ways. First, I defend an alternative way of understanding general relativity which implies that we have a perfectly fine interpretation of the models of the theory even in the absence of 'physical coordinate systems'. Second, I analyze and challenge the motivations behind the 'observable' view. Third, I analyze Rovelli's proposal and I conclude that it does not allow extracting any physical information from our models that wasn't available before. Fourth, I draw an analogy between general relativistic spacetimes and Newtonian spacetimes, which allows me to argue that as 'physical observables' are not needed in Newtonian spacetime, then neither are they in general relativity. In this sense, I conclude that the 'observable' view of general relativity is unmotivated.</description>

      <title>Gauging generalised symmetries in linear gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of a free spin-2 field on Minkowski spacetime has 1-form and $(d-3)$-form symmetries associated with conserved currents formed by contractions of the linearised Riemann tensor with conformal Killing-Yano 2-forms. We show that a subset of these can be interpreted as Noether currents for specific shift symmetries of the graviton that involve a Killing vector and a closed 1-form parameter. We give a systematic method to gauge these 1-form symmetries by coupling the currents to background gauge fields and introducing a particular set of counter-terms involving the background fields. The simultaneous gauging of certain pairs of 1-form and $(d-3)$-form symmetries is obstructed by the presence of mixed 't Hooft anomalies. The anomalous pairs of symmetries are those which are related by gravitational duality. The implications of these anomalies are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute analytically greybody factors for asymptotically flat spherically symmetric black holes with stringy higher derivative corrections in d dimensions in the high frequency limit. Our calculations include both the eikonal limit - where the real part of the frequency of the scattered wave is much larger than the imaginary part - and the highly damped case - where the imaginary part of the frequency is much larger than the real part -, addressing the emission of gravitons and test scalar fields, and yielding full transmission and reflection scattering coefficients.</description>

      <title>A test for LISA foreground Gaussianity and stationarity. II. Extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are key observational targets for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. Unresolvable EMRI signals contribute to forming a gravitational wave background (GWB). Characterizing the statistical features of the GWB from EMRIs is of great importance, as EMRIs will ubiquitously affect large segments of the inference scheme. In this work, we apply a frequentist test for GWB Gaussianity and stationarity, exploring three astrophysically-motivated EMRI populations. We construct the resulting signal by combining state-of-the-art EMRI waveforms and a detailed description of the LISA response with time-delay interferometric variables. Depending on the brightness of the GWB, our analysis demonstrates that the resultant EMRI foregrounds show varying degrees of departure from the usual statistical assumptions that the GWBs are both Gaussian and Stationary. If the GWB is non-stationary with non-Gaussian features, this will challenge the robustness of Gaussian-likelihood model, when applied to global inference results, e.g. foreground estimation, background detection, and individual-source parameters reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the non-Gaussian corrections to the energy density and anisotropies of gravitational waves induced after an ultra-slow-roll phase of inflation by using a diagrammatic approach, and present the corresponding Feynman rules. Our two-loop calculation includes both the intrinsic non-Gaussianity of the inflaton perturbation $\delta\phi$ and the non-Gaussianity arising from the nonlinear relation between the latter and the curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}$. We apply our formalism to an analytical model in which the ultra-slow-roll phase is followed by a constant-roll stage with a nonvanishing second slow-roll parameter $\eta$, and address the renormalization of the one-loop scalar power spectrum in this scenario.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic noncommutative-geometry wormholes as emergent phenomena in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noncommutative geometry, an offshoot of string theory, replaces point-like particles by smeared objects. These local effects have led to wormhole solutions in a semiclassical setting, but it has also been claimed that the noncommutative effects can be implemented by modifying only the energy momentum tensor in the Einstein field equations, while leaving the Einstein tensor unchanged. The implication is that noncommutative-geometry wormholes could be macroscopic. This result can be readily explained by considering the noncommutative-geometry background to be a fundamental property and the macroscopic wormhole spacetime to be emergent, according to an earlier version of this paper. However, it is shown in the present version that such wormholes could not be sufficiently massive to exist on a macroscopic scale. A major objective in this paper is to invoke $f(Q)$ gravity to provide the extra degrees of freedom to overcome these obstacles.</description>

      <title>Parametrized multipolar gravitational waveforms for testing general relativity: Amplitude corrections up to 2PN order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A parametrized multipolar gravitational wave phasing within multipolar post-Minkowskian and post-Newtonian formalism was developed in earlier works [S. Kastha et al., PRD 98, 124033 (2018) and PRD 100, 044007 (2019)]. This facilitates the model-agnostic tests for the multipolar structure of compact binaries using gravitational wave observations. In this paper, we derive a parametrized multipolar amplitude of the gravitational wave signal in terms of mass and current-type radiative multipole moments within the post-Newtonian approximation to general relativity. We assume the compact binary to be moving in quasicircular orbits, with component spins (anti-) aligned with respect to the binary's orbital angular momentum. We report a closed-form expression for the parametrized multipolar amplitude of the waveform at second post-Newtonian order both in time and frequency domains. This includes the contribution from the leading five mass-type and the leading four current-type radiative moments. This framework of constructing a parametrized waveform accomplishes a generic parametrization of both gravitational wave phase and amplitude with the same set of phenomenological parameters. Hence, it should significantly enhance the precision of the multipole tests in the context of present and future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Multiparameter multipolar test of general relativity with gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amplitude and phase of the gravitational waveform from compact binary systems can be decomposed in terms of their mass- and current-type multipole moments. In a modified theory of gravity, one or more of these multipole moments could deviate from general theory of relativity. In this work, we show that a waveform model that parametrizes the amplitude and phase in terms of the multipole moments of the binary can facilitate a novel multiparameter test of general relativity with exquisite precision. Using a network of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories, simultaneous deviation in the leading seven multipoles of a GW190814-like binary can be bounded to within 6%--40% depending on the multipole order, while supermassive black hole mergers observed by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna achieve a bound of 0.3%--2%. We further argue that bounds from multipoles can be uniquely mapped onto other parametrized tests of general relativity and have the potential to become a downstream analysis from which bounds of other parametric tests of general relativity can be derived. The set of multipole parameters, therefore, provides an excellent basis to carry out precision tests of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Impact of Correlations on the Modeling and Inference of Beyond Vacuum-GR Effects in Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In gravitational-wave astronomy, extreme-mass-ratio-inspiral (EMRI) sources for the upcoming LISA observatory have the potential to serve as high-precision probes of astrophysical environments in galactic nuclei, and of potential deviations from general relativity (GR). Such ``beyond vacuum-GR'' effects are often modeled as perturbations to the evolution of vacuum EMRIs under GR. Previous studies have reported unprecedented constraints on these effects by examining the inference of one effect at a time. However, a more realistic analysis would require the simultaneous inference of multiple beyond vacuum-GR effects. The parameters describing such effects are generally significantly correlated with each other and the vacuum EMRI parameters. We explicitly show how these correlations remain even if any modeled effect is absent in the actual signal, and how they cause inference bias when any effect in the signal is absent in the analysis model. This worsens the overall measurability of the whole parameter set, challenging the constraints found by previous studies, and posing a general problem for the modeling and inference of beyond vacuum-GR effects in EMRIs.</description>

      <title>Klein-Gordon oscillators in traversable wormhole rainbow gravity spacetime: Conditional exact solvability via a throat radius and oscillator frequency correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we discuss an analytical solution for a set of the Klein-Gordon (KG) oscillators' energies through a correlation between the frequency of the KG-oscillators and the traversable wormhole (TWH) throat radius. Under such restricted parametric correlation (hence the notion of conditionally exact solvability is unavoidable in the process), we report the effects of throat radius, rainbow parameter, disclination parameter, and oscillator frequency on the spectroscopic structure of a vast number of $\left( n,m\right) $-states (the radial and magnetic quantum numbers, respectively). In the process, we only use two loop quantum gravity motivated rainbow functions pairs. The only rainbow functions that clearly and reliably fully adhere to the rainbow gravity model and secure Planck energy $E_p$ as the maximum possible energy for particles and anti-particles alike. Near the asymptotically flat upper and lower universes connected by the TWH, i.e., for the throat radius $r_{0 }&gt;&gt;1 $, the energies tend to cluster around the rest mass energies, i.e., $|E_{\pm }|\sim m_{0 }$. Whereas, for $r_{0 }&lt;&lt;1$ the energies tend to approach $|E_{\pm }| \leq E_{P}$.</description>

      <title>Minimal Elements of the Causal Boundary with Applications to Spacetime Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1972, Geroch, Kronheimer, and Penrose introduced what is now called the causal boundary of a spacetime. This boundary is constructed out of Terminal Indecomposable Past sets (TIPs) and their future analogues (TIFs), which are the pasts and futures of inextendible causal curves. The causal boundary is a key tool to understand the global structure of a spacetime. In this paper, we show that in a spacetime with compact Cauchy surfaces, there is always at least one minimal TIP and one minimal TIF, minimal meaning that it does not contain another TIP (resp.\ TIF) as a proper subset. We then study the implications of the minimal TIP and TIF meeting each other. This condition generalizes some of the "no observer horizon" conditions that have been used in the literature to obtain partial solutions of the Bartnik splitting conjecture. We also show that such a no observer horizons condition is satisfied when the spacetime has a (possibly discrete) timelike conformal symmetry, generalizing a result of Costa e Silva, Flores, and Herrera about conformal Killing vector fields.</description>

      <title>Deflection of light by wormholes and its shadow due to dark matter within modified symmetric teleparallel gravity formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of traversable wormhole formation in the dark matter halos in the context of $f(Q)$ gravity. We obtain the exact wormhole solutions with anisotropic matter source based on the Bose-Einstein condensate, Navarro-Frenk-White, and pseudo-isothermal matter density profiles. Notably, we present a novel wormhole solution supported by these dark matters using the expressions for the density profile and rotational velocity along with the modified field equations to calculate the redshift and shape functions of the wormholes. With a particular set of parameters, we demonstrate that our proposed wormhole solutions fulfill the flare-out condition against an asymptotic background. Additionally, we examine the energy conditions, focusing on the null energy conditions at the wormhole's throat, providing a graphical representation of the feasible and negative regions. Our study also examines the wormhole's shadow in the presence of various dark matter models, revealing that higher central densities result in a shadow closer to the throat, whereas lower values have the opposite effect. Moreover, we explore the deflection of light when it encounters these wormholes, particularly noting that light deflection approaches infinity at the throat, where the gravitational field is extremely strong.</description>

      <title>Effective Potential and Topological Photon Spheres: A Novel Approach to Black Hole Parameter Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we base our analysis on the assumption that the existence of a photon sphere is an intrinsic feature of any ultra-compact gravitational structure with spherical symmetry. Utilizing the concept of a topological photon sphere, we categorize the behaviors of various gravitational models based on the structure of their photon spheres. This innovative approach enables us to define boundaries for black hole parameters, subsequently allowing us to classify the model as either a black hole or a naked singularity. Indeed, we will demonstrate that the presence of this interplay between the gravitational structure and the existence of a photon sphere is a unique advantage that can be utilized from both perspectives. Our observations indicate that a gravitational model typically exhibits the behavior of a horizonless structure (or a naked singularity) when a minimum effective potential (a stable photon sphere) appears within the studied spacetime region. Additionally, in this study, we tried to investigate the effect of this structure on the behavior of the photon sphere by choosing models that are affected by the Perfect Fluid Dark Matter (PFDM). Finally, by analyzing a model with multiple event horizons, we show that the proposed method remains applicable even in such scenarios.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a Non-canonical $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work comprises a study of the thermodynamic behavior of modified $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ gravity, which had been developed based on a non-canonical theory known as K-essence theory. In this development, we use the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) type of non-standard Lagrangian. We develop a modified first law and generalized second law of thermodynamics (GSLT) within the modified $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ gravity, where we consider the background metric to be the usual Friedmann-Lema$\hat{\text{i}}$tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) type. A graphical analysis of surface gravity has been performed for the modified FLRW metric via the $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ theory, which is different from the usual FLRW gravity through the usual $f(R,T)$ gravity. Exponential and power law scale factors are used to analyze cosmic surface gravity. Through the investigation of the modified GSLT, using the relation of scale factor with the scalar field, we have seen that during the initial phase of the universe, the entropy's rate of change may be either negative or positive, contingent upon the value of the curvature constant. The negativity of the entropy change indicates that the modified GSLT is not feasible in that particular area for a particular curvature constant. These traits suggest that during the inflationary period, entropy might have been either negative or positive. It has also been seen that entropy saturates every curvature value at different time ranges, which indicates the heat death of the universe.</description>

      <title>Constraining viscous-fluid models in $f(Q)$ gravity using cosmic measurements and large-scale structure data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the effects of bulk viscosity on the accelerating expansion and large-scale structure formation of a universe in which the underlying gravitational interaction is described by $f(Q)$ gravity. Various toy models of the $f(Q)$ gravity theory, including power-law ($f_{1\rm{CDM}}$), exponential ($f_{2\rm{CDM}}$), and logarithmic ($f_{3\rm{CDM}}$) are considered. To test the cosmological viability of these models, we use 57 Hubble parameter data points (OHD), 1048 supernovae distance modulus (SNIa), their combined analysis (OHD+SNIa), 14 growth rate ($f$-data), and 30 redshift-space distortions ($f\sigma_8$) datasets. We compute the best-fit values $\Omega_m, H_0$ and exponents $\{n, p, \gamma\}$ including the bulk viscosity coefficient $\zeta_0$, through a detailed statistical analysis. Moreover, we study linear cosmological perturbations and compute the density contrast \(\delta(z)\), growth factor $D(z)$, growth rate $(f(z)$, and redshift-space distortion $f\sigma_8(z)$. Based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian / Schwartz Information Criterion (BIC), a statistical comparison of the $f(Q)$ gravity models with \lcdm is made. From our statistical analysis of cosmic measurements, we found an underestimation of all models on the OHD data; therefore, statistical viability led us to weigh it in favour of SNIa data which resulted in the exponential ($f_{2\rm{CDM}}$) model without bulk viscosity being the most plausible alternative model, while on average the $f_{1\rm{CDM}}$ model performed statistically the weakest. We also found that adding bulk viscosity did not improve the fit of the models to all observational data.</description>

      <title>Teleparallel Gravity and Quintessence: The Role of Nonminimal Boundary Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we have outlined the development of an autonomous dynamical system within a general scalar-tensor gravity framework. This framework encompasses the overall structure of the non-minimally coupled scalar field functions for both the torsion scalar ($T$) and the boundary term ($B$). We have examined three well-motivated forms of potential functions and constrained the model parameters through dynamical system analysis. This analysis has played a crucial role in identifying cosmologically viable models. We have analysed the behaviour of dynamical parameters such as equation-of-state parameters for dark energy and the total, as well as all the standard density parameters for radiation, matter, and dark energy to assess their compatibility with current observational data. The phase space diagrams are presented to support the stability conditions of the corresponding critical points. The Universe is apparent in its late-time cosmic acceleration phase via the dark energy-dominated critical points. Additionally, we compare our findings with the most prevailing $\Lambda$CDM model. The outcomes are further inspected using the cosmological data sets of Supernovae Ia and the Hubble rate H(z).</description>

      <title>Wave Metrics in the Cotton and Conformal Killing Gravity Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study wave metrics in the context of Cotton Gravity and Conformal Killing Gravity. First, we consider pp-wave metrics with flat and non-flat wave surfaces and show that they are exact solutions to the field equations of these theories. More explicitly, the field equations reduce to an inhomogeneous Laplace and Helmholtz differential equations, depending on the curvature of the two-dimensional geometry of the wave surfaces. An interesting point here is that the ones with non-flat wave surfaces are not present in classical GR, which manifests a crucial distinction between these theories and GR. Moreover, we investigate Kerr-Schild-Kundt metrics in the context of these theories and show that, from among these metrics, only the AdS wave metrics solve the field equations of these theories. However, AdS spherical and dS hyperbolic wave metrics do not solve the field equations of these theories, which is in contrast to the classical GR. In the case of AdS wave metrics, the field equations of these theories reduce to an inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation. We give all the necessary and sufficient conditions for the metric function $V$ to solve these field equations.</description>

      <title>The n-dimensional Weyl conformal tensor in a 4-index gravitational field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Weyl conformal tensor is the traceless component of the Riemann tensor and therefore, as is known, the information it contains does not appear explicitly in Einstein's gravitation equation. Following a rigorous mathematical treatment based on the variational principle, we'll suggest that there exists a 4-index gravitational field equation linearly containing the Weyl tensor closely related to a tidal gravitational field tensor whose components will be calculated. We'll demonstrate, among other things, that the cosmological constant appears as a natural solution of the four-index theory in the form of an integration constant which therefore does not need to be introduced ad hoc into a Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Butterfly Effect: Non-perturbative Dynamics From Small-Scale Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we investigate the non-perturbative dynamics of single field inflation with a departure from slow-roll. Using simulations, we find that oscillatory features in the potential can drastically alter the course of inflation, with major phenomenological implications. In certain cases, the entire Universe gets trapped in a forever inflating de Sitter state. In others, only some regions get stuck in a false vacuum, offering an alternative channel for primordial black hole formation. Analogous to the flap of a butterfly, these results show that small-scale phenomena can have profound consequences on the evolution of the entire Universe. This demonstrates the necessity of a non-perturbative approach in the exploration of the small-scale physics of inflation, particularly in the regime relevant for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Accretion mediated spin-eccentricity correlations in LISA massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine expected effective spin ($\chi_{{\rm eff},1\rm yr}$) and orbital eccentricity ($e_{1\rm yr}$) correlations for a population of observable equal-mass massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with total redshifted mass $M_z\sim[10^{4.5},10^{7.5}]~{\rm M}_\odot$ embedded in a circumbinary disc (CBD), one-year before merging in the LISA band. We find a strong correlation between measurable eccentricity and negative effective spin for MBHBs that are carried to merger by retrograde accretion. This is due to the well-established eccentricity pumping of retrograde accretion and the formation of retrograde CBD-aligned mini-discs, as observed in hydrodynamical simulations. Conversely, prograde accretion channels result in positive $\chi_{{\rm eff},1\rm yr}$ and non-measurable $e_{1\rm yr}$. This clear contrast between the two CBD orientations - and particularly the unique signature of retrograde configurations - provides a promising way to unlock the mysteries of MBHB formation channels in the LISA era.</description>

      <title>A neural network-based gravitational wave interpolant with applications to low-latency analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matched-filter based gravitational-wave search pipelines identify candidate events within seconds of their arrival on Earth, offering a chance to guide electromagnetic follow-up and observe multi-messenger events. Understanding the detectors' response to an astrophysical transient across the searched signal manifold is paramount to inferring the parameters of the progenitor and deciding which candidates warrant telescope time. We describe a framework that uses artificial neural networks to interpolate gravitational waves and, equivalently, the signal-to noise ratio (SNR) across sufficiently local patches of the signal manifold. Our machine-learning based model generates a single waveform in 6 milliseconds on a CPU and 0.4 milliseconds on a GPU. When using a GPU to generate batches of waveforms simultaneously, we find that we can produce $10^4$ waveforms in $\lesssim 1$ ms. This is achieved while remaining faithful, on average, to 1 part in $10^4$ (1 part in $10^5$) for binary black hole (binary neutron star) waveforms. The model we present is designed to directly utilize intermediate detection pipeline outputs in the hopes of facilitating a better real-time understanding of gravitational-wave candidates.</description>

      <title>Quantum Complexity of $T\bar{T}$-deformation and Its Implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ holography to calculate the quantum complexity of $T\bar{T}$-deformation, utilizing the complexity equals volume (CV) and the complexity equals action (CA) proposals within the bulk spacetime with a finite radius cutoff. We find that the complexity of the deformed theory differs from the renormalized complexity of the original theory by a geometric functional: the bending (Willmore) energy of the time-constant slice of the base manifold. We use this result to propose an unambiguous scheme for calculating holographic quantum complexity through the CA proposal.</description>

      <title>Remote Hawking-Moss instanton and the Lorentzian path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hawking-Moss (HM) bounce solution implies that the tunneling amplitude between vacua is uniquely determined by the vacuum energy at the initial vacuum and the top of a potential barrier, regardless of the field distance between them $\Delta \phi$. This implausible conclusion was carefully discussed in [E. J. Weinberg, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 251303, (2007)], and it was concluded that the conventional HM amplitude is not reliable for a transition to the top of distant local maxima (hereinafter referred to as the remote HM transition). We revisit this issue and study the impact of the quantum tunneling effect on the remote HM transition. We demonstrate that the amplitude for such a distant transition is indeed smaller than the conventional HM amplitude by employing the Lorentzian path integral in a simple setup. We consider a linear potential, which allows for analytic treatments, and evaluate the up-tunneling probability of a homogeneous scalar field in de Sitter spacetime. The Picard-Lefschetz theory is employed to identify the relevant Lefschetz thimble, representing the relevant tunneling trajectory. We then compare the resulting transition amplitude with the conventional HM amplitude. We find that when the field separation $|\Delta \phi|$ is larger, the quantum-tunneling amplitude, estimated by our Lorentzian path integral, is smaller than that of the conventional HM amplitude. This implies that the transition amplitude may be significantly suppressed if the thermal interpretation is not applicable and the quantum-tunneling effect is dominant for the remote HM transition.</description>
