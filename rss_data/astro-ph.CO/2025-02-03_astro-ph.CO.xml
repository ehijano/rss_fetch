      <title>It's not $\sigma_8$ : constraining the non-linear matter power spectrum with the Dark Energy Survey Year-5 supernova sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak gravitational lensing magnification of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is sensitive to the matter power spectrum on scales $k&gt;1 h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, making it unwise to interpret SNe Ia lensing in terms of power on linear scales. We compute the probability density function of SNe Ia magnification as a function of standard cosmological parameters, plus an empirical parameter $A_{\rm mod}$ which describes the suppression or enhancement of matter power on non-linear scales compared to a cold dark matter only model. While baryons are expected to enhance power on the scales relevant to SN Ia lensing, other physics such as neutrino masses or non-standard dark matter may suppress power. Using the Dark Energy Survey Year-5 sample, we find $A_{\rm mod} = 0.77^{+0.69}_{-0.40}$ (68\% credible interval around the median). Although the median is consistent with unity there are hints of power suppression, with $A_{\rm mod} &lt; 1.09$ at 68\% credibility.</description>

      <title>Temperature-redshift relation in energy-momentum-powered gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been recent interest in the cosmological consequences of energy-momentum-powered gravity models, in which the matter side of Einstein's equations includes a term proportional to some power, $n$, of the energy-momentum tensor, in addition to the canonical linear term. Previous works have suggested that these models can lead to a recent accelerating universe without a cosmological constant, but they can also be seen as phenomenological extensions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM, which are observationally constrained to be close to the $\Lambda$CDM limit. Here we show that these models violate the temperature-redshift relation, and are therefore further constrained by astrophysical measurements of the cosmic microwave background temperature. We provide joint constraints on these models from the combination of astrophysical and background cosmological data, showing that this power is constrained to be about $|n|&lt;0.01$ and $|n|&lt;0.1$, respectively in models without and with a cosmological constant, and improving previous constraints on this parameter by more than a factor of three. By breaking degeneracies between this parameter and the matter density, constraints on the latter are also improved by a factor of about two.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the largest structures in the nearby Universe: Discovery of the Quipu superstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a precise determination of cosmological parameters we need to understand the effects of the local large-scale structure of the Universe on the measurements. They include modifications of the cosmic microwave background, distortions of sky images by large-scale gravitational lensing, and the influence of large-scale streaming motions on measurements of the Hubble constant. The streaming motions, for example, originate from mass concentrations with distances up to 250 Mpc. In this paper we provide the first all-sky assessment of the largest structures at distances between 130 and 250 Mpc and discuss their observational consequences, using X-ray galaxy clusters to map the matter density distribution. Among the five most prominent superstructures found, the largest has a length longer than 400 Mpc with an estimated mass of about 2 10e17 Msun. This entity, which we named Quipu, is the largest cosmic structure discovered to date. These superstructures contain about 45% of the galaxy clusters, 30% of the galaxies, 25% of the matter, and occupy a volume fraction of 13%, thus constituting a major part of the Universe. The galaxy density is enhanced in the environment of superstructures out to larger distances from the nearest member clusters compared to the outskirts of clusters in the field. We find superstructures with similar properties in simulations based on Lambda-CDM cosmology models. We show that the superstructures should produce a modification on the cosmic microwave background through the integrated Sachs-Wolf effect. Searching for this effect in the Planck data we found a signal of the expected strength, however, with low significance. Characterising these superstructures is also important for astrophysical research, for example the study of the environmental dependence of galaxy evolution as well as for precision tests of cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Modeling submillimeter galaxies in cosmological simulations: Contribution to the cosmic star formation density and predictions for future surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) constitute a key population of bright star-forming galaxies at high redshift. These galaxies challenge galaxy formation models, particularly in reproducing their observed number counts and redshift distributions. Furthermore, although SMGs contribute significantly to the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD), their precise role remains uncertain. Upcoming surveys, such as the Ultra Deep Survey with the TolTEC camera, are expected to offer valuable insights into SMG properties and their broader impact. Robust modeling of SMGs in a cosmologically representative volume is necessary to investigate their nature in preparation for next-generation submillimeter surveys. We implement and test parametric relations derived from radiative transfer calculations across three cosmological simulations: EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and FLAMINGO. Particular emphasis is placed on the FLAMINGO due to their large volume and robust statistical sampling of SMGs. Based on the model that best reproduces observations, we forecast submillimeter fluxes within the simulations, analyze the properties of SMGs, and evaluate their evolution over cosmic time. Our results show that the FLAMINGO reproduces the observed redshift distribution and source number counts of SMGs without requiring a top-heavy initial mass function. On the other hand, the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG show a deficit of bright SMGs. We find that SMGs with S850 &gt; 1 mJy contribute up to 27% of the SFRD at z=2.6 in the FLAMINGO, consistent with recent observations. Flux density functions reveal a rise in SMG abundance from z = 6 to 2.5, followed by a sharp decline in the number of brighter SMGs from z = 2.5 to 0. Leveraging the SMG population in FLAMINGO, we forecast that the TolTEC UDS will detect 80,000 sources over 0.8 deg^2 at 1.1 mm (at the 4{\sigma} detection limit), capturing about 50% of the cosmic SFRD at z=2.5.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays Masquerading as Hot CGM Gas: An Inverse-Compton Origin for Diffuse X-ray Emission in the Circumgalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations have argued that Milky Way (MW), Andromeda, and lower-mass galaxies exhibit extended soft X-ray diffuse halos to radii $R\gtrsim100\,$kpc in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). If interpreted as thermal emission, the shallow surface brightness profiles $S_{X}\propto R^{-1}$ are difficult to explain and contradict other observations. We show that such halos instead arise from inverse Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons with GeV cosmic ray (CR) electrons. GeV electrons have ~Gyr lifetimes and escape the galaxy, forming a shallow extended profile out to $\gtrsim100\,$kpc, where IC off the CMB should produce soft, thermal-like X-ray spectra peaked at ~keV. The observed keV halo luminosities and brightness profiles agree well with those expected for CRs observed in the local interstellar medium (LISM) escaping the galaxy, with energetics consistent with known CRs from SNe and/or AGN, around galaxies with stellar masses $M_{\ast}\lesssim2\times 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$. At higher masses observed X-ray luminosities are larger than predicted from IC and should be dominated by hot gas. In the MW+M31, the same models of escaping CRs reproduce gamma-ray observations if we assume an LISM-like proton-to-electron ratio and CR-pressure-dominated halo. In all other halos, the radio and $\gamma$-ray brightness is below detectable limits. If true, the observations provide qualitatively new constraints on CGM and CR physics: X-ray brightness directly traces the CR lepton energy density in the CGM. This agrees with LISM values within 10 kpc, which following the profile expected for escaping CRs in the CGM. The inferred CR pressure is a major part of the MW CGM pressure budget. X-ray surface brightness and luminosity allows one to further determine the CGM diffusivity at radii $\sim10-1000\,$kpc. These also agree with LISM values at small radii but increase in the CGM.</description>

      <title>The evolution of cosmic ray electrons in the cosmic web: seeding by AGN, star formation and shocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several processes in the Universe convert a fraction of gas kinetic energy into the acceleration of relativistic electrons, making them observable at radio wavelengths, or contributing to a dormant reservoir of low-energy cosmic rays in cosmic structures. We present a new suite of cosmological simulations, with simple galaxy formation models calibrated to work at a specific spatial resolution, tailored to study all most important processes of injection of relativistic electrons in evolving large-sale structures: accretion and merger shocks, feedback from active galactic nuclei and winds from star forming regions. We also follow the injection of magnetic fields by active galactic nuclei and star formation, and compute the observational signatures of these mechanisms. We find that the injection of cosmic ray electrons by shocks is the most volume filling process, and that it also dominates the energy density of fossil relativistic electrons in halos. The combination of the seeding mechanisms studied in this work, regardless of the uncertainties related to physical or numerical uncertainties, is more than enough to fuel large-scale radio emissions with a large amount of seed fossil electrons. We derive an approximated formula to predict the number of fossil cosmic ray electrons injected by z=0 by the total activity of shocks, AGN and star formation in the volume of halos. By looking at the maximum possible contribution to the magnetisation of the cosmic web by all our simulated sources, we conclude that galaxy formation-related processes, alone, cannot explain the values of Faraday Rotation of background polarised sources recently detected using LOFAR.</description>

      <title>Clusternets: A deep learning approach to probe clustering dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are becoming popular in cosmology for extracting valuable information from cosmological data. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on matter density snapshots to distinguish clustering Dark Energy (DE) from the cosmological constant scenario and to detect the speed of sound ($c_s$) associated with clustering DE. We compare the CNN results with those from a Random Forest (RF) algorithm trained on power spectra. Varying the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_{\rm{DE}}$ within the range of -0.7 to -0.99, while keeping $c_s^2 = 1$, we find that the CNN approach results in a significant improvement in accuracy over the RF algorithm. The improvement in classification accuracy can be as high as $40\%$ depending on the physical scales involved. We also investigate the ML algorithms' ability to detect the impact of the speed of sound by choosing $c_s^2$ from the set $\{1, 10^{-2}, 10^{-4}, 10^{-7}\}$ while maintaining a constant $w_{\rm DE}$ for three different cases: $w_{\rm DE} \in \{-0.7, -0.8, -0.9\}$. Our results suggest that distinguishing between various values of $c_s^2$ and the case where $c_s^2=1$ is challenging, particularly at small scales and when $w_{\rm{DE}}\approx -1$. However, as we consider larger scales, the accuracy of $c_s^2$ detection improves. Notably, the CNN algorithm consistently outperforms the RF algorithm, leading to an approximate $20\%$ enhancement in $c_s^2$ detection accuracy in some cases.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from dark domain walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For most of cosmic history, the evolution of our Universe has been governed by the physics of a 'dark sector', consisting of dark matter and dark energy, whose properties are only understood in a schematic way. The influence of these constituents is mediated exclusively by the force of gravity, meaning that insight into their nature must be gleaned from gravitational phenomena. The advent of gravitational-wave astronomy has revolutionised the field of black hole astrophysics, and opens a new window of discovery for cosmological sources. Relevant examples include topological defects, such as domain walls or cosmic strings, which are remnants of a phase transition. Here we present the first simulations of cosmic structure formation in which the dynamics of the dark sector introduces domain walls as a source of stochastic gravitational waves in the late Universe. We study in detail how the spectrum of gravitational waves is affected by the properties of the model, and extrapolate the results to scales relevant to the recent evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background. Our relativistic implementation of the field dynamics paves the way for optimal use of the next generation of gravitational experiments to unravel the dark sector.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel approach using neural networks (NNs) to differentiate between cosmological models, and implemented LIME as an interpretability approach to identify the key features influencing our model's decisions. We show the potential of NNs to enhance the extraction of meaningful information from cosmological large-scale structure data, based on current galaxy-clustering survey specifications, for the cosmological constant and cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model. We find that the NN can successfully distinguish between $\Lambda$CDM and the $f(R)$ models, by predicting the correct model with approximately $97\%$ overall accuracy, thus demonstrating that NNs can maximize the potential of current and next generation surveys to probe for deviations from general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel approach to the class of cosmic barotropic fluids in which the speed of sound squared is defined as a function of the Equation of State parameter, so called $c_s^2(w)$ models, is examined. For this class of models, a new analytical reconstruction method is introduced for finding their equivalent purely kinetic k-essence formulation. The method is explicitly demonstrated for several $c_s^2(w)$ models. A distinguished feature of the studied models is a peak in $c_s^2$ during cosmic expansion. A possible role that such model features could play in understanding of so far unexplained aspects of cosmic evolution is discussed. The application of the obtained explicit or closed form solutions in understanding dark sector unification models is outlined.</description>

      <title>Investigating Late-Time Dark Energy and Massive Neutrinos in Light of DESI Y1 BAO</title>

Abstract: Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), in combination with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and Type Ia Supernovae (SN) luminosity distances, suggests a dynamical evolution of the dark energy equation of state with a phantom phase ($w &lt; -1$) in the past when the so-called $w_0w_a$ parametrization $w(a) = w_0 + w_a(1-a)$ is assumed. In this work, we investigate more general dark energy models that also allow a phantom equation of state. We consider three cases: an equation of state with a transition feature, a model-agnostic equation of state with constant values in chosen redshift bins, and a k-essence model. Since the dark energy equation of state is correlated with neutrino masses, we reassess constraints on the neutrino mass sum focusing on the model-agnostic equation of state. We find that the combination of DESI BAO with Planck 2018 CMB data and SN data from Pantheon, Pantheon+, or Union3 is consistent with an oscillatory dark energy equation of state, while a monotonic behavior is preferred by the DESY5 SN data. Performing model comparison techniques, we find that the $w_0w_a$ parametrization remains the simplest dark energy model that can provide a better fit to DESI BAO, CMB, and all SN datasets than $\Lambda$CDM. Constraints on the neutrino mass sum assuming dynamical dark energy are relaxed compared to $\Lambda$CDM and we show that these constraints are tighter in the model-agnostic case relative to $w_0w_a$ model by $70\%-90\%$.</description>

Abstract: The reheating temperature plays a crucial role in the early universe's evolution, marking the transition from inflation to the radiation-dominated era. It directly impacts the number of $e$-folds and, consequently, the observable parameters of inflation, such as the spectral index of scalar perturbations. By establishing a relationship between the gravitational reheating temperature and the spectral index, we can derive constraints on inflationary models. Specifically, the range of viable reheating temperatures imposes bounds on the spectral index, which can then be compared with observational data, such as those from the Planck satellite, to test the consistency of various models with cosmological observations. Additionally, in the context of dark matter production, we demonstrate that gravitational reheating provides a viable mechanism when there is a relationship between the mass of the dark matter particles and the mass of the particles responsible for reheating. This connection offers a pathway to link dark matter genesis with inflationary and reheating parameters, allowing for a unified perspective on early universe dynamics.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Imaging Systematics for DESI 2024 Emission Line Galaxies and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) are one of the main tracers that the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) uses to probe the universe. However, they are afflicted by strong spurious correlations between target density and observing conditions known as imaging systematics. We present the imaging systematics mitigation applied to the DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) large-scale structure catalogs used in the DESI 2024 cosmological analyses. We also explore extensions of the fiducial treatment. This includes a combined approach, through forward image simulations in conjunction with neural network-based regression, to obtain an angular selection function that mitigates the imaging systematics observed in the DESI DR1 ELGs target density. We further derive a line-of-sight selection function from the forward model that removes the strong redshift dependence between imaging systematics and low redshift ELGs. Combining both angular and redshift-dependent systematics, we construct a 3D selection function and assess the impact of all selection functions on clustering statistics. We quantify differences between these extended treatments and the fiducial treatment in terms of the measured 2-point statistics. We find that the results are generally consistent with the fiducial treatment and conclude that the differences are far less than the imaging systematics uncertainty included in DESI 2024 full-shape measurements. We extend our investigation to the ELGs at $0.6&lt;z&lt;0.8$, i.e., beyond the redshift range ($0.8&lt;z&lt;1.6$) adopted for the DESI clustering catalog, and demonstrate that determining the full 3D selection function is necessary in this redshift range. Our tests showed that all changes are consistent with statistical noise for BAO analyses indicating they are robust to even severe imaging systematics. Specific tests for the full-shape analysis will be presented in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Refining local-type primordial non-Gaussianity: Sharpened $b_\phi$ constraints through bias expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local-type primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), predicted by many non-minimal models of inflation, creates a scale-dependent contribution to the power spectrum of large-scale structure (LSS) tracers. Its amplitude is characterized by the product $b_\phi f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, where $b_\phi$ is an astrophysical parameter dependent on the properties of the tracer. However, $b_\phi$ exhibits significant secondary dependence on halo concentration and other astrophysical properties, which may bias and weaken the constraints on $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$. In this work, we demonstrate that incorporating knowledge of the relation between Lagrangian bias parameters and $b_\phi$ can significantly enhance PNG constraints. We employ the Hybrid Effective Field Theory (HEFT) approach at the field-level and a linear regression model to seek a connection between the bias parameters and $b_{\phi}$ for halo and galaxy samples, constructed using the \textsc{AbacusSummit} simulation suite and mimicking the luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. For the fixed-mass halo samples, our full bias model reduces the uncertainty by more than 70\%, with most of that improvement coming from $b_\nabla$, which we find to be an excellent proxy for concentration. For the galaxy samples, our model reduces the uncertainty on $b_\phi$ by 80\% for all tracers. By adopting Lagrangian-bias informed priors on the parameter $b_\phi$, future analyses can thus constrain $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ with less bias and smaller errors.</description>

      <title>Remarks on overestimating the effects of inhomogeneities on the Hubble constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02288v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble constant is one of the most important parameters in cosmology. Discrepancies in values of the Hubble constant estimated from various measurements, the so-called Hubble tension, are a serious problem. In this paper, we study the effects of small-scale inhomogeneities of structure formation on the measurement of the Hubble constant using the luminosity distance-redshift relation. By adopting the adhesion model in Newtonian cosmology as the model of structure formation, we investigate whether or not the effects of inhomogeneities can be sufficiently large to affect the current observations of the Hubble constant. We show that inappropriate treatment of the effects of inhomogeneities can cause a large deviation of the measured value of the Hubble constant from the background value, whose magnitude is comparable with the Hubble tension. Our main message is the importance of adopting an appropriate model of structure formation to investigate the effects of inhomogeneities. We also add discussion on the spatial averaging approach used to estimate the measured Hubble constant in the inhomogeneous universe.</description>

      <title>A general method to reconstruct strong gravitational lenses based on the singular perturbative approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of gravitational arcs systems detected is increasing quickly and should even increase at a faster rate in the near future. This wealth of new gravitational arcs requires the development of a purely automated method to reconstruct the lens and source. A general reconstruction method based on the singular perturbative approach is proposed in this paper. This method generates a lens and source reconstruction directly from the gravitational arc image. The method is fully automated and works in two steps. The first step is to generate a guess solution based on the circular solution in the singular perturbative approach. The second step is to break the sign degeneracy and to refine the solution by using a general source model. The refinement of the solution is conducted step by step to avoid the source-lens degeneracy issue. One important asset of this automated method is that the lens solution is written in universal terms which allows the computation of statistics. Considering the large number of lenses which should be available in the near future this ability to compute un-biased statistics is an important asset.</description>

      <title>On the overlap reduction function of pulsar timing array searches for gravitational waves in modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) searches for gravitational waves (GWs) aim to detect a characteristic correlation pattern in the timing residuals of galactic millisecond pulsars. This pattern is described by the PTA overlap reduction function (ORF) \Gamma_ab(\xi_ab), which is known as the Hellings--Downs (HD) curve in general relativity (GR). In theories of modified gravity, the HD curve often receives corrections. Assuming, e.g., a subluminal GW phase velocity, one finds a drastically enhanced ORF in the limit of small angular separations between pulsar a and pulsar b in the sky, \xi_ab --&gt; 0. In particular, working in harmonic space and performing an approximate resummation of all multipole contributions, the auto correlation coefficient \Gamma_aa seems to diverge. In this paper, we confirm that this divergence is unphysical and provide an exact and analytical expression for \Gamma_aa in dependence of the pulsar distance L_a and the GW phase velocity v_ph. In the GR limit and assuming a large pulsar distance, our expression reduces to \Gamma_aa = 1. In the case of subluminal phase velocity, we show that the regularization of the naive divergent result is a finite-distance effect, meaning that \Gamma_aa scales linearly with fL_a, where f is the GW frequency. For superluminal phase velocity (subluminal group velocity), which is relevant in the case of massive gravity, we correct an earlier analytical result for \Gamma_ab. Our results pave the way for fitting modified-gravity theories with nonstandard phase velocity to PTA data, which requires a proper understanding of the auto correlation coefficient \Gamma_aa.</description>

      <title>Islands in Bianchi type-I Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the conditions for finding an island in an anisotropic universe - Bianchi Type-I filled with radiation. We verify that the existence of islands does not depend on their shape. We then find that islands may form at certain times, near the turnaround point - where the universe turns from contraction to expansion in one of the directions. This is in line with previous analyses regarding cosmological space-times where islands form if one has two energy scales in the problem, such as the typical temperature of the universe and, on top of that, cosmological constant, curvature, anisotropy, or some mass scale.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave propagation beyond General Relativity: geometric optic expansion and lens-induced dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of gravity can be tested by how gravitational waves (GWs) are emitted, detected, and propagate through the universe. Propagation tests are powerful, as small deviations compound over cosmological distances. However, GW propagation tests of theories beyond Einstein's general relativity (GR) are limited by the high degree of symmetry of the average cosmological spacetime. Deviations from homogeneity, i.e. gravitational lenses, allow for new interactions, e.g., between standard GW polarization and new scalar or vector fields, with different spin. Therefore, GW lensing beyond GR offers novel tests of cosmological gravity. Here we present the theory of GW propagation beyond GR in the short-wave expansion, including corrections to the leading-order amplitude and phase for the first time. As an example, we compute the dispersive (frequency-dependent) corrections to all metric and scalar field perturbations in Brans-Dicke, the simplest modified theory exhibiting GW dispersion. GW lensing effects are too small to observe in Brans-Dicke theories compatible with solar system and binary pulsar limits. Nevertheless, our formalism opens the possibility of novel tests of gravity, including dark-energy theories and screening mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Potential of RES-NOVA as Dark Matter observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The RES-NOVA project is an experimental initiative aimed at detecting neutrinos from the next galactic supernova using PbWO$_{4}$ cryogenic detectors, operated at low temperatures in a low-background environment. By utilizing archaeological lead (Pb) as the target material, RES-NOVA leverages its high radiopurity, large nuclear mass, and the natural abundance of $^{207}$Pb, making it well-suited for exploring both spin-independent and spin-dependent Dark Matter (DM) interactions via nuclear scattering. This work presents a background model developed for the RES-NOVA technology demonstrator and evaluates its implications for Dark Matter detection. Detailed calculations of nuclear matrix elements, combined with the unique properties of archaeological Pb, demonstrate RES-NOVA's potential as a complementary tool to existing direct detection experiments for studying Dark Matter interactions. The experiment will conduct DM searches over a broad mass range spanning 4 orders of magnitude, from sub-GeV/$c^2$ to TeV/$c^2$. In the most optimistic scenario, RES-NOVA is expected to probe DM-nucleon cross-sections down to 1$\times 10^{-43}$ cm$^2$ and 2$\times 10^{-46}$ cm$^2$ for candidates with masses of 2 GeV/$c^2$ and 20 GeV/$c^2$, respectively.</description>
