      <title>Time-delayed gamma-ray signatures of heavy axions from core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy axions that couple to both quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics with masses on the order of MeV - GeV and high-scale decay constants in excess of $\sim$$10^8$ GeV may arise generically in e.g. axiverse constructions. In this work we provide the most sensitive search to-date for the existence of such heavy axions using Fermi-LAT data towards four recent supernovae (SN): Cas A, SN1987A, SN2023ixf, and SN2024ggi. We account for heavy axion production in the proto-neutron-star cores through nuclear and electromagnetic processes and then the subsequent decay of the axions into photons. While previous works have searched for gamma-rays from SN1987A using the Solar Maximum Mission that observed SN1987A during the SN itself, we show that using Fermi Large Area Telescope data provides an approximately five orders of magnitude improvement in flux sensitivity for axions with lifetimes larger than around 10 years. We find no evidence for heavy axions and exclude large regions of previously-unexplored parameter space.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group equations of the LEFT at two loops: dimension-five effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first part of a systematic calculation of the two-loop anomalous dimensions in the low-energy effective field theory (LEFT): the effects at dimension five in the power counting. Our calculation is performed in a basis with generic mass matrices, we employ the algebraically consistent 't Hooft-Veltman scheme for $\gamma_5$, and we correct for evanescent as well as chiral-symmetry-breaking effects by including the appropriate finite counterterms. We also provide results for the $CP$-even sector in a scheme that coincides with naive dimensional regularization. We discuss two methods to avoid the explicit construction of gauge-variant operators, which in principle are needed for the cancellation of sub-divergences, even in the background-field method. The two methods are consistent with each other and with existing partial results. Our work is a further step towards a complete EFT framework for physics beyond the Standard Model at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy.</description>

      <title>Asymmetries from a charged memory-burdened PBH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a purely gravitational origin of observed baryon asymmetry and dark matter (DM) abundance from asymmetric Hawking radiation of light primordial black holes (PBH) in presence of a non-zero chemical potential, originating from the space-time curvature. Considering the PBHs are described by a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m metric, and are produced in a radiation dominated Universe, we show, it is possible to simultaneously explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry along with right DM abundance satisfying bounds from big bang nucleosynthesis, cosmic microwave background and gravitational wave energy density due to PBH density fluctuation. We also obtain the parameter space beyond the semiclassical approximation, taking into account the quantum effects on charged PBH dynamics due to memory burden.</description>

      <title>Bridging massive and massless schemes for soft gluon resummation in heavy-flavour production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbative calculations for processes involving heavy flavours can be carried out using two approaches: the massive and the massless schemes. These schemes can also be combined to leverage their respective strengths. Additionally, both massive and massless frameworks can be supplemented by soft-gluon resummation. However, matching resummed calculations across the two schemes presents significant challenges, primarily due to the non-commutativity of the soft and small mass limits. The consistent resummation of mass and soft logarithms has been recently achieved at next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy. In this paper, we extend this framework to achieve the so-called NLL$^\prime$ accuracy, which accounts for finite terms in the soft limit.</description>

      <title>HQET sum rules for matrix elements of dimension-six four-quark operators for meson lifetimes within and beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theory predictions of heavy-hadron lifetime ratios critically depend on precise determinations of the dimension-six spectator effects arising from the double insertion of the weak effective $|\Delta B| = 1$ Hamiltonian. In the presence of beyond-standard-model (BSM) operators, the resulting $\Delta B = 0$ Hamiltonian features additional four-quark operators whose matrix elements need to be determined using non-perturbative methods. We present for the first time results for the non-perturbative hadronic matrix elements of the four-quark operators relevant for the description of the meson lifetime ratio $\tau\left(B^+\right) / \tau\left(B_d\right)$, obtained using heavy-quark effective theory (HQET) sum rules with the full BSM effective Hamiltonian. In addition, we recompute and update the bag parameters for the Standard Model operators.</description>

      <title>On T-Invariance Violation in Neutrino Oscillations and Matter Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of matter effects on T (time-reversal)-odd observables, making use of the quantum-mechanical formalism of neutrino-flavor evolution. We attempt to be comprehensive and pedagogical. Matter-induced T-invariance violation (TV) is qualitatively different from, and more subtle than, matter-induced CP (charge-parity)-invariance violation. If the matter distribution is symmetric relative to the neutrino production and detection points, matter effects will not introduce any new TV. However, if there is intrinsic TV, matter effects can modify the size of the T-odd observable. On the other hand, if the matter distribution is not symmetric, there is genuine matter-induced TV. For Earth-bound long-baseline oscillation experiments, these effects are small. This remains true for unrealistically-asymmetric matter potentials (for example, we investigate the effects of ''hollowing out'' 50% of the DUNE neutrino trajectory). More broadly, we explore consequences, or lack thereof, of asymmetric matter potentials on oscillation probabilities. While fascinating in their own right, T-odd observables are currently of limited practical use, due in no small part to a dearth of intense, well-characterized, high-energy electron-neutrino beams. Further in the future, however, intense, high-energy muon storage rings might become available and allow for realistic studies of T invariance in neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Gravitational Portals and Freeze-in during Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic investigation of freeze-in during reheating while taking care to include both direct and indirect production of dark matter (DM) via gravitational portals and inflaton decay. Direct production of DM can occur via gravitational scattering of the inflaton, while indirect production occurs through scattering in the Standard Model radiation bath. We consider two main contributions to the radiation bath during reheating. The first, which may dominate at the onset of the reheating process, is produced via gravitational scattering of the inflaton. The second (and more standard contribution) comes from inflaton decay. We consider a broad class of DM production rates parameterized as $R_{\chi} \propto T^{n+6}/\Lambda^{n+2}$, and inflaton potentials with a power-law form $V(\phi) \propto \phi^{k}$ about the minimum. We find the relic density produced by freeze-in for each contribution to the Standard Model bath for arbitrary $k$ and $n$, and compare these with the DM density produced gravitationally by inflaton scattering. We find that freeze-in production from the gravitationally-produced radiation bath can exceed that of the conventional decay bath and account for the observed relic density provided that $m_{\chi} &gt; T_{\rm RH}$, with additional $k$- and $n$-dependent constraints. For each freeze-in interaction considered, we also find $m_{\chi}$- and $T_{\rm RH}$-dependent limits on the BSM scale, $\Lambda$, for which gravitational production will exceed ordinary freeze-in production.</description>

      <title>New Physics at the Muon (Synchrotron) Ion Collider: MuSIC for several scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Muon (Synchrotron) Ion Collider (MuSIC) can be the successor to the Electron-Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory, as well as the ideal demonstrator facility for a future multi-TeV Muon Collider. Besides its rich nuclear physics and Standard Model particle physics programs, in this work we show that the MuSIC with a TeV-scale muon beam offers also a unique opportunity to probe New Physics. In particular, the relevant searches have the potential to surpass current experimental limits and explore new regimes of the parameter space for a variety of Beyond the Standard Model scenarios including: lepton-flavor violating leptoquarks, muonphilic vector boson interactions, axion-like particles coupling to photons, and heavy sterile neutrinos. Depending on the particular case, the sensitivity of the searches in the MuSIC may span a wide range of energy scales, namely from sub-GeV particles to the few TeV New Physics mediators. Our analysis demonstrates that the MuSIC can strike a powerful chord in the search for New Physics, thanks to unique combination of features that amplify its capabilities.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Escaping Direct Detection Runs into Higgs Mass Hierarchy Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current generation of Dark Matter Direct Detection Experiments has ruled out a large region of parameter space for dark matter, particularly in the ($10 - 1000$) GeV mass range. However, due to very low event rates, searching for dark matter in the heavy mass range, $\mathcal{O}$(TeV), is a daunting task requiring even larger volume detectors and long exposure times. We show that for a broad class of dark matter models of the type that these experiments are searching, including some of the most popular candidates, the heavy dark matter mass range can be ruled out in its entirety once we take into account the large corrections to Higgs mass imparted by such heavy dark matter. We show that such a limit is applicable to all types of dark matter i.e. scalar, vector, and fermionic, provided they couple directly with Higgs. By taking some simple and well studied dark matter models we show that the latest LZ limits can completely rule out such a dark matter except in a narrow range around $M_h/2$ mass.</description>

      <title>Unpolarized valence GPDs and form factors of pion in the modified chiral quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the valence generalized parton distribution functions (GPDs) of pion at zero skewness applying a theoretical approach in which the valence GPDs are related to valence quark distribution functions, directly. To this end, we use the results of modified chiral quark model ($\chi QM$) for the valence quark distributions of pion obtained in our previous work. We also determine the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors of pion and compare the results of our theoretical model for valence GPDs and form factors of pion with the results of some other models and available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Neutrino nucleus Quasi-Elastic and resonant Neutral Current scatterings with Non-Standard Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As well known, the cross sections of the resonance and Quasi-Elastic (QE) scattering off nucleons depend on quantities known as form factors that describe the nucleon structure. There are alternative approaches to determine the values of these non-perturbative quantities, some of them relying on the Neutral Current (NC) scattering of neutrinos off nucleons. In the presence of NC Non-Standard Interactions (NSI), such derivations must be revisited. The aim of the present paper is to discuss how information on NSI can be extracted by combining alternative approaches for deriving the form factors. We discuss how the KamLAND atmospheric neutrino data with $E_\nu&lt;{\rm GeV}$ (used to determine the axial strange form factor $g_A^s$) can already constrain the axial NSI of $\nu_\tau$ with nucleons. We also argue that if the precision measurement of $\nu_\mu$ NC QE scattering establishes unexpectedly large vector strange form factor (e.g., $F_1^s(Q^2)\sim 0.01$), it will be an indication for nonzero NSI coupling with $u$ and $d$ quarks ($\epsilon_{\mu\mu}^{Au/d}\sim 0.01$). We study the QE and resonance scattering cross sections of $\nu_\tau$ and $\nu_e$ off Argon and show that if their axial NSI is of the order of (but of course below) the present bounds, the deviation of QE cross sections from the SM prediction will be sizable and distinct from the uncertainties induced by the form factors.</description>

      <title>Kernel methods for evolution of generalized parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) characterize the 3-dimensional structure of hadrons, combining information about their internal quark and gluon longitudinal momentum distributions and transverse position within the hadron. The dependence of GPDs on the factorization scale $Q^2$ allows one to connect hard exclusive processes involving GPDs at disparate energy and momentum scales, which is needed in global analyses of experimental data. In this work we explore how finite element methods can be used to construct fast and differentiable $Q^2$ evolution codes for GPDs in momentum space, which can be used in a machine learning framework. We show numerical benchmarks of the methods' accuracy, including a comparison to an existing evolution code from PARTONS/APFEL++, and provide a repository where the code can be accessed.</description>

      <title>Decoding spin-parity quantum numbers and decay widths of double $J/\psi$ exotic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive helicity amplitudes for the fully charmed tetraquark states decays into vector meson pair under two types of models, where the one is from quark model and the other one is from heavy quark effective theory. The angular distributions have been given by the cascade decays $T_{4c}\to J/\psi(D_{(s)}^*)+J/\psi(\bar{D}_{(s)}^*)$ along with $J/\psi\to \mu^++\mu^-$ or $D_{(s)}^*\to D_{(s)}+\pi$, showing that spin-0 and spin-2 states can be distinguished. If we assume quantum entanglement as a fundamental principle, there is a strict constraint formula for helicity amplitudes. These findings will assist in experimentally differentiating various spin-parity states, determining decay widths and hunting for unobserved structures, thereby shedding light on the internal properties of double $J/\psi$ exotic states.</description>

      <title>A simple way to reduce the number of contours in the multi-fold Mellin-Barnes integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mellin-Barnes integral representation of one-loop off-shell box massless diagram is five-fold by construction. On the other hand, it is known from the year 1992 that it may be reduced to certain two-fold MB integral. We propose a way to reduce the number of the MB integration contours from five to two by using the MB integral representation only in combination with basic methods of mathematical analysis such as analytical regularization. We do not use any Barnes lemma to prove the reduction but we use the integral Cauchy formula instead. We recover first the well-known two-fold MB representation for the one-loop triangle massless diagram and then show how the five-fold MB integral representation of one-loop box diagram with all the indices 1 in four spacetime dimensions may be reduced to the two-fold MB representation for one-loop triangle diagram. Singular integrals over Feynman parameters appear in the integrand of the five-fold MB integral representation at the intermediate step. Such integrals should be treated as distributions with respect to certain linear combinations of the initial MB integration variables in the MB integrands. These distributions may be integrated out with a finite number of residues in the limit of removing the analytical regularization. We explain how to apply this strategy to an arbitrary Feynman diagram in order to reduce the number of MB integration contours.</description>

      <title>The Baryon-Baryon Interaction in the Large-$N_c$ Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13677</link>

Abstract: We analyze the large-$N_c$ structure of the baryon-baryon potential derived in the framework of SU(3) chiral perturbation theory up to next-to-leading order including contact interactions as well as one-meson and two-meson exchange diagrams. Moreover, we assess the impact of SU(3) symmetry breaking from a large-$N_c$ perspective and show that the leading order results can successfully be applied to the hyperon-nucleon potential.</description>

      <title>Taming flavour violation in the Inverse Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Inverse Seesaw mechanism remains one of the most attractive explanations for the lightness of neutrino masses, allowing for natural low-scale realisations. We consider the prospects of a simple extension via 3 generations of sterile fermions - the so called ISS(3,3) - in what concerns numerous lepton flavour observables. In order to facilitate a connection between the Lagrangian parameters and low-energy data, we systematically develop new parametrisations of the Yukawa couplings. Relying on these new parametrisations to explore the parameter space, we discuss the complementary role of charged lepton flavour violation searches in dedicated facilities, as well as in lepton colliders (FCC-ee and $\mu$TRISTAN). Our results reveal the strong synergy of the different indirect searches in probing the distinct flavour sectors of the model. In particular, we show that in the absence of radiative decays $\ell_\alpha\to\ell_\beta\gamma$, sizeable rates for $Z$-penguin dominated observables could hint at a non-trivially mixed and non-degenerate heavy spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electron-positron to muon--anti-muon cross-section in the asymptotically safe Standard Model. In particular, we include the graviton contributions to the scattering amplitude, which is computed from momentum-dependent time-like one-particle-irreducible correlation functions. Specifically, we employ reconstruction techniques for the graviton spectral functions. We find that the full asymptotically safe quantum cross section decreases in the ultraviolet with the centre-of-mass energy, and is compatible with unitarity bounds. Importantly, our findings provide non-trivial evidence for the unitarity of the asymptotically safe Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Minimal extension of the Standard Model with a mirror symmetry between fundamental fermions and a possible origin of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a specific, nontrivial extension of the Standard Model of weak interactions based on the ${SU(2)}_L\times{U(1)}_Y\times{U(1)}_C$ group. Our motivation follows from the identification of the globally conserved charge $\Omega=\mathrm{B}-\mathrm{L}-\mathrm{Q}$ as a neutrino charge. An intriguing feature of the model is the emergence of a mirror symmetry between neutrinos and electrically charged leptons, as well as between up and down quarks. Following the spontaneous breaking of the weak gauge symmetry with the use of the Goldstone-Higgs iso-doublet, all elementary fermions acquire Dirac masses from Yukawa interaction. The $W^\pm$ and $Z$ bosons also acquire masses, although with a modified relationship between their respective masses, as compared to the Standard Model. Our model accounts for both chiral components of the neutrino and offers an explanation for the non-observability of the right-chiral neutrino. Additionally, it forbids neutrinoless double-beta decay. Spontaneous breaking of the local $U(1)$ symmetry leads to the new gauge boson $ \mathit{\Omega}_\mu$ mass $M_\mathit{\Omega}$, which we assume to be greater than the mass $m_\chi$ of a new scalar, Higgs-like field $\chi$. The cosmological stability of $\chi$, predicted under this condition, allows for its interpretation as dark matter, interacting exclusively with $\mathit{\Omega}_\mu$ and gravity. From this perspective, we solve and analyze a system of Boltzmann equations that describe the thermal evolution of the number density of $\chi$ dark matter and the $\mathit{\Omega}_\mu$ mediator field within the context of the $\mathrm{\Lambda CDM}$ cosmological model. Specifically, we estimate the coupling constant $q$ to be in the range of $\sim 10^{-8.5}\ g$ to $\sim 10^{-6}\ g$ which ensures cosmological stability of the $\chi$ particles.</description>

      <title>Numerical evaluation of two-loop QCD helicity amplitudes for $gg\to t \bar{t} g$ at leading colour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first benchmark evaluation of the two-loop finite remainders for the production of a top-quark pair in association with a jet at hadron colliders in the gluon channel. We work in the leading colour approximation, and perform the numerical evaluation in the physical phase space. To achieve this result, we develop a new method for expressing the master integrals in terms of a (over-complete) basis of special functions that enables the infrared and ultraviolet poles to be cancelled analytically despite the presence of elliptic Feynman integrals. The special function basis makes it manifest that the elliptic functions appear solely in the finite remainder, and can be evaluated numerically through generalised series expansions. The helicity amplitudes are constructed using four dimensional projectors combined with finite-field techniques to perform integration-by-parts reduction, mapping to special functions and Laurent expansion in the dimensional regularisation parameter.</description>

      <title>Notes on recasting the ATLAS-EXOT-2019-23 search for pairs of displaced hadronic jets in the ATLAS calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note describes the validation of material allowing the reinterpretation of an ATLAS search for decays of pair-produced neutral long-lived particles decaying in the hadronic part of the calorimeter, or at the edge of the electromagnetic calorimeter, using the full Run-2 ATLAS dataset. This reinterpretation material includes an efficiency map linking truth-level kinematic information (decay position, transverse momentum and decay products of the LLPs) to the probability of the reconstructed event being selected in the analysis signal region. In this document we describe the validation procedure, i.e. how the map was used to recover the limits presented in the ATLAS publication using events generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and hadronised using Pythia8, and we identify some limitations of this approach. We moreover comment upon issues concerning the validation procedure itself, in particular with regards to whether or not the information included in the existing, published material allows for an external user to test recasting methods.</description>

      <title>LeStrat-Net: Lebesgue style stratification for Monte Carlo simulations powered by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a machine learning algorithm to turn around stratification in Monte Carlo sampling. We use a different way to divide the domain space of the integrand, based on the height of the function being sampled, similar to what is done in Lebesgue integration. This means that isocontours of the function define regions that can have any shape depending on the behavior of the function. We take advantage of the capacity of neural networks to learn complicated functions in order to predict these complicated divisions and preclassify large samples of the domain space. From this preclassification we can select the required number of points to perform a number of tasks such as variance reduction, integration and even event selection. The network ultimately defines the regions with what it learned and is also used to calculate the multi-dimensional volume of each region.</description>

      <title>Triple real-emission contribution to the zero-jettiness soft function at N3LO in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we have presented the result for the zero-jettiness soft function at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO) in perturbative QCD [arXiv:2409.11042], without providing technical details of the calculation. The goal of this paper is to describe the most important element of that computation, the triple real-emission contribution. We present a detailed discussion of the many technical aspects of the calculation, for which a number of methodological innovations was required. Although some elements of the calculation were discussed earlier [arXiv:2004.03285,arXiv:2206.12323,arXiv:2111.13594,arXiv:2204.09459,arXiv:2401.05245], this paper is intended to provide a complete summary of the methods used in the computation of the triple real-emission contribution to the soft function.</description>

      <title>Total decay rates of $B$ mesons at NNLO-QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We update the Standard Model (SM) predictions for the lifetimes of the $B^+$, $B_d$ and $B_s$ mesons within the heavy quark expansion (HQE), including the recently determined NNLO-QCD corrections to non-leptonic decays of the free $b$-quark. In addition, we update the HQE predictions for the lifetime ratios $\tau (B^+)/\tau (B_d)$ and $\tau (B_s)/\tau (B_d)$, and provide new results for the semileptonic branching fractions of the three mesons entirely within the HQE. We obtain a considerable improvement of the theoretical uncertainties, mostly due to the reduction of the renormalisation scale dependence when going from LO to NNLO, and for all the observables considered, we find good agreement, within uncertainties, between the HQE predictions and the corresponding experimental data. Our results read, respectively, $\Gamma (B^+) = 0.587^{+0.025}_{-0.035}~{\rm ps}^{-1}$, $\Gamma (B_d) = 0.636^{+0.028}_{-0.037}~{\rm ps}^{-1}$, $\Gamma (B_s) = 0.628^{+0.027}_{-0.035}~{\rm ps}^{-1}$, for the total decay widths, $\tau (B^+)/\tau (B_d) = 1.081^{+0.014}_{-0.016}$, $\tau (B_s)/\tau (B_d) = 1.013^{+0.007}_{-0.007}$, for the lifetime ratios, and ${\cal B}_{\rm sl} (B^+) = (11.46^{+0.47}_{-0.32}) \%$, ${\cal B}_{\rm sl} (B_d) = (10.57^{+0.47}_{-0.27}) \%$, ${\cal B}_{\rm sl} (B_s) = (10.52^{+0.50}_{-0.29}) \%$, for the semileptonic branching ratios. Finally, we also provide an outlook for further improvements of the HQE determinations of the $B$-meson decay widths and of their ratios.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reviews recent developments in the Parton Branching (PB) method, focusing on its application to Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) parton distributions and the implementation of TMD evolution equations in Monte Carlo generators. Key advancements include the inclusion of photon and heavy electroweak boson radiation in the evolution equations and their impact on collinear and TMD distributions. A detailed comparison of PB and Collins-Soper-Sterman formalisms highlights improvements in the accuracy of PB Sudakov form factors. The role of soft gluons, intrinsic transverse momentum, and the $z_M$ parameter in modelling non-perturbative effects is emphasized, with implications for inclusive distributions and Drell-Yan transverse momentum spectra. This review also addresses challenges in achieving consistency between forward and backward evolution.</description>

      <title>Freeze-in leptogenesis with sterile neutrino self-interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos are a simple yet compelling addition to the Standard Model. For right-handed neutrinos with masses below the electroweak scale, leptogenesis can proceed through CP-violating oscillations of the sterile neutrinos. This is known as ARS or freeze-in leptogenesis. However, the ARS scenario requires the right-handed neutrinos to have a high degree of mass degeneracy. In this work, we study an extension of the SM that introduces a scalar singlet in addition to the two sterile neutrinos required to generate the baryon asymmetry. The new scalar interacts with the sterile neutrinos via a Yukawa interaction. This leads to an additional rate for the production and destruction of the sterile neutrinos and to a novel contribution to the effective potential. For the case in which the mass and the new Yukawa matrices are not diagonal in the same basis, we find that the effective potential can boost the baryon asymmetry of the universe by several orders of magnitude. This significantly alleviates the fine-tuned mass condition required in vanilla ARS leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>The Neutrino Slice at Muon Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muon colliders provide an exciting new path pushing forward the energy frontier of particle physics. We point out a new use of these facilities for neutrino physics and beyond the Standard Model physics \emph{using their main detectors}. Muon decays along the main accelerator rings induce an intense, highly collimated beam of neutrinos. As this beam crosses a thin slice of the kt-scale detector, it would induce unprecedented numbers of neutrino interactions, with $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ events per second for a 10 TeV $\mu^+\mu^-$ collider. We characterize these events, showing that they are highly energetic and possess a distinct timing signature with a large transverse displacement. We discuss promising applications of these events for instrumentation, electroweak, and beyond-the-Standard Model physics. For instance, we show that a sub-percent measurement of the neutrino-electron scattering rate enables new precision measurements of the Weak angle and a novel detection of the neutrino charge radius.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a model of neutrino mass based on the type I seesaw mechanism embedded in a spontaneously broken global lepton number framework with a $Z_2$ symmetry. We show that the resulting Majoron is a viable freeze-in dark matter candidate. Two right-handed neutrinos are assumed to have dominant off-diagonal masses suggesting resonant leptogenesis as the origin of baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Explicit higher dimensional lepton number violating operators, are shown to play a crucial role in simultaneously controlling both the Majoron production in the early Universe and the right handed neutrino mass splitting relevant for resonant leptogenesis. We perform a combined analysis of Majoron dark matter and leptogenesis, discussing the relative importance of self energy and vertex contributions to CP asymmetry, and explore the parameter space, leading to an intricate relation between neutrino mass, dark matter and baryon asymmetry.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an all-order analysis of double-logarithmic corrections to the so-called soft-overlap contribution to heavy-to-light transition form factors at large hadronic recoil. Specifically, we study $B_c \to \eta_c$ transitions within a perturbative non-relativistic framework, treating both the bottom and charm quarks as heavy with the hierarchy $m_b \gg m_c \gg\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$. Our diagrammatic analysis shows that double-logarithmic corrections arise from two distinct sources: Exponentiated soft-gluon effects described by standard Sudakov factors, and rapidity-ordered soft-quark configurations, leading to implicit integral equations, which so far have only been studied in the context of energetic muon-electron backward scattering. We find that the all-order structure of the double logarithms is governed by a novel type of coupled integral equations, which encode the non-trivial interplay between these two effects. Whereas a closed-form solution to these equations is currently unknown, we present useful iteration formulas, and derive the asymptotic behaviour of the soft-overlap form factor for infinitely large recoil energies, showing that the Sudakov suppression is somewhat weakened by the intertwined soft-quark and soft-gluon corrections. In a broader context, our findings shed light onto the physical origin and mathematical structure of endpoint divergences arising from soft-collinear factorization and the related Feynman mechanism for power-suppressed hard exclusive processes.</description>

      <title>Leading-Twist Flavor Singlet Quark TMDs at Small-$x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the small-$x$ asymptotics of the flavor singlet, leading-twist quark Transverse Momentum Dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs). We apply the recently developed Light-Cone Operator Treatment to rewrite the TMD operator definitions at small $x$ in terms of polarized dipole amplitudes, present the small-$x$ evolution equations and their solutions in the large-$N_c$, linearized, Double-Logarithmic Approximation (DLA), where $N_c$ is the number of quark colors. Previously, this approach was used to determine the small-$x$ asymptotics of the unpolarized and helicity TMDs. In this work we obtain the small-$x$ asymptotics of the Sivers function, helicity worm-gear, transversity, pretzelosity, Boer-Mulders and transversity worm-gear TMDs, thus completing the set of the asymptotic small-$x$ behavior of all the leading-twist flavor-singlet quark TMDs.</description>

      <title>Towards the HEFT-hedron: the complete set of positivity constraints at NLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the complete set of positivity bounds on the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) at next-to-leading order (NLO). We identify the 15 operators that can be constrained by positivity, as they contribute to $s^2$-growth in the amplitude for longitudinal gauge-Higgs scattering, that is to all possible 2-to-2 scattering processes involving longitudinal gauge bosons, $V_L = W_L^\pm, Z_L$, and the Higgs boson, $h$. We find two sets of constraints: (i) specific linear combinations of CP-even Wilson coefficients (WCs) must be positive, and (ii) the magnitudes of some WCs -- including all CP-odd ones -- must be smaller than products of other CP-even WCs. We present our final constraints on the 15 dimensional HEFT space and show how known positivity bounds on the 3 dimensional space of dimension 8 SMEFT can be recovered from them. We find that only about $5\%$ of the parameter space for WCs of HEFT operators at NLO complies with these positivity constraints. Additionally, we obtain double-sided bounds on these WCs by fully exploiting the implications of unitarity and $st$-crossing symmetry. For WCs contributing to the vector boson scattering process our final constraints are in most cases significantly stronger than the experimental ones. For the $V_L V_L, hh \to hh$ and $V_LV_L, hh \to V_Lh$ process, there are no reported experimental limits and our theoretical constraints provide the first bounds.</description>

      <title>$2\nu\beta\beta$ Spectrum in Chiral Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two-neutrino double beta decay ($2\nu\beta\beta$) in chiral effective field theory. We find contributions from weak magnetism and double-weak pion-exchange at next-to-leading-order in the chiral power counting. We discuss the impact of the chiral corrections on the electron spectra and find that they should be included in analyses of $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay that aim to uncover new physics signatures in the electron spectrum. We illustrate this point by revisiting the effect of sterile neutrinos and non-standard charged interactions. We also find that the pion-exchange contributions involve nuclear matrix elements that are related to those appearing in neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu \beta \beta$). We investigate whether the $0\nu \beta \beta$ nuclear matrix elements can be obtained from detailed measurements of the energy spectrum of the outgoing electrons in $2\nu\beta\beta$ transitions.</description>

      <title>On the EFT validity for Drell-Yan tails at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we examine the validity range of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) description of high-energy Drell-Yan processes at the LHC. To this purpose, we consider explicit mediators that contribute to these processes in the $s$- and $t$-channels, comparing their effects in Drell-Yan distributions with the ones obtained by matching onto the corresponding EFT. We determine the conditions for the EFT results to accurately describe these scenarios. In particular, we explore the impact of including dimension-eight $(d=8)$ operators in the faster convergence of the EFT series, at the analytical and numerical level, considering contributions to the cross section up to the square of $d=8$ EFT operator insertions. Moreover, we discuss the possible implications of clipping LHC data and illustrate results for a specific New-Physics scenario motivated by low-energy flavor data.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianity from explicit $U(1)$-breaking interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate primordial non-Gaussianity (NG) arising from the explicit $U(1)$ symmetry-breaking interactions during inflation involving a nearly massless axial component of a complex scalar field $P$. We analyze the induced NG parameter $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ under scenarios where the axial field functions as either a curvaton or cold dark matter (CDM). In the curvaton framework, there is a conventional contribution to the local NG of $f_{\rm NL} \simeq -O(1)$. Additional positive local NG can result from either the self-interactions of axial field fluctuations, their interactions with a light radial partner, or kinetic mixing with the inflaton via $U(1)$ symmetry-breaking terms. We identify parameter regions where the interactions lead to cancellations, suppressing the overall local NG to $|f^{\rm loc}_{\mathrm{NL}}| \lesssim O(0.1)$, while leaving the trispectrum largely unaffected. In the CDM scenario, these interactions enhance the NG in the isocurvature fluctuations. Moreover, interactions between the axial field and another light scalar, such as a curvaton, can generate $O(1)$ curvature NG signals and significant mixed curvature-isocurvature NGs that are within the reach of future experiments with $\sigma(f^{\rm loc}_{{\rm NL}})\sim1$. We also explore the role of a heavy radial field in generating oscillating correlation signals, noting that such signals can dominate the shape of the mixed adiabatic-isocurvature bispectrum. In certain cases, an oscillatory isocurvature bispectrum signal may be observable in the future, aiding in distinguishing between certain types of the $U(1)$-breaking self-interactions of the axial field.</description>

      <title>The nucleon-$\Delta$ elastic cross section in isospin-asymmetric nuclear medium with the inclusion of scalar-isovector $\delta$ meson field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The production, dynamic evolution, and decay of $\Delta$ particles play a crucial role in understanding the properties of high baryon density nuclear matter in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions. In this work, the energy-, density-, and isospin-dependent nucleon-$\Delta$ elastic cross section ($\sigma^{*}_{N \Delta}$) is studied within the relativistic Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck framework, in which the $\delta$ meson field is further considered. The results show that the $\delta$ and $\rho$ meson related exchange terms have a nonnegligible contribution to the $\sigma^{*}_{N \Delta}$ compared to only considering the $\rho$ meson exchange terms, although there is a significant cancellation on the cross section among these meson exchange terms. In addition, due to the different effects of the medium correction on the effective mass of neutrons, protons, and differently charged $\Delta$s, the individual $\sigma^{*}_{N \Delta}$ exhibits an ordered isospin-asymmetry ($\alpha$) dependence, and $\sigma^{*}_{n\Delta}$ and $\sigma^{*}_{p\Delta}$ have opposite $\alpha$ dependencies. And the $\alpha$ dependence of the ratio $R(\alpha)=\sigma^{*}(\alpha)/\sigma^{*}(\alpha=0)$ for $n\Delta$ reaction channels follow $n\Delta^{++}&gt;n\Delta^{+}&gt;n\Delta^{0}&gt;n\Delta^{-}$, while for $p\Delta$ it is $p\Delta^{-}&gt;p\Delta^{0}&gt;p\Delta^{+}&gt;p\Delta^{++}$. Moreover, the results also indicate that the isospin effect on the $\sigma^{*}_{N \Delta}$, which is dominantly caused by the isovector $\rho$ and $\delta$ meson fields, is still pronounced at densities up to 3 times normal nuclear density. Finally, a parametrization of the energy-, density-, and isospin-dependent $N\Delta$ elastic cross section is proposed based on the microscopic calculated results, and the in-medium $\sigma^{*}_{N \Delta}$ in the energy range of $\sqrt{s}$=2.3$\sim$3.0 GeV can be well described.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Shadow and other Observables away from the Horizon: Extending the Effective Metric Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work we have developed a model-independent, effective description of quantum deformed, spherically symmetric and static black holes in four dimensions. The deformations of the metric are captured by two functions of the physical distance to the horizon, which are provided in the form of self-consistent Taylor series expansions. While this approach efficiently captures physical observables in the immediate vicinity of the horizon, it is expected to encounter problems of convergence at further distances. Therefore, we demonstrate in this paper how to use Pad\'e approximants to extend the range of applicability of this framework. We provide explicit approximations of physical observables that depend on finitely many effective parameters of the deformed black hole geometry, depending on the order of the Pad\'e approximant. By taking the asymptotic limit of this order, we in particular provide a closed-form expression for the black hole shadow of the (fully) deformed geometry, which captures the leading quantum corrections. We illustrate our results for a number of quantum black holes previously proposed in the literature and find that our effective approach provides excellent approximations in all cases.</description>

Abstract: The sphaleron rate is a key phenomenological quantity both for the axion thermal production in the Early Universe and the Chiral Magnetic Effect occurring in the Quark-Gluon Plasma in presence of a background magnetic field. In this talk we present an extension of our recent determination of the sphaleron rate, in the SU(3) gauge theory, based on the determination of the two-point function of the topological charge density at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Progress in lattice simulations for two Higgs doublet models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The custodial Two-Higgs-Doublet-Model with SU(2) gauge fields is studied on the lattice. This model has the same global symmetry structure as the Standard Model but the additional Higgs field enlarges the scalar spectrum and opens the possibility for the occurrence of spontaneous symmetry breaking of the global symmetries. Both the spectrum and the running of the gauge coupling of the custodial 2HDM are studied on a line of constant Standard Model physics with cutoff ranging from 300 to 600 GeV. The lower bounds of the realizable masses for the additional BSM scalar states are found to be well bellow the W boson mass. In fact, for the choice of quartic couplings in this work the estimated lower mass for one of the BSM states is found to be about $\sim 0.2m_{W}$ and independent of the cutoff.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The timeline of the expansion rate ultimately defines the interplay between high energy physics, astrophysics and cosmology. The guiding theme of this topical review is provided by the scrutiny of the early history of the space-time curvature through the diffuse backgrounds of gravitational radiation that are sensitive to all the stages of the evolution of the plasma. Due to their broad spectrum (extending from the aHz region to the THz domain) they bridge the macroworld described by general relativity and the microworld of the fundamental constituents of matter. It is argued that during the next score year the analysis of the relic gravitons may infirm or confirm the current paradigm where a radiation plasma is assumed to dominate the whole post-inflationary epoch. The role of high frequency and ultra-high frequency signals between the MHz and the THz is emphasized in the perspective of quantum sensing. The multiparticle final state of the relic gravitons and its macroscopic quantumness is also discussed with particular attention to the interplay between the entanglement entropy and the maximal frequency of the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Double sine-Gordon class of universal coarsening dynamics in a spin-1 Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Far from equilibrium, universal dynamics prevails in many different situations, from pattern coarsening to turbulence, while the understanding of its microscopic laws and classification has remained unsatisfactory. Here, universal scaling evolution reflected by coarsening in a multi-component Bose gas is traced back to a low-energy effective theory given by a double sine-Gordon (DSG) model for a single real scalar field. Our experimental observations of a rubidium spinor BEC support the applicability of this model. Evaluating the scaling evolution according to the low-energy effective model demonstrates the universal aspects of the scaling characteristics as compared with that of the spinor gas. The difference between diffusion-type and sub-diffusive scaling is shown to be connected to the occupation of minima within the DSG potential. Our results point to a path towards a microscopic description and classification of pattern coarsening in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Hot QCD Matter 2024 -- Hard Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hot and dense QCD matter, known as the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), is explored through heavy-ion collision experiments at the LHC and RHIC. Jets and heavy flavors, produced from the initial hard scattering, are used as hard probes to study the properties of the QGP. Recent experimental observations on jet quenching and heavy-flavor suppression have strengthened our understanding, allowing for fine-tuning of theoretical models in hard probes. The second conference, HOT QCD Matter 2024, was organized to bring the community together for discussions on key topics in the field. This article comprises 15 sections, each addressing various aspects of hard probes in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, offering a snapshot of current experimental observations and theoretical advancements. The article begins with a discussion on memory effects in the quantum evolution of quarkonia in the quark-gluon plasma, followed by an experimental review, new insights on jet quenching at RHIC and LHC, and concludes with a machine learning approach to heavy flavor production at the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <title>Is the formation of primordial black holes from single-field inflation compatible with standard cosmology?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the generation of primordial black holes (PBHs) within the framework of single-field inflationary models and their compatibility with the cosmological history of the Universe. Our results suggest that, depending on the masses of the formed PBHs, single-field inflation models require more than fine-tuning a potential to induce ultra-slow roll; it necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the post-inflationary cosmological evolution. As an explicative example, we introduce a new model, based on a double inflection point and consistent with Cosmic Microwave Background observations, capable of generating sub-solar PBHs, whose merger could be potentially detectable by the LVK experiment.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we analyze the effects of stochastic magnetic fluctuations with respect to an intense magnetic field background over the yields for photon and dilepton emission processes in a thermalized quark-gluon plasma phase. Such stochastic fluctuations model the effects of nearly random initial conditions for the nuclei participating in non-central heavy-ion collisions, which are the sources of the background magnetic field. Our theoretical results predict significant anisotropic effects due to stochastic magnetic noise over the angular distribution for photon and dilepton production rates in this scenario.</description>

      <title>Oscillators with imaginary coupling: spectral functions in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The axioms of Quantum Mechanics require that the hamiltonian of any closed system is self-adjoint, so that energy levels are real and time evolution preserves probability. On the other hand, non-hermitian hamiltonians with ${\cal{PT}}$-symmetry can have both real spectra and unitary time evolution. In this paper, we study in detail a pair of quantum oscillators coupled by an imaginary bilinear term, both in quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory. We discuss explicitly how such hamiltonians lead to perfectly sound physical theories with real spectra and unitary time evolution, in spite of their non-hermiticity. We also analyze two-point correlation functions and their associated K\"allen-Lehmann representation. In particular, we discuss the intimate relation between positivity violation of the spectral functions and the non-observability of operators in a given correlation function. Finally, we conjecture that positivity violation of some spectral functions of the theory could be a generic sign of the existence of complex pairs of energy eigenvalues (i.e., a ${\cal{PT}}$-broken phase) somewhere in its parameter space.</description>

      <title>Sphere free energy of scalar field theories with cubic interactions</title>

Abstract: The dimensional continuation approach to calculating the free energy of $d$-dimensional Euclidean CFT on the round sphere $S^d$ has been used to develop its $4-\epsilon$ expansion for a number of well-known non-supersymmetric theories, such as the $O(N)$ model. The resulting estimate of the sphere free energy $F$ in the 3D Ising model has turned out to be in good agreement with the numerical value obtained using the fuzzy sphere regularization. In this paper, we develop the $6-\epsilon$ expansions for CFTs on $S^d$ described by scalar field theory with cubic interactions and use their resummations to estimate the values of $F$. In particular, we study the theories with purely imaginary coupling constants, which describe non-unitary universality classes arising when certain conformal minimal models are continued above two dimensions. The Yang-Lee model $M(2,5)$ is described by a field theory with one scalar field, while the $D$-series $M(3,8)$ model is described by two scalar fields. We also study the $OSp(1|2)$ symmetric cubic theory of one commuting and two anti-commuting scalar fields, which appears to describe the critical behavior of random spanning forests. In the course of our work, we revisit the calculations of beta functions of marginal operators containing the curvature. We also use another method for approximating $F$, which relies on perturbation theory around the bilocal action near the long-range/short-range crossover. The numerical values it gives for $F$ tend to be in good agreement with other available methods.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Measurement of Lepton-Jet Azimuthal Angular Asymmetries in Deep-Inelastic Scattering at HERA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In deep-inelastic positron-proton scattering, the lepton-jet azimuthal angular asymmetry is measured using data collected with the H1 detector at HERA. When the average transverse momentum of the lepton-jet system, $\lvert \vec{P}_\perp \rvert $, is much larger than the total transverse momentum of the system, $\lvert \vec{q}_\perp \rvert$, the asymmetry between parallel and antiparallel configurations, $\vec{P}_\perp$ and $\vec{q}_\perp$, is expected to be generated by initial and final state soft gluon radiation and can be predicted using perturbation theory. Quantifying the angular properties of the asymmetry therefore provides an additional test of the strong force. Studying the asymmetry is important for future measurements of intrinsic asymmetries generated by the proton's constituents through Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs), where this asymmetry constitutes a dominant background. Moments of the azimuthal asymmetries are measured using a machine learning method for unfolding that does not require binning.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic non-Gaussianity of ultra slow-roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-Gaussian tail of the curvature fluctuation, $\zeta$, in an inflationary scenario with a transient ultra slow-roll phase that generates a localized large enhancement of the spectrum of $\zeta$. To do so, we implement a numerical procedure that provides the probability distribution of $\zeta$ order by order in perturbation theory. The non-Gaussianities of $\zeta$ can be shown to arise from its non-linear relation to the inflaton fluctuations and from the intrinsic non-Gaussianities of the latter, which stem from its self interactions. We find that intrinsic non-Gaussianities, which have often been ignored to estimate the abundance of primordial black holes in this kind of scenario, are important. The relevance of the intrinsic contribution depends on the rapidity with which the transient ultra slow-roll phase occurs, as well as on its duration. Our method cannot be used accurately when the perturbative in-in formalism fails to apply, highlighting the relevance of developing fully non-perturbative approaches to the problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering the Einstein-Hilbert truncation for the running action in (euclidean) quantum gravity, we derive the renormalization group equations for the cosmological and Newton constant. We find that these equations admit only the Gaussian fixed point with a UV-attractive and a UV-repulsive eigendirection, and that there is no sign of the non-trivial UV-attractive fixed point of the asymptotic safety scenario. Crucial to our analysis is a careful treatment of the measure in the path integral that defines the running action and a proper introduction of the physical running scale $k$. We also show why and how in usual implementations of the RG equations the aforementioned UV-attractive fixed point is generated.</description>

      <title>Gluon Unpolarized, Polarized, and Transversity GPDs from Lattice QCD: Lorentz-Covariant Parametrization (Part I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify the matrix elements necessary to determine the chiral-even $H_g,~E_g,~\widetilde{H}_g,~\widetilde{E}_g$ and chiral-odd $H^T_g,~E^T_g, \widetilde{H}^T_g ,~\widetilde{E}^T_g$ gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in lattice QCD calculations. We present a method to achieve a Lorentz-covariant parameterization of the matrix elements in terms of a linearly independent basis of tensor structures. This parameterization is crucial for projecting lattice QCD matrix elements onto lightcone distributions. For the first time, we determine the corresponding components that project onto the linear combinations of invariant amplitudes, which reduce to the different gluon GPDs in the lightcone limit and enable their separation in a lattice QCD calculation for spin-$0$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hadrons. Hence, this work lays the foundation for the numerical determination of the gluon GPDs from first-principle lattice QCD calculations, directly advancing our understanding of the mass and spin structures, and mechanical properties of the nucleon, as well as the physics underlying deeply virtual Compton scattering and deeply virtual meson production in a range of experimental processes.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Flavor in SMEFT Electroweak Precision Fits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective field theory tools are essential for exploring non-Standard Model physics at the LHC in the absence of the discovery of new light particles. Predictions for observables are typically made at the lowest order in the QCD and electroweak expansions in the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT) and often ignore the effects of flavor. Here, we present results for electroweak precision observables (EWPOs)at the next-to-leading order QCD and electroweak expansions (NLO) of the SMEFT with an arbitrary flavor structure for the fermion operators. Numerical NLO SMEFT fits toEWPOs have a strong dependence on the assumed flavor structures and we demonstrate this using various popular assumptions for flavor symmetries.</description>

      <title>Study some two loop contribution to muon anomalous MDM in the N-B-LSSM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15387v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the muon magnetic dipole moment (MDM) has close relation with the new physics (NP) in the development of the Standard Model (SM). Combined with the Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) and the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) E821 result, the departure from the SM prediction is about 5.0 $\sigma$. We study the electroweak corrections from several type two-loop SUSY diagrams and the virtual SUSY particles include chargino, neutralino, scalar lepton and scalar neutrino. Based on the latest experimental constraints, we study the {muon anomalous MDM} under the next to the minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM with local B-L gauge symmetry (N-B-LSSM). The abundant numerical results verify that $\tan{\beta},~T_e,~M^2_L,~M^2_e,~M_{BB'}$ play an important role in {muon anomalous MDM}. $M^2_e,~\tan{\beta}$ and $T_e$ are sensitive parameters to {muon anomalous MDM}. From the data obtained in all the figures of the numerical results, most of the values of $a_{\mu}^{NBL}$ are in 2$\sigma$ interval, which can compensate the departure between the experiment data and the SM prediction.</description>

      <title>Signatures of supermassive charged gravitinos in liquid scintillator detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous work [K.A. Meissner and H. Nicolai, Eur. Phys. J. C {\bf 84}, 269 (2024)], two of the present authors have suggested possible experimental ways to search for stable supermassive particles with electric charges of $\cO(1)$ in upcoming underground experiments, in particular the new Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) experiment. In the current paper, we present a detailed analysis of the specific signature of such gravitino-induced events for the JUNO detector and for upcoming liquid argon detectors like DUNE (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment). The proposed method of detection relies on the ``glow'' produced by photons during the passage of such particles through the detector liquid, which would last for about a few to a few hundred microseconds depending on its velocity and the track. The cross sections for electronic excitation of the main component of the scintillator liquid, namely linear alkylbenzene (LAB), by the passing gravitino are evaluated using quantum-chemical methods. The results show that, if such particles exist, the resulting signals would lead to a unique and unmistakable signature, for which we present event simulations as they would be seen by the JUNO or DUNE photomultipliers. Our analysis brings together two very different research areas, namely fundamental particles physics and the search for a fundamental theory on the one hand, and methods of advanced quantum chemistry on the other.</description>

Abstract: We study the possibility of measuring T (time reversal) violation in a future long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. By assuming a neutrino factory as a staging scenario of a muon collider at the J-PARC site, we find that the ${\nu}_e \to {\nu}_{\mu}$ oscillation probabilities can be measured with a good accuracy at the Hyper-Kamiokande detector. By comparing with the probability of the time-reversal process, ${\nu}_{\mu} \to {\nu}_e$, measured at the T2K/T2HK experiments, one can determine the CP phase $\delta$ in the neutrino mixing matrix if $| \sin(\delta)|$ is large enough. The determination of $\delta$ can be made with poor knowledge of the matter density of the earth as T violation is almost insensitive to the matter effects. The comparison of CP and T-violation measurements, ${\it \`a\ la}$ the CPT theorem, provides us with a non-trivial check of the three neutrino paradigm based on the quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deconvolving ("unfolding'') detector distortions is a critical step in the comparison of cross section measurements with theoretical predictions in particle and nuclear physics. However, most existing approaches require histogram binning while many theoretical predictions are at the level of statistical moments. We develop a new approach to directly unfold distribution moments as a function of another observable without having to first discretize the data. Our Moment Unfolding technique uses machine learning and is inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We demonstrate the performance of this approach using jet substructure measurements in collider physics. With this illustrative example, we find that our Moment Unfolding protocol is more precise than bin-based approaches and is as or more precise than completely unbinned methods.</description>

      <title>Top Quark Mass Extractions from Energy Correlators: A Feasibility Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent article, we proposed an energy correlator-based method to achieve a precision top quark mass extraction from jet substructure, using the $W$-boson mass as a standard candle. In this paper, we perform an extensive event generator simulation study of this proposal, testing both its experimental viability, as well as its sensitivity to different subprocesses in the top quark production and decay. On the experimental side, we show that uncertainties in the jet energy scale, constituent energy scale, and tracking efficiency have a minimal effect. On the theoretical side, we find that our observable isolates the perturbative decay of the top quark, while nonperturbative physics, such as the modelling of color reconnection, and underlying event, have a negligible impact on the distribution. We conclude that our proposed measurement is resilient to the experimental and theoretical aspects of the hadron collider environment, with variations in model parameters consistently leading to $\lesssim 100~$MeV shifts in the measured top mass. Our results motivate precision theoretical calculations of the energy correlator on top decays, both analytic and using parton shower generators, and further exploration of the experimental measurement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11196v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The masses of eight baryon sets and nine meson sets of three or more equal-quantum excited states are fitted by a simple two-parameter logarithm function, M(n) = a Ln(n) + b, where $n$ is the order of excitation. The conjecture is made that accurately measured masses of all equal-quantum baryon and meson excited states would be related by the logarithm function used here; at least for the mass range of currently known excited states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the issue of cancellation of infrared (IR) divergences at the amplitude level in Light Front Quantum Chromodynamics (LFQCD) using the coherent state formalism. We consider the process $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow q\bar{q}g$ upto $\mathcal{O}(g^3)$ in light-cone-time-ordered Hamiltonian perturbation theory and show that IR divergences in S-matrix elements appear due to vanishing energy denominators. We construct the coherent state formalism for LFQCD and explicitly show that these divergences are cancelled when a coherent state basis is used for calculating the S-matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Mixing angle of $K_1(1270/1400)$ and the $K\bar K_1(1400)$ molecular interpretation of $\eta_1(1855)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the SU(3) symmetry breaking effect, the axial-vector kaons $K_1(1270)$ and $K_1(1400)$ are established to be mixtures of two P-wave $K_{1A}\left( {^3{P_1}} \right)$ and $K_{1B}\left( {^1{P_1}} \right)$ states. In QCD sum rules, we propose a new construction of the $K_1$ current operators and calculate the two-point correlation functions by including the next-to-leading order four-quark condensates. The mixing angle is determined as $\theta = \left( {46.95_{ - 0.23}^{ + 0.25}} \right)^\circ$ by reproducing the masses of $K_1(1270)$ and $K_1(1400)$. We further compose the $K\bar K_1\left( {1270} \right)$ and $K\bar K_1\left( {1400} \right)$ interpolating currents with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ to investigate the possible molecular interpretation of the recently observed ${\eta _1}(1855)$ state. We calculate the correlation functions and perform the QCD sum rule analyses for these two molecular systems. However, the spectral functions are found to be negative in physical regions so that they are not able to provide reliable investigations of the $K\bar K_1$ molecular states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the central values of the relevant experimental inputs, that is the strong coupling constant and the top quark and Higgs masses, the effective Higgs potential displays two minima, one at the electroweak scale and a deeper one at high energies. We review the phenomenology of the Higgs inflation model, extending the Standard Model to include a non-minimal coupling to gravity; as recently shown [1], even configurations that would be metastable in the Standard Model, become viable for inflation if the non-minimal coupling is large enough to flatten the Higgs potential at field values below the barrier between the minima.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jet substructure studies at the Large Hadron Collider have been used to constrain parton distribution functions, test perturbative QCD, measure the strong-coupling constant, and probe the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. We extend these studies to lower energies at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider that would additionally allow us to test existing models of non-perturbative physics. In this study, we present a PYTHIA8-based Monte Carlo study of substructure of jets produced in $p+p$ collisions at 200 GeV. The selection criteria is adapted for a feasible measurement at sPHENIX. We consider different types of jet substructure observables such as jet angularities and primary Lund Plane with a special focus on suppression of collinear radiation around emitting heavy quark known as a dead cone effect.</description>

Abstract: A novel proposal is made to account for the dark matter component of the Universe. Ultralight dark matter with mass $\leq {\cal{O}}(10^{-22})~eV$ is one of the strong candidates for the missing mass which aids the formation of galaxies as well as holding them together. They are also known as fuzzy dark matter(FDM) which will come under Cold Dark matter. The question is what is this particle and its implications. How do we experimentally see it is an outstanding question. We propose to answer some of these questions with some evidences and the estimates.</description>

      <title>Precision calculations of $B\to K^*$ form factors from SCET sum rules beyond leading-power contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ vacuum-to-$B$ meson correlation functions with interpolating currents $\bar{q}'\slashed{n}q$ and $\bar{q}'\slashed{n}\gamma_{\perp}q$ to construct light-cone sum rules (LCSR) for calculating the $B\to K^*$ form factors in the large recoil region. We investigate several subleading-power corrections to these form factors at tree level, including the next-to-leading power contributions from the hard-collinear propagator, the subleading power corrections from the effective current $\bar{q}\Gamma[i\slashed{D}_{\perp}/(2m_b)]h_v$, and four-body higher-twist effects. By utilizing the available leading-power results at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ and the power corrections from higher-twist $B$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes from our previous work, we further derive the improved numerical predictions for $B\to K^*$ form factors by applying the three-parameter model for $B$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs). The subleading-power contribution is about $30\%$ relative to the corresponding leading-power result. Taking the well-adopted Bourrely-Caprini-Lellouch (BCL) parametrization, we then provide the numerical results of $B\to K^*$ form factors in the entire kinematic range, by adopting the combined fit to both LCSR predictions and lattice QCD results. Taking advantage of the newly obtained $B\to K^*$ form factors, we analyse the rare exclusive decay $B \to K^* \nu_\ell\bar{\nu}_\ell$ and estimate the Standard Model predictions of $\mathcal{BR}(\bar{B}^0 \to \bar{K}^{*0} \nu_\ell\bar{\nu}_\ell)=7.54(86)\times 10^{-6}$, $\mathcal{BR}(\bar{B}^+ \to \bar{K}^{*+} \nu_\ell\bar{\nu}_\ell)=9.35(94)\times 10^{-6}$ and longitudinal $K^*$ polarization fraction $F_L=0.44(4)$.</description>

Abstract: We combine, for the first time, event-by-event $\rm T_RENTo$ initial conditions with the relativistic viscous hydrodynamic model v-USPhydro and the Monte Carlo event generator JEWEL to make predictions for the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and jet azimuthal anisotropies $v_n\left\{2\right\}$ in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02 \, \rm TeV$ PbPb collisions for multiple centralities and values of the jet cone radius $R$. The $R$-dependence of $R_{AA}$ and $v_2\left\{2\right\}$ strongly depends on the presence of recoiling scattering centers. We find a small jet $v_3\left\{2\right\}$ in mid-central collisions and consistent results in wide jet $p_T$ regions and centralities with ATLAS data.</description>

      <title>Energy recovery twin linear $e^+e^-$, $e^-e^-$ colliders (ERLC ) with high luminosities and acceleration gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a high-energy superconducting $e^+e^-$ linear collider with energy recovery (ERLC) has been proposed, using twin RF structures to avoid parasitic collisions in linacs. Such a collider could operate in DC (duty cycle) or CW (continuous) mode, if sufficient power is available, with a luminosity of ${\cal O}(10^{36})$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ at $2E_0=$250-500 GeV. In this paper, we find that the luminosity of the ERLC operating in DC mode does not depend on the accelerating gradient (for the same total power), allowing the ERLC to operate at the maximum available accelerating gradients. We also consider for the first time an $e^-e^-$ twin collider with energy recovery and estimate its achievable luminosity. Such an $e^-e^-$ collider is simpler than an $e^+e^-$ one. It does not require beam recycling, since electrons can be produced anew each time. Travelling-wave RF structures allow higher gradients and reduced thermal loading. It is shown that an ERLC with an acceleration gradient of $G=40$ MeV/m can be operated in CW mode with $L_{e^+e^-} =$ (1-2.5)$10^{36}$ and $L_{e^-e^-} =$ (3-7)$10^{36}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for reasonable powers of 150 and 300 MW at $2E_0=250$ and 500 GeV, respectively. Such a machine is a promising candidate for a Higgs factory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a first study of the semileptonic decay $D^0\rightarrow K^-\pi^0\mu^{+}\nu_{\mu}$ by analyzing an $e^+e^-$ annihilation data sample of $7.9~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ collected at the center-of-mass energy of 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector. The absolute branching fraction of $D^0\to K^-\pi^0\mu^{+}\nu_{\mu}$ is measured for the first time to be $(0.729 \pm 0.014_{\rm stat} \pm 0.011_{\rm syst})\%$. Based on an amplitude analysis, the $S\text{-}{\rm wave}$ contribution is determined to be $(5.76 \pm 0.35_{\rm stat} \pm 0.29_{\rm syst})\%$ of the total decay rate in addition to the dominated $K^{*}(892)^-$ component. The branching fraction of $D^0\to K^{*}(892)^-\mu^+\nu_\mu$ is given to be $(2.062 \pm 0.039_{\rm stat} \pm 0.032_{\rm syst})\%$, which improves the precision of the world average by a factor of 5. Combining with the world average of ${\mathcal B}(D^0\to K^{*}(892)^-e^+\nu_e)$, the ratio of the branching fractions obtained is $\frac{{\mathcal B}(D^0\to K^{*}(892)^-\mu^+\nu_\mu)}{{\mathcal B}(D^0\to K^{*}(892)^-e^+\nu_e)} = 0.96\pm0.08$, in agreement with lepton flavor universality. Furthermore, assuming single-pole dominance parameterization, the most precise hadronic form factor ratios for $D^0\to K^{*}(892)^{-} \mu^+\nu_\mu$ are extracted to be $r_{V}=V(0)/A_1(0)=1.37 \pm 0.09_{\rm stat} \pm 0.03_{\rm syst}$ and $r_{2}=A_2(0)/A_1(0)=0.76 \pm 0.06_{\rm stat} \pm 0.02_{\rm syst}$.</description>

      <title>Scalar field with a time-independent classical source, not trivial after all: from vacuum decay to scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Historically it has been believed that a time-independent classical source has no effect on the scattering of relativistic uncharged field, in contrast with single particle quantum mechanics. In this work we show that the dynamics is not trivial. We solve exactly for the scattering amplitudes and find that a key ingredient is the production of particles from the unstable vacuum, conceptually similar to the Schwinger mechanism. We compute exactly the probabilities for the vacuum to decay in $n$ particles. The time dependence of such probabilities displays interesting properties such as the quantum Zeno effect and in particular has no regime where the exponential decay law is a good approximation. We show that the trivial scattering found in the past is the byproduct of the adiabatic switching of the interaction. In fact, it is not possible to switch off the interaction (adiabatically or otherwise) at distant times and recover the exact results. Finally, this non trivial vacuum behavior is a source of particle production. We argue that such non-perturbative calculations can be phenomenologically relevant for the production processes that are suppressed at the lower orders in perturbation theory, for instance dilaton production in a medium.</description>

      <title>Three-flavor, Full Momentum Space Neutrino Spin Oscillations in Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of anisotropic neutrino and antineutrino fluxes, the quantum kinetic equations drive coherent oscillations in neutrino helicity, frequently referred to as spin oscillations. These oscillations depend directly on the absolute mass scale and Majorana phase, but are usually too transient to produce important effects. In this paper we present a full momentum-space analysis of Majorana neutrino spin oscillations in a snapshot of a three-dimensional neutron star merger simulation. We find an interesting angular dependence that allows for that resonant and adiabatic oscillations to occur along specific directions in a large volume of the merger remnant. The solid angle spanned by these directions is extremely narrow in general. We then analyze spin transformation in the presence of flavor transformation by characterizing how the effect's resonance and timescale change during a fast flavor instability. For this analysis, we derive a generalized resonance condition that poses a restrictive requirement for resonance to exist in any flavor channel. We determine that spin oscillations at all locations in the merger snapshot have a length scale that is too large for significant oscillations to be expected even where there exist resonant and adiabatic directions.</description>

      <title>False Vacuum Decay Rate From Thin To Thick Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a single real scalar field in flat spacetime with a polynomial potential up to $\phi^4$, that has a local minimum, the false vacuum, and a deeper global minimum, the true vacuum. When the vacua are almost degenerate we are in the thin wall regime, while as their difference in potential energy increases, we approach the thick wall regime. We give explicit simple formulae for the decay rate of the false vacuum in 3 and 4 spacetime dimensions. Our results include a careful treatment both of the bounce action, which enters at the exponent of the decay rate, and of the functional determinant at one loop, which determines the prefactor. The bounce action is computed analytically as an expansion in the thin wall parameter in generic $D$ dimensions. We find that truncating such an expansion at second order we obtain a remarkably accurate bounce action also deep into thick wall regimes. We calculate the functional determinant numerically in 3 and 4 dimensions and fit the results with simple polynomials of the same thin wall parameter. This allows us to write the complete one-loop decay rate as a compact expression, which works accurately from thin to thick wall regimes.</description>

      <title>Black hole-neutron star mergers in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations of black hole-neutron star binaries, particularly those where the black hole has a lower mass compared to other observed systems, have the potential to place strong constraints on modifications to general relativity that arise at small curvature length scales. Here we study the dynamics of black hole-neutron star mergers in shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, a representative example of such a theory, by numerically evolving the full equations of motion. We consider quasi-circular binaries with different mass-ratios that are consistent with recent gravitational wave observations, including cases with and without tidal disruption of the star, and quantify the impact of varying the coupling controlling deviations from general relativity on the gravitational wave signal and scalar radiation. We find that the main effect on the late inspiral is the accelerated frequency evolution compared to general relativity, and that--even considering Gauss-Bonnet coupling values approaching those where the theory breaks down--the impact on the merger gravitational wave signal is mild, predominately manifesting as a small change in the amplitude of the ringdown. We compare our results to current post-Newtonian calculations and find consistency throughout the inspiral.</description>

      <title>De-excitations of highly excited $^{11}$B$^*$ and $^{15}$N$^*$ based on the GEMINI++ code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear de-excitations associated with neutrino-nucleus interactions and nucleon decays are playing an increasingly significant role in neutrino experiments. We explore the GEMINI++ code and estimate its ability to account for the de-excitation processes of highly excited $^{11}$B$^*$ and $^{15}$N$^*$, which can be created in the liquid scintillator and water Cherenkov detectors respectively. It is found that GEMINI++ can not describe the nuclear experimental data of $^{11}$B$^*$ and $^{15}$N$^*$ well. To improve its performance for de-excitations of light nuclei, we modify GEMINI++ and then develop a code of GEMINI++4$\nu$, which can give the best predictions compared with experimental measurements among some widely used statistical model codes.</description>

      <title>Indirect detection of the QCD axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion, originally proposed to solve the strong CP problem in QCD, is a prominent candidate for dark matter (DM). In the presence of strong magnetic fields, such as those around neutron stars, axions can theoretically convert into photons, producing detectable electromagnetic signals. This axion-photon coupling provides a unique experimental pathway to probe axions within a specific mass range. We investigate a novel observational approach using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to search for radio transients that could arise from interactions between neutron stars and dense DM clumps known as axion miniclusters. By observing the core of Andromeda with the VErsatile GBT Astronomical Spectrometer (VEGAS) and the X-band receiver (8 to 10 GHz), we achieve sensitivity to axions with masses in the range of (33 - 42)$\,\mu$eV, with a mass resolution of $3.8 \times 10^{-4}\,\mu$eV. We detail our observational and analytical strategies developed to capture transient signals from axion-photon conversion, achieving an instrumental sensitivity of $2\,$mJy per spectral channel. Despite our sensitivity threshold, no candidate signals exceeding the 5$\sigma$ level were identified. Future implementations will extend this search across additional spectral bands and refine the modeling used for the processes involved, strengthening the constraints on axion DM models.</description>
