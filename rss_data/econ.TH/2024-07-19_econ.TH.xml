      <title>Communicating with Anecdotes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a communication game between a sender and a receiver. The sender chooses one of her signals about the state of the world (i.e., anecdotes) and communicates to the receiver who takes an action affecting both players. The sender and the receiver both care about the state of the world but are also influenced by personal preferences, so their ideal actions can differ. We characterize perfect Bayesian equilibria. The sender faces a temptation to persuade: she wants to select a biased anecdote to influence the receiver's action. Anecdotes are still informative to the receiver (who will debias at equilibrium) but the attempt to persuade comes at a cost to precision. This gives rise to informational homophily where the receiver prefers to listen to like-minded senders because they provide higher-precision signals. Communication becomes polarized when the sender is an expert with access to many signals, with the sender choosing extreme outlier anecdotes at equilibrium (unless preferences are perfectly aligned). This polarization dissipates all gains from communication with an increasingly well-informed sender when the anecdote distribution is heavy-tailed. Experts can therefore face a curse of informedness: receivers will prefer to listen to less-informed senders who cannot pick biased signals as easily.</description>

      <title>AI-powered mechanisms as judges: Breaking ties in chess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology use has been rising in sports to reach decisions of various complexity. At a relatively low complexity level, for example, major tennis tournaments replaced human line judges with Hawk-Eye Live technology to reduce staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. AI is now ready to move beyond such mundane tasks, however. A case in point and a perfect application ground is chess. To reduce the growing incidence of ties, many elite tournaments have resorted to fast chess tiebreakers. However, these tiebreakers significantly reduce the quality of games. To address this issue, we propose a novel AI-driven method for an objective tiebreaking mechanism. This method evaluates the quality of players' moves by comparing them to the optimal moves suggested by powerful chess engines. If there is a tie, the player with the higher quality measure wins the tiebreak. This approach not only enhances the fairness and integrity of the competition but also maintains the game's high standards. To show the effectiveness of our method, we apply it to a dataset comprising approximately 25,000 grandmaster moves from World Chess Championship matches spanning from 1910 to 2018, using Stockfish 16, a leading chess AI, for analysis.</description>
