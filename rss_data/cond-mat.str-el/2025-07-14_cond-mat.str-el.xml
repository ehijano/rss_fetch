      <title>Partial suppression of magnetism in the square lattice SU(3) Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SU(N) Hubbard model is a natural extension of the SU(2) model. However, even the N=3 case remains poorly understood. We report a substantially new ground-state phase diagram of the square lattice SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model. Using a backflow ansatz, we identify strong signatures of a Mott transition and a subsequent magnetic transition, and the suppression of a previously predicted magnetic phase. We study the hole-doped model, identifying a transition from magnetic to paramagnetic behavior in the strong-coupling regime. Our findings offer a qualitatively new ground state picture. More broadly, our work suggests a path to study general SU(N) Hubbard models with arbitrary filling and geometry.</description>

      <title>Diagonal Isometric Form for Tensor Product States in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isometric tensor product states (isoTPS) generalize the isometric form of the one-dimensional matrix product states (MPS) to tensor networks in two and higher dimensions. Here, we introduce an alternative isometric form for isoTPS by incorporating auxiliary tensors to represent the orthogonality hypersurface. We implement the time evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm on this new isometric form and benchmark the method by computing ground states and the real time evolution of the transverse field Ising model in two dimensions on large square lattices of up to 1250 sites. Our results demonstrate that isoTPS can efficiently capture the entanglement structure of two-dimensional area law states. The short-time dynamics is also accurately reproduced even at the critical point. Our isoTPS formulation further allows for a natural extension to different lattice geometries, such as the honeycomb or kagome latice.</description>

      <title>Tunable chiral and nematic states in the triple-Q antiferromagnet Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex spin configurations in magnetic materials, ranging from collinear single-Q to noncoplanar multi-Q states, exhibit rich symmetry and chiral properties. However, their detailed characterization is often hindered by the limited spatial resolution of neutron diffraction techniques. Here we employ magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and magnetic linear dichroism (MLD) to investigate the triangular lattice antiferromagnet Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$, revealing three-state (Z3) nematicity and also spin chirality across its multi-Q magnetic phases. At intermediate temperatures, the presence of MLD identifies nematicity arising from a single-Q stripe phase, while at high magnetic fields and low temperatures, a phase characterized solely by MCD emerges, signifying a purely chiral non-coplanar triple-Q state. Notably, at low temperatures and small fields, we discover a unique phase where both chirality and nematicity coexist. A theoretical analysis based on a continuous multi-Q manifold captures the emergence of these distinct magnetic phases, as a result of the interplay between four-spin interactions and weak magnetic anisotropy. Additionally, MCD and MLD microscopy spatially resolves the chiral and nematic domains. Our findings establish Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$ as a rare platform hosting diverse multi-Q states with distinct combinations of spin chirality and nematicity while demonstrating the effectiveness of polarized optical techniques in characterizing complex magnetic textures.</description>

      <title>Quantized order parameters of approximate symmetry for metals and insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a simple scheme to distinguish between metals and insulators, or more generally gapless and gapped phases, by introducing the notion of an approximate symmetry order parameter. For one dimensional systems, we provide an explicit proof for the known criteria of metals and insulators based on the polarization operator which have been widely accepted for decades without a rigorous proof. For higher dimensions, we introduce a tiny magnetic flux to control the system, where the translation symmetry becomes approximate. We show that insulators and metals can be well distinguished with use of the approximate symmetry operators and they work as quantized order parameters in the thermodynamic limit characterizing gapless and gapped nature of the system.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic theory of square skyrmion lattice in tetragonal frustrated antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-temperature part of the phase diagram of tetragonal frustrated antiferromagnets is discussed within the framework of the mean-field approach. Based on recent experimental and theoretical studies, we consider a model including frustrated Heisenberg exchange, biquadratic exchange, anisotropic exchange, and magnetodipolar interaction. It is analytically demonstrated that a subtle interplay among these interactions results in a variety of phase diagrams in the temperature-magnetic field plane. We argue that the phase diagram obtained for the easy axis along the high-symmetry direction $[001]$ and moderate biquadratic exchange reproduces all crucial features of the phase diagram experimentally observed for~\gdru~compound. The topological properties of the respective double-modulated square skyrmion lattice phase are discussed. The developed analytical approach can also be useful for the refinement of the microscopic model parameters when comparing its predictions with experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Intertwined Density Waves in La$_4$Ni$_{3-x}$Cu$_x$O$_{10+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ has been reported to emerge upon suppression of intertwined spin and charge density wave (SDW/CDW) order, suggesting a possible connection to the pairing mechanism. Here we report a systematic investigation of La$_{4}$Ni$_{3-x}$Cu$_{x}$O$_{10+\delta}$ ($0 \leq x \leq 0.7$), focusing on the evolution of the SDW/CDW order as a function of chemical substitution. Temperature-dependent resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and Hall effect measurements reveal a linear suppression of density wave transition temperature $T{\text{dw}}$ and a concurrent enhancement of hole concentration with increasing Cu content. At higher substitution levels ($x &gt; 0.15$), the transition-induced anomaly in the resistivity becomes undetectable while a magnetic signature persists, indicating a partial decoupling of spin and charge components and the possible survival of short-range spin correlations. The absence of superconductivity across the substitution series highlights the importance of additional factors in stabilizing the superconducting state in pressurized La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Dynamics in a (2+1)-D Gauge Theory: The Stringy Nature on a Superconducting Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the confinement mechanism in gauge theories and the universality of effective string-like descriptions of gauge flux tubes remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. We probe string modes of motion with dynamical matter in a digital quantum simulation of a (2+1) dimensional gauge theory using a superconducting quantum processor with up to 144 qubits, stretching the hardware capabilities with quantum-circuit depths comprising up to 192 two-qubit layers. We realize the $Z_2$-Higgs model ($Z_2$HM) through an optimized embedding into a heavy-hex superconducting qubit architecture, directly mapping matter and gauge fields to vertex and link superconducting qubits, respectively. Using the structure of local gauge symmetries, we implement a comprehensive suite of error suppression, mitigation, and correction strategies to enable real-time observation and manipulation of electric strings connecting dynamical charges. Our results resolve a dynamical hierarchy of longitudinal oscillations and transverse bending at the end points of the string, which are precursors to hadronization and rotational spectra of mesons. We further explore multi-string processes, observing the fragmentation and recombination of strings. The experimental design supports 300,000 measurement shots per circuit, totaling 600,000 shots per time step, enabling high-fidelity statistics. We employ extensive tensor network simulations using the basis update and Galerkin method to predict large-scale real-time dynamics and validate our error-aware protocols. This work establishes a milestone for probing non-perturbative gauge dynamics via superconducting quantum simulation and elucidates the real-time behavior of confining strings.</description>

      <title>Exciting terahertz magnons with amplitude modulated light: spin pumping, squeezed states, symmetry breaking and pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how amplitude modulated, coherent high-frequency drives can be used to access otherwise difficult to reach collective resonances and off-resonantly induce parametric instabilities. In particular, we demonstrate that difficult to access antiferromagnetic resonances in the THz range can be parametrically excited with signals at optical frequencies via a mechanism that we call Modulated Floquet Parametric Driving (MFPD). We study spin pumping and the formation of entangled, two-mode squeezed magnon pairs in anisotropic antiferromagnets under MFPD. Furthermore, we show that MFPD induces transitions to symmetry breaking steady-states in which dynamical spin patterns are formed by resonant magnon pairs.</description>

      <title>Exponential onset of scalable entanglement via twist-and-turn dynamics in XY models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient preparation of scalable multipartite entanglement is a central goal in the development of next-generation quantum devices. In this work, we show that the so-called ``twist-and-turn" (TaT) dynamics for interacting spin ensembles, generated by Hamiltonians with U(1)-symmetric interactions and with a transverse field, can offer an important resource to reach this goal. For models with sufficiently high connectivity, TaT dynamics exhibits two key features: 1) it features both scalable squeezing at short times, as well as quantum Fisher information with Heisenberg scaling at later times; and 2) scalable multipartite entanglement (up to Heisenberg scaling) is reached in a time growing only logarithmically with system size, associated with an exponential buildup of quantum correlations. These results can be shown exactly in the XY model with a Rabi field and infinite range interactions, and numerically in the case of spatially decaying XY interactions, such as dipolar interactions in two dimensions, provided that unstable spin-wave modes do not develop for large system sizes and/or strong fields. For dipolar interactions, the entanglement dynamics at intermediate times is completely at odds with thermalization; and it appears to saturate the maximum speed of entanglement buildup allowed by Lieb-Robinson bounds generalized to power-law interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Rocksalt rare-earth monoxides as electronic and magnetic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stable binary rare earth (RE) oxides are usually trivalent RE ion sesquioxides (RE2O3), that are highly insulating and either nonmagnetic or antiferromagnetic. On the other hand, rocksalt-type divalent RE ion monoxides (REOs) have been scarcely synthesized owing to their metastable nature. Accordingly, their fundamental properties have not been unveiled. Recently, thin film epitaxy was successfully applied to synthesize various REOs. In stark contrast with RE2O3, REOs are highly electrically conducting, and exhibit superconductivity, room temperature ferromagnetism, and so on. Therefore, REOs are new and simple f-electron system, promising as electronic, magnetic, and spintronic materials. In this review, their fundamental properties are introduced, and their significance and future prospects are discussed toward a new paradigm in f-electron systems.</description>

      <title>Strengthened correlations near [110] edges of $d$-wave superconductors in the t-J model with the Gutzwiller approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report results of a study of strongly correlated $d$-wave superconducting slabs within a t-J model solved using the statistically consistent Gutzwiller approach. For different dopings, we model slabs cut at 45$^\circ$ relative to the main crystallographic $ab$-axes, i.e., [110] orientation, and conclude that quasiparticle charge is drawn to the edges. Thus, the correlations are locally strengthened, and a region near the edge is closer to the Mott insulating state with reduced hopping amplitudes on the links. Superconductivity is locally weakened near the edges in the correlated state, and the spectral weight of zero-energy Andreev bound states is substantially reduced compared to weak coupling theory. The renormalization of the edge states leaves no room for an extended $s$-wave component to form for hole dopings ranging from strongly underdoped to slightly overdoped.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time parametrization of neural quantum states for quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states are a promising framework for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can represent states with volume-law entanglement. As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schr\"odinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state ($s$-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using simply a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the parameterization is efficient in the number of parameters and the smooth neural quantum state allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.</description>

      <title>Observation of quasi-steady dark excitons and gap phase in a doped semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton plays an important role in optics and optics-related behaviors and leads to novel correlated phases like charge order, exciton insulator, and exciton-polariton condensation. Dark exciton shows distinct properties from bright one. However, it cannot be directly detected by conventional optic measurements. The electronic modulation effect of dark excitons in quasi-equilibrium distribution, critical for electronic devices in working status, is still elusive. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we report creating, detecting, and controlling dark excitons in the quasi-equilibrium distribution in a doped semiconductor SnSe2. Surprisingly, we observe an excitonic gap phase, with a conduction band opening an anisotropic gap. Our results broaden the scope of dark excitons, extending their studies from the picosecond timescale in the ultrafast photoemission process to conditions occurring under quasi-equilibrium. We reveal the light-matter interaction in the engineering of electronic structures and provide a new way to realize the excitonic gap phase in semiconductors with large band gaps.</description>

      <title>Theory of magnetism for rare-earth magnets on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice with non-Kramers ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the rapid experimental progress on the rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland lattice magnets, we propose a generic effective spin model that describes interacting non-Kramers local moments on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice. We point out that the local moments consist of both magnetic dipole and quadrupole components and the effective model turns out to be an extended XYZ model with an intrinsic field that accounts for the crystal field splitting. We then study the ground-state phase diagram of the model and find that pure quadrupole orders, which are invisible to conventional experimental probes, can be stabilized over a broad regime. In particular, we show that a hidden ``1/3 magnetization plateau'' with quadrupole orders generally exists and discuss its experimental signatures. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our results to the rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland lattice magnets Pr$_{2}$Ga$_{2}$BeO$_{7}$ and Pr$_{2}$Be$_{2}$GeO$_{7}$.</description>

Abstract: Bose-Fermi mixtures naturally appear in various physical systems. In semiconductor heterostructures, such mixtures can be realized, with bosons as excitons and fermions as dopant charges. However, the complexity of these hybrid systems challenges the comprehension of the mechanisms that determine physical properties such as mobility. In this study, we investigate interlayer exciton diffusion in an H-stacked WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ heterobilayer. Our measurements are performed in the ultra-low exciton density regime at low temperatures to examine how the presence of charges affects exciton mobility. Remarkably, for charge doping near the Mott insulator phase, we observe a giant enhancement of exciton diffusion of three orders of magnitude compared to charge neutrality. We attribute this observation to mobile valence holes, which experience a suppressed moir\'e potential due to the electronic charge order in the conduction band, and recombine with any conduction electron in a non-monogamous manner. This new mechanism emerges for sufficiently large fillings in the vicinity of correlated generalized Wigner crystal and Mott insulating states. Our results demonstrate the potential to characterize correlated electron states through exciton diffusion and provide insights into the rich interplay of bosons and fermions in semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: A Dirac quantum spin liquid hosts Dirac spinons, which are low-energy fractionalized neutral quasiparticles with spin 1/2 that obey the Dirac equation. Recent inelastic neutron scattering studies have revealed a cone spin continuum in YCu$_3$(OD)$_6$Br$_2$[Br$_{x}$(OD)$_{1-x}$], consistent with the convolution of two Dirac spinons. In this work, we further studied spin excitations using the inelastic neutron scattering technique. The width of low-energy spin excitations shows a linear temperature dependence, which can be explained by spinon-spinon interactions with a Dirac dispersion. Polarized neutron scattering measurements reveal that in-plane magnetic fluctuations are about 1.5 times stronger than the out-of-plane ones, suggesting the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and consistent with our theoretical modeling and simulations. Moreover, the high-energy spin excitations around 14 meV agree with the one-pair spinon-antispinon excitations in Raman studies. The real part of the dynamical susceptibility derived from the Kramers-Kronig relationship also agrees with the Knight shift measured by nuclear magnetic resonance, clearly demonstrating the negligible effects of magnetic impurities on static susceptibility. These results provide a rare example in studying quantum-spin-liquid materials where different experimental techniques can be directly compared, and they give further insights for the possible Dirac quantum spin liquid in this system.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry-projected wave function methods capture static correlation by breaking and restoring the symmetries of a system. In this article, we present the symmetry-projected spin antisymmetrized geminal power (spin-AGP) state projected onto space group symmetry as well as complex conjugation, spin-flip, and time-reversal symmetries. The method is benchmarked on the 1D XXZ model and 2D $\mathrm{J_1-J_2}$ model with square and triangular lattices. Our results indicate that symmetry projection methods provide a powerful tool for frustrated spin systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring the relations between coexisting, cooperative, or competing types of ordering is a key to identify and harness the mechanisms governing the mutual interactions between them, and to utilize their combined properties. We have experimentally explored the response of the charge density wave (CDW) to various antiferromagnetic, metamagnetic, and field-aligned ferromagnetic states that constitute the magnetic phase diagram of TmNiC$_2$. The high resolution x-ray diffraction experiment employing synchrotron radiation at low temperature and high magnetic field, allowed to follow the superstructure satellite reflections, being a sensitive probe of CDW. This investigation not only reveals direct evidence that the charge density wave avoids even a partial suppression in the antiferromagnetic ground state but also proves that this state coexists, without any visible signatures of weakening, in the entire dome of the magnetically ordered phases, including the field-aligned ferromagnetic state. The calculations of the electronic and phonon structures support the experiment, revealing that the dominant contribution to the CDW transition stems from momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling. We conclude that this mechanism prevents the CDW from vanishing, although the nesting conditions within the magnetically ordered phases deteriorate.</description>

      <title>Strain as a tool to stabilize the isotropic triangular lattice in a geometrically frustrated organic quantum magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometric frustration is a key ingredient in the emergence of exotic states of matter, such as the quantum spin liquid in Mott insulators. While there has been intense interest in experimentally tuning frustration in candidate materials, achieving precise and continuous control has remained a major hurdle -- particularly in accessing the properties of the ideally frustrated lattice. Here, we show that large, finely controlled anisotropic strains can effectively tune the degree of geometric frustration in the Mott insulating $\kappa$-(ET)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ -- a slightly anisotropic triangular-lattice quantum magnet. Using thermodynamic measurements of the elastocaloric effect, we experimentally map out a temperature-strain phase diagram that captures both the ground state of the isotropic lattice and the less frustrated parent state. Our results provide a new benchmark for calculations of the triangular-lattice Hubbard model as a function of frustration and highlight the power of lattice engineering as a route to realizing perfectly frustrated quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Resilient cluster Mott states in layered Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ against pressure-induced symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, by combining density-functional theory (DFT) with dynamical mean-field calculations (DMFT), we compare the crystal and electronic structures of the prototype cluster Mott insulator Nb$_{3}$Cl$_8$ at ambient and high-pressure. We explain the finite but significantly reduced charge gap experimentally observed at $P=9.7$ GPa. We reveal a local symmetry breaking of the Nb$_{3}$ trimer under pressure, reducing its symmetry from $C_{3v}$ to $C_{s}$. This leads to a strong bandwidth enhancement and a lift of band degeneracy. Crucially, despite the significant change of band details, the cluster Mott insulating state is robust against local symmetry breaking. We show that the experimental observed gap under pressure is still a cluster Mott gap and its reduced value stems from both increased bandwidth and reduced Coulomb interactions under pressure. Our study provides the first systematic theoretical elucidation of how pressure-induced symmetry breaking dictates the cluster Mott state, establishing a robust foundation for understanding the intricate relationship between symmetry, local/non-local correlations, and emergent quantum states in correlated cluster compounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2004.13036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the theory for 2D-to-2D tunneling spectroscopy aided by magnetic or quantum-order excitations, and apply it to the description of van-der-Waals heterostructures of graphene/ultrathin $\alpha-{\rm RuCl}_3$. We study the behavior of both the differential conductance and the inelastic electron tunneling spectrum (IETS) of these heterostructures. The IETS in particular exhibits features, such as the gap of continuum spinon excitations and Majorana bound states, whose energies scale {\it cubicly} with the applied magnetic field. Such scaling, which exists for a relatively wide range of fields, is at odds with the linear one exhibited by conventional magnons and can be used to prove the existence of Kitaev quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Wehrl Entropy and Entanglement Complexity of Quantum Spin Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wehrl entropy of a quantum state is the Shannon entropy of its coherent-state distribution function, and remains non-zero even for pure states. We investigate the relationship between this entropy and the many-particle quantum entanglement, for $N$ spin-1/2 particles. Explicitly, we numerically calculate the Wehrl entropy of various $N$-particle ($2\leq N\leq 20$) entangled pure states, with respect to the SU(2)$^{\otimes N}$ coherent states. Our results show that for the large-$N$ ($N\gtrsim 10$) systems the Wehrl entropy of the highly chaotic entangled states (e.g., $2^{-N/2}\sum_{s_1,s_2,...,s_N=\uparrow,\downarrow}|s_1,s_2,...,s_N\rangle e^{-i\phi_{s_1,s_2,...,s_N}}$, with $\phi_{s_1,s_2,...,s_N}$ being random angles) are substantially larger than that of the very regular entangled states (e.g., the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state). Therefore, the Wehrl entropy can reflect the complexity of the quantum entanglement of many-body pure states, as proposed by A. Sugita (Jour. Phys. A 36, 9081 (2003)). In particular, the Wehrl entropy per particle (WEPP) can be used as a quantitative description of this entanglement complexity. Unlike other quantities used to evaluate this complexity (e.g., the degree of entanglement between a subsystem and the other particles), the WEPP does not necessitate the division of the total system into two subsystems. We further demonstrate that many-body pure entangled states can be classified into three types, based on the behavior of the WEPP in the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$: states approaching that of a maximally mixed state, those approaching completely separable pure states, and a third category lying between these two extremes. Each type exhibits fundamentally different entanglement complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10312v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising and 3-state Potts models. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensors with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</description>

      <title>Dissipation and Interaction-Controlled Non-Hermitian Skin Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effects (NHSEs) have recently been extensively studied at the single-particle level. When many-body interactions become dominant, novel non-Hermitian phenomena can emerge. In this work, we propose an experimentally accessible mechanism to induce and control NHSEs in interacting and reciprocal dissipative systems. We consider both 1D and 2D Bose-Hubbard lattices subject to staggered two-particle loss combined with synthetic magnetic flux and long-range hopping. When the two-particle loss is small, the bound eigenstates (e.g., doublons and triplons) are all localized at the same boundary due to the interplay between the magnetic flux and staggered two-particle loss. In contrast, for strong two-particle loss, the skin-mode localization direction of the bound particles is unexpectedly reversed. This reversal stems from the combined effect of the staggered two-particle loss, synthetic magnetic flux, and long-range hopping, through which virtual second-order and third-order hopping processes induce effectively strong nonreciprocal hopping of doublons. Our results open up a new avenue for exploring novel non-Hermitian phenomena in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Exceptional stationary state in a dephasing many-body open quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a dephasing many-body open quantum system that hosts, together with the infinite-temperature state, another additional stationary state. The latter is exceptional in many respects, as it is pure and retains memory of the initial condition, whereas any orthogonal state evolves towards the infinite-temperature state erasing any information on the initial state. We discuss the approach to stationarity of the model focusing in particular on the fate of interfaces between the two states; a simple classical model based on a membrane picture helps developing an effective hydrodynamic theory even if the dynamics does not feature any conserved quantity. The fact that the model reaches stationary properties on timescales that depend on the system size while the asymptotic decay rate is finite is duly highlighted. We point out the reasons for considering these exceptional stationary states as quantum many-body scars in the open system framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider multiband BCS superconductors that exhibit time-reversal symmetry and uniform pairing, and analyze their dynamic density and spin structure factors using linear-response theory within the mean-field BCS-BEC crossover framework at zero temperature. Our results for the multi-orbital Hubbard model satisfy the associated f-sum rules in several limits. In particular, in the strong-coupling limit, they coincide with those of a weakly-interacting Bose gas of Cooper pairs, where the low-energy collective Goldstone modes serve as Bogoliubov phonons. We further reveal that the quantum-geometric origin of the low-energy structure factors, along with related observables such as the superfluid-weight tensor and the effective-mass tensor of Cooper pairs, can be traced all the way back to the effective-mass theorem for Bloch bands in this limit. As an illustration, we investigate the pyrochlore-Hubbard model numerically and demonstrate that the Goldstone modes are the only relevant collective degrees of freedom in the flat-band regime.</description>
