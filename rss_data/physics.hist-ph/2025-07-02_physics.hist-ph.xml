      <title>The Metaphysics of Protection: Emergence, Agency, and the Ontological Status of Logical Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper argues that the practice of fault-tolerant quantum computation, specifically the mechanism of Quantum Error Correction (QEC), offers a profoundly new lens through which to examine foundational questions of ontology, emergence, and interpretation. We move beyond the standard debate on quantum speedup to ask: What is the nature of the entity--the logical qubit--that is being protected, and what does the active, goal-directed process of its protection reveal about physical reality? We argue that the logical qubit presents a unique case study in the metaphysics of identity, functioning as a quantifiable "Ship of Theseus" in Hilbert space. We introduce the concept of "engineered emergence" to describe the active, information-driven stabilization of the logical qubit, distinguishing it from passive forms of emergence and positioning it as a new category of causal structure. Finally, we demonstrate that the logical qubit serves as a powerful new testbed for major interpretations of quantum mechanics (including agent-centered, Many-Worlds, and Bohmian views), revealing novel strengths and challenges for each. We conclude that the technological imperative of fault-tolerance is not merely an engineering problem but a catalyst for deep philosophical insight, transforming abstract debates into concrete physical questions.</description>

      <title>Observable and Unobservable in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the connection between logical independence and the algebraic structure of quantum mechanics. Building on results by Brukner et al., it introduces the notion of \textit{onto-epistemic ignorance}: situations in which the truth of a proposition is not deducible due to an objective breakdown in the phenomenal chain that transmits information from a system A to a system B, rather than to any subjective lack of knowledge. It is shown that, under such conditions, the probabilities accessible to a real observer are necessarily conditioned by decidability and obey a non-commutative algebra, formally equivalent to the fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Can Machines Philosophize?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Turing test, we present a novel methodological framework to assess the extent to which a population of machines mirrors the philosophical views of a population of humans. The framework consists of three steps: (i) instructing machines to impersonate each human in the population, reflecting their backgrounds and beliefs, (ii) administering a questionnaire covering various philosophical positions to both humans and machines, and (iii) statistically analyzing the resulting responses. We apply this methodology to the debate on scientific realism, a long-standing philosophical inquiry exploring the relationship between science and reality. By considering the outcome of a survey of over 500 human participants, including both physicists and philosophers of science, we generate their machine personas using an artificial intelligence engine based on a large-language generative model. We reveal that the philosophical views of a population of machines are, on average, similar to those endorsed by a population of humans, irrespective of whether they are physicists or philosophers of science. As compared to humans, however, machines exhibit a weaker inclination toward scientific realism and a stronger coherence in their philosophical positions. Given the observed similarities between the populations of humans and machines, this methodological framework may offer unprecedented opportunities for advancing research in experimental philosophy by replacing human participants with their machine-impersonated counterparts, possibly mitigating the efficiency and reproducibility issues that affect survey-based empirical studies.</description>

      <title>A refinement of the Lorentz local field expression with impact on the Clausius-Mossotti and Lorentz-Lorenz models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 19th century Mossotti and Clausius developed an expression linking the electrical permittivity of a dielectric to the product of molecular polarizability and number density. Lorenz and Lorentz later extended this framework to encompass the refractive index of the dielectric. These classical expressions have proven remarkably successful in describing how permittivity and refractive index vary with number density, under the assumption that molecular polarizability remains relatively constant. While these models have stood the test of time and continue to offer valuable insights, their derivation relies on an approximation of the local electric field within a spherical cavity that represents the environment of a single molecule with its own field excluded. For regimes of higher number densities, such as those encountered in densified dielectrics, employing an exact solution for the local field becomes increasingly important. This refinement not only extends the applicability of the Clausius-Mossotti and Lorentz-Lorenz equations but also leads to more accurate estimates of molecular polarizability in general.</description>
