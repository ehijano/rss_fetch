      <title>A Critique of Chen's "The 2-MAXSAT Problem Can Be Solved in Polynomial Time"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine Yangjun Chen's technical report titled ``The 2-MAXSAT Problem Can Be Solved in Polynomial Time'' [Che23], which revises and expands upon their conference paper of the same name [Che22]. Chen's paper purports to build a polynomial-time algorithm for the ${\rm NP}$-complete problem 2-MAXSAT by converting a 2-CNF formula into a graph that is then searched. We show through multiple counterexamples that Chen's proposed algorithms contain flaws, and we find that the structures they create lack properly formalized definitions. Furthermore, we elaborate on how the author fails to prove the correctness of their algorithms and how they make overgeneralizations in their time analysis of their proposed solution. Due to these issues, we conclude that Chen's technical report [Che23] and conference paper [Che22] both fail to provide a proof that ${\rm P}={\rm NP}$.</description>

      <title>No Complete Problem for Constant-Cost Randomized Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the class of communication problems with public-coin randomized constant-cost protocols, called $BPP^0$, does not contain a complete problem. In other words, there is no randomized constant-cost problem $Q \in BPP^0$, such that all other problems $P \in BPP^0$ can be computed by a constant-cost deterministic protocol with access to an oracle for $Q$. We also show that the $k$-Hamming Distance problems form an infinite hierarchy within $BPP^0$. Previously, it was known only that Equality is not complete for $BPP^0$. We introduce a new technique, using Ramsey theory, that can prove lower bounds against arbitrary oracles in $BPP^0$, and more generally, we show that $k$-Hamming Distance matrices cannot be expressed as a Boolean combination of any constant number of matrices which forbid large Greater-Than subproblems.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Minimizing Energy Consumption of Partitioning DAG Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a graph partition problem where we are given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose vertices and arcs can be respectively regarded as tasks and dependencies among tasks. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total energy consumed for completing these tasks by assigning the tasks to k heterogeneous machines. We first show that the problem is NP-hard. Then, we present polynomial-time algorithms for two special cases where there are only two machines and where the input DAG is a directed path. Finally, we study a natural variant where there are only two machines with one of them being capable of executing a limited number of tasks. We show that this special case remains computationally hard.</description>

      <title>A simplified proof of the CSP Dichotomy Conjecture and XY-symmetric operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new theory of strong subalgebras and linear congruences that are defined globally. Using this theory we provide a new proof of the correctness of Zhuk's algorithm for all tractable CSPs on a finite domain, and therefore a new simplified proof of the CSP Dichotomy Conjecture. Additionally, using the new theory we prove that composing a weak near-unanimity operation of an odd arity $n$ we can derive an $n$-ary operation that is symmetric on all two-element sets. Thus, CSP over a constraint language $\Gamma$ on a finite domain is tractable if and only if there exist infinitely many polymorphisms of $\Gamma$ that are symmetric on all two-element sets.</description>

      <title>Pseudoentanglement Ain't Cheap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that any pseudoentangled state ensemble with a gap of $t$ bits of entropy requires $\Omega(t)$ non-Clifford gates to prepare. This bound is tight up to polylogarithmic factors if linear-time quantum-secure pseudorandom functions exist. Our result follows from a polynomial-time algorithm to estimate the entanglement entropy of a quantum state across any cut of qubits. When run on an $n$-qubit state that is stabilized by at least $2^{n-t}$ Pauli operators, our algorithm produces an estimate that is within an additive factor of $\frac{t}{2}$ bits of the true entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Random Reed-Solomon Codes are List Recoverable with Optimal List Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that Reed-Solomon (RS) codes with random evaluation points are list recoverable up to capacity with optimal output list size, for any input list size.
  Namely, given an input list size $\ell$, a designated rate $R$, and any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we show that a random RS code is list recoverable from $1-R-\varepsilon$ fraction of errors with output list size $L = O(\ell/\varepsilon)$, for field size $q=\exp(\ell,1/\varepsilon) \cdot n^2$. In particular, this shows that random RS codes are list recoverable beyond the ``list recovery Johnson bound''. Such a result was not even known for arbitrary random linear codes. Our technique follows and extends the recent line of work on list decoding of random RS codes, specifically the works of Brakensiek, Gopi, and Makam (STOC 2023), and of Guo and Zhang (FOCS 2023).</description>

      <title>Two prover perfect zero knowledge for MIP*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent MIP*=RE theorem of Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright, and Yuen shows that the complexity class MIP* of multiprover proof systems with entangled provers contains all recursively enumerable languages. Prior work of Grilo, Slofstra, and Yuen [FOCS '19] further shows (via a technique called simulatable codes) that every language in MIP* has a perfect zero knowledge (PZK) MIP* protocol. The MIP*=RE theorem uses two-prover one-round proof systems, and hence such systems are complete for MIP*. However, the construction in Grilo, Slofstra, and Yuen uses six provers, and there is no obvious way to get perfect zero knowledge with two provers via simulatable codes. This leads to a natural question: are there two-prover PZK-MIP* protocols for all of MIP*?
  In this paper, we show that every language in MIP* has a two-prover one-round PZK-MIP* protocol, answering the question in the affirmative. For the proof, we use a new method based on a key consequence of the MIP*=RE theorem, which is that every MIP* protocol can be turned into a family of boolean constraint system (BCS) nonlocal games. This makes it possible to work with MIP* protocols as boolean constraint systems, and in particular allows us to use a variant of a construction due to Dwork, Feige, Kilian, Naor, and Safra [Crypto '92] which gives a classical MIP protocol for 3SAT with perfect zero knowledge. To show quantum soundness of this classical construction, we develop a toolkit for analyzing quantum soundness of reductions between BCS games, which we expect to be useful more broadly. This toolkit also applies to commuting operator strategies, and our argument shows that every language with a commuting operator BCS protocol has a two prover PZK commuting operator protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considerable effort in experimental quantum computing is devoted to noisy intermediate scale quantum computers (NISQ computers). Understanding the effect of noise is important for various aspects of this endeavor including notable claims for achieving quantum supremacy and attempts to demonstrate quantum error correcting codes. In this paper we use Fourier methods combined with statistical analysis to study the effect of noise. In particular, we use Fourier analysis to refine the linear cross-entropy fidelity estimator. We use both analytical methods and simulations to study the effect of readout and gate errors, and we use our analysis to study the samples of Google's 2019 quantum supremacy experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.04539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of placing wildlife crossings, such as green bridges, over human-made obstacles to challenge habitat fragmentation. The main task herein is, given a graph describing habitats or routes of wildlife animals and possibilities of building green bridges, to find a low-cost placement of green bridges that connects the habitats. We develop different problem models for this task and study them from a computational complexity and parameterized algorithmics perspective.</description>

      <title>Relaxed Local Correctability from Local Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the first asymptotically good relaxed locally correctable codes with polylogarithmic query complexity, bringing the upper bound polynomially close to the lower bound of Gur and Lachish (SICOMP 2021). Our result follows from showing that a high-rate locally testable code can boost the block length of a smaller relaxed locally correctable code, while preserving the correcting radius and incurring only a modest additive cost in rate and query complexity. We use the locally testable code's tester to check if the amount of corruption in the input is low; if so, we can "zoom-in" to a suitable substring of the input and recurse on the smaller code's local corrector. Hence, iterating this operation with a suitable family of locally testable codes due to Dinur, Evra, Livne, Lubotzky, and Mozes (STOC 2022) yields asymptotically good codes with relaxed local correctability, arbitrarily large block length, and polylogarithmic query complexity.
  Our codes asymptotically inherit the rate and distance of any locally testable code used in the final invocation of the operation. Therefore, our framework also yields nonexplicit relaxed locally correctable codes with polylogarithmic query complexity that have rate and distance approaching the Gilbert-Varshamov bound.</description>

      <title>Improved Space Bounds for Subset Sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: More than 40 years ago, Schroeppel and Shamir presented an algorithm that solves the Subset Sum problem for $n$ integers in time $O^*(2^{0.5n})$ and space $O^*(2^{0.25n})$. The time upper bound remains unbeaten, but the space upper bound has been improved to $O^*(2^{0.249999n})$ in a recent breakthrough paper by Nederlof and W\k{e}grzycki (STOC 2021). Their algorithm is a clever combination of a number of previously known techniques with a new reduction and a new algorithm for the Orthogonal Vectors problem.
  In this paper, we improve the space bound by Nederlof and W\k{e}grzycki to $O^*(2^{0.246n})$ and also simplify their algorithm and its analysis. We achieve this by using an idea, due to Howgrave-Graham and Joux, of using a random prime number to filter the family of subsets. We incorporate it into the algorithm by Schroeppel and Shamir and then use this amalgam inside the representation technique. This allows us to reduce an instance of Subset Sum to a larger number of instances of weighted orthogonal vector.</description>

      <title>Structural Complexities of Matching Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study various novel complexity measures for two-sided matching mechanisms, applied to the two canonical strategyproof matching mechanisms, Deferred Acceptance (DA) and Top Trading Cycles (TTC). Our metrics are designed to capture the complexity of various structural (rather than computational) concerns, in particular ones of recent interest within economics. We consider a unified, flexible approach to formalizing our questions: Define a protocol or data structure performing some task, and bound the number of bits that it requires. Our main results apply this approach to four questions of general interest; for mechanisms matching applicants to institutions, our questions are:
  (1) How can one applicant affect the outcome matching?
  (2) How can one applicant affect another applicant's set of options?
  (3) How can the outcome matching be represented / communicated?
  (4) How can the outcome matching be verified?
  Holistically, our results show that TTC is more complex than DA, formalizing previous intuitions that DA has a simpler structure than TTC. For question (2), our result gives a new combinatorial characterization of which institutions are removed from each applicant's set of options when a new applicant is added in DA; this characterization may be of independent interest. For question (3), our result gives new tight lower bounds proving that the relationship between the matching and the priorities is more complex in TTC than in DA. We nonetheless showcase that this higher complexity of TTC is nuanced: By constructing new tight lower-bound instances and new verification protocols, we prove that DA and TTC are comparable in complexity under questions (1) and (4). This more precisely delineates the ways in which TTC is more complex than DA, and emphasizes that diverse considerations must factor into gauging the complexity of matching mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Realizing temporal graphs from fastest travel times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we initiate the study of the temporal graph realization problem with respect to the fastest path durations among its vertices, while we focus on periodic temporal graphs. Given an $n \times n$ matrix $D$ and a $\Delta \in \mathbb{N}$, the goal is to construct a $\Delta$-periodic temporal graph with $n$ vertices such that the duration of a fastest path from $v_i$ to $v_j$ is equal to $D_{i,j}$, or to decide that such a temporal graph does not exist. The variations of the problem on static graphs have been well studied and understood since the 1960's (e.g. [Erd\H{o}s and Gallai, 1960], [Hakimi and Yau, 1965]).
  As it turns out, the periodic temporal graph realization problem has a very different computational complexity behavior than its static (i.e. non-temporal) counterpart. First, we show that the problem is NP-hard in general, but polynomial-time solvable if the so-called underlying graph is a tree. Building upon those results, we investigate its parameterized computational complexity with respect to structural parameters of the underlying static graph which measure the ``tree-likeness''. We prove a tight classification between such parameters that allow fixed-parameter tractability (FPT) and those which imply W[1]-hardness. We show that our problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the feedback vertex number (and therefore also any smaller parameter such as treewidth, degeneracy, and cliquewidth) of the underlying graph, while we show that it is in FPT when parameterized by the feedback edge number (and therefore also any larger parameter such as maximum leaf number) of the underlying graph.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger as a Quantum Programmer: Estimating Entanglement via Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying entanglement is an important task by which the resourcefulness of a quantum state can be measured. Here we develop a quantum algorithm that tests for and quantifies the separability of a general bipartite state, by making use of the quantum steering effect, the latter originally discovered by Schr\"odinger. Our separability test consists of a distributed quantum computation involving two parties: a computationally limited client, who prepares a purification of the state of interest, and a computationally unbounded server, who tries to steer the reduced systems to a probabilistic ensemble of pure product states. To design a practical algorithm, we replace the role of the server by a combination of parameterized unitary circuits and classical optimization techniques to perform the necessary computation. The result is a variational quantum steering algorithm (VQSA), which is a modified separability test that is better suited for the capabilities of quantum computers available today. We then simulate our VQSA on noisy quantum simulators and find favorable convergence properties on the examples tested. We also develop semidefinite programs, executable on classical computers, that benchmark the results obtained from our VQSA. Our findings here thus provide a meaningful connection between steering, entanglement, quantum algorithms, and quantum computational complexity theory. They also demonstrate the value of a parameterized mid-circuit measurement in a VQSA and represent a first-of-its-kind application for a distributed VQA.</description>

      <title>Improved Stabilizer Estimation via Bell Difference Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of learning quantum states in various models with respect to the stabilizer formalism and obtain the following results:
  - We prove that $\Omega(n)$ $T$-gates are necessary for any Clifford+$T$ circuit to prepare computationally pseudorandom quantum states, an exponential improvement over the previously known bound. This bound is asymptotically tight if linear-time quantum-secure pseudorandom functions exist.
  - Given an $n$-qubit pure quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ that has fidelity at least $\tau$ with some stabilizer state, we give an algorithm that outputs a succinct description of a stabilizer state that witnesses fidelity at least $\tau - \varepsilon$. The algorithm uses $O(n/(\varepsilon^2\tau^4))$ samples and $\exp\left(O(n/\tau^4)\right) / \varepsilon^2$ time. In the regime of $\tau$ constant, this algorithm estimates stabilizer fidelity substantially faster than the na\"ive $\exp(O(n^2))$-time brute-force algorithm over all stabilizer states.
  - In the special case of $\tau &gt; \cos^2(\pi/8)$, we show that a modification of the above algorithm runs in polynomial time.
  - We exhibit a tolerant property testing algorithm for stabilizer states.
  The underlying algorithmic primitive in all of our results is Bell difference sampling. To prove our results, we establish and/or strengthen connections between Bell difference sampling, symplectic Fourier analysis, and graph theory.</description>

Abstract: The approximate stabilizer rank of a quantum state is the minimum number of terms in any approximate decomposition of that state into stabilizer states. Bravyi and Gosset showed that the approximate stabilizer rank of a so-called "magic" state like $|T\rangle^{\otimes n}$, up to polynomial factors, is an upper bound on the number of classical operations required to simulate an arbitrary quantum circuit with Clifford gates and $n$ number of $T$ gates. As a result, an exponential lower bound on this quantity seems inevitable. Despite this intuition, several attempts using various techniques could not lead to a better than a linear lower bound on the "exact" rank of ${|T\rangle}^{\otimes n}$, meaning the minimal size of a decomposition that exactly produces the state. For the "approximate" rank, which is more realistically related to the cost of simulating quantum circuits, no lower bound better than $\tilde \Omega(\sqrt n)$ has been known. In this paper, we improve the lower bound on the approximate rank to $\tilde \Omega (n^2)$ for a wide range of the approximation parameters. An immediate corollary of our result is the existence of polynomial time computable functions which require a super-linear number of terms in any decomposition into exponentials of quadratic forms over $\mathbb{F}_2$, resolving a question in [Wil18]. Our approach is based on a strong lower bound on the approximate rank of a quantum state sampled from the Haar measure, a step-by-step analysis of the approximate rank of a magic-state teleportation protocol to sample from the Haar measure, and a result about trading Clifford operations with $T$ gates by [LKS18].</description>
