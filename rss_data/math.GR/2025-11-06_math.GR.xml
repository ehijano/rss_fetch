      <title>Jensen's Functional Equation on Involution-Generated Groups: An ($\mathrm{SR}_2$) Criterion and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Jensen functional equations on a group $G$ with values in an abelian group $H$: \begin{align} \tag{J1}\label{eq:J1} f(xy)+f(xy^{-1})&amp;=2f(x)\qquad(\forall\,x,y\in G),\\ \tag{J2}\label{eq:J2} f(xy)+f(x^{-1}y)&amp;=2f(y)\qquad(\forall\,x,y\in G), \end{align} with the normalization $f(e)=0.$ Building on techniques for the symmetric groups $S_n$, we isolate a structural criterion on $G$ -- phrased purely in terms of involutions and square roots -- under which every solution to \eqref{eq:J1} must also satisfy \eqref{eq:J2} and is automatically a group homomorphism. Our new criterion, denoted $(\mathrm{SR}_2)$, implies that $S_1(G,H) = S_{1,2}(G,H) = \mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$, applies to many reflection--generated groups and, in particular, recovers the full solution on $S_n.$ Furthermore, we give a transparent description of the solution space in terms of the abelianization $G/[G,G],$ and we treat dihedral groups $D_m$ in detail, separating the cases $m$ odd and even. The approach is independent of division by 2 in $H$ and complements the classical complex-valued theory that reduces \eqref{eq:J1} to functions on $G/[G,[G,G]].$</description>

      <title>A note on co-Hopfian groups and rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ and $n$ be positive integers. Assume additionally that $p\neq 3$ is a prime and that $n&gt;2$. Let $R$ be a field of characteristic $p$. A very special consequence of a result of Bunina and Kunyavskii (2023, arXiv:2308.10076) is that $SL_{n}(R)$ is co-Hopfian as a group if and only if $R$ is co-Hopfian as a ring. In this paper, we prove that if $k$ is the algebraic closure of the $2$ element field, then $SL_{2}(k)$ is a co-Hopfian group. Since this $k$ is trivially seen to be co-Hopfian as a ring our result somewhat extends that of Bunina and Kunyavskii. We apply our result to prove that the class of groups satisfying Turner's Retract Theorem (called Turner groups here) is not closed under elementary equivalence thereby answering a question posed by the authors in (2017, Comm. Algebra).</description>

      <title>Commuting graphs and semigroup constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to see how commuting graphs interact with two semigroup constructions: the zero-union and the direct product. For both semigroup constructions, we investigate the diameter, clique number, girth, chromatic number and knit degree of their commuting graphs and, when possible, we exhibit the relationship between each one of these properties and the corresponding properties of the commuting graphs of the original semigroups.</description>

      <title>A partial order on the 240 packings of PG(3,2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been known that the most symmetrical solutions of Kirkman's Schoolgirl Problem can be constructed from the $240$ packings of the projective space $PG(3, 2)$, but it seems to have escaped notice that these packings have the structure of a partially ordered set. In this paper, we construct a shellable Bruhat-like graded partial order on the packings of $PG(3, 2)$ that refines the partial order on the product of four chains $[8]\times[5]\times[3]\times[2]$ and defines a Lehmer code on the packings. The partial order exists because the packings of $PG(3, 2)$ form a quasiparabolic set (in the sense of Rains--Vazirani) that is in bijective correspondence with a certain collection of maximal orthogonal subsets of the $E_8$ root system. The $E_8$ construction also induces transitive actions of the Weyl groups of type $D_n$ on the packings for $5 \leq n \leq 8$, and these actions are faithful for $n &lt; 8$. It is possible to define both the signed permutation action and the partial order using the combinatorics of labelled Fano planes.</description>

      <title>On metacyclic p-group codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the metacyclic p-group codes arising from finite semisimple group algebras. In [CM25], we studied group codes arising from metacyclic groups with order divisible by two distinct odd primes. In the current work, we focus on metacyclic p-group codes, as a result of which we are also able to extend the results of [CM25] for metacyclic groups with order divisible by any two primes, not necessarily odd or distinct. Consequently, existing results on group algebras of some important classes of groups, including dihedral and quaternion groups, have been extended. Additionally, we provide left codes for the undertaken group algebras. Finally, we construct non-central codes using units motivated by Bass and bicyclic units, which are inequivalent to any abelian group codes and yield best known parameters.</description>

      <title>Quasimorphisms of free products of racks and quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the second bounded cohomology of the free product of racks and quandles is infinite-dimensional as a real vector space. This is similar to the case of groups. As a corollary, we show that the second bounded cohomology of the free rack and the free quandle is infinite-dimensional. We also give another proof of this corollary using homogeneous group quasimorphisms.</description>

      <title>Detecting virtual homomorphisms via Banach metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of "Banach metrics" on finitely generated infinite groups. This extends the notion of a Cayley graph (as a metric space). Our motivation comes from trying to detect the existence of virtual homomorphisms into Z, the additive group of integers. We show that detection of such homomorphisms through metric functional boundaries of Cayley graphs isn't always possible. However, we prove that it is always possible to do so through a metric functional boundary of some Banach metric on the group.</description>

      <title>On Generalized Characters Whose Values on Nonidentity Elements are Sums of at Most Two Roots of Unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A character of a finite group having degree $n$ takes values which may be expressed as sums of $n$ or fewer roots of unity. In this note, we prove a result which describes the irreducible constituents of generalized characters on abelian groups whose values on nonidentity elements are expressible as sums of two or fewer roots of unity. In Section 4, we apply our main result to obtain information about the connectivity of prime graphs for groups admitting such characters.</description>

      <title>Profinite Direct Sums with Applications to Profinite Groups of Type $\Phi_R$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the "profinite direct sum" is a good notion of infinite direct sums for profinite modules having properties similar to direct sums of abstract modules. For example, the profinite direct sum of projective modules is projective, and there is a Mackey's Formula for profinite modules described using these sums. As an application, we prove that the class of profinite groups of type $\Phi_R$ is closed under subgroups.</description>

      <title>Critical Exponent Rigidity for $\Theta-$positive Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove for a $\Theta-$positive representation from a discrete subgroup $\Gamma\subset \mathsf{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$, the critical exponent for any $\alpha\in \Theta$ is not greater than one. When $\Gamma$ is geometrically finite, the equality holds if and only if $\Gamma$ is a lattice.</description>
