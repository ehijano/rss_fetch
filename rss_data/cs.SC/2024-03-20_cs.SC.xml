      <title>Gr{\"o}bner bases over polytopal affinoid algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyhedral affinoid algebras have been introduced by Einsiedler, Kapranov and Lind to connect rigid analytic geometry (analytic geometry over non-archimedean fields) and tropical geometry.In this article, we present a theory of Gr{\"o}bner bases for polytopal affinoid algebras that extends both Caruso et al.'s theory of Gr{\"o}bner bases on Tate algebras and Pauer et al.'s theory of Gr{\"o}bner bases on Laurent polynomials.We provide effective algorithms to compute Gr{\"o}bner bases for both ideals of Laurent polynomials and ideals in polytopal affinoid algebras. Experiments with a Sagemath implementation are provided.</description>

      <title>OSVAuto: semi-automatic verifier for functional specifications of operating systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and implementation of a tool for semi-automatic verification of functional specifications of operating system modules. Such verification tasks are traditionally done in interactive theorem provers, where the functionalities of the module are specified at abstract and concrete levels using data such as structures, algebraic datatypes, arrays, maps and so on. In this work, we provide encodings to SMT for these commonly occurring data types. This allows verification conditions to be reduced into a form suitable for SMT solvers. The use of SMT solvers combined with a tactic language allows semi-automatic verification of the specification. We apply the tool to verify functional specification for key parts of the uC-OS/II operating system, based on earlier work giving full verification of the system in Coq. We demonstrate a large reduction in the amount of human effort due to increased level of automation.</description>

      <title>Self-Attention Based Semantic Decomposition in Vector Symbolic Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) have emerged as a novel framework for enabling interpretable machine learning algorithms equipped with the ability to reason and explain their decision processes. The basic idea is to represent discrete information through high dimensional random vectors. Complex data structures can be built up with operations over vectors such as the "binding" operation involving element-wise vector multiplication, which associates data together. The reverse task of decomposing the associated elements is a combinatorially hard task, with an exponentially large search space. The main algorithm for performing this search is the resonator network, inspired by Hopfield network-based memory search operations.
  In this work, we introduce a new variant of the resonator network, based on self-attention based update rules in the iterative search problem. This update rule, based on the Hopfield network with log-sum-exp energy function and norm-bounded states, is shown to substantially improve the performance and rate of convergence. As a result, our algorithm enables a larger capacity for associative memory, enabling applications in many tasks like perception based pattern recognition, scene decomposition, and object reasoning. We substantiate our algorithm with a thorough evaluation and comparisons to baselines.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical NeuroSymbolic Approach for Action Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Action quality assessment (AQA) applies computer vision to quantitatively assess the performance or execution of a human action. Current AQA approaches are end-to-end neural models, which lack transparency and tend to be biased because they are trained on subjective human judgements as ground-truth. To address these issues, we introduce a neuro-symbolic paradigm for AQA, which uses neural networks to abstract interpretable symbols from video data and makes quality assessments by applying rules to those symbols. We take diving as the case study. We found that domain experts prefer our system and find it more informative than purely neural approaches to AQA in diving. Our system also achieves state-of-the-art action recognition and temporal segmentation, and automatically generates a detailed report that breaks the dive down into its elements and provides objective scoring with visual evidence. As verified by a group of domain experts, this report may be used to assist judges in scoring, help train judges, and provide feedback to divers. We will open-source all of our annotated training data and code for ease of reproducibility.</description>
