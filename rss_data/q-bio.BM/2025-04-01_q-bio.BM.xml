      <title>GPx4 is bound to peroxidized membranes by a hydrophobic anchor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23341v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroptosis is a form of cell death discovered in recent years, induced by excessive peroxidation of phospholipids. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) is an intracellular enzyme that can repair the peroxidized phospholipids on membranes, thus regulating ferroptosis. By combining multiscale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimental assays, we investigate the binding mechanisms of GPx4 on membranes. Using coarse-grained MD simulations, we found that L130 and its adjacent residues on GPx4 can form a stable and unique binding interface with PE/PS-rich and peroxidized membranes. Subsequent all-atom MD simulations verified the stability of the binding interface. The critical residue on the interface, L130, was inserted deeply into the membrane as a hydrophobic anchor and guided the reaction center toward the membrane surface. Enzyme activity assays and in vitro cell experiments showed that mutations of L130 resulted in weaker activities of the enzyme, probably caused by non-functional binding modes of GPx4 on membranes, as revealed by in silico simulations. This study highlights the crucial role of the hydrophobic residue, L130, in the proper anchoring of GPx4 on membranes, the first step of its membrane-repairing function.</description>

      <title>Addressing Model Overcomplexity in Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction With Molecular Fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is crucial for pharmaceutical research and clinical safety. Recent deep learning models often suffer from high computational costs and limited generalization across datasets. In this study, we investigate a simpler yet effective approach using molecular representations such as Morgan fingerprints (MFPS), graph-based embeddings from graph convolutional networks (GCNs), and transformer-derived embeddings from MoLFormer integrated into a straightforward neural network. We benchmark our implementation on DrugBank DDI splits and a drug-drug affinity (DDA) dataset from the Food and Drug Administration. MFPS along with MoLFormer and GCN representations achieve competitive performance across tasks, even in the more challenging leak-proof split, highlighting the sufficiency of simple molecular representations. Moreover, we are able to identify key molecular motifs and structural patterns relevant to drug interactions via gradient-based analyses using the representations under study. Despite these results, dataset limitations such as insufficient chemical diversity, limited dataset size, and inconsistent labeling impact robust evaluation and challenge the need for more complex approaches. Our work provides a meaningful baseline and emphasizes the need for better dataset curation and progressive complexity scaling.</description>

      <title>Solvation enhances folding cooperativity and the topology dependence of folding rates in a lattice protein model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aqueous solvent profoundly influences protein folding, yet its effects are relatively poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the impact of solvation on the folding of lattice proteins by using Monte Carlo simulations. The proteins are modelled as self-avoiding 27-mer chains on a cubic lattice, with compact native states and structure-based G\=o potentials. Each residue that makes no contacts with other residues in a given protein conformation is assigned a solvation energy {\epsilon}_s , representing its full exposure to the solvent. We find that a negative {\epsilon}_s , indicating a favorable solvation, increases the cooperativity of the folding transition by lowering the free energy of the unfolded state, increasing the folding free energy barrier, and narrowing the folding routes. This favorable solvation also significantly improves the correlation between folding rates and the native topology, measured by the relative contact order. Our results suggest that G\=o model may overestimate the importance of native interactions and a solvation potential countering the native bias can play a significant role. The solvation energy in our model can be related to the polar interaction between water and peptide groups in the protein backbone. It is therefore suggested that the solvation of peptide groups may significantly contribute to the exceptional folding cooperativity and the pronounced topology-dependence of folding rates observed in two-state proteins.</description>

      <title>Persistent Sheaf Laplacian Analysis of Protein Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein flexibility, measured by the B-factor or Debye-Waller factor, is essential for protein functions such as structural support, enzyme activity, cellular communication, and molecular transport. Theoretical analysis and prediction of protein flexibility are crucial for protein design, engineering, and drug discovery. In this work, we introduce the persistent sheaf Laplacian (PSL), an effective tool in topological data analysis, to model and analyze protein flexibility. By representing the local topology and geometry of protein atoms through the multiscale harmonic and non-harmonic spectra of PSLs, the proposed model effectively captures protein flexibility and provides accurate, robust predictions of protein B-factors. Our PSL model demonstrates an increase in accuracy of 32% compared to the classical Gaussian network model (GNM) in predicting B-factors for a dataset of 364 proteins. Additionally, we construct a blind machine learning prediction method utilizing global and local protein features. Extensive computations and comparisons validate the effectiveness of the proposed PSL model for B-factor predictions.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning of Proteins with Local and Global Regions of Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although machine learning has transformed protein structure prediction of folded protein ground states with remarkable accuracy, intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (IDPs/IDRs) are defined by diverse and dynamical structural ensembles that are predicted with low confidence by algorithms such as AlphaFold. We present a new machine learning method, IDPForge (Intrinsically Disordered Protein, FOlded and disordered Region GEnerator), that exploits a transformer protein language diffusion model to create all-atom IDP ensembles and IDR disordered ensembles that maintains the folded domains. IDPForge does not require sequence-specific training, back transformations from coarse-grained representations, nor ensemble reweighting, as in general the created IDP/IDR conformational ensembles show good agreement with solution experimental data, and options for biasing with experimental restraints are provided if desired. We envision that IDPForge with these diverse capabilities will facilitate integrative and structural studies for proteins that contain intrinsic disorder.</description>

      <title>PharMolixFM: All-Atom Foundation Models for Molecular Modeling and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural biology relies on accurate three-dimensional biomolecular structures to advance our understanding of biological functions, disease mechanisms, and therapeutics. While recent advances in deep learning have enabled the development of all-atom foundation models for molecular modeling and generation, existing approaches face challenges in generalization due to the multi-modal nature of atomic data and the lack of comprehensive analysis of training and sampling strategies. To address these limitations, we propose PharMolixFM, a unified framework for constructing all-atom foundation models based on multi-modal generative techniques. Our framework includes three variants using state-of-the-art multi-modal generative models. By formulating molecular tasks as a generalized denoising process with task-specific priors, PharMolixFM achieves robust performance across various structural biology applications. Experimental results demonstrate that PharMolixFM-Diff achieves competitive prediction accuracy in protein-small-molecule docking (83.9% vs. 90.2% RMSD &lt; 2{\AA}, given pocket) with significantly improved inference speed. Moreover, we explore the empirical inference scaling law by introducing more sampling repeats or steps. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/PharMolix/OpenBioMed.</description>

      <title>PharmAgents: Building a Virtual Pharma with Large Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of novel small molecule drugs remains a critical scientific challenge with far-reaching implications for treating diseases and advancing human health. Traditional drug development--especially for small molecule therapeutics--is a highly complex, resource-intensive, and time-consuming process that requires multidisciplinary collaboration. Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly the rise of large language models (LLMs), present a transformative opportunity to streamline and accelerate this process. In this paper, we introduce PharmAgents, a virtual pharmaceutical ecosystem driven by LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. PharmAgents simulates the full drug discovery workflow--from target discovery to preclinical evaluation--by integrating explainable, LLM-driven agents equipped with specialized machine learning models and computational tools. Through structured knowledge exchange and automated optimization, PharmAgents identifies potential therapeutic targets, discovers promising lead compounds, enhances binding affinity and key molecular properties, and performs in silico analyses of toxicity and synthetic feasibility. Additionally, the system supports interpretability, agent interaction, and self-evolvement, enabling it to refine future drug designs based on prior experience. By showcasing the potential of LLM-powered multi-agent systems in drug discovery, this work establishes a new paradigm for autonomous, explainable, and scalable pharmaceutical research, with future extensions toward comprehensive drug lifecycle management.</description>
