      <title>Nap-induced modulations of tinnitus -a cross-sectional database analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of naps on tinnitus was systematically assessed by exploring the frequency, clinical and demographic characteristics of this phenomenon. 9,724 data from two different tinnitus databases (Tinnitus Hub: $n = 6115$; Tinnitus Research Initiative (TRI): $n = 3627$) were included. After separate analysis of the databases, these results were then compared with each other. In the Tinnitus Hub survey database, a total of 31.1% reported an influence on tinnitus by taking a nap (26.9% in the TRI database), with much more frequent worsening after a nap than improvement (23.0% a little or a lot worse; TRI: 17.7% worse; 8.1% a little or a lot better; TRI: 9.2% better). The influence of napping on tinnitus was associated in both databases with other clinical features, such as the dependence of tinnitus on night quality, stress and somatosensory maneuvers. The present study confirms the clinical observation that more tinnitus sufferers report worsening after a nap than tinnitus sufferers reporting an improvement. It was consistently shown that tinnitus sufferers reporting nap-induced modulation of tinnitus also report more frequently an influence of night sleep on their tinnitus. Further clinical and polysomnographic research is warranted to better understand the interaction between sleep and tinnitus.</description>

      <title>Data Integration with Fusion Searchlight: Classifying Brain States from Resting-state fMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous neural activity observed in resting-state fMRI is characterized by complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Different measures related to local and global brain connectivity and fluctuations in low-frequency amplitudes can quantify individual aspects of these neural dynamics. Even though such measures are derived from the same functional signals, they are often evaluated separately, neglecting their interrelations and potentially reducing the analysis sensitivity. In our study, we present a fusion searchlight (FuSL) framework to combine the complementary information contained in different resting-state fMRI metrics and demonstrate how this can improve the decoding of brain states. Moreover, we show how explainable AI allows us to reconstruct the differential impact of each metric on the decoding, which additionally increases spatial specificity of searchlight analysis. In general, this framework can be adapted to combine information derived from different imaging modalities or experimental conditions, offering a versatile and interpretable tool for data fusion in neuroimaging.</description>

      <title>Dynamical mean-field theory for a highly heterogeneous neural population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale systems with inherent heterogeneity often exhibit complex dynamics that are crucial for their functional properties. However, understanding how such heterogeneity shapes these dynamics remains a significant challenge, particularly in systems with widely varying time scales. To address this, we extend Dynamical Mean Field Theory$\unicode{x2014}$a powerful framework for analyzing large-scale population dynamics$\unicode{x2014}$to systems with heterogeneous temporal properties. Using the population dynamics of a biological neural network as an example, we develop a theoretical framework that determines how inherent heterogeneity influences the critical transition point of the network. By introducing a model that incorporates graded-persistent activity$\unicode{x2014}$a property where certain neurons sustain activity over extended periods without external inputs$\unicode{x2014}$we show that neurons with extremely long timescales shift the system's transition point and expand its dynamical regime, enhancing its suitability for temporal information processing. Furthermore, we validate our framework by applying it to a system with heterogeneous adaptation, demonstrating that such heterogeneity can reduce the dynamical regime, contrary to previous simplified approximations. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for understanding the functional advantages of diversity in complex systems and offer insights applicable to a wide range of heterogeneous networks beyond neural populations.</description>

      <title>RAID-Database: human Responses to Affine Image Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image quality databases are used to train models for predicting subjective human perception. However, most existing databases focus on distortions commonly found in digital media and not in natural conditions. Affine transformations are particularly relevant to study, as they are among the most commonly encountered by human observers in everyday life. This Data Descriptor presents a set of human responses to suprathreshold affine image transforms (rotation, translation, scaling) and Gaussian noise as convenient reference to compare with previously existing image quality databases. The responses were measured using well established psychophysics: the Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling method. The set contains responses to 864 distorted images. The experiments involved 105 observers and more than 20000 comparisons of quadruples of images. The quality of the dataset is ensured because (a) it reproduces the classical Pi\'eron's law, (b) it reproduces classical absolute detection thresholds, and (c) it is consistent with conventional image quality databases but improves them according to Group-MAD experiments.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Quantum Superposition to Infer the Dynamic Behavior of a Spatial-Temporal Neural Network Signaling Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exploration of new problem classes for quantum computation is an active area of research. In this paper, we introduce and solve a novel problem class related to dynamics on large-scale networks relevant to neurobiology and machine learning. Specifically, we ask if a network can sustain inherent dynamic activity beyond some arbitrary observation time or if the activity ceases through quiescence or saturation via an 'epileptic'-like state. We show that this class of problems can be formulated and structured to take advantage of quantum superposition and solved efficiently using the Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover quantum algorithms. To do so, we extend their functionality to address the unique requirements of how input (sub)sets into the algorithms must be mathematically structured while simultaneously constructing the inputs so that measurement outputs can be interpreted as meaningful properties of the network dynamics. This, in turn, allows us to answer the question we pose.</description>
