      <title>How soap bubbles change shape while maintaining a fixed volume of air?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine experiments and theoretical derivations to study the evolution of a stretched soap bubble and compare it with an open film to highlight the effect of volume conservation. We identify a critical length for both surfaces, beyond which a bottleneck develops in the middle and begins to shrink irreversibly, ultimately pinching off into multiple compartments. Before leaving the equilibrium regime, surface energy minimization governs the shape, which can be addressed theoretically via the variational method. In contrast to open films, soap bubble volume conservation introduces a Lagrange multiplier, analogous to a pressure difference, mediating long-range shape evolution. By examining how boundary constraints influence deformation, we contrast the bubble's convex-to-concave transition with the behavior of soap films under similar conditions. Our analysis of equilibrium and breakup regimes reveals critical differences between bubble and film stability profiles, shedding light on universal behaviors in non-equilibrium fluid mechanics, with implications for biological and material sciences.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced three-dimensional (3D) tracking methods are essential for studying particle dynamics across a wide range of complex systems, including multiphase flows, environmental and atmospheric sciences, colloidal science, biological and medical research, and industrial manufacturing processes. This review provides a comprehensive summary of 3D particle tracking and flow diagnostics using Digital Holography (DH). We begin by introducing the principles of DH, accompanied by a detailed discussion on numerical reconstruction. The review then explores various hardware setups used in DH, including inline, off-axis, and dual or multiple-view configurations, outlining their advantages and limitations. We also delve into different hologram processing methods, categorized into traditional multi-step, inverse, and machine learning-based approaches, providing in-depth insights into their applications for 3D particle tracking and flow diagnostics across multiple studies. The review concludes with a discussion on future prospects, emphasizing the significant role of machine learning in enabling accurate DH-based particle tracking and flow diagnostic techniques across diverse fields, such as manufacturing, environmental monitoring, and biological sciences.</description>

      <title>Multifluid simulation of shear-induced migration in pressure-driven suspension flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study simulates shear-induced migration (SIM) in semi-dilute pressure-driven Stokes suspension flows using a multi-fluid (MF) model. Building on analysis from a companion paper (Harvie, 2024), the specific formulation uses volume-averaged phase stresses that are linked to the binary hydrodynamic interaction of spheres and suspension microstructure as represented by an anisotropic, piece-wise constant pair-distribution function (PDF). The form of the PDF is chosen to capture observations regarding the microstructure in sheared suspensions of rough particles, as reported in the literature. Specifically, a hydrodynamic roughness value is used to represent the width of the anisotropic region, and within this region the concentration of particles is higher in the compression zone than expansion zone. By numerically evaluating the hydrodynamic particle interactions and calculating the various shear and normal viscosities, the stress closure is incorporated into Harvie's volume-averaged MF framework, referred to as the MF-roughness model. Using multi-dimensional simulations the roughness and compression zone PDF concentration are then globally optimised to reproduce benchmark solid and velocity distributions reported in the literature for a variety of semi-dilute monodisperse suspension flows occurring within rectangular channels. For comparison, two different versions of the phenomenological stress closure by Morris and Boulay (1999) are additionally proposed as fully tensorial frame-invariant alternatives to the MF-roughness model. Referred to as MF-MB99-A and MF-MB99-B, these models use alternative assumptions for partitioning of the mixture normal stress between the solid and fluid phases. The optimised solid and velocity distributions from all three stress closures are similar and correlate well with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Multi-range fractional model for convective atmospheric surface-layer turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a multi-range fractional (MRF) model to capture the turbulent spectrum consisting of multiple self-similar ranges impacted by multiple effects. The MRF model is validated using long-term observational atmospheric surface layer data from Qingtu lake with extreme Reynolds numbers up to Re$_\tau\sim O(10^6)$. The spectral exponent in each range and the transition scales between different ranges are solo parameters in the MRF model and are identified for streamwise velocity, vertical velocity, and temperature, and they update the quantifications in the multi-point Monin-Obukhov theory. Therefore, based on the MRF model and considering the consistency between the turbulent spectrum and variance, we propose an expression for the vertical dependence of the streamwise velocity variance that is inadequately described by the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. The MRF model provides a new method to analyze and quantify turbulent data, and as a time-series model, it enables the generation of synthetic turbulent data.</description>

      <title>A CNN-based particle tracking method for large-scale fluid simulations with Lagrangian-Eulerian approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel particle tracking method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to improve the efficiency of Lagrangian-Eulerian (L-E) approaches. Relying on the successive neighbor search (SNS) method for particle tracking, the L-E approaches face increasing computational and parallel overhead as simulations grow in scale. This issue arises primarily because the SNS method requires lengthy tracking paths, which incur intensive inter-processor communications. The proposed method, termed the CNN-SNS method, addresses this issue by approximating the spatial mapping between reference frames through the CNN. Initiating the SNS method from CNN predictions shortens the tracking paths without compromising accuracy and consequently achieves superior parallel scalability. Numerical tests demonstrate that the CNN-SNS method exhibits increasing computational advantages over the SNS method in large-scale, high-velocity flow fields. As the resolution and parallelization scale up, the CNN-SNS method achieves reductions of 95.8% in tracking path length and 97.0% in computational time.</description>

      <title>Does Yakhot's growth law for turbulent burning velocity hold?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using formal renormalization theory, Yakhot derived in ([28], 1988) an $O\left(\frac{A}{\sqrt{\log A}}\right)$ growth law of the turbulent flame speed with respect to large flow intensity $A$ based on the inviscid G-equation. Although this growth law is widely cited in combustion literature, there has been no rigorous mathematical discussion to date about its validity. As a first step towards unveiling the mystery, we prove that there is no intermediate growth law between $O\left(\frac{A}{\log A}\right)$ and $O(A)$ for two dimensional incompressible Lipschitz continuous periodic flows with bounded swirl sizes. In particular, we do not assume the non-degeneracy of critical points. Additionally, other examples of flows with lower regularity, Lagrangian chaos, and related phenomena are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Quasi-Integrable Equations from traveling-wave data using the Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are used to study vortex solutions in the 2+1 dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations. These solutions include the regularized long-wave (RLW) equation and the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) equation, which are toy models of the geostrophic shallow water model in the planetary atmosphere. PINNs successfully solve these equations in the forward process and the solutions are obtained using the mesh-free approach and automatic differentiation while accounting for conservation laws. In the inverse process, the proper equations can be successfully derived from a given training data. Since these equations have a lot in common, there are situations when substantial misidentification arises during the inverse analysis. We consider PINNs with conservation laws (referred to as cPINNs), deformations of the initial profiles, and a friction approach that provides excellent discrimination of the equations to improve the identification's resolution.</description>

      <title>A Pioneering Neural Network Method for Efficient and Robust Fuel Sloshing Simulation in Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating fuel sloshing within aircraft tanks during flight is crucial for aircraft safety research. Traditional methods based on Navier-Stokes equations are computationally expensive. In this paper, we treat fluid motion as point cloud transformation and propose the first neural network method specifically designed for simulating fuel sloshing in aircraft. This model is also the deep learning model that is the first to be capable of stably modeling fluid particle dynamics in such complex scenarios. Our triangle feature fusion design achieves an optimal balance among fluid dynamics modeling, momentum conservation constraints, and global stability control. Additionally, we constructed the Fueltank dataset, the first dataset for aircraft fuel surface sloshing. It comprises 320,000 frames across four typical tank types and covers a wide range of flight maneuvers, including multi-directional rotations. We conducted comprehensive experiments on both our dataset and the take-off scenario of the aircraft. Compared to existing neural network-based fluid simulation algorithms, we significantly enhanced accuracy while maintaining high computational speed. Compared to traditional SPH methods, our speed improved approximately 10 times. Furthermore, compared to traditional fluid simulation software such as Flow3D, our computation speed increased by more than 300 times.</description>
