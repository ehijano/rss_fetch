      <title>Reinforcement Learning in High-frequency Market Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a new and comprehensive theoretical analysis for the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in high-frequency market making. We bridge the modern RL theory and the continuous-time statistical models in high-frequency financial economics. Different with most existing literature on methodological research about developing various RL methods for market making problem, our work is a pilot to provide the theoretical analysis. We target the effects of sampling frequency, and find an interesting tradeoff between error and complexity of RL algorithm when tweaking the values of the time increment $\Delta$ $-$ as $\Delta$ becomes smaller, the error will be smaller but the complexity will be larger. We also study the two-player case under the general-sum game framework and establish the convergence of Nash equilibrium to the continuous-time game equilibrium as $\Delta\rightarrow0$. The Nash Q-learning algorithm, which is an online multi-agent RL method, is applied to solve the equilibrium. Our theories are not only useful for practitioners to choose the sampling frequency, but also very general and applicable to other high-frequency financial decision making problems, e.g., optimal executions, as long as the time-discretization of a continuous-time markov decision process is adopted. Monte Carlo simulation evidence support all of our theories.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Options Trading: An End-To-End Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to options trading strategies using a highly scalable and data-driven machine learning algorithm. In contrast to traditional approaches that often require specifications of underlying market dynamics or assumptions on an option pricing model, our models depart fundamentally from the need for these prerequisites, directly learning non-trivial mappings from market data to optimal trading signals. Backtesting on more than a decade of option contracts for equities listed on the S&amp;P 100, we demonstrate that deep learning models trained according to our end-to-end approach exhibit significant improvements in risk-adjusted performance over existing rules-based trading strategies. We find that incorporating turnover regularization into the models leads to further performance enhancements at prohibitively high levels of transaction costs.</description>
