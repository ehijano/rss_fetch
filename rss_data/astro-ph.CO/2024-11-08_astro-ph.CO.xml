      <title>J1721+8842: The first Einstein zig-zag lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of the first example of an Einstein zig-zag lens, an extremely rare lensing configuration. In this system, J1721+8842, six images of the same background quasar are formed by two intervening galaxies, one at redshift $z_1 = 0.184$ and a second one at $z_2 = 1.885$. Two out of the six multiple images are deflected in opposite directions as they pass the first lens galaxy on one side, and the second on the other side -- the optical paths forming zig-zags between the two deflectors. In this letter, we demonstrate that J1721+8842, previously thought to be a lensed dual quasar, is in fact a compound lens with the more distant lens galaxy also being distorted as an arc by the foreground galaxy. Evidence supporting this unusual lensing scenario includes: 1- identical light curves in all six lensed quasar images obtained from two years of monitoring at the Nordic Optical Telescope; 2- detection of the additional deflector at redshift $z_2 = 1.885$ in JWST/NIRSpec IFU data; and 3- a multiple-plane lens model reproducing the observed image positions. This unique configuration offers the opportunity to combine two major lensing cosmological probes: time-delay cosmography and dual source-plane lensing since J1721+8842 features multiple lensed sources forming two distinct Einstein radii of different sizes, one of which being a variable quasar. We expect tight constraints on the Hubble constant and the equation of state of dark energy by combining these two probes on the same system. The $z_2 = 1.885$ deflector, a quiescent galaxy, is also the highest-redshift strong galaxy-scale lens with a spectroscopic redshift measurement.</description>

      <title>Fast, Accurate and Perturbative Forward Modeling of Galaxy Clustering Part II: Redshift Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forward modeling the galaxy density within the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFT of LSS) enables field-level analyses that are robust to theoretical uncertainties. At the same time, they can maximize the constraining power from galaxy clustering on the scales amenable to perturbation theory. In order to apply the method to galaxy surveys, the forward model must account for the full observational complexity of the data. In this context, a major challenge is the inclusion of redshift space distortions (RSDs) from the peculiar motion of galaxies. Here, we present improvements in the efficiency and accuracy of the RSD modeling in the perturbative LEFTfield forward model. We perform a detailed quantification of the perturbative and numerical error for the prediction of momentum, velocity and the redshift-space matter density. Further, we test the recovery of cosmological parameters at the field level, namely the growth rate $f$, from simulated halos in redshift space. For a rigorous test and to scan through a wide range of analysis choices, we fix the linear (initial) density field to the known ground truth but marginalize over all unknown bias coefficients and noise amplitudes. With a third-order model for gravity and bias, our results yield $&lt;1\,\%$ statistical and $&lt;1.5\,\%$ systematic error. The computational cost of the redshift-space forward model is only $\sim 1.5$ times of the rest frame equivalent, enabling future field-level inference that simultaneously targets cosmological parameters and the initial matter distribution.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the single-component thermal dust emission model in CMB experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that multiple Galactic thermal dust emission components may exist along the line of sight, but a single-component approximation is still widely used, since a full multi-component estimation requires a large number of frequency bands that are only available with future experiments. In light of this, we present a reliable, quantitative, and sensitive criterion to test the goodness of all kinds of dust emission estimations. This can not only give a definite answer to the quality of current single-component approximations; but also help determine preconditions of future multi-component estimations. Upon the former, previous works usually depend on a more complicated model to improve the single-component dust emission; however, our method is free from any additional model, and is sensitive enough to directly discover a substantial discrepancy between the Planck HFI data (100-857 GHz) and associated single-component dust emission estimations. This is the first time that the single-component estimation is ruled out by the data itself. For the latter, a similar procedure will be able to answer two important questions for estimating the complicated Galactic emissions: the number of necessary foreground components and their types.</description>

      <title>Fast Generation of Weak Lensing Maps with Analytical Point Transformation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear cosmological fields like galaxy density and lensing convergence can be approximately related to Gaussian fields via analytic point transforms. The lognormal transform (LN) has been widely used and is a simple example of a function that relates nonlinear fields to Gaussian fields. We consider more accurate General Point-Transformed Gaussian (GPTG) functions for such a mapping and apply them to convergence maps. We show that we can create maps that preserve the LN's ability to exactly match any desired power spectrum but go beyond LN by significantly improving the accuracy of the probability distribution function (PDF). With the aid of symbolic regression, we find a remarkably accurate GPTG function for convergence maps: its higher-order moments, scattering wavelet transform, Minkowski functionals, and peak counts match those of N-body simulations to the statistical uncertainty expected from tomographic lensing maps of the Rubin LSST 10 years survey. Our five-parameter function performs 2 to 5$\times$ better than the lognormal. We restrict our study to scales above about 7 arcmin; baryonic feedback alters the mass distribution on smaller scales. We demonstrate that the GPTG can robustly emulate variations in cosmological parameters due to the simplicity of the analytic transform. This opens up several possible applications, such as field-level inference, rapid covariance estimation, and other uses based on the generation of arbitrarily many maps with laptop-level computation capability.</description>

      <title>Conversations and Deliberations: Non-Standard Cosmological Epochs and Expansion Histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document summarizes the discussions which took place during the PITT-PACC Workshop entitled "Non-Standard Cosmological Epochs and Expansion Histories," held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Sept. 5-7, 2024. Much like the non-standard cosmological epochs that were the subject of these discussions, the format of this workshop was also non-standard. Rather than consisting of a series of talks from participants, with each person presenting their own work, this workshop was instead organized around free-form discussion blocks, with each centered on a different overall theme and guided by a different set of Discussion Leaders. This document is not intended to serve as a comprehensive review of these topics, but rather as an informal record of the discussions that took place during the workshop, in the hope that the content and free-flowing spirit of these discussions may inspire new ideas and research directions.</description>

      <title>Lattice simulations of axion-U(1) inflation: gravitational waves, magnetic fields, and black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study axion-U(1) inflation, focusing on the regime where the coupling between axions and gauge fields results in significant backreaction from the amplified gauge fields during inflation. These amplified gauge fields not only generate high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) but also induce spatial inhomogeneities in the axion field, which can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). Both GWs and PBHs serve as key probes for constraining the coupling strength between the axion and gauge fields. We find that, when backreaction is important during inflation, the constraints on the coupling strength due to GW overproduction are relaxed compared to previous studies, in which backreaction matters only after inflation. For PBH formation, understanding the probability density function (PDF) of axion field fluctuations is crucial. While earlier analytical studies assumed that these fluctuations followed a $\chi^2$-distribution, our results suggest that the PDF tends toward a Gaussian distribution in cases where gauge field backreaction is important, regardless whether during or after inflation. We also calculate the spectrum of the produced magnetic fields in this model and find that their strength is compatible with the observed lower limits.</description>

      <title>Dark energy constraints using gamma-ray burst correlations with DESI 2024 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even though the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) mission does not exclude a dynamical dark energy evolution, the concordance paradigm, i.e., the $\Lambda$CDM model, remains statistically favored, as it depends on the fewest number of free parameters. In this respect, high redshift astrophysical sources, such as gamma-ray bursts, represent a formidable tool to model the form of dark energy, since they may provide a link between early and local redshift regimes. Hence, the use of these objects as possible distance indicators turns out to be essential to investigate the cosmological puzzle. To this end, we adopt two gamma-ray burst linear correlations, namely the $L_p-E_p$ and $L_0-E_p-T$ relations, to test the flat and non-flat $\Lambda$CDM, $\omega_0$CDM, and $\omega_0\omega_1$CDM cosmological models, i.e., those directly examined by the DESI collaboration. The inferred correlation coefficients and cosmological parameters are thus obtained by considering two independent Monte Carlo Markov chain analyses, the first considering the whole DESI data set and the second excluding a seemingly problematic data point placed at $z_{eff} = 0.51$. Using model selection criteria, the two above correlations do not show a preference on a precise cosmological model although, when the data point at $z_{eff}$ is included, the concordance paradigm appears to be the least favored among the tested cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Dark energy reconstructions combining BAO data with galaxy clusters and intermediate redshift catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological parameters and dark energy (DE) behavior are generally constrained assuming \textit{a priori} models. We work out a model-independent reconstruction to bound the key cosmological quantities and the DE evolution. Through the model-independent \textit{B\'ezier interpolation} method, we reconstruct the Hubble rate from the observational Hubble data and derive analytic expressions for the distances of galaxy clusters, type Ia supernovae, and uncorrelated baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) data. In view of the discrepancy between Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) BAO data, they are kept separate in two distinct analyses. Correlated BAO data are employed to break the baryonic--dark matter degeneracy. All these interpolations enable us to single out and reconstruct the DE behavior with the redshift $z$ in a totally model-independent way. In both analyses, with SDSS-BAO or DESI-BAO data sets, the constraints agree at $1$--$\sigma$ confidence level (CL) with the flat $\Lambda$CDM model. The Hubble constant tension appears solved in favor of the Planck satellite value. The reconstructed DE behavior exhibits deviations at small $z$ ($&gt;1$--$\sigma$ CL), but agrees ($&lt;1$--$\sigma$ CL) with the cosmological constant paradigm at larger $z$. Our method hints for a slowly evolving DE, consistent with a cosmological constant at early times.</description>

      <title>No rungs attached: A distance-ladder free determination of the Hubble constant through type II supernova spectral modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing discrepancy in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) estimates obtained through local distance ladder methods and early universe observations poses a significant challenge to the $\Lambda$CDM model, suggesting potential new physics. Type II supernovae (SNe II) offer a promising technique for determining $H_0$ in the local universe independently of the traditional distance ladder approach, opening up a complimentary path for testing this discrepancy. We aim to provide the first $H_0$ estimate using the tailored expanding photosphere method (EPM) applied to SNe II, made possible by recent advancements in spectral modelling that enhance its precision and efficiency. Our tailored EPM measurement utilizes a spectral emulator to interpolate between radiative transfer models calculated with TARDIS, allowing us to fit supernova spectra efficiently and derive self-consistent values for luminosity-related parameters. We apply the method on public data for ten SNe II at redshifts between 0.01 and 0.04. Our analysis demonstrates that the tailored EPM allows for $H_0$ measurements with precision comparable to the most competitive established techniques, even when applied to literature data not designed for cosmological applications. We find an independent $H_0$ value of $74.9\pm1.9$ (stat) km/s/Mpc, which is consistent with most current local measurements. Considering dominant sources of systematic effects, we conclude that our systematic uncertainty is comparable to or less than the current statistical uncertainty. This proof-of-principle study highlights the potential of the tailored EPM as a robust and precise tool for investigating the Hubble tension independently of the local distance ladder. Observations of SNe II tailored to $H_0$ estimation can make this an even more powerful tool by improving the precision and by allowing us to better understand and control systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Extracting Axion String Network Parameters from Simulated CMB Birefringence Maps using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles may form a network of cosmic strings in the Universe today that can rotate the plane of polarization of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. Future CMB observations with improved sensitivity might detect this axion-string-induced birefringence effect, thereby revealing an as-yet unseen constituent of the Universe and offering a new probe of particles and forces that are beyond the Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics. In this work, we explore how spherical convolutional neural networks (SCNNs) may be used to extract information about the axion string network from simulated birefringence maps. We construct a pipeline to simulate the anisotropic birefringence that would arise from an axion string network, and we train SCNNs to estimate three parameters related to the cosmic string length, the cosmic string abundance, and the axion-photon coupling. Our results demonstrate that neural networks are able to extract information from a birefringence map that is inaccessible with two-point statistics alone (i.e., the angular power spectrum). We also assess the impact of noise on the accuracy of our SCNN estimators, demonstrating that noise at the level anticipated for Stage IV (CMB-S4) measurements would significantly bias parameter estimation for SCNNs trained on noiseless simulated data, and necessitate modeling the noise in the training data.</description>

      <title>Superradiant growth anomaly magnification in evolution of vector bosonic condensates bounded by a Kerr black hole with near-horizon reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05108v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight vector particles can form evolving condensates around a Kerr black hole (BH) due to superradiant instability. We study the effect of near-horizon reflection on the evolution of this system: by matching three pieces of asymptotic expansions of the Proca equation in Kerr metric and considering the leading order in the electric mode, we present explicit analytical expressions for the corrected spectrum and the superradiant instability rates. Particularly, in high-spin BH cases, we identify an anomalous situation where the superadiance rate is temporarily increased by the reflection parameter $\mathcal{R}$, which also occurs in the scalar scenario, but is largely magnified in vector condensates due to a faster growth rate in dominant mode. We point out the condition for the growth anomaly in the adiabatic case is that information carried per particle exceeds a certain value $\delta I/\delta N&gt;2\pi k_\text{B} \sqrt{(1+\mathcal{R})/(1-\mathcal{R})}$. We further construct several featured quantities to illustrate it, and formalize the anomaly-induced gravitational wave strain deformation.</description>

      <title>Mapping reionization bubbles in the JWST era I: empirical edge detection with Lyman alpha emission from galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionized bubble sizes during reionization trace physical properties of the first galaxies. JWST's ability to spectroscopically confirm and measure Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emission in sub-L* galaxies opens the door to mapping ionized bubbles in 3D. However, existing Lya-based bubble measurement strategies rely on constraints from single galaxies, which are limited by the large variability in intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ emission. As a first step, we present two bubble size estimation methods using Lya spectroscopy of ensembles of galaxies, enabling us to map ionized structures and marginalize over Ly$\alpha$ emission variability. We test our methods using Gpc-scale reionization simulations of the intergalactic medium (IGM). To map bubbles in the plane of the sky, we develop an edge detection method based on the asymmetry of Ly$\alpha$ transmission as a function of spatial position. To map bubbles along the line-of-sight, we develop an algorithm using the tight relation between Ly$\alpha$ transmission and the line-of-sight distance from galaxies to the nearest neutral IGM patch. Both methods can robustly recover bubbles with radius $\gtrsim$10 comoving Mpc, sufficient for mapping bubbles even in the early phases of reionization, when the IGM is $\sim70-90\%$ neutral. These methods require $\gtrsim$0.002-0.004 galaxies/cMpc$^3$, a $5\sigma$ Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width upper limit of $\lesssim$30\r{A} for the faintest targets, and redshift precision $\Delta z \lesssim 0.015$, feasible with JWST spectroscopy. Shallower observations will provide robust lower limits on bubble sizes. Additional constraints on IGM transmission from Ly$\alpha$ escape fractions and line profiles will further refine these methods, paving the way to our first direct understanding of ionized bubble growth.</description>

While in field theory constructions their tension is usually assumed to be constant (or at most slowly-varying), this is often not the case in the context of String Theory. Indeed, the tensions of both fundamental and field theory strings within a string compactification depend on the expectation values of the moduli, which in turn can vary with time. We discuss how the evolution of a cosmic string network changes with a time-dependent tension, both for long-strings and closed loops, by providing an appropriate generalisation of the Velocity One Scale (VOS) model and its implications. The resulting phenomenology is very rich, exhibiting novel features such as growing loops, percolation and a radiation-like behaviour of the long string network. We conclude with a few remarks on the impact for gravitational wave emission.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Production During Reheating: From the Inflaton to Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the gravitational waves (GWs) produced by primordial black holes (PBHs) in the presence of the inflaton condensate in the early Universe. Combining the GW production from the evaporation process, the gravitational scattering of the inflaton itself, and the density fluctuations due to the inhomogeneous distribution of PBHs, we propose for the first time a complete coherent analysis of the spectrum, revealing three peaks, one for each source. Three frequency ranges ($\sim$ kHz, GHz, and PHz, respectively) are expected, each giving rise to a similar GW peak amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}$. We also compare our predictions with current and future GWs detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Amplification of Chiral Gravitational Waves and the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological vacuum amplification of gravitational waves in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. We develop a comprehensive framework to compute graviton production induced by the parity violating Pontryagin coupling and study its imprint on the stochastic gravitational wave background energy power spectrum. We explore gravitational vacuum amplification in four concrete scenarios for the evolution of the Chern-Simons pseudoscalar. We show that a parity-violating contribution dominates over an initially flat spectrum when the velocity of the pseudoscalar quickly interpolates between two asymptotically constant values or when it is nonvanishing and constant through a finite period of time. This is also the case when we parametrize the pseudoscalar evolution by a perfect fluid with radiation- and dust-like equations of state for large enough values of its energy density. The resulting spectra are compared with the sensitivity curves of current and future gravitational wave observational searches.</description>

      <title>Extending the Dark Matter Reach of Water Cherenkov Detectors using Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the first method for water Cherenkov detectors to constrain GeV-scale dark matter (DM) below the solar evaporation mass. While previous efforts have highlighted the Sun and Earth as DM capture targets, we demonstrate that Jupiter is a viable target. Jupiter's unique characteristics, such as its lower core temperature and significant gravitational potential, allow it to capture and retain light DM more effectively than the Sun, particularly in the mass range below 4 GeV where direct detection sensitivity diminishes. Our calculations provide the first bounds on GeV-scale annihilating DM within Jupiter, showing that these bounds surpass current solar limits and direct detection results.</description>

      <title>New approach to search for long transient gravitational waves from inspiraling compact binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for gravitational waves generated by the inspiral phase of binaries of light compact objects holds significant promise in testing the existence of primordial black holes and/or other exotic objects. In this paper, we present a new method to detect such signals exploiting some techniques typically applied in searches for continuous quasi-monochromatic gravitational waves. We describe the signal model employed and present a new strategy to optimally construct the search grid over the parameter space investigated, significantly reducing the search computing cost. Additionally, we estimate the pipeline sensitivity corroborating the results with software injections in real data from the LIGO third observing run. The results show that the method is well suited to detect long-transient signals and standard continuous gravitational waves. According to the criteria used in the grid construction step, the method can be implemented to cover a wide parameter space with slightly reduced sensitivity and lower computational cost or to focus on a narrower parameter space with increased sensitivity at a higher computational expense. The method shows an astrophysical reach up to the Galactic Center (8kpc) for some regions of the parameter space and given search configurations.</description>

      <title>Berry phase in axion physics: implications for detection, SM global structure, and generalized symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Berry phase arising from axion-gauge-boson and axion-fermion interactions. The effective Hamiltonians in these two systems are shown to share the same form, enabling a unified description of the Berry phase. This approach offers a new perspective on certain axion experiments, including photon birefringence and storage-ring experiments. Additionally, we conceptually propose a novel photon-ring experiment for axion detection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that measuring the axion-induced Berry phase provides a unique way for probing the global structure of the Standard Model (SM) gauge group and axion-related generalized symmetries.</description>

      <title>Primordial power spectrum from an objective collapse mechanism: The simplest case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we analyzed the physical origin of the primordial inhomogeneities during the inflation era. The proposed framework is based, on the one hand, on semiclassical gravity, in which only the matter fields are quantized and not the spacetime metric. Secondly, we incorporate an objective collapse mechanism based on the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model, and we apply it to the wavefunction associated with the inflaton field. This is introduced due to the close relation between cosmology and the so-called ``measurement problem'' in Quantum Mechanics. In particular, in order to break the homogeneity and isotropy of the initial Bunch-Davies vacuum, and thus obtain the inhomogeneities observed today, the theory requires something akin to a ``measurement'' (in the traditional sense of Quantum Mechanics). This is because the linear evolution driven by Schr\"odinger's equation does not break any initial symmetry. The collapse mechanism given by the CSL model provides a satisfactory mechanism for breaking the initial symmetries of the Bunch-Davies vacuum. The novel aspect in this work is that the constructed CSL model arises from the simplest choices for the collapse parameter and operator. From these considerations, we obtain a primordial spectrum that has the same distinctive features as the standard one, which is consistent with the observations from the Cosmic Microwave Background.</description>

      <title>Modular domain walls and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss modular domain walls and gravitational waves in a class of supersymmetric models where quark and lepton flavour symmetry emerges from modular symmetry. In such models a single modulus field $\tau$ is often assumed to be stabilised at or near certain fixed point values such as $\tau = {\rm i}$ and $\tau = \omega$ (the cube root of unity), in its fundamental domain. We show that, in the global supersymmetry limit of certain classes of potentials, the vacua at these fixed points may be degenerate, leading to the formation of modular domain walls in the early Universe. Taking supergravity effects into account, in the background of a fixed dilaton field $S$, the degeneracy may be lifted, leading to a bias term in the potential allowing the domain walls to collapse. We study the resulting gravitational wave spectra arising from the dynamics of such modular domain walls, and assess their observability by current and future experiments, as a window into modular flavour symmetry.</description>

      <title>How fast does the WallGo? A package for computing wall velocities in first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WallGo is an open source software for the computation of the bubble wall velocity in first-order cosmological phase transitions. It also computes the energy budget available for the generation of gravitational waves. The main part of WallGo, built in Python, determines the wall velocity by solving the scalar-field(s) equation of motion, the Boltzmann equations and energy-momentum conservation for the fluid velocity and temperature. WallGo also includes two auxiliary modules: WallGoMatrix, which computes matrix elements for out-of-equilibrium particles, and WallGoCollision, which performs higher-dimensional integrals for Boltzmann collision terms. Users can implement custom models by defining an effective potential and specifying a list of out-of-equilibrium particles and their interactions.
  As the first public software to compute the wall velocity including out-of-equilibrium contributions, WallGo improves the precision of the computation compared to common assumptions in earlier computations. It utilises a spectral method for the deviation from equilibrium and collision terms that provides exponential convergence in basis polynomials, and supports multiple out-of-equilibrium particles, allowing for Boltzmann mixing terms. WallGo is tailored for non-runaway wall scenarios where leading-order coupling effects dominate friction.
  While this work introduces the software and the underlying theory, a more detailed documentation can be found in https://wallgo.readthedocs.io.</description>

      <title>Velocity and acceleration fluctuations in dark matter and dynamical dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.05606v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Illustris and Virgo N-body simulations, we study the velocity and acceleration fluctuations in collisionless dark matter involving long-range gravity. By contrast, in the kinetic theory of gases, molecules undergo elastic collisions involving short-range interactions, where only velocity fluctuations are relevant. Long-range gravity requires a broad size of haloes to be formed. Hierarchical structure formation proceeds through the merging of smaller haloes to form larger haloes, which facilitates a continuous energy cascade from small to large haloes at a constant rate of $\varepsilon_u\approx -10^{-7}$m$^2$/s$^3$. Velocity fluctuations involve a critical velocity $u_c\propto (1+z)^{-3/4}$, and acceleration fluctuations involve a critical acceleration $a_c\propto (1+z)^{3/4}$. The two quantities are related as $\varepsilon_{u}\approx -a_c u_c/(18\pi^2)$. With critical velocity $u_c$ on the order of 300km/s at $z=0$, the critical acceleration is found to be $a_{c0}\equiv a_c(z=0) \approx 10^{-10}$m/s$^2$ at $z=0$ that is higher at higher redshift. This suggests that the critical acceleration $a_c$ might explain the universal acceleration $a_0 \approx 10^{-10}$m/s$^2$ in the empirical Tully-Fisher relation and modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). The predicted redshift evolution of $a_0 \propto (1+z)^{3/4}$ can be validated by Magneticum and EAGLE simulations. High-redshift Tully-Fisher relation will provide more insight. Finally, note that dark energy density $\rho_{DE}\approx {a_{c0}^{2}/G}=10^{-10}$J/m$^3$, we postulate an entropic origin of dark energy from the acceleration fluctuations in dark matter. A $\nu_0\nu_a$CDM model was proposed for the evolution of dynamical dark energy. When compared to the $w_0w_a$CDM model with constraints from DESI (2024), this model suggests a constant density at high redshift and a slower power-law weakening density at low redshift.</description>

      <title>Constraints on ultra-slow-roll inflation with the NANOGrav 15-Year Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-slow-roll~(USR) inflation predicts an exponential amplification of scalar perturbations at small scales, which leads to a stochastic gravitational wave background~(SGWB) through the coupling of the scalar and tensor modes at the second-order expansion of the Einstein equation. In this work, we search for such a scalar-induced SGWB from the NANOGrav 15-year (NG15) dataset, and find that the SGWB from USR inflation could explain the observed data. The Bayes factors are $54\pm 5$ for the USR inflation model alone and $68\pm 6$ for the combined USR inflation plus supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB) models. We place constraints on the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum to $P_{\mathrm{Rp}} &gt; 10^{-1.95}$ at $95\%$ confidence level (C.L.) at the scale of $k\sim 20\, \mathrm{pc}^{-1}$. We find that $\log_{10} P_{\mathrm{Rp}}$ degenerates with the peak scale $\log_{10} k_{\mathrm{p}}$. We also obtain the parameter space allowed by the data in the USR inflationary scenario, where the $e$-folding numbers of the duration of the USR phase has a lower limit $\Delta N &gt; 2.80$ ($95\%$ C.L.) when the USR phase ends at $N\approx 20$. With astrophysically motivated priors, the NG15 dataset fits both the USR inflation model and SMBHB model equally well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paradigm of the inflationary universe provides a possible explanation for several observed cosmological properties. In order for such solutions to be successful, the universe must convert the energy stored in the inflaton potential into standard model particles through a process known as reheating. In this paper, we reconsider the reheating process for the case where the inflaton potential respects an approximate (but spontaneously broken) conformal symmetry during the reheating epoch. After reviewing the Effective Field Theory of Reheating, we present solutions for the nonlinear oscillations of the inflaton field, derive the corresponding Hill's equation for the coupled reheating field, and determine the stability diagram for parametric resonance. For this class of models -- the simplest realization being a scalar field with a quartic term -- the expansion of the universe drives the coupled field toward a more unstable part of parameter space, in contrast to the standard case. We also generalize this class of models to include quadratic breaking terms in the potential during the reheating epoch and address the process of stability in that universality class of models.</description>

      <title>Hawai'i Supernova Flows: A Peculiar Velocity Survey Using Over a Thousand Supernovae in the Near-Infrared</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Hawai'i Supernova Flows project and present summary statistics of the first 1,217 astronomical transients observed, 668 of which are spectroscopically classified Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia). Our project is designed to obtain systematics-limited distances to SNe Ia while consuming minimal dedicated observational resources. To date, we have performed almost 5,000 near-infrared (NIR) observations of astronomical transients and have obtained spectra for over 200 host galaxies lacking published spectroscopic redshifts. In this survey paper we describe the methodology used to select targets, collect/reduce data, calculate distances, and perform quality cuts. We compare our methods to those used in similar studies, finding general agreement or mild improvement. Our summary statistics include various parametrizations of dispersion in the Hubble diagrams produced using fits to several commonly used SN Ia models. We find the lowest dispersions using the \texttt{SNooPy} package's EBV\_model2, with a root mean square (RMS) deviation of 0.165 mag and a normalized median absolute deviation (NMAD) of 0.123 mag.
  The full utility of the Hawai'i Supernova Flows data set far exceeds the analyses presented in this paper. Our photometry will provide a valuable test bed for models of SN Ia incorporating NIR data. Differential cosmological studies comparing optical samples and combined optical and NIR samples will have increased leverage for constraining chromatic effects like dust extinction. We invite the community to explore our data by making the light curves, fits, and host galaxy redshifts publicly accessible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local universe is highly inhomogeneous and anisotropic. We live in a relatively sparse region of the Laniakea supercluster at the edge of a large 80 Mpc-wide void. We study the effect of these inhomogeneities on the measured gravitational wave event rates. In particular, we estimate how the measured merger rate of compact binaries is biased by the local matter distribution. The effect of the inhomogeneities on the merger rate is suppressed by the low angular resolution of gravitational wave detectors coupled with their smoothly decreasing population-averaged sensitivity with distance. We estimate the effect on the compact binary coalescence event rate to be at most 6% depending of the chirp mass of the target binary system and the sensitivity and orientation of the detectors.</description>

Abstract: We study the importance of precise modelling of the photometric redshift error distributions on the estimation of parameters from cross correlation measurements and present a working example of the scattering matrix formalism to correct for the redshift bin mismatch of objects in tomographic cross correlation analysis. We measured the angular galaxy auto-power spectrum and cross-power spectrum in four tomographic bins with redshift intervals $z = [0.0,0.3,0.45,0.6,0.8]$ from the cross correlation of Planck Cosmic Microwave Background lensing potential and photometric galaxy catalogue from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Survey Data Release 8. We estimated galaxy linear bias and amplitude of cross correlation using maximum likelihood estimation to put constraints on the $\sigma_{8}$ parameter. We show that the modified Lorentzian function used to fit the photometric redshift error distribution performs well only near the peaks of the distribution. We adopt a sum of Gaussians model to capture the broad tails of the error distribution. Our sum of Gaussians model yields $\sim 2-5\,\sigma$ smaller values of cross correlation amplitude compared to the $\Lambda$CDM expectations. We compute the $\sigma_{8}$ parameter after correcting for the redshift bin mismatch of objects following the scattering matrix approach. The $\sigma_{8}$ parameter becomes consistent with $\Lambda$CDM model in the last tomographic bin but shows $\sim 1-3\,\sigma$ tension in other redshift bins.</description>

      <title>Testing the framework of the halo occupation distribution with assembly bias modeling and empirical extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate theoretical systematics caused by the application of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) to the study of galaxy clustering at non-linear scales. To do this, we repeat recent cosmological analyses using extended HOD models based on both the Aemulus and Aemulus $\nu$ simulation suites, allowing for variations in the dark matter halo shape, incompleteness, baryonic effects and position bias of central galaxies. We fit to the galaxy correlation function including the projected correlation function, redshift space monopole and quadrupole, and consider how the changes in HOD affect the retrieval of cosmological information. These extensions can be understood as an evaluation of the impact of the secondary bias in the clustering analysis. In the application of BOSS galaxies, these changes do not have a significant impact on the measured linear growth rate. But, we do find weak to mild evidence for some of the effects modeled by the empirical parameterizations adopted. The modeling is able to make the HOD approach more complete in terms of cosmological constraints. We anticipate that the future and better data can provide tighter constraints on the new prescriptions of the HOD model.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the power spectrum turnover scale from the cross-correlation between CMB lensing and Quaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the projected clustering of quasars in the Gaia-unWISE quasar catalog, Quaia, and its cross-correlation with CMB lensing data from Planck, to measure the large-scale turnover of the matter power spectrum, associated with the size of the horizon at the epoch of matter-radiation equality. The turnover is detected with a significance of between $2.3$ and $3.1\sigma$, depending on the method used to quantify it. From this measurement, the equality scale is determined at the $\sim20\%$ level. Using the turnover scale as a standard ruler alone (discarding information from the large-scale curvature of the power spectrum), in combination with supernova data through an inverse distance ladder approach, we measure the current expansion rate to be $H_0=62.7\pm17.2\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. The addition of information coming from the power spectrum curvature approximately halves the standard ruler uncertainty. Our measurement in combination with calibrated supernovae from Pantheon$+$ and SH0ES constrains the CMB temperature to be $T_{\rm CMB}=3.10^{+0.48}_{-0.36}\,{\rm K}$, independently of CMB data. Alternatively, assuming the value of $T_{\rm CMB}$ from COBE-FIRAS, we can constrain the effective number of relativistic species in the early Universe to be $N_{\rm eff}=3.0^{+5.8}_{-2.9}$.</description>

      <title>Constraining anisotropic universe under $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We try to find the possibility of a Bianchi V universe in the modified gravitational field theory of $f(R,T)$. We have considered a Lagrangian model in the connection between the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$ and the Ricci scalar $R$. In order to solve the field equations a power law for the scaling factor was also considered. To make a comparison of the model parameters with the observational data, we put constraints on the model under the datasets of the Hubble parameter, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Pantheon, joint datasets of Hubble parameter + Pantheon, and collective datasets of the Hubble parameter + Baryon Acoustic Oscillations + Pantheon. The outcomes for the Hubble parameter in the present epoch are reasonably acceptable, especially since our estimation of this $H_0$ is remarkably consistent with various recent Planck Collaboration studies that utilize the $\Lambda$-CDM model.</description>

      <title>Exploring field-evolution and dynamical-capture coalescing binary black holes in GWTC-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate formation channels for merging binary black holes (BBHs) in GWTC-3, with a dedicated semiparametric population model. The model first describes or excludes a high-spin (with magnitudes of $\sim0.7$) and high-mass (ranging in $\sim 20-80M_{\odot}$) subpopulation, which was identified by previous works and can be interpreted as hierarchical mergers. We find that the rest of BBH population can be categorized into two subpopulations with different mass and mass-ratio distributions, as indicated by a Bayes factor of $\ln\mathcal{B}=1.8$. One subpopulation, characterized by nearly aligned spins and consistent with isolated-field formation, likely dominates the 10-solar-mass peak in the primary-mass function. The other subpopulation, with isotropic spins and consistent with the dynamical channels, shows a stronger preference for symmetric pairing, and mainly contributes to the 35-solar-mass peak in the primary-mass function. Note that the Bayes factor is not high enough with the currently available data, so that the case of a single population is still acceptable. Additionally, we compare the mass distributions between merging BBHs and black holes (BHs) in high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). We find that the primary mass of the aligned subpopulation is slightly lighter than those of the HMXB BHs, while the isotropic subpopulation is consistent with the HMXB BHs, if the power-law index of its mass function is shifted by 2, as indicated by the dynamical formation channels. However, the spin magnitudes of both subpopulations are significantly smaller than those of the HMXB BHs.</description>

      <title>Bulk Black Hole Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dark dimension provides a mechanism to resolve the cosmological hierarchy problem and assembles a colosseum for dark matter contenders. In a series of recent publications we investigated whether primordial black holes (PBHs) perceiving the dark dimension could constitute all of the dark matter in the universe. A key assumption of these investigations is that PBHs remain confined to the brane during the entire evaporation process. As a consequence, the abundance of PBHs evaporating at the present epoch is severely constrained by observations of both the extragalactic and Galactic $\gamma$-ray backgrounds. As a natural outgrowth of these investigations, herein we relax the assumption of brane localized PBHs and reexamine the evaporation process of PBHs which are allowed to escape into the dark dimension. We show that the escape of PBHs from the brane is almost instantaneous. Armed with this pivotal finding we reassess the allowed mass range of PBHs to assemble all cosmological dark matter, which is estimated to be $10^{11} \lesssim M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \lesssim 10^{21}$.</description>

      <title>Fewer supermassive binary black holes in pulsar timing array observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the inferred properties of the putative gravitational wave background in the second data release of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) to be in better agreement with theoretical expectations under the improved noise model. In particular, if the gravitational wave background is from supermassive black hole binaries, the observed gravitational wave emission is the dominant source of the binary energy loss, with no evidence of environmental effects, eccentric orbits, or an overabundance of sources. Our improved noise model addresses the misspecification of noise priors which impacts the inference of temporal correlations of the background. We also find evidence for epoch-correlated temporally-uncorrelated (white) noise which has a stronger impact on the measurement in the presence of Hellings-Downs correlations of the background.</description>
