      <title>A remark on some punctual Quot schemes on smooth projective curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a locally free sheaf $\mathcal{E}$ on a smooth projective curve, we can define the punctual Quot scheme which parametrizes torsion quotients of $\mathcal{E}$ of length $n$ supported at a fixed point. It is known that the punctual Quot scheme is a normal projective variety with canonical Gorenstein singularities. In this note, we show that the punctual Quot scheme is a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial Fano variety of Picard number one.</description>

      <title>Connection Matrices in Macaulay2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we describe the theoretical foundations of the Macaulay2 package ConnectionMatrices and explain how to use it. For a left ideal in the Weyl algebra that is of finite holonomic rank, we implement the computation of the encoded system of linear PDEs in connection form with respect to an elimination term order that depends on a chosen positive weight vector. We also implement the gauge transformation for carrying out a change of basis over the field of rational functions. We demonstrate all implemented algorithms with examples.</description>

      <title>Derived McKay correspondence for real reflection groups of rank three</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the derived McKay correspondence for real reflection groups of rank $3$ in terms of a maximal resolution of the logarithmic pair consisting of the quotient variety and the discriminant divisor with coefficient $\frac{1}{2}$. As an application, we verify a conjecture by Polishchuk and Van den Bergh on the existence of a certain semiorthgonal decomposition of the equivariant derived category into the derived categories of affine spaces for any real reflection group of rank $3$.</description>

      <title>The de Rham cohomology of covers with cyclic $p$-Sylow subgroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over a field $k$ with an action of a finite group $G$. A well-known result of Chevalley and Weil describes the $k[G]$-module structure of cohomologies of $X$ in the case when the characteristic of $k$ does not divide $\# G$. It is unlikely that such a formula can be derived in the general case, since the representation theory of groups with non-cyclic $p$-Sylow subgroups is wild in characteristic $p$. The goal of this article is to show that when $G$ has a cyclic $p$-Sylow subgroup, the $G$-structure of the de Rham cohomology of $X$ is completely determined by the ramification data. In principle, this leads to new formulas in the spirit of Chevalley and Weil for such curves. We provide such an explicit description of the de Rham cohomology in the cases when $G = \mathbb Z/p^n$ and when the $p$-Sylow subgroup of $G$ is normal of order $p$.</description>

      <title>Well-clipped cones behave themselves under all finite quotients, the cone conjecture under most</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a property of convex cones, being "well-clipped", that is inspired by the work of several complex algebraic geometers on the Morrison-Kawamata cone conjecture. That property is satisfied by movable cones of divisors on various complex projective varieties of Calabi-Yau type, such as abelian varieties and projective hyperk\"ahler manifolds. The property of being well-clipped has the advantage to descend under taking invariants by a finite group action, and to be stable by direct sums. In the class of well-clipped cones, we also provide a simple characterization of those cones that admit a rational polyhedral fundamental domain under some natural group action.
  We use this framework to prove the movable cone conjecture for finite quotients of various projective varieties of Calabi-Yau type, notably products of projective primitive symplectic varieties, abelian varieties, and smooth rational surfaces underlying klt Calabi-Yau pairs. This entails Enriques manifolds. We deduce that such finite quotients admit finitely many unmarked small $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial modifications, and that the nef cone conjecture holds for them.</description>

      <title>The Hitchin morphism for certain surfaces fibered over a curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chen-Ng\^o Conjecture predicts that the Hitchin morphism from the moduli stack of $G$-Higgs bundles on a smooth projective variety surjects onto the space of spectral data. The conjecture is known to hold for the group $GL_n$ and any surface, and for the group $GL_2$ and any smooth projective variety. We prove the Chen-Ng\^o Conjecture for any reductive group when the variety is a ruled surface or (a blowup of) a nonisotrivial elliptic fibration with reduced fibers. Furthermore, if the group is a classical group, i.e. $G \in \{SL_n,SO_n,Sp_{2n}\}$, then we prove the Hitchin morphism restricted to the Dolbeault moduli space of semiharmonic $G$-Higgs bundles surjects onto the space of spectral data.</description>

      <title>Pairing Anderson motives via formal residues in the Frobenius endomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anderson modules form a generalization of Drinfeld modules and are commonly understood as the counterpart of abelian varieties but with function field coefficients. In an attempt to study their ``motivic theory'', two objects of semilinear algebra are attached to an Anderson module: its motive and its dual motive. While the former is better suited to follow the analogy with Grothendieck motives, the latter has proven much useful in the study of transcendence questions in positive characteristic. Despite sharing similar definitions, the relationship between motives and dual motives has remained nebulous. Over perfect fields, it was only proved recently by the second author that the finite generation of the motive is equivalent to the finite generation of the dual motive, answering a long-standing open question in function field arithmetic (the ``abelian equals $A$-finite'' theorem). This work constructs a perfect pairing among the motive and the dual motive of an Anderson module, with values in a module of differentials, thus answering a question raised by Hartl and Juschka. Our construction involves taking the residue of certain formal power series in the Frobenius endomorphism. Although it may seem peculiar, this pairing is natural and compatible with base change. It also comes with several new consequences in function field arithmetic; for example, we generalize the ``abelian equals A-finite'' theorem to a large class of algebras, including fields, perfect algebras and noetherian regular domains.</description>

      <title>Gluing moduli spaces of quantum toric stacks via secondary fan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extension from toric varieties to quantum toric stacks allows for the study of moduli spaces of toric objects with fixed combinatorial structures, as we now consider general finitely generated subgroups of $\mathbb{R}^n$ as "lattices." This paper aims to construct a moduli space that encompasses all such moduli spaces for a given dimension of the ambient space. To achieve this, we adapt the construction of the secondary fan within the quantum framework. This approach provides a description of wall-crossings between different moduli spaces, analogous to those observed in LVMB manifolds.</description>

      <title>Emergent Strings in Type IIB Calabi--Yau Compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study infinite distance limits in the complex structure moduli space of Type IIB compactifications on Calabi--Yau threefolds, in light of the Emergent String Conjecture. We focus on the so-called type II limits, which, based on the asymptotic behaviour of the physical couplings in the low-energy effective theory, are candidates for emergent string limits. However, due to the absence of Type IIB branes of suitable dimensionality, the emergence of a unique critical string accompanied by a tower of Kaluza--Klein states has so far remained elusive. By considering a broad class of type II$_b$ limits, corresponding to so-called Tyurin degenerations, and studying the asymptotic behaviour of four-dimensional EFT strings in this geometry, we argue that the worldsheet theory of the latter describes a unique critical heterotic string on $T^2\times\mathrm{K3}$ with a gauge bundle whose rank depends on $b$. In addition, we establish the presence of an infinite tower of BPS particles arising from wrapped D3-branes by identifying a suitable set of special Lagrangian 3-cycles in the geometry. The associated BPS invariants are conjectured to be counted by generalisations of modular forms. As a consistency check, we further show that in special cases mirror symmetry identifies the EFT strings with the well-understood emergent string limits in the K\"ahler moduli space of Type IIA compactifications on K3-fibred Calabi--Yau threefolds. Finally, we discuss the implications of the Emergent String Conjecture for type II limits which do not correspond to Tyurin degenerations, and predict new constraints on the possible geometries of type II degenerations which resemble those arising in the Kulikov classification of degenerations of K3 surfaces.</description>

      <title>Height arguments toward the dynamical Mordell-Lang problem in arbitrary characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use height arguments to prove two results about the dynamical Mordell-Lang problem. We are more interested in the positive characteristic case due to our original purpose.
  (i) For an endomorphism of a projective variety, the return set of a dense orbit into a curve is finite if any cohomological Lyapunov exponent of any iteration is not an integer.
  (ii) Let $f\times g:X\times C\rightarrow X\times C$ be an endomorphism in which $f$ and $g$ are endomorphisms of a projective variety $X$ and a curve $C$, respectively. If the degree of $g$ is greater than the first dynamical degree of $f$, then the return sets of the system $(X\times C,f\times g)$ have the same form as the return sets of the system $(X,f)$.
  Using the second result, we deal with the case of split endomorphisms of products of curves, for which the degrees of the factors are pairwise distinct.
  In the cases that the height argument cannot be applied, we find examples which show that the return set can be very complicated -- more complicated than experts once imagine -- even for endomorphisms of tori of zero entropy.</description>

      <title>On anticyclotomic Selmer groups of elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p\geq5$ be a prime number and let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field where $p$ is unramified. Under mild technical assumptions, in this paper we prove the non-existence of non-trivial finite $\Lambda$-submodules of Pontryagin duals of signed Selmer groups of a $p$-supersingular rational elliptic curve over the anticyclotomic $\mathbb Z_p$-extension of $K$, where $\Lambda$ is the corresponding Iwasawa algebra. In particular, we work under the assumption that our plus/minus Selmer groups have $\Lambda$-corank $1$, so they are not $\Lambda$-cotorsion. Our main theorem extends to the supersinular case analogous non-existence results by Bertolini in the ordinary setting; furthermore, since we cover the case where $p$ is inert in $K$, we refine previous results of Hatley-Lei-Vigni, which deal with $p$-supersingular elliptic curves under the assumption that $p$ splits in $K$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the (universal) local isomonodromic deformations of irregular-singular connections defined on principal bundles over complex curves: for any complex reductive structure group G, any pole order, and allowing for twisted/ramified formal normal forms at each pole. This covers the general case, and we particularly study the fundamental groups of the spaces of admissible deformations of irregular types/classes, in the viewpoint of (twisted/nonsplit) reflections cosets.</description>

      <title>On SYZ mirrors of Hirzebruch surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Strominger-Yau-Zaslow (SYZ) approach to mirror symmetry constructs a mirror space and a superpotential from the data of a Lagrangian torus fibration on a K\"ahler manifold with effective first Chern class. For K\"ahler manifolds whose first Chern class is not nef, the SYZ construction is further complicated by the presence of additional holomorphic discs with non-positive Maslov index.
  In this paper, we study SYZ mirror symmetry for two of the simplest toric examples: the non-Fano Hirzebruch surfaces F_3 and F_4. For F_3, we determine the SYZ mirror associated to generic perturbations of the complex structure, and demonstrate that the SYZ mirror depends on the choice of perturbation. For F_4, we determine the SYZ mirror for a specific perturbation of complex structure, where the mirror superpotential is an explicit infinite Laurent series. Finally, we relate this superpotential to those arising from other perturbations of F_4 via a scattering diagram.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1512.04076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the intersection cohomology of the moduli spaces $M_{r,d}$ of semistable vector bundles having rank $r$ and degree $d$ over a curve. We do this by relating the Hodge-Deligne polynomial of the intersection cohomology of $M_{r,d}$ to the Donaldson-Thomas invariants of the curve. These invariants can be computed by methods going back to Harder, Narasimhan, Desale and Ramanan. More generally, we introduce Donaldson-Thomas classes in the Grothendieck group of mixed Hodge modules over $M_{r,d}$ and relate them to the class of the intersection complex of $M_{r,d}$. Our methods can be applied to the moduli spaces of semistable objects in arbitrary hereditary categories.</description>

Abstract: Given two irreducible conics $C$ and $D$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ odd, we show that there are $q^2/4+O(q^{3/2})$ points $P$ in $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ such that $P$ is external to $C$ and internal to $D$. This answers a question of Korchm\'{a}ros. We also prove the analogous result for higher-dimensional smooth quadric hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ with $n$ odd, where the answer is $q^{n-1}/4+O(q^{n-\frac{3}{2}})$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a theory of diminished multiplier ideals on singular varieties which was introduced by Hacon, and developed by Lehmann. We prove a result regarding the termination of certain type of flips with scaling of an ample divisor if the Cartier index is bounded, and if $\kappa_{\sigma}(K_X+\Delta)\ge \dim X-1$ holds. The proof uses a theory of diminished multiplier ideal.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Yang-Mills fields on $B$-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering $B$-branes over a complex manifold $X$ as objects of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves over $X$, we define holomorphic gauge fields on $B$-branes and introduce the Yang-Mills functional for these fields. These definitions extend well-known concepts in the context of vector bundles to the setting of $B$-branes.
  For a given $B$-brane, we show that its Atiyah class is the obstruction to the existence of gauge fields. When $X$ is the variety of complete flags in a $3$-dimensional complex vector space, we prove that any $B$-brane over $X$ admits at most one holomorphic gauge field.
  Furthermore, we establish that the set of Yang-Mills fields on a given $B$-brane, if nonempty, is in bijective correspondence with the points of an algebraic set defined by $m$ complex polynomials of degree less than four in $m$ indeterminates, where $m$ is the dimension of the space of morphisms from the brane to its tensor product with the sheaf of holomorphic one-forms.</description>

      <title>Periods of Real Biextensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A real biextension is a real mixed Hodge structure that is an extension of R(0) by a mixed Hodge structure with weights $-1$ and $-2$. A unipotent real biextension over an algebraic manifold is a variation of mixed Hodge structure over it, each of whose fibers is a real biextension and whose weight graded quotients are do not vary. We show that if a unipotent real biextension has non abelian monodromy, then its ``general fiber'' does not split. This result is a tool for investigating the boundary behaviour of normal functions and is applied in arXiv:2408.07809 to study the boundary behaviour of the normal function of the Ceresa cycle.</description>

      <title>Nash blowups of 2-generic determinantal varieties in positive characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Nash blowup of 2-generic determinantal varieties over fields of positive characteristic is non-singular. We prove this in two steps. Firstly, we explicitly describe the toric structure of such varieties. Secondly, we show that in this case the combinatorics of Nash blowups are free of characteristic. The result then follows from the analogous result in characteristic zero proved by W. Ebeling and S. M. Gusein-Zade.</description>

      <title>On the Quantum K-theory of Quiver Varieties at Roots of Unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Psi(\textbf{z},\textbf{a},q)$ a the fundamental solution matrix of the quantum difference equation of a Nakajima variety $X$. In this work, we prove that the operator $$ \Psi(\textbf{z},\textbf{a},q) \Psi\left(\textbf{z}^p,\textbf{a}^p,q^{p^2}\right)^{-1} $$ has no poles at the primitive complex $p$-th roots of unity $q=\zeta_p$. As a byproduct, we show that the iterated product of the operators ${\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}}(\textbf{z},\textbf{a},q )$ from the $q$-difference equation on $X$: $$ {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\textbf{z} q^{(p-1)\mathcal{L}},\textbf{a},q) \cdots {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\textbf{z} q^{\mathcal{L}},\textbf{a},q) {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\textbf{z} ,\textbf{a},q) $$ evaluated at $q=\zeta_p$ has the same eigenvalues as ${\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\textbf{z}^p,\textbf{a}^p,q^p)$.
  Upon a reduction of the quantum difference equation of $X$ to the quantum differential equation over the field of finite characteristic, the above iterated product transforms into a Grothendiek-Katz $p$-curvature of the corresponding quantum connection whreas ${\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\textbf{z}^p,\textbf{a}^p,q^p)$ becomes a certain Frobenius twist of that connection. In this way, we give an explicit description of the spectrum of the $p$-curvature of quantum connection for Nakajima varieties.</description>

      <title>Independence of $\ell$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove independence of $\ell$ for Betti numbers as well as for characteristic polynomials of motivically defined endomorphisms of $\ell$-adic cohomology. This long standing problem is solved through the construction of new comparison isomorphisms relating $\ell$-adic cohomology of a separated scheme of finite type over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic with its rigid cohomology. Taking advantage of the description of categories of $\ell$-adic sheaves of geometric origin as categories of modules over $\ell$-adic cohomology in the stable category of motivic sheaves, these independence of $\ell$-results are promoted to independence of $\ell$ of suitable categories of $\ell$-adic sheaves themselves.</description>

      <title>An $l$-adic bifiltered complex of a proper SNCL scheme with an SNCD and an $l$-adic relative monodromy filtration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a family of log points with constant log structure and for a proper SNCL scheme with an SNCD over the family, we construct a fundamental l-adic bifiltered complex as a geometric application of the theory of the derived category of (bi)filtered complexes in our papers. By using this bifiltered complex, we give the formulation of the log l-adic relative monodromy-weight conjecture with respect to the filtration arising from the SNCD. That is, we state that the relative l-adic monodromy filtration should exist for the Kummer log etale cohomological sheaf of the proper SNCL scheme with an SNCD and it should be equal to the l-adic weight filtration.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Schubert Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schubert coefficients are nonnegative integers $c^w_{u,v}$ that arise in Algebraic Geometry and play a central role in Algebraic Combinatorics. It is a major open problem whether they have a combinatorial interpretation, i.e, whether $c^w_{u,v} \in \#{\sf P}$. We study the closely related vanishing problem of Schubert coefficients: $\{c^w_{u,v}=^? 0\}$. Until this work it was open whether this problem is in the polynomial hierarchy ${\sf PH}$. We prove that $\{c^w_{u,v}=^? 0\}$ in ${\sf coAM}$ assuming the GRH. In particular, the vanishing problem is in ${\Sigma_2^{{\text{p}}}}$. Our approach is based on constructions lifted formulations, which give polynomial systems of equations for the problem. The result follows from a reduction to Parametric Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, recently studied in arXiv:2408.13027. We extend our results to all classical types. Type $D$ is resolved in the appendix (joint with David Speyer).</description>

      <title>Siegel modular forms of level (4,8) and weight two</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the space of Siegel modular forms of genus $g$ of weight two relative to the main congruence subgroup of level 2 and to Igusa's group $\Gamma_g(4, 8)$ and $\Gamma_g(2,4)$.One of the main results of this paper is that in the case $g\ge 8$ the space $[\Gamma_g[4,8],2]$ is generated by the products of 4 theta nullwerte. Thus this note can be considered as a completion of the example at the end of [Fr].</description>
