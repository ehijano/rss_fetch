      <title>Neutralina: promoting science and gender-equality in Latin-America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed certain societal weaknesses, including the lack of scientists in the media and the readiness of the public to believe in fake news. "Neutralina" is a science communication personality created on Instagram (@neutralina.lu) in response to the observed need for scientific outreach done by women in Peruvian and Latin American society. The objectives of this project include normalizing the presence of women in science, fighting against stereotypes and fake news, and disseminating scientific knowledge. Neutralina has attracted a sizable young audience and is expanding beyond Instagram into other formats such as podcasts, real-life conferences, and roundtable discussions. Statistics detailing its growth will be presented, alongside strategies employed to engage the young audience.</description>

      <title>Impact of Cognitive Dissonance on Social Hysteresis: Insights fromthe Expressed and Private Opinions Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing interest in models of opinion dynamics, particularly those that distinguish between private beliefs and publicly expressed opinions, spans several academic disciplines, from the social sciences to the hard sciences. They have been developed to study decision-making mechanisms and applied to many social phenomena, such as pluralistic ignorance, the spiral of silence, or preference falsification. Within these models, however, there is a notable gap in the study of social hysteresis, a concept crucial to understanding the delayed responses of societies to the rapid changes of the modern world. This research aims to fill this gap by examining the impact of cognitive dissonance on social hysteresis through an updated model of expressed and private opinions (EPOs). We study the model both analytically and through Monte Carlo simulations. To facilitate understanding and replication of our model, and to provide a resource for further exploration to a diverse interdisciplinary audience, we have made the special NetLogo implementation of the model publicly available at GitHub. By incorporating a cognitive dissonance mitigation mechanism into an agent-based q-voter-type model of Expressed and Private Opinions (EPOs), we demonstrate that this mechanism induces social hysteresis. Consequently, we argue that refraining from rationalizing publicly expressed opinions could mitigate social hysteresis and facilitate consensus, offering insights into potential strategies for managing societal responses to change.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic interplay between information spreading and opinion polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how information-spreading mechanisms affect opinion dynamics and vice-versa via an agent-based simulation on adaptive social networks. First, we characterize the impact of reposting on user behavior with limited memory, a feature that introduces novel system states. Then, we build an experiment mimicking information-limiting environments seen on social media platforms and study how the model parameters can determine the configuration of opinions. In this scenario, different posting behaviors may sustain polarization or revert it. We further show the adaptability of the model by calibrating it to reproduce the statistical organization of information cascades as seen empirically in a microblogging social media platform.</description>

      <title>Critical fragility in socio-technical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Socio-technical systems, where technological and human elements interact in a goal-oriented manner, provide important functional support to our societies. Here we draw attention to the underappreciated concept of timeliness -- i.e., system elements being available at the right place at the right time -- that has been ubiquitously and integrally adopted as a quality standard in the \textit{modus operandi\/} of socio-technical systems. We point out that a variety of incentives, often reinforced by competitive pressures, prompt system operators to myopically optimize for efficiencies, running the risk of inadvertently taking timeliness to the limit of its operational performance, correspondingly making the system critically fragile to perturbations by pushing the entire system towards the proverbial `edge of a cliff'. Invoking a stylized model for operational delays, we identify the limiting operational performance of timeliness, as a true critical point, where the smallest of perturbations can lead to a systemic collapse. Specifically for firm-to-firm production networks, we suggest that the proximity to \textit{critical fragility\/} is an important ingredient for understanding the fundamental ``excess volatility puzzle'' in economics. Further, in generality for optimizing socio-technical systems, we propose that critical fragility is a crucial aspect in managing the trade-off between efficiency and robustness.</description>
