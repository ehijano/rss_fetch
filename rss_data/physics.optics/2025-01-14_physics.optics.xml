      <title>Interferometric optical mass measurement in the low-reference regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise optical, label-free, measurement of mass at the nanoscale has been significantly advanced by techniques based on interferometric scattering, such as mass photometry (MP). These methods exploit the interference between a scattered and reference field to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for weakly scattering objects (e.g. proteins) and are currently limited to masses bigger than 40 kDa. Standard MP employs a mask that attenuates the reference field, allowing for the increase in illumination power without saturation of the detector. In this theoretical study, we examine how the SNR evolves when extending reference attenuation beyond conventional levels: entering the low-reference regime. Our simplified model finds that a substantial SNR enhancement can be achieved when the magnitude of reference matches that of the scattered field and investigate refractive index tuning as a potential method to reach the required attenuation in practice. The accomplishable SNR improvement can be tailored to a given mass region, i.e. allowing the detection of masses smaller than 40 kDa.</description>

      <title>Ultra-compact broadband spot size converter using metamaterial cell-based inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the expansion of silicon photonics from datacom applications into emerging fields like optical I/O, quantum and programmable photonics there is an increasing demand for devices that combine ultra-compact footprints, low losses, and broad bandwidths. While inverse design techniques have proven very efficient in achieving small footprints, they often underutilize physical insight and rely on large parameter spaces that are challenging to explore, thereby limiting the performance of the resulting devices. Here we present a design methodology that combines inverse design with a topology based on cells, each of which contains a subwavelength metamaterial. This approach significantly reduces the parameter space, while the inherent anisotropy of the subwavelength structures yields shorter devices. We experimentally demonstrate our technique with an ultra-compact spot size converter that achieves a x24 expansion ratio times (from 0.5{\mu}m to 12{\mu}m) over a length of only 7{\mu}m, with insertion losses of 0.8 dB across a measured bandwidth of 160nm (up to 300nm in simulation), surpassing the state-of-the-art by a wide margin.</description>

      <title>X-ray microcomputed tomography of 3D chaotic microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaotic microcavities play a crucial role in several research areas, including the study of unidirectional microlasers, nonlinear optics, sensing, quantum chaos, and non-Hermitian physics. To date, most theoretical and experimental explorations have focused on two-dimensional (2D) chaotic dielectric microcavities, while there have been minimal studies on three-dimensional (3D) ones since precise geometrical information of a 3D microcavity can be difficult to obtain. Here, we image 3D microcavities with submicron resolution using X-ray microcomputed tomography (micro CT), enabling nondestructive imaging that preserves the sample for subsequent use. By analyzing the ray dynamics of a typical deformed microsphere, we demonstrate that a sufficient deformation along all three dimensions can lead to chaotic ray trajectories over extended time scales. Notably, using the X-ray micro CT reconstruction results, the phase space chaotic ray dynamics of a deformed microsphere are accurately established. X-ray micro CT could become a unique platform for the characterization of such deformed 3D microcavities by providing a precise means for determining the degree of deformation necessary for potential applications in ray chaos and quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Compact Model of Linear Passive Integrated Photonics Device for Photon Design Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As integrated photonic systems grow in scale and complexity, Photonic Design Automation (PDA) tools and Process Design Kits (PDKs) have become increasingly important for layout and simulation. However, fixed PDKs often fail to meet the rising demand for customization, compelling designers to spend significant time on geometry optimization using FDTD, EME, and BPM simulations. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven Eigenmode Propagation Method (DEPM) based on the unitary evolution of optical waveguides, along with a compact model derived from intrinsic waveguide Hamiltonians. The relevant parameters are extracted via complex coupled-mode theory. Once constructed, the compact model enables millisecond-scale simulations that achieve accuracy on par with 3D FDTD, within the model's valid scope. Moreover, this method can swiftly evaluate the effects of manufacturing variations on device and system performance, including both random phase errors and polarization-sensitive components. The data-driven EPM thus provides an efficient and flexible solution for future photonic design automation, promising further advancements in integrated photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>On the optical field confinement at the anapole mode in nanohole silicon metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, researchers demonstrated numerous types of the metasurfaces with non-radiating states including the anapole ones. These metasurfaces have promising properties for various applications in optics which are mainly connected with the optical field confinement. But by itself, the existence of the anapole state does not make one available to exploit this feature. For example, Ospanova et al. [\textit{Laser \&amp; Photonics Rev.}, 2018, vol. 12, p. 1800005] presented a grouped nanohole array in silicon slab possessing anapole mode in visible range. In this work, it is proved that despite of the existence of the anapole mode in the proposed nanostructure the valuable electric field confinement is not reached. Thus most expected uses of the anapole state cannot be gained through this nanostructure. As demonstrated here, the aforementioned nanostructure may be replaced by the square nanohole array having the anapole state with different meta-atom and much larger electric field confinement.</description>

      <title>Twist-induced near-field radiative thermal regulator assisted by cylindrical surface modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field radiative heat transfer (RHT) can surpass Planck's blackbody limit by several orders of magnitude due to the tunneling effect of thermal photons. The ability to understand and regulate RHT is of great significance in contactless energy transfer. In this work, we construct a rotating system with a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) cylinder for actively regulating the RHT between two nanoparticles (NPs). The results show that when the two NPs are located directly above the cylinder, energy can be directionally transmitted along the cylindrical channel in the form of low-loss surface waves, which can significantly enhance RHT. In addition, we find that the RHT can be regulated by actively manipulating the excitation of cylindrical surface modes. When the rotation point is located in the middle of the line connecting the two NPs, the modulation contrast approaches five orders of magnitude, higher than that of cylinders made of other materials under the same conditions. When its diameter is slightly less than the distance between NPs, the h-BN cylinder shows excellent tunability in the heat exchange. The present work may offer a theoretical possibility for actively regulating and controlling near-field RHT between arbitrary objects based on cylindrical waveguides.</description>

      <title>Full C- and L-band tunable erbium-doped integrated lasers via scalable manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erbium (Er) ions are the gain medium of choice for fiber-based amplifiers and lasers, offering a long excited-state lifetime, slow gain relaxation, low amplification nonlinearity and noise, and temperature stability compared to semiconductor-based platforms. Recent advances in ultra-low-loss silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) photonic integrated circuits, combined with ion implantation, have enabled the realization of high-power on-chip Er amplifiers and lasers with performance comparable to fiber-based counterparts, supporting compact photonic systems. Yet, these results are limited by the high (2 MeV) implantation beam energy required for tightly confined Si$_3$N$_4$ waveguides (700 nm height), preventing volume manufacturing of Er-doped photonic integrated circuits. Here, we overcome these limitations and demonstrate the first fully wafer-scale, foundry-compatible Er-doped photonic integrated circuit-based tunable lasers. Using 200 nm-thick Si$_3$N$_4$ waveguides, we reduce the ion beam energy requirement to below 500 keV, enabling efficient wafer-scale implantation with an industrial 300 mm ion implanter. We demonstrate a laser wavelength tuning range of 91 nm, covering nearly the entire optical C- and L-bands, with fiber-coupled output power reaching 36 mW and an intrinsic linewidth of 95 Hz. The temperature-insensitive properties of erbium ions allowed stable laser operation up to 125$^{\circ}$C and lasing with less than 15 MHz drift for over 6 hours at room temperature using a remote fiber pump. The fully scalable, low-cost fabrication of Er-doped waveguide lasers opens the door for widespread adoption in coherent communications, LiDAR, microwave photonics, optical frequency synthesis, and free-space communications.</description>

      <title>Turing-Completeness and Undecidability in Coupled Nonlinear Optical Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks of coupled nonlinear optical resonators have emerged as an important class of systems in ultrafast optical science, enabling richer and more complex nonlinear dynamics compared to their single-resonator or travelling-wave counterparts. In recent years, these coupled nonlinear optical resonators have been applied as application-specific hardware accelerators for computing applications including combinatorial optimization and artificial intelligence. In this work, we rigorously prove a fundamental result showing that coupled nonlinear optical resonators are Turing-complete computers, which endows them with much greater computational power than previously thought. Furthermore, we show that the minimum threshold of hardware complexity needed for Turing-completeness is surprisingly low, which has profound physical consequences. In particular, we show that several problems of interest in the study of coupled nonlinear optical resonators are formally undecidable. These theoretical findings can serve as the foundation for better understanding the promise of next-generation, ultrafast all-optical computers.</description>

      <title>Revealing Point Group Symmetry of Rare-earth Dopants via Polarization-resolved Single-particle Microspectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local point group symmetry of luminescent centers, such as defects, impurities, and dopant ions within a crystal, dictates their optical transition properties. While conventional low-temperature spectroscopy quantifies point group symmetry by enumerating the splitting of optical transitions, it fails to capture vectorial symmetry information, such as the orientation of symmetry axes. Here, we establish a quantitative link between point group symmetry, crystal symmetry, optical transition dipole orientation, and polarized luminescence in rare-earth-doped single-particle crystals using computational electromagnetism. Combined with room-temperature single-particle polarization spectroscopy, we resolve the magnetic dipole orientations from individual optical transition of dopant ions in single microcrystal, enabling precise identification of point group symmetry and its axes. We observe single-particle chirality arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking of intrinsically chiral space group during crystallization. Based on point group and crystal symmetries, we present a practical scheme to optical sensing the 3D orientation of rare-earth-doped single particles in dynamic environments by using two arbitrarily transition bands from single-view polarization spectra. Our computational electromagnetism framework not only elucidates polarized luminescence but also provides insights into optimizing dipole orientation-dependent energy transfer for designing ultra-bright rare-earth-doped nanocrystals, such as F\"orster resonance energy transfer, and can interpret enhanced linear polarization in extreme optical phenomena like stimulated emission, superradiance, and superfluorescence following dipole-coherent radiation in single emitters.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy for Fast Quantitative Phase Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative phase imaging is a method of choice to observe structure and dynamics of unlabelled biological cells. Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) reconstructs high resolution images over a wide field of view, but requires capturing many images, thus limiting acquisition speed. On the other hand, differential phase contrast (DPC) is fast but limited in resolution, as it only exploits brightfield measurements. In this study, we propose perturbative Fourier ptychographic microscopy (pFPM) as a darkfield extension of DPC for fast, high-resolution, wide-field quantitative phase imaging. We interpret DPC as a single step of the Gauss-Newton algorithm with quadratic regularization, leading to a natural generalization of multiple steps and more general regularizers. In addition, we show that phase imaging with a minimal number of illumination patterns can be achieved using the DPC brightfield illumination patterns and annular darkfield illumination patterns. Our methodology combines both a perturbative phase retrieval algorithm and annular darkfield illumination patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photochemistry in the earth's atmosphere is driven by the sun, continuously altering the concentration and spatial distribution of pollutants. Precisely monitoring their atmospheric abundance relies predominantly on optical sensing, which requires the knowledge of exact absorption cross sections. One key pollutant which impacts many photochemical reaction-pathways is formaldehyde. Agreement on formaldehyde absolute absorption cross section remains elusive in the photochemically-relevant ultraviolet spectral region, hampering sensitive concentration tracking. Here, we introduce free-running ultraviolet dual comb spectroscopy, combining high spectral resolution (1 GHz), broad spectral coverage (12 THz), and fast acquisition speed (500 ms), as a novel method for absolute absorption cross section determination with unprecedented fidelity. Within this bandwidth, our method uncovers almost one order of magnitude more rovibrational transitions than detected before which leads to refined rotational constants for high-level quantum simulations of molecular eigenstates. This ultra-resolution method can be generalized to provide a universal tool for fast electronic fingerprinting of atmospherically-relevant species, both for sensing applications and to benchmark improvements of ab-initio quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Feedforward Cancellation of High-Frequency Phase Noise in Frequency-Doubled Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cancellation of high-frequency laser phase noise using feedforward techniques, as opposed to feedback methods, has achieved significant advancements in recent years. However, directly applying existing feedforward techniques to laser systems based on nonlinear conversion still faces substantial challenges. Here, we propose and demonstrate a feedforward scheme that suppresses phase noise in frequency-doubled light by utilizing phase noise information of its fundamental pump. This scheme is enabled by the fact that the phase jitter of the frequency-doubled light is simply twice that of the pump, except for a first-order low-pass filtering effect introduced by the SHG enhancement cavity. Testing this method on a 420-nm frequency-doubled laser system, we realize a 25-dB suppression of the servo noise bump near 1 MHz on the 420-nm light, and an average suppression of 30 dB for strong injected noise ranging from 100 kHz to 20 MHz. This scheme shows promising potential for applications requiring blue or ultraviolet light with minimal high-frequency phase noise, such as precision control of atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Photonic antiferromagnetic topological insulator with a single surface Dirac cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetism, characterized by magnetic moments aligned in alternating directions with a vanished ensemble average, has garnered renewed interest for its potential applications in spintronics and axion dynamics. The synergy between antiferromagnetism and topology can lead to the emergence of an exotic topological phase unique to certain magnetic order, termed antiferromagnetic topological insulators (AF TIs). A hallmark signature of AF TIs is the presence of a single surface Dirac cone--a feature typically associated with strong three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators--only on certain symmetry-preserving crystal terminations. However, the direct observation of this phenomenon poses a significant challenge. Here, we have theoretically and experimentally discovered a 3D photonic AF TI hosting a single surface Dirac cone protected by the combined symmetry of time reversal and half-lattice translation. Conceptually, our setup can be viewed as a z-directional stack of two-dimensional Chern insulators, with adjacent layers oppositely magnetized to form a 3D type-A AF configuration. By measuring both bulk and surface states, we have directly observed the symmetry-protected gapless single-Dirac-cone surface state, which shows remarkable robustness against random magnetic disorders. Our work constitutes the first realization of photonic AF TIs and photonic analogs of strong topological insulators, opening a new chapter for exploring novel topological photonic devices and phenomena that incorporate additional magnetic degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>High-power ultrafast radially and azimuthally polarized accelerating Airy beams and their particle-like lattice topologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerating Airy beams, known for their non-diffracting nature, self-healing properties, and curved propagation trajectories, are solutions to the paraxial wave equation. In this work, we theoretically and experimentally investigate nonuniform (radially and azimuthally) polarized vector Airy beams. We provide an analytical representation of their spatial spectra and examine their electromagnetic field distributions in space. To validate the theoretical model, we have used a nanograting inscribed inside a glass volume by a femtosecond laser to create geometrical phase elements, suitable for the realization of high-power ultrafast radially and azimuthally polarized vector Airy beams. We have conducted experiments that confirm the successful generation of high-power vector beams and have performed Stokes parameter measurements of these beams. Additionally, we explore both theoretically and experimentally their topology, identifying particle-like formations such as skyrmionic and antiskyrmionc accelerating lattices within the high-power ultrafast electric fields and their Stokes parameters.</description>

      <title>Sensing the vibration of non-reflective surfaces with 10-dB-squeezed-light enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser light with squeezed quantum uncertainty is a powerful tool for interferometric sensing. A routine application can be found in gravitational wave observatories. A significant quantum advantage is only achievable if a large fraction of the photons are actually measured. For this reason, quantum-enhanced vibrational measurements of strongly absorbing or scattering surfaces have not been considered so far. Here we demonstrate the strongly quantum-enhanced measurement of the frequency characteristics of surface vibrations in air by measuring the air pressure wave instead. Our squeezed laser beam, which simply passes the vibrating surface, delivers a sensitivity that an ultra-stable conventional light beam in the same configuration can only achieve with ten times the power. The pressure amplitude of a ultrasonic wave of just 0.12 mPa/ Hz was clearly visible with a spatial resolution in the millimetre range and a 1 kHz resolution bandwidth. We envision applications in sensor technology where distant, highly absorbing or optically inaccessible surface vibrations in air are to be measured with limited, e.g. eye-safe, light powers.</description>

      <title>Broadband transient full-Stokes luminescence spectroscopy with high sensitivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials emitting circularly polarized light (CPL) are highly sought after for applications ranging from efficient displays to quantum information technologies. Established methods for time-resolved CPL characterization have significant limitations, preventing in-depth photophysical insight necessary for materials development. We have designed and built a high-sensitivity (noise level 10^-4), broadband (ca. 400-900 nm), transient (ns resolution, ms range) full-Stokes (CPL and linear polarizations) spectroscopy setup. We demonstrate its broad applicability by measuring compounds with low dissymmetry factors across various timescales, as well as tracking the temporal evolution of linear polarization components alongside associated CPL artefacts. We have written open-source software and used stock optical components to make transient CPL spectroscopy practically accessible to a wide audience, enabling the study of chiral materials in numerous diverse applications.</description>

      <title>A neuromorphic camera for tracking passive and active matter with lower data throughput</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the merits of an event-based camera (EBC) for tracking of passive and, in particular, active matter. For passive matter, we tracked the Brownian motion of different microparticles and estimated their diffusion coefficient. For active matter, we explored the case of tracking murine spermatozoa and aimed to extract motility parameters from the motion of cells. This has applications in enhancing outcomes for clinical fertility treatments. Using the EBC, we obtain results equivalent to those from an sCMOS camera, yet achieve a reduction in file size of up to two orders of magnitude. This is important in the modern computer era, as it simplifies data acquisition and analysis. We believe the EBC is an excellent choice, particularly for long-term studies of active matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement distribution in quantum networks will enable next-generation technologies for quantum-secured communications, distributed quantum computing and sensing. Future quantum networks will require dense connectivity, allowing multiple parties to share entangled states in a reconfigurable manner, while long-distance connections are established through the teleportation of entangled states, namely entanglement swapping. However, developing flexible physical platforms that can distribute entanglement through a high-capacity and scalable architecture remains a significant challenge. Here we realise a multiplexed programmable network where entanglement is routed and teleported between four parties through a reconfigurable multi-port circuit operating on the transverse-spatial photonic degree-of-freedom. We harness the natural mode-mixing process inside a multi-mode fibre and place it between two programmable phase planes to implement high-dimensional operations for two independent photons carrying eight transverse-spatial modes. This complex-medium-based circuit allows for the control of a four-party state where high-fidelity entangled states can be simultaneously distributed over multiple channels with different on-demand configurations. Our design allows us to break away from the limited planar geometry and bypass the control and fabrication challenges of conventional integrated platforms. Our demonstration showcases the potential of this architecture for enabling quantum networks with scalable and versatile connectivity that is fully compatible with existing communications infrastructure.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency, high-count-rate 2D superconducting nanowire single-photon detector array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are the current leading technology for the detection of single-photons in the near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral regions, due to record performance in terms of detection efficiency, low dark count rate, minimal timing jitter, and high maximum count rates. The various geometry and design parameters of SNSPDs are often carefully tailored to specific applications, resulting in challenges in optimising each performance characteristic without adversely impacting others. In particular, when scaling to larger array formats, the key challenge is to manage the heat load generated by the many readout cables in the cryogenic cooling system. Here we demonstrate a practical, self-contained 64-pixel SNSPD array system which exhibits high performance of all operational parameters, for use in the strategically important SWIR spectral region. The detector is an 8x8 array of 27.5 x 27.8 {\mu}m pixels on a 30 {\mu}m pitch, which leads to an 80 -- 85% fill factor. At a wavelength of 1550nm, a uniform average per-pixel photon detection efficiency of 77.7% was measured and the observed system detection efficiency (SDE) across the entire array was 65%. A full performance characterisation is presented, including a dark count rate of 20 cps per pixel, full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) jitter of 100 ps per pixel, a 3-dB maximum count rate of 645 Mcps and no evidence of crosstalk at the 0.1% level. This camera system therefore facilitates a variety of picosecond time-resolved measurement-based applications that include biomedical imaging, quantum communications, and long-range single-photon light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and 3D imaging.</description>

      <title>Janus Bound States in the Continuum with Asymmetric Topological Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel topological defect called Janus bound states in the continuum (BICs), featuring asymmetric topological charges in upward and downward radiation channels. Our approach involves a photonic crystal slab (PCS) that initially exhibits both out-of-plane and in-plane mirror symmetry, and this PCS possesses one BIC at the \Gamma point and two BICs off the \Gamma point. By introducing certain perturbations that break the out-of-plane mirror symmetry, the two off-\Gamma BICs decompose into four circularly polarized states (C points) with identical topological charges (each with half the topological charge of the original BIC) while the at-\Gamma BIC is preserved. Then, we selectively manipulate the four C points associated with the downward radiation channel to converge at the at-\Gamma BIC, forming a Janus BIC with distinct topological charges for upward and downward radiation. By further introducing in-plane mirror symmetry perturbation, we can bring two of the C points with the same handedness and identical topological charges for upward radiation to merge into the Janus BIC. This process results in a Janus chiral BIC which exhibits large intrinsic chirality and an infinite Q factor. Janus BICs can induce distinct Pancharatnam-Berry phase singularities in momentum space for different incident channels, providing a new approach to control orbital angular momentum. Janus chiral BICs hold promise in enhancing direction-dependent and spin-dependent asymmetric light-matter interaction, opening new pathways for improving chirality-dependent operation for on-chip devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise spatial manipulation of particles via optical forces is essential in many research areas, ranging from biophysics to atomic physics. Central to this effort is the challenge of designing optical systems that are optimized for specific applications. Traditional design methods often rely on trial-and-error methods, or on models that approximate the particle as a point dipole, which only works for particles much smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic field. In this work, we present a general inverse design framework based on the Maxwell stress tensor formalism capable of simultaneously designing all components of the system, while being applicable to particles of arbitrary sizes and shapes. Notably, we show that with small modifications to the baseline formulation, it is possible to engineer systems capable of attracting, repelling, accelerating, oscillating, and trapping particles. We demonstrate our method using various case studies where we simultaneously design the particle and its environment, with particular focus on free-space particles and particle-metalens systems.</description>

      <title>Method for overcoming the finite space-bandwidth limitation of digital holograms in holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13098v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A digital hologram has a finite space-bandwidth, which determines the spatial resolution and angular field of view of its reconstructed image. However, higher space-bandwidth induces aliased replica patterns in the Fresnel diffraction. This study analyzes the spatial distribution of the angular spectrum in an undersampled hologram using angle modulation in the complex domain. The replica functions are identified as phase-modulated functions by multiples of the sampling frequency, with the spatial frequency range extending continuously from the original function into the regions of the replica functions. Simulations of optical imaging confirm the theoretical predictions, demonstrating that imaging performance beyond the space-bandwidth limitation of a digital hologram is achievable. Specifically, multiple diffraction fields have the orthogonal property, which enables the effective removal of high-order terms. This approach provides an alternative solution to overcome the constraints imposed by the finite space-bandwidth of digital holograms.</description>

      <title>Lifshitz tail states in non-Hermitian disordered photonic lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In lattices with uncorrelated on-site potential disorder, Anderson localization near the band edges can exhibit anomalously weak localization in the form of Lifshitz tail states. These states correspond to clusters of contiguous sites with nearly identical on-site energies, allowing excitations to extend significantly beyond the characteristic localization length determined by the inverse of Lyapunov exponent. Since Lifshitz tail states are rare events, with an exponentially small density of states, they are typically considered of limited practical importance. In this work, we demonstrate that when Anderson localization is induced by disorder in an imaginary on-site potential, Lifshitz tail states can dominate the system's dynamics and become experimentally observable. This phenomenon is illustrated through the Anderson-Bernoulli model in a non-Hermitian photonic lattice, shedding light on the unique interplay between disorder and non-Hermiticity in such systems</description>

Abstract: We consider an imaging scheme, inspired by microscopy, in which both correlation imaging and first-order intensity imaging can be performed simultaneously, to investigate the effects of strong turbulence on the two different kinds of images. The comparison between direct and correlation imaging in the presence of strong turbulence unambiguously revealed an advantage of the latter. Remarkably, this advantage, quantified by analyzing the visibility of periodic sample patterns, is more striking when the presence of turbulence becomes the dominant factor in determining the image resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the extensive use of electrochemiluminescence in sensing applications, its potential in lighting and display technology has been constrained by the low luminance and short operational lifetime of electrochemiluminescence devices (ECLDs). Here, we demonstrate a substantial enhancement in the luminance, efficiency, and operational longevity of ECLDs by introducing electrochemically induced hyperfluorescence (ECiHF) via electrogeneration of charge-transfer (CT) excimers and subsequent energy transfer to fluorescent acceptors. By assuming a double-decker arrangement of the electron donor and acceptor groups, the molecule TpAT-tFFO supports solution-state thermally activated delayed fluorescence from a CT excimer state and efficient energy transfer to the rubrene dye TBRb. Optimized ECLDs based on this material combination achieve an unprecedented luminance of 6,220 cd/m2 and their operational lifetime (LT50) at an initial luminance of 100 cd/m2 exceeds 20 minutes, more than 10-fold longer than other ECLDs with meaningful efficiency or brightness. We identify energy level alignment between the excimer and the emitter as a crucial factor for efficient ECiHF. In mixtures with energy gaps &gt; 0.5 eV, electron transfer results in reduced performance and renders the operation strongly dependent on applied voltage and frequency. By contrast, spectroelectrochemical analysis reveals that devices with favorable energy level alignment operate on a pure excimer mechanism across a wide range of frequencies. These findings highlight the innovative potential of ECiHF in improving the performance of ECLD, which can be widely applied in future commercial lighting solutions.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of 3D Nanophotonic Devices with Structural Integrity Using Auxiliary Thermal Solvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D additive manufacturing enables the fabrication of nanophotonic structures with subwavelength features that control light across macroscopic scales. Gradient-based optimization offers an efficient approach to design these complex and non-intuitive structures. However, expanding this methodology from 2D to 3D introduces complexities, such as the need for structural integrity and connectivity. This work introduces a multi-objective optimization method to address these challenges in 3D nanophotonic designs. Our method combines electromagnetic simulations with an auxiliary heat-diffusion solver to ensure continuous material and void connectivity. By modeling material regions as heat sources and boundaries as heat sinks, we optimize the structure to minimize the total temperature, thereby penalizing disconnected regions that cannot dissipate thermal loads. Alongside the optical response, this heat metric becomes part of our objective function. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm by designing two 3D nanophotonic devices. The first is a focusing element. The second is a waveguide junction, which connects two incoming waveguides for two different wavelengths into two outgoing waveguides, which are rotated by 90{\deg} to the incoming waveguides. Our approach offers a design pipeline that generates digital blueprints for fabricable nanophotonic materials, paving the way for practical 3D nanoprinting applications.</description>

      <title>Theory of Multimode Squeezed Light Generation in Lossy Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A unified theoretical approach to describe the properties of multimode squeezed light generated in a lossy medium is presented. This approach is valid for Markovian environments and includes both a model of discrete losses based on the beamsplitter approach and a generalized continuous loss model based on the spatial Langevin equation. For an important class of Gaussian states, we derive master equations for the second-order correlation functions and illustrate their solution for both frequency-independent and frequency-dependent losses. Studying the mode structure, we demonstrate that in a lossy environment no broadband basis without quadrature correlations between the different broadband modes exists. Therefore, various techniques and strategies to introduce broadband modes can be considered. We show that the Mercer expansion and the Williamson-Euler decomposition do not provide modes in which the maximal squeezing contained in the system can be measured. In turn, we find a new broadband basis that maximizes squeezing in the lossy system and present an algorithm to construct it.</description>

Abstract: Quantum emitters in solid-state materials are highly promising building blocks for quantum information processing and communication science. Recently, single-photon emission from van der Waals materials has been reported in transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride, exhibiting the potential to realize photonic quantum technologies in two-dimensional materials. Here, we report the generation of room temperature single-photon emission from exfoliated and thermally annealed single crystals of van der Waals {\alpha}-MoO3. The second-order correlation function measurement displays a clear photon antibunching, while the luminescence intensity exceeds 0.4 Mcts/s and remains stable under laser excitation. The theoretical calculation suggests that an oxygen vacancy defect is a possible candidate for the observed emitters. Together with photostability and brightness, quantum emitters in {\alpha}-MoO3 provide a new avenue to realize photon-based quantum information science in van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Partially Coherent Crystalline Undulator Radiation from a Positron Bunch Modulated via the SASE XFEL Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystalline undulator (CU), where the positrons of a bunch are channeled planarly, is considered. In contrast to channeling radiation, CU radiation (CUR) occurs due to the average sinusoidal motion of positrons. Taking into account the medium polarization, besides hard photons, soft photons are also generated. In the SASE XFEL process, microbunching occurs with a longitudinal size on the order of the wavelength of the stimulated radiation due to the interaction between positrons and generated photons at zero angle. These microbunches in CU will radiate coherently, and the radiation of the bunch will be partially coherent. Charged particles organized into a microbunch with a well-defined spatial phase distribution can emit coherent (synergistic or collective) radiation when the wavelength of the emitted radiation is comparable to or longer than the longitudinal size of the microbunch. The CU parameters, the spatial period and the amplitude, are selected to preserve both the channeling phenomenon of positrons and the coherence of CUR from positron microbunches. The gain of spontaneous radiation depends on the modulation depth of the microbunch, which is a critical parameter of the bunch and can also be determined through the proposed experiment. A numerical analysis has been conducted for a specific case involving CUR generated by a positron bunch modulated during the SASE XFEL, at a corresponding wavelength of the process.</description>

      <title>A simple model for entangled photon generation in resonant structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to engineer pairs of entangled photons is essential to quantum information science, and generating these states using spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in nano- and micrometer-scale materials offers numerous advantages. To properly engineer such sources, a reliable model describing nano- and micrometer-scale SPDC is necessary; however, such a theoretical description remains a challenge. Here, we propose a simplified model to describe SPDC in resonant structures, which considers the generation of photon pairs and the resonant enhancement of spectral bands to be separate processes, even though they actually occur simultaneously. We compare our simplified model to both the rigorous theory of SPDC in an etalon - a simple example of a resonant structure - and our experiments on SPDC in etalons and find agreement for low-gain SPDC. By simplifying the calculations required to generate photon pairs, our model promises to make designing complex resonant structures easier, and it promises to hasten the iteration of designs across the field of quantum state engineering.</description>
