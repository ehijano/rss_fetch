      <title>Discrete $Z_4$ symmetry in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the discrete $Z_4$ symmetry ${\hat {\bf i}}$, which takes place in the scenario of quantum gravity where the gravitational tetrads emerge as the order parameter. Under this symmetry operation $\hat {\bf i}$, the emerging tetrads are multiplied by the imaginary unit, $\hat {\bf i}\,e^a_\mu = - i e^a_\mu$. The existence of such symmetry and the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry are also supported by the consideration of the symmetry breaking scheme in the topological superfluid $^3$He-B. The order parameter $^3$He-B is the analogue of the tetrad field, but it has complex values. The $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry operation changes the phase of the complex order parameter by $\pi/2$, which corresponds to the $Z_4$ discrete symmetry in quantum gravity. We also considered the alternative scenario of the breaking of this $Z_4$ symmetry, in which the $\hat {\bf i}$-operation changes sign of the scalar curvature, $\hat {\bf i} \,{\cal R} = - {\cal R}$, and thus the Einstein-Hilbert action violates the $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry. In the alternative scenario of symmetry breaking, the gravitational coupling $K=1/16\pi G$ plays the role of the order parameter.</description>

      <title>Rise and Fall of Anderson Localization By Lattice Vibrations: A Time-Dependent Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intricate relationship between electrons and the crystal lattice is a linchpin in condensed matter, traditionally described by the Fr\"ohlich model encompassing the lowest-order lattice-electron coupling. Recently developed quantum acoustics emphasizing the wave nature of lattice vibrations has enabled the exploration of previously uncharted territories of electron-lattice interaction, not accessible with conventional tools such as perturbation theory. In this context, our agenda here is two-fold. First, we showcase the application of machine learning methods to categorize various interaction regimes within the subtle interplay of electrons and the dynamical lattice landscape. Second, we shed light on a nebulous region of electron dynamics identified by the machine learning approach and then attribute it to transient localization, where strong lattice vibrations result in a momentary Anderson prison for electronic wavepackets, later released by the evolution of the lattice. Overall, our research illuminates the spectrum of dynamics within the Fr\"ohlich model, such as transient localization, which has been suggested as a pivotal factor contributing to the mysteries surrounding strange metals. Furthermore, this paves the way for utilizing time-dependent perspectives in machine learning for designing materials with tailored electron-lattice properties.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian lattice gauge fields in the photonic synthetic frequency dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge fields provide a conceptual framework for the description of particles having spins. The theoretical importance of non-Abelian gauge fields motivates their experimental synthesis and explorations. Here, we demonstrate non-Abelian lattice gauge fields for photons. In the study of gauge fields, lattice models are essential for the understanding of their implications in extended systems. We utilize the platform of synthetic frequency dimensions, which enables the study of lattice physics in a scalable and programmable way. We observe Dirac cones at time-reversal-invariant momenta as well as the direction reversal of eigenstate trajectories associated with such Dirac cones. Both of them are unique signatures of non-Abelian gauge fields in our lattice system. Our results highlight the implications of non-Abelian gauge field in the study of topological physics and suggest opportunities for the control of photon spins and pseudospins.</description>

      <title>Electric-Field Control of Magnetic Skyrmion Chirality in a Centrosymmetric 2D van der Waals Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals magnets hosting topological magnetic textures, such as skyrmions, show promise for applications in spintronics and quantum computing. Electrical control of these topological spin textures would enable novel devices with enhanced performance and functionality. Here, using electron microscopy combined with in situ electric and magnetic biasing, we show that the skyrmion chirality, whether left-handed or right-handed, in insulating Cr2Ge2Te6, is controlled by external electric field direction applied during magnetic field cooling process. The electric-field-tuned chirality remains stable, even amid variations in magnetic and electric fields. Our theoretical investigation reveals that nonzero Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between the nearest neighbors, induced by the external electric field, change their sign upon reversing the electric field direction, thereby facilitating chirality selection. The electrical control of magnetic chirality demonstrated in this study can be extended to other non-metallic centrosymmetric skyrmion-hosting magnets, opening avenues for future device designs in topological spintronics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Memory effects on the current induced propagation of spin textures in NdCo$_5$/Ni$_8$Fe$_2$ bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilayers of NdCo$_5$/Ni$_8$Fe$_2$ can act as reconfigurable racetracks thanks to the parallel stripe domain configuration present in the hard magnetic material with weak perpendicular anisotropy (NdCo$_5$), and its imprint on the soft magnetic layer (Ni$_8$Fe$_2$). This pattern hosts spin textures with well defined topological charges and establishes paths for their deterministic propagation under the effect of pulsed currents, which has been studied as a function of externally applied fields by using Magnetic Transmission X-ray Microscopy. The experiments show guided vortex/antivortex propagation events within the Ni$_8$Fe$_2$ above a threshold current of $3\cdot10^{11}$ A/m$^2$. Opposite propagation senses have been observed depending on the topological charge of the spin texture, both in the remnant state and under an applied external field. Micromagnetic simulations of our multilayer reveal that the guiding effect and asymmetric propagation sense are due to the magnetic history of the hard magnetic layer. An exchange-bias-based memory effect acts as a magnetic spring and controls the propagation sense by favoring a specific orientation of the in plane magnetization, leading to a system which behaves as a hard-soft magnetic composite with reconfigurable capabilities for a controlled propagation of magnetic topological textures.</description>

      <title>The Schwinger-Keldysh Coset Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coset construction is a tool for systematically building low energy effective actions for Nambu-Goldstone modes. This technique is typically used to compute time-ordered correlators appropriate for $S$-matrix computations for systems in their ground state. In this paper, we extend this technique to the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, which enables one to calculate a wider variety of correlators and applies also to systems in a mixed state. We focus our attention on internal symmetries and demonstrate that, after identifying the appropriate symmetry breaking pattern, Schwinger-Keldysh effective actions for Nambu-Goldstone modes can be constructed using the standard rules of the coset construction. Particular emphasis is placed on the thermal state and ensuring that correlators satisfy the KMS relation. We also discuss explicitly the power counting scheme underlying our effective actions. We comment on the similarities and differences between our approach and others that have previously appeared in the literature. In particular, our prescription does not require the introduction of additional ``diffusive'' symmetries and retains the full non-linear structure generated by the coset construction. We conclude with a series of explicit examples, including a computation of the finite-temperature two-point functions of conserved spin currents in non-relativistic paramagnets, antiferromagnets, and ferromagnets. Along the way, we also clarify the discrete symmetries that set antiferromagnets apart from ferromagnets, and point out that the dynamical KMS symmetry must be implemented in different ways in these two systems.</description>
