      <title>SemantiCodec: An Ultra Low Bitrate Semantic Audio Codec for General Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing through audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the application of language modelling techniques to audio data. However, traditional codecs often operate at high bitrates or within narrow domains such as speech and lack the semantic clues required for efficient language modelling. Addressing these challenges, we introduce SemantiCodec, a novel codec designed to compress audio into fewer than a hundred tokens per second across diverse audio types, including speech, general audio, and music, without compromising quality. SemantiCodec features a dual-encoder architecture: a semantic encoder using a self-supervised AudioMAE, discretized using k-means clustering on extensive audio data, and an acoustic encoder to capture the remaining details. The semantic and acoustic encoder outputs are used to reconstruct audio via a diffusion-model-based decoder. SemantiCodec is presented in three variants with token rates of 25, 50, and 100 per second, supporting a range of ultra-low bit rates between 0.31 kbps and 1.43 kbps. Experimental results demonstrate that SemantiCodec significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art Descript codec on reconstruction quality. Our results also suggest that SemantiCodec contains significantly richer semantic information than all evaluated audio codecs, even at significantly lower bitrates. Our code and demos are available at https://haoheliu.github.io/SemantiCodec/.</description>

      <title>Who is Authentic Speaker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice conversion (VC) using deep learning technologies can now generate high quality one-to-many voices and thus has been used in some practical application fields, such as entertainment and healthcare. However, voice conversion can pose potential social issues when manipulated voices are employed for deceptive purposes. Moreover, it is a big challenge to find who are real speakers from the converted voices as the acoustic characteristics of source speakers are changed greatly. In this paper we attempt to explore the feasibility of identifying authentic speakers from converted voices. This study is conducted with the assumption that certain information from the source speakers persists, even when their voices undergo conversion into different target voices. Therefore our experiments are geared towards recognising the source speakers given the converted voices, which are generated by using FragmentVC on the randomly paired utterances from source and target speakers. To improve the robustness against converted voices, our recognition model is constructed by using hierarchical vector of locally aggregated descriptors (VLAD) in deep neural networks. The authentic speaker recognition system is mainly tested in two aspects, including the impact of quality of converted voices and the variations of VLAD. The dataset used in this work is VCTK corpus, where source and target speakers are randomly paired. The results obtained on the converted utterances show promising performances in recognising authentic speakers from converted voices.</description>

      <title>Active Learning with Task Adaptation Pre-training for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) has garnered increasing attention due to its wide range of applications in various fields, including human-machine interaction, virtual assistants, and mental health assistance. However, existing SER methods often overlook the information gap between the pre-training speech recognition task and the downstream SER task, resulting in sub-optimal performance. Moreover, current methods require much time for fine-tuning on each specific speech dataset, such as IEMOCAP, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with large-scale noisy data. To address these issues, we propose an active learning (AL)-based fine-tuning framework for SER, called \textsc{After}, that leverages task adaptation pre-training (TAPT) and AL methods to enhance performance and efficiency. Specifically, we first use TAPT to minimize the information gap between the pre-training speech recognition task and the downstream speech emotion recognition task. Then, AL methods are employed to iteratively select a subset of the most informative and diverse samples for fine-tuning, thereby reducing time consumption. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method \textsc{After}, using only 20\% of samples, improves accuracy by 8.45\% and reduces time consumption by 79\%. The additional extension of \textsc{After} and ablation studies further confirm its effectiveness and applicability to various real-world scenarios. Our source code is available on Github for reproducibility. (https://github.com/Clearloveyuan/AFTER).</description>

      <title>Distance Sampling-based Paraphraser Leveraging ChatGPT for Text Data Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been growing interest in audio-language retrieval research, where the objective is to establish the correlation between audio and text modalities. However, most audio-text paired datasets often lack rich expression of the text data compared to the audio samples. One of the significant challenges facing audio-text datasets is the presence of similar or identical captions despite different audio samples. Therefore, under many-to-one mapping conditions, audio-text datasets lead to poor performance of retrieval tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tackle the data imbalance problem in audio-language retrieval task. To overcome the limitation, we introduce a method that employs a distance sampling-based paraphraser leveraging ChatGPT, utilizing distance function to generate a controllable distribution of manipulated text data. For a set of sentences with the same context, the distance is used to calculate a degree of manipulation for any two sentences, and ChatGPT's few-shot prompting is performed using a text cluster with a similar distance defined by the Jaccard similarity. Therefore, ChatGPT, when applied to few-shot prompting with text clusters, can adjust the diversity of the manipulated text based on the distance. The proposed approach is shown to significantly enhance performance in audio-text retrieval, outperforming conventional text augmentation techniques.</description>

      <title>Visual and audio scene classification for detecting discrepancies in video: a baseline method and experimental protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a baseline approach and an experimental protocol for a specific content verification problem: detecting discrepancies between the audio and video modalities in multimedia content. We first design and optimize an audio-visual scene classifier, to compare with existing classification baselines that use both modalities. Then, by applying this classifier separately to the audio and the visual modality, we can detect scene-class inconsistencies between them. To facilitate further research and provide a common evaluation platform, we introduce an experimental protocol and a benchmark dataset simulating such inconsistencies. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in scene classification and promising outcomes in audio-visual discrepancies detection, highlighting its potential in content verification applications.</description>

      <title>Learning Expressive Disentangled Speech Representations with Soft Speech Units and Adversarial Style Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice conversion is the task to transform voice characteristics of source speech while preserving content information. Nowadays, self-supervised representation learning models are increasingly utilized in content extraction. However, in these representations, a lot of hidden speaker information leads to timbre leakage while the prosodic information of hidden units lacks use. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for expressive voice conversion called "SAVC" based on soft speech units from HuBert-soft. Taking soft speech units as input, we design an attribute encoder to extract content and prosody features respectively. Specifically, we first introduce statistic perturbation imposed by adversarial style augmentation to eliminate speaker information. Then the prosody is implicitly modeled on soft speech units with knowledge distillation. Experiment results show that the intelligibility and naturalness of converted speech outperform previous work.</description>

      <title>RGI-Net: 3D Room Geometry Inference from Room Impulse Responses in the Absence of First-order Echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Room geometry is important prior information for implementing realistic 3D audio rendering. For this reason, various room geometry inference (RGI) methods have been developed by utilizing the time-of-arrival (TOA) or time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) information in room impulse responses (RIRs). However, the conventional RGI technique poses several assumptions, such as convex room shapes, the number of walls known in priori, and the visibility of first-order reflections. In this work, we introduce the RGI-Net which can estimate room geometries without the aforementioned assumptions. RGI-Net learns and exploits complex relationships between low-order and high-order reflections in RIRs and, thus, can estimate room shapes even when the shape is non-convex or first-order reflections are missing in the RIRs. RGI-Net includes the evaluation network that separately evaluates the presence probability of walls, so the geometry inference is possible without prior knowledge of the number of walls.</description>

      <title>Dual-path Mamba: Short and Long-term Bidirectional Selective Structured State Space Models for Speech Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers have been the most successful architecture for various speech modeling tasks, including speech separation. However, the self-attention mechanism in transformers with quadratic complexity is inefficient in computation and memory. Recent models incorporate new layers and modules along with transformers for better performance but also introduce extra model complexity. In this work, we replace transformers with Mamba, a selective state space model, for speech separation. We propose dual-path Mamba, which models short-term and long-term forward and backward dependency of speech signals using selective state spaces. Our experimental results on the WSJ0-2mix data show that our dual-path Mamba models of comparably smaller sizes outperform state-of-the-art RNN model DPRNN, CNN model WaveSplit, and transformer model Sepformer.

      <title>A Few-Shot Learning Approach for Sound Source Distance Estimation Using Relation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.10561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the performance of few-shot learning, specifically meta learning empowered few-shot relation networks, over supervised deep learning and conventional machine learning approaches in the problem of Sound Source Distance Estimation (SSDE). In previous research on deep supervised SSDE, low accuracies have often resulted from the mismatch between the training data (from known environments) and the test data (from unknown environments). By performing comparative experiments on a sufficient amount of data, we show that the few-shot relation network outperforms other competitors including eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP). Hence it is possible to calibrate a microphone-equipped system, with a few labeled samples of audio recorded in a particular unknown environment to adjust and generalize our classifier to the possible input data and gain higher accuracies.</description>

      <title>Brilla AI: AI Contestant for the National Science and Maths Quiz</title>

Abstract: The African continent lacks enough qualified teachers which hampers the provision of adequate learning support. An AI could potentially augment the efforts of the limited number of teachers, leading to better learning outcomes. Towards that end, this work describes and evaluates the first key output for the NSMQ AI Grand Challenge, which proposes a robust, real-world benchmark for such an AI: "Build an AI to compete live in Ghana's National Science and Maths Quiz (NSMQ) competition and win - performing better than the best contestants in all rounds and stages of the competition". The NSMQ is an annual live science and mathematics competition for senior secondary school students in Ghana in which 3 teams of 2 students compete by answering questions across biology, chemistry, physics, and math in 5 rounds over 5 progressive stages until a winning team is crowned for that year. In this work, we built Brilla AI, an AI contestant that we deployed to unofficially compete remotely and live in the Riddles round of the 2023 NSMQ Grand Finale, the first of its kind in the 30-year history of the competition. Brilla AI is currently available as a web app that livestreams the Riddles round of the contest, and runs 4 machine learning systems: (1) speech to text (2) question extraction (3) question answering and (4) text to speech that work together in real-time to quickly and accurately provide an answer, and then say it with a Ghanaian accent. In its debut, our AI answered one of the 4 riddles ahead of the 3 human contesting teams, unofficially placing second (tied). Improvements and extensions of this AI could potentially be deployed to offer science tutoring to students and eventually enable millions across Africa to have one-on-one learning interactions, democratizing science education.</description>
