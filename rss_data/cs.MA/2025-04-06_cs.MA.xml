      <title>On Word-of-Mouth and Private-Prior Sequential Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social learning provides a fundamental framework in economics and social sciences for studying interactions among rational agents who observe each other's actions but lack direct access to individual beliefs. This paper investigates a specific social learning paradigm known as Word-of-Mouth (WoM), where a series of agents seeks to estimate the state of a dynamical system. The first agent receives noisy measurements of the state, while each subsequent agent relies solely on a degraded version of her predecessor's estimate. A defining feature of WoM is that the final agent's belief is publicly broadcast and adopted by all agents, in place of their own. We analyze this setting both theoretically and through numerical simulations, showing that some agents benefit from using the public belief broadcast by the last agent, while others suffer from performance deterioration.</description>

      <title>Do Large Language Models Solve the Problems of Agent-Based Modeling? A Critical Review of Generative Social Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in AI have reinvigorated Agent-Based Models (ABMs), as the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the emergence of ``generative ABMs'' as a novel approach to simulating social systems. While ABMs offer means to bridge micro-level interactions with macro-level patterns, they have long faced criticisms from social scientists, pointing to e.g., lack of realism, computational complexity, and challenges of calibrating and validating against empirical data. This paper reviews the generative ABM literature to assess how this new approach adequately addresses these long-standing criticisms. Our findings show that studies show limited awareness of historical debates. Validation remains poorly addressed, with many studies relying solely on subjective assessments of model `believability', and even the most rigorous validation failing to adequately evidence operational validity. We argue that there are reasons to believe that LLMs will exacerbate rather than resolve the long-standing challenges of ABMs. The black-box nature of LLMs moreover limit their usefulness for disentangling complex emergent causal mechanisms. While generative ABMs are still in a stage of early experimentation, these findings question of whether and how the field can transition to the type of rigorous modeling needed to contribute to social scientific theory.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Collective World Model for Emergent Communication and Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fully decentralized multi-agent world model that enables both symbol emergence for communication and coordinated behavior through temporal extension of collective predictive coding. Unlike previous research that focuses on either communication or coordination separately, our approach achieves both simultaneously. Our method integrates world models with communication channels, enabling agents to predict environmental dynamics, estimate states from partial observations, and share critical information through bidirectional message exchange with contrastive learning for message alignment. Using a two-agent trajectory drawing task, we demonstrate that our communication-based approach outperforms non-communicative models when agents have divergent perceptual capabilities, achieving the second-best coordination after centralized models. Importantly, our distributed approach with constraints preventing direct access to other agents' internal states facilitates the emergence of more meaningful symbol systems that accurately reflect environmental states. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of decentralized communication for supporting coordination while developing shared representations of the environment.</description>

      <title>Extending Data Spatial Semantics for Scale Agnostic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce extensions to Data Spatial Programming (DSP) that enable scale-agnostic programming for application development. Building on DSP's paradigm shift from data-to-compute to compute-to-data, we formalize additional intrinsic language constructs that abstract persistent state, multi-user contexts, multiple entry points, and cross-machine distribution for applications. By introducing a globally accessible root node and treating walkers as potential entry points, we demonstrate how programs can be written once and executed across scales, from single-user to multi-user, from local to distributed, without modification. These extensions allow developers to focus on domain logic while delegating runtime concerns of persistence, multi-user support, distribution, and API interfacing to the execution environment. Our approach makes scale-agnostic programming a natural extension of the topological semantics of DSP, allowing applications to seamlessly transition from single-user to multi-user scenarios, from ephemeral to persistent execution contexts, and from local to distributed execution environments.</description>

      <title>Distributed Linear Quadratic Gaussian for Multi-Robot Coordination with Localization Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of distributed coordination control for multi-robot systems (MRSs) in the presence of localization uncertainty using a Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) approach. We introduce a stochastic LQG control strategy that ensures the coordination of mobile robots while optimizing a performance criterion. The proposed control framework accounts for the inherent uncertainty in localization measurements, enabling robust decision-making and coordination. We analyze the stability of the system under the proposed control protocol, deriving conditions for the convergence of the multi-robot network. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experimental validation using Robotrium simulation experiments, showcasing the practical applicability of the control strategy in real-world scenarios with localization uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Inherent and emergent liability issues in LLM-based agentic systems: a principal-agent perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic systems powered by large language models (LLMs) are becoming progressively more complex and capable. Their increasing agency and expanding deployment settings attract growing attention over effective governance policies, monitoring and control protocols. Based on emerging landscapes of the agentic market, we analyze the potential liability issues stemming from delegated use of LLM agents and their extended systems from a principal-agent perspective. Our analysis complements existing risk-based studies on artificial agency and covers the spectrum of important aspects of the principal-agent relationship and their potential consequences at deployment. Furthermore, we motivate method developments for technical governance along the directions of interpretability and behavior evaluations, reward and conflict management, and the mitigation of misalignment and misconduct through principled engineering of detection and fail-safe mechanisms. By illustrating the outstanding issues in AI liability for LLM-based agentic systems, we aim to inform the system design, auditing and monitoring approaches to enhancing transparency and accountability.</description>

      <title>Agentic Knowledgeable Self-awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved considerable performance across various agentic planning tasks. However, traditional agent planning approaches adopt a "flood irrigation" methodology that indiscriminately injects gold trajectories, external feedback, and domain knowledge into agent models. This practice overlooks the fundamental human cognitive principle of situational self-awareness during decision-making-the ability to dynamically assess situational demands and strategically employ resources during decision-making. We propose agentic knowledgeable self-awareness to address this gap, a novel paradigm enabling LLM-based agents to autonomously regulate knowledge utilization. Specifically, we propose KnowSelf, a data-centric approach that applies agents with knowledgeable self-awareness like humans. Concretely, we devise a heuristic situation judgement criterion to mark special tokens on the agent's self-explored trajectories for collecting training data. Through a two-stage training process, the agent model can switch between different situations by generating specific special tokens, achieving optimal planning effects with minimal costs. Our experiments demonstrate that KnowSelf can outperform various strong baselines on different tasks and models with minimal use of external knowledge.

      <title>SynWorld: Virtual Scenario Synthesis for Agentic Action Knowledge Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the interaction between agents and their environments, agents expand their capabilities by planning and executing actions. However, LLM-based agents face substantial challenges when deployed in novel environments or required to navigate unconventional action spaces. To empower agents to autonomously explore environments, optimize workflows, and enhance their understanding of actions, we propose SynWorld, a framework that allows agents to synthesize possible scenarios with multi-step action invocation within the action space and perform Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) exploration to effectively refine their action knowledge in the current environment. Our experiments demonstrate that SynWorld is an effective and general approach to learning action knowledge in new environments. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/SynWorld.</description>

      <title>Programming Distributed Collective Processes in the eXchange Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent trends like the Internet of Things (IoT) suggest a vision of dense and multi-scale deployments of computing devices in nearly all kinds of environments. A prominent engineering challenge revolves around programming the collective adaptive behaviour of such computational ecosystems. This requires abstractions able to capture concepts like ensembles (dynamic groups of cooperating devices) and collective tasks (joint activities carried out by ensembles). In this work, we consider collections of devices interacting with neighbours and that execute in nearly-synchronised sense-compute-interact rounds, where the computation is given by a single program mapping sensing values and incoming messages to output and outcoming messages. To support programming whole computational collectives, we propose the abstraction of a distributed collective process, which can be used to define at once the ensemble formation logic and its collective task. We formalise the abstraction in the eXchange Calculus (XC), a core functional language based on neighbouring values (maps from neighbours to values) where state and interaction is handled through a single primitive, exchange, and provide a corresponding implementation in the FCPP language. Then, we exercise distributed collective processes using two case studies: multi-hop message propagation and distributed monitoring of spatial properties. Finally, we discuss the features of the abstraction and its suitability for different kinds of distributed computing applications.</description>

      <title>Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Techniques for coordination of multi-agent systems are vast and varied, often utilizing purpose-built solvers or controllers with tight coupling to the types of systems involved or the coordination goal. In this paper, we introduce a general unified framework for heterogeneous multi-agent coordination using the language of cellular sheaves and nonlinear sheaf Laplacians, which are generalizations of graphs and graph Laplacians. Specifically, we introduce the concept of a nonlinear homological program encompassing a choice of cellular sheaf on an undirected graph, nonlinear edge potential functions, and constrained convex node objectives, which constitutes a standard form for a wide class of coordination problems. We use the alternating direction method of multipliers to derive a distributed optimization algorithm for solving these nonlinear homological programs. To demonstrate the applicability of this framework, we show how heterogeneous coordination goals including combinations of consensus, formation, and flocking can be formulated as nonlinear homological programs and provide numerical simulations showing the efficacy of our distributed solution algorithm.</description>
