      <title>Cosmological scaling of precursor domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain wall (DW) networks have a large impact on cosmology and present interesting dynamics that can be controlled by various scaling regimes. In the first stage after spontaneous breaking of the discrete symmetry, the network is seeded with `DW precursors', the zeros of a tachyonic field. At sufficiently weak coupling, this stage can be quite long. The network is then driven to a non-relativistic scaling regime: in flat spacetime the correlation length grows like $L\sim t^{\kappa}$ with $\kappa=1/2$. We focus on the precursor regime in cosmology, assuming a power-law scale factor $a\propto t^\alpha$. We obtain the scaling exponent as a function of the external parameter, $\kappa(\alpha)$, by explicit computation in $1+1$ and $2+1$ dimensions, and find a smooth transition from nonrelativistic scaling with $\kappa\simeq 1/2$ for $\alpha\lesssim1/2$ to DW gas regime $\kappa \simeq \alpha$ for $\alpha\gtrsim1/2$, confirming previous arguments. The precise form of the transition $\kappa(\alpha)$ is surprisingly independent of dimension, suggesting that similar results should also be valid in $3+1$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the Carrollian Nature of the Light Front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in non-Lorentzian physics, we revisit the light-cone formulation of quantum field theories. We discuss some interesting subalgebras within the light-cone Poincar\'e algebra, with a key emphasis on the Carroll, Bargmann, and Galilean kinds. We show that theories on the light front possess a Hamiltonian of the magnetic Carroll type, thereby proposing a straightforward method for deriving magnetic Carroll Hamiltonian actions from Lorentzian field theories.</description>

      <title>Kerr Effective Black Hole Geometries in Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the explicit embedding of the effective Kerr spacetimes, which are pertinent to the vanishing of static Love numbers, soft hair descriptions of Kerr black holes, and low-frequency scalar-Kerr scattering amplitudes, as solutions within N = 2 supergravity. These spacetimes exhibit a hidden $SL(2, R) \times U (1)$ or $SO(4, 2)$ symmetry resembling the so called subtracted geometries with $SL(2, R) \times SL(2, R)$ symmetry, which accurately represent the near-horizon geometry of Kerr black holes and, as we will argue most accurately represents the internal structure of the Kerr black hole. To quantify the differences among the effective Kerr spacetimes, we compare their physical quantities, internal structures, and geodesic equations. Although their thermodynamic properties, including entropy, match those of Kerr, our study uncovers significant differences in the interiors of these effective Kerr solutions. A careful examination of the internal structure of the spacetimes highlights the distinctions between various effective Kerr geometries and their quasinormal spectra.</description>

      <title>QCD-Gravity double-copy in the Regge regime: shock wave propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work, we demonstrated a double-copy relation between inclusive gluon radiation in shock wave collisions of ultrarelativistic nuclei and inclusive graviton radiation in trans-Planckian gravitational shock wave collisions. We compute here the corresponding gravitational shock wave propagators in general relativity and demonstrate that they too obey a double copy relation to gluon shock wave propagators computed previously. These results provide key input in a renormalization group approach towards computing the high frequency radiation spectrum in close black hole encounters.</description>

      <title>Note on higher-group structure in 6d self-dual gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze higher-group structure of a 6d model coupled with a self-dual 2-form gauge field. This model is defined from 6d axion-electrodynamics with a 1-form Chern-Weil(CW) symmetry gauged dynamically. The gauging leads to a Green-Schwarz-West-Sagnotti(GSWS) term, which gives rise to an anomaly through a GSWS transformation acting on the 2-form gauge field. We cancel this anomaly by gauging a 3-form CW symmetry in 6d axion-electrodynamics. We find out the global symmetries in the resultant model and derive the gauge invariant action in the presence of the background gauge fields. It is argued that a discrete 1-form symmetry is anomalous because turning on the associated background gauge field causes quantum inconsistency due to an operator-valued ambiguity. Higher-group structure in this model that is manifested as a Green-Schwarz-like transformation for CW background gauge fields is discussed.</description>

      <title>Reissner-Nordstr\"om dyonic black holes with gauged scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For gauged scalar fields minimally coupled to Einstein-Maxwell theory, the Mayo-Bekenstein no-hair theorem can be circumvented when including appropriate scalar self-interactions, allowing static, electrically charged black holes to be endowed with (Abelian) gauged scalar hair. Here we show these spherically symmetric solutions can be extended to include a magnetic charge in a model with scalar multiplets. The resulting dyonic configurations share most of the properties of the electrically charged solutions, in particular satisfying the same {\it resonance} condition, with the existence of a mass gap with respect to the bald Reissner-Nordstr\"om dyonic black holes. A distinctive feature, however, is that no solitonic limit exists for a non-zero magnetic charge.</description>

      <title>A Scaling Relation, $Z_m$-type Deconfinement Phases and Imaginary Chemical Potentials in Finite Temperature Large-$N$ Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the effective potentials for the Polyakov loops in finite temperature SU$(N)$ gauge theories obey a certain scaling relation with respect to temperature in the large-$N$ limit. This scaling relation strongly constrains the possible terms in the Polyakov loop effective potentials. Moreover, by using the effective potentials in the presence of imaginary chemical potentials or imaginary angular velocities in several models, we find that phase transitions to $Z_m$-type deconfinement phases ($Z_m$ phase) occur, where the eigenvalues of the Polyakov loop are distributed $Z_m$ symmetrically. Physical quantities in the $Z_m$ phase obey the scaling properties of the effective potential. The models include Yang-Mills (YM) theories, the bosonic BFSS matrix model and ${\mathcal N}=4$ supersymmetric YM theory on $S^3$. Thus, the phase diagrams of large-$N$ gauge theories with imaginary chemical potentials are very rich and the stable $Z_m$ phase would be ubiquitous. Monte-Carlo calculations also support this. As a related topic, we discuss the phase diagrams of large-$N$ YM theories with real angular velocities in finite volume spaces.</description>

      <title>Embedding formalism for AdS superspaces in five dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard geometric description of $d$-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space is a quadric in ${\mathbb R}^{d-1,2}$ defined by $(X^0)^2 - (X^1)^2 - \dots - (X^{d-1})^2 + (X^d)^2 = \ell^2 = \text{const}$. In this paper we provide a supersymmetric generalisation of this embedding construction in the $d=5$ case. Specifically, a bi-supertwistor realisation is given for the ${\cal N}$-extended AdS superspace $\text{AdS}^{5|8\cal N}$, with ${\cal N}\geq 1$. The proposed formalism offers a simple construction of AdS super-invariants. As an example, we present a model for a massive superparticle in $\text{AdS}^{5|8\cal N}$ which is manifestly invariant under the AdS isometry supergroup $\mathsf{SU}(2,2|{\cal N})$.</description>

      <title>Stretched Horizon from Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it has been observed that the Hartle-Hawking correlators, a signature of smooth horizon, can emerge from certain heavy excited state correlators in the (manifestly non-smooth) BTZ stretched horizon background, in the limit when the stretched horizon approaches the real horizon. In this note, we develop a framework of quantizing the CFT modular Hamiltonian, that explains the necessity of introducing a stretched horizon and the emergence of thermal features in the AdS-Rindler and (planar) BTZ backgrounds. In more detail, we quantize vacuum modular Hamiltonian on a spatial segment of $S^{1}$. Unlike radial quantization, (Euclidean) time circles emerge naturally here which can be contracted smoothly to the `fixed points'(end points of the interval) of this quantization thus providing a direct link to thermal physics. To define a Hilbert space with discrete normalizable states and to construct a Virasoro algebra with finite central extension, a natural regulator ($\epsilon$) is needed around the fixed points. Eventually, in the dual description the fixed points correspond to the horizons of AdS-Rindler patch or (planar) BTZ and the cut-off being the stretched horizon. We construct a (Lorentzian) highest weight representation of that Virasoro algebra. We further demonstrate that two point function in a (vacuum) descendant state of the regulated Hilbert space will reproduce thermal answer in $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ limit which is analogous to the recent observation of emergent thermality in stretched horizon background. We also argue the thermal entropy of this quantization coincides with entanglement entropy of the subregion. Conversely, the microcanonical entropy corresponding to high energy density of states exactly reproduce the BTZ entropy. Quite remarkably, all these dominant high lying microstates are defined only at finite $\epsilon$ in the regulated Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Notes on heating phase dynamics in Floquet CFTs and Modular quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the connection between the heating phase of periodically driven CFTs and the Modular Hamiltonian of a subregion in the vacuum state. We show that the heating phase Hamiltonian corresponds to the Modular Hamiltonian, with the fixed points mapping to the endpoints of the subregion. In the bulk dual, we find that these fixed points correspond to the Ryu-Takayanagi surface of the AdS-Rindler wedge. Consequently, the entanglement entropy associated to the boundary interval within two fixed points exactly matches with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of AdS-Rindler. We observe the emergent Virasoro algebra in the boundary quantization of the Modular Hamiltonian has a striking similarity with the emerging near Horizon Virasoro algebra. This is a consequence of the fact that while obtaining the boundary Virasoro algebra, a cut-off with conformal boundary condition around the fixed point is introduced, which in the bulk is related to a stretched horizon, with an emergent two-dimensional conformal symmetry. We also argue that as one tunes the parameter space of Floquet Hamiltonians to transition from the non-heating to the heating phase the operator algebra type changes from Von Neumann type $I$ to $III_1$ factor, providing a non-equilibrium analogue of the Hawking-Page transition.</description>

      <title>A Double Copy of Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the color-kinematics duality for nonlinear sigma models with nonsymmetric cosets. The role of color is played by curvatures in field space. The duality between curvature and kinematics allows for a new double copy: the double copy of the nonlinear sigma model for nonsymmetric cosets is the general Galileon theory. We provide evidence for this new double copy of geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this brief note we calculate the entanglement entropy in $M^{\otimes N}/S_N$ symmetric orbifold CFTs in the presence of topological defects, which were recently constructed in \cite{Gutperle:2024vyp,Knighton:2024noc}. We consider both universal defects which realize $Rep(S_N)$ non-invertible symmetry and non-universal defects. We calculate the sub-leading defect entropy/g-factor for defects at the boundary entangling surface as well as inside it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study timelike and conventional entanglement entropy as potential probes of black hole singularities via the AdS/CFT correspondence. Using an analytically tractable example, we find characteristic behavior of holographic timelike entanglement entropy when the geometry involves a curvature singularity. We also observe interesting phenomena that, in some particular setups, holographic timelike and conventional entanglement entropy are determined from multiple complex saddle points, which fall outside the assumptions of the Lewkowycz-Maldacena type argument.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the couplings of the gravity supermultiplet (graviton and gravitino) of minimal $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUGRA following a constructive approach. Firstly, we use the master formulae that follows from considering the scaling behavior of the spinor variables under the little group. Secondly, we derive the 4-point couplings using BFCW. Then, we verify these results for the general 3-point interactions that can be derived using the KLT-type relations, i.e., they can be written as the square of the coupling of the gluons and gluinos. Finally, we consider SUGRA Compton effect for graviton-gravitino. For completeness, we present in the appendix the $\mathcal{N}=1$ Sugra lagrangian in the 2-component Weyl formalism, including the proofs of SUSY and gauge invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review some classic works on ground state entanglement entropy in $(1+1)$-dimensional free scalar field theory. We point out identifications between the methods for the calculation of entanglement entropy and we show how the formalism developed for the discretized theory can be utilized in order to obtain results in the continuous theory. We specify the entanglement spectrum and we calculate the entanglement entropy for the theory defined on an interval of finite length $L$. Finally, we derive the modular Hamiltonian directly, without using the modular flow, via the continuous limit of the expressions obtained in the discretized theory. In a specific coordinate system, the modular Hamiltonian assumes the form of a free field Hamiltonian on the Rindler wedge.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our study of integrable structures in large $N_c$ QCD$_2$ to a broad class of theories called the generalized QCD, which are given by the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}\propto {\rm tr}\,B\wedge F- {\rm tr}\,V(B)$ coupled to quarks in the fundamental representation. We recast the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the meson spectrum into a TQ-Baxter equation and determine a transfer matrix in a closed form for any given polynomial $V(B)$. Using this reformulation, we derive the asymptotic expansion of energy levels and wavefunctions. Examining the analytic structure of the spectrum as a function of the coefficients of $V(B)$, we determine the region of couplings where the theory admits a positive and discrete spectrum of mesons. Furthermore, we uncover a multi-sheeted structure with infinitely many multi-critical points, where several mesons become simultaneously massless. Lastly, we illustrate that this structure persists in the large-representation limit of the generalized QCD with the SU(2) gauge group.</description>

      <title>Linear-T Resistivity from Spatially Random Vector Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Patel et.al introduced a higher dimensional version of the SYK model with random coupling in Yukawa interaction to find the linear-$T$ resistivity. We test the universality of the mechanism by replacing the scalar with vector field in various dimensions. We find that it works for vector as well as scalar interaction, although the details are very different. However, this mechanism for the linear-$T$ resistivity works only in $(2+1)$ dimension not in higher dimension independent of the interaction type. Based on these results, we explore the role of spatial random disorder and find a simple understanding how such random scattering converts the Fermi liquid to the strange metal by changing the behavior of the self-energies of involved boson and fermion.</description>

Abstract: The M5-brane has been argued to potentially provide much-needed theoretical underpinning for various non-perturbative phenomena in strongly-coupled quantum systems and yet the primary non-perturbative effect already in its classical on-shell formulation has received little attention: The flux-quantization of the higher gauge field on its worldvolume.
  This problem appears subtle because of (1a.) the notorious self-duality of the 3-form flux density in the small field limit, combined with (1b.) its highly non-linear self-duality for strong fields, and (2a.) the twisting of its Bianchi identity by the pullback of the 11d SuGra C-field flux density, which (2b.) is subject to its own subtle flux quantization law on the ambient spacetime.
  These subtleties call into question the tacit assumption that the M5 brane's 3-flux is quantized in ordinary cohomology and hence leaves open the rather fundamental question of what the M5-brane's worldvolume higher gauge field really is.
  Here we characterize the valid quantization laws of the M5-brane's 3-flux in (non-abelian) generalized twisted cohomology. The key step is to pass to super-spacetime and there to combine the character map with the "super-embedding"-construction of the on-shell M5-brane fields, of which we give a rigorous and streamlined re-rederivation.
  We show that one admissible quantization law of the 3-flux on M5-branes is by 4-Cohomotopy-twisted 3-Cohomotopy, as predicted by "Hypothesis H". Besides quantizing the bulk fluxes (G4,G7) and the brane's H3-flux themselves, this law also implies the (level-)quantization of the induced Page-charge/Hopf-WZ term on the M5-brane, necessary for its action functional to be globally well-defined.
  Finally, we demonstrate how with this flux quantization imposed, there generically appear skyrmionic solitons on M5-branes and anyonic topological quantum states on open M5-branes.</description>

      <title>Brownian Gaussian Unitary Ensemble: non-equilibrium dynamics, efficient $k$-design and application in classical shadow tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and extensively study a Brownian generalization of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (BGUE). Our analysis begins with the non-equilibrium dynamics of BGUE, where we derive explicit analytical expressions for various one-replica and two-replica variables at finite $N$ and $t$. These variables include the spectral form factor and its fluctuation, the two-point function and its fluctuation, out-of-time-order correlators (OTOC), the second R\'enyi entropy, and the frame potential for unitary 2-designs. We discuss the implications of these results for hyperfast scrambling, emergence of tomperature, and replica-wormhole-like contributions in BGUE. Next, we investigate the low-energy physics of the effective Hamiltonian for an arbitrarily number of replicas, deriving long-time results for the frame potential. We conclude that the time required for the BGUE ensemble to reach $k$-design is linear in $k$, consistent with previous findings in Brownian SYK models. Finally, we apply the BGUE model to the task of classical shadow tomography, deriving analytical results for the shadow norm and identifying an optimal time that minimizes the shadow norm, analogous to the optimal circuit depth in shallow-circuit shadow tomography.</description>

Abstract: A short review of expansion by regions is presented. It is a well-known strategy to obtain an expansion of a given multiloop Feynman integral in a given limit where some kinematic invariants and/or masses have certain scaling measured in powers of a given small parameter. Prescriptions of this strategy are formulated in a simple geometrical language and are illustrated through simple examples.</description>

      <title>Holographic spectral function of fermion in instantonic plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the gauge-gravity duality, we investigate the fermionic correlation function in the D(-1)-D3 brane system which describes the instantonic plasma in holography. In this system, the charge of the D(-1) brane as the D-instanton gives the gluon condensate. To simplify the holographic setup, we first reduce briefly the ten-dimensional supergravity background produced by D(-1)-D3-branes to an equivalently five-dimensional background. Then using the standard method for computing the Green function in the AdS/CFT dictionary, we derive the equations for the fermionic correlation functions and solve them numerically with the infalling boundary condition. Our numerical results illustrate that the fermionic correlation function as spectral function includes two branches of the dispersion curves whose behavior is very close to the results obtained from the method of hard thermal loop. And the effective mass generated by the medium effect of fermion splits into two values due to the spin-dependent interactions induced by instantons. Therefore, this work in holography demonstrates the instantonic configuration is very influential to the fermionic plasmino in plasma.</description>

      <title>Quiver Polymerisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two new diagrammatic techniques on $3d\;\mathcal N=4$ quiver gauge theories, termed chain and cyclic quiver polymerisation are introduced. These gauge a diagonal $\mathrm{SU}/\mathrm{U}(k)$ subgroup of the Coulomb branch global symmetry of a quiver (or pair of quivers) with multiple legs. The action on the Coulomb branch is that of a $\mathrm{SU}/\mathrm{U}(k)$ hyper-K\"ahler quotient. The polymerisation techniques build and generalise known composition methods from class $\mathcal S$. Polymerisation is used to generate a wide range of magnetic quivers from various physical contexts. These include polymerisation constructions for Kronheimer-Nakajima quivers, which generalise the ADHM construction for the moduli space of $k\;\mathrm{SU}(N)$ instantons on $\mathbb C^2$ to A-type singularities. Also a polymerisation construction of the magnetic quiver for the $6d\;\mathcal N=(1,0)$ coming from two $\frac{1}{2}$ M5 branes probing an $E_6$ Klein singularity. We find a method of extending magnetic quivers for Class $\mathcal S$ theories to cure the incomplete Higgsing that arises when gluing punctures into the loops associated with higher genus theories. Other novel constructions include a unitary magnetic quiver for the closure of a height four nilpotent orbit of $\mathrm{SO}(7)$. We explore the relationships between the Coulomb and Higgs branches of quivers under polymerisation.</description>

      <title>New construction of a vacuum doubly rotating black ring by the Ehlers transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Ehlers transformation, we derive an exact solution for a doubly rotating black ring in five-dimensional vacuum Einstein theory. It is well-known that the vacuum Einstein theory with three commuting Killing vector fields can be reduced to a non-linear sigma model with $SL(3,{\mathbb R})$ target space symmetry. As shown previously by Giusto and Saxena, the $SO(2,1)$ subgroup in the $SL(3,{\mathbb R})$ can generate a rotating solution from a static solution while preserving asymptotic flatness. This so-called Ehlers transformation actually transforms the five-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole into the five-dimensional Myers-Perry black hole. However, unlike the case with the black hole, applying this method directly to the static black ring or the Emparan-Reall black ring, does not yield a regular rotating black ring due to the emergence of a Dirac-Misner string singularity. To solve this undesirable issue, we use a singular vacuum solution of a rotating black ring/lens that already possesses a Dirac-Misner string singularity as the seed solution for the Ehlers transformation. The resulting solution is regular, indicating the absence of curvature singularities, conical singularities, orbifold singularities, Dirac-Misner string singularities, and closed timelike curves both on and outside the horizon. We show that this solution obtained by the Ehlers transformation coincides precisely with the Pomeransky-Sen'kov solution. We expect that applying this method to other theories may lead to the finding of new exact solutions, such as solutions for black lenses and capped black holes, as well as black ring configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the continuous phase transition and thermodynamic observables in the three-dimensional Euclidean $SU(2)$ principal chiral field model with the triad tensor renormalization group (tTRG) and the anisotropic tensor renormalization group (ATRG) methods. Using these methods, we find results that are consistent with previous Monte Carlo estimates and the predicted renormalization group scaling of the magnetization close to criticality. These results bring us one step closer to studying finite-density QCD in four dimensions using tensor network methods.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Third Harmonic of a Vacuum Response in a Subcritical Laser Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a nonlinear response of the physical vacuum by the example of the third harmonic in radiation of the electron-positron-photon plasma excited by a strong time dependent electric field at the focus spot of counterpropagating laser pulses. The investigation was developed within the framework of the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon kinetic theory nonperturbatively describing vacuum creation of the quasiparticle electron-positron plasma (EPP) and different channels of its interaction with the photon subsystem in the single-photon approximation that are opened in the presence of a strong semiclassical field. We investigate the radiation of EPP in the annihilation channel on the basis of the well known approximations and compare the obtained result with the semiclassical radiation of the plasma oscillations. In the high-frequency range for large adiabaticity parameter the quantum radiation dominates in comparison with the semiclassical one.</description>

Abstract: We construct stationary, rotating black binaries in general relativity with a positive cosmological constant. We consider identical black holes with either aligned or anti-aligned spins. Both cases have less entropy than the corresponding single Kerr/Schwarzschild de Sitter black hole with the same total angular momentum and cosmological horizon entropy. Our solutions establish continuous non-uniqueness in general relativity without matter. They also provide initial data for the spinning binary merger problem (when orbital angular momentum is added).</description>

      <title>A spin chain with non-Hermitian $\mathscr{PT}-$symmetric boundary couplings: exact solution, dissipative Kondo effect, and phase transitions on the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an exactly solvable $\mathscr{PT}-$symmetric non-Hermitian model where a spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ isotropic quantum Heisenberg spin chain is coupled to two spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ Kondo impurities at its boundaries with coupling strengths that are complex conjugates of each other. Solving the model by means of a combination of the Bethe Ansatz and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques, we show that the model exhibits three distinct boundary phases: a $\mathscr{PT}$ symmetric phase with a dissipative Kondo effect, a phase with bound modes and spontaneously broken $\mathscr{PT}$ symmetry, and a phase with an effectively unscreened spin (i.e. a free local moment). In the Kondo and the unscreened phases, the $\mathscr{PT}-$symmetry is unbroken, and hence all states have real energies, whereas in the bound mode phases, in addition to the states with real energies, there exist states with complex energy eigenvalues that appear in complex conjugate pairs, signaling spontaneous breaking of the $\mathscr{PT}-$symmetry. The exact solution is used to provide an accessible benchmark for DMRG with a non-Hermitian matrix product operator representation that demonstrates an accuracy comparable to its Hermitian limit thus showing the power of DMRG to handle non-Hermitian many body calculations.</description>

      <title>Complete Positivity and Thermal Relaxation in Quadratic Quantum Master Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a systematic method for deriving quantum master equations that satisfy the requirements of a completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) map, further describing thermal relaxation processes. In this paper, we assume that the quantum master equation is obtained through the canonical quantization of the generalized Brownian motion proposed in [Physics Letters A, 494, 129277 (2024)]. At least classically, this dynamics describes the thermal relaxation process regardless of the choice of the system Hamiltonian. The remaining task is to identify the parameters ensuring that the quantum master equation meets complete positivity. We limit our discussion to many-body quadratic Hamiltonians and establish a CPTP criterion for our quantum master equation. This criterion is useful for applying our quantum master equation to models with interaction such as a network model, which has been used to investigate how quantum effects modify heat conduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories of gravity are considered to be competitors to Einstein's theory of general relativity for the description of classical gravity, as they are used to build feasible models for cosmic inflation. These theories can be formulated both in the Jordan and Einstein frame, which are related by a Weyl transformation with a field transformation, known together as a frame transformation. These theories formulated in the above two frames are often considered to be equivalent from the point of view of classical theory. However, this is no longer true from the quantum field theoretical perspective. In the present article, we show that the Ward identities derived in the above two frames are not connected through the frame transformation. This shows that the quantum field theories formulated in these two frames are not equivalent to each other. Moreover, this inequivalence is also shown by comparing the effective actions derived in these two frames.</description>

Abstract: We investigated the Goon--Penco (GP) relation on higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes with an arbitrary cosmological constant. It was found that the GP relation retained its form in four- and higher-dimensional spacetimes. Thus, the reactions in the black holes are universal with respect to the dimensionality. Furthermore, the GP relation was found to be universal on any state of the black hole including near-extremal and near-Nariai cases. Thus, this study showed that the GP relation was prevalent for higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes with an arbitrary cosmological constant regardless of the initial state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The information paradox suggests that the black hole loses information when it emits radiation. In this way, the spectrum of radiation corresponds to a mixed (non-pure) quantum state even if the internal state generating the black-hole is expected to be pure in essence. In this paper we propose an argument solving this paradox by understanding the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking when the black-hole selects one among the many possible ground states, emitting then radiation as a consequence of it. Here the particle operator number is the order parameter. This mechanism explains the connection between the density matrix corresponding to the pure state describing the black-hole state and the density matrix describing the spectrum of radiation (mixed quantum state). From this perspective, we can recover the black-hole information from the superposition principle applied to the different possible order parameters (particle number operators).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the newly developed technique of inverse quantum hamiltonian reduction to investigate the representation theory of the simple affine vertex algebra $\mathsf{A}_{2}(\mathsf{u},2)$ associated to $\mathfrak{sl}_{3}$ at level $\mathsf{k} = -3+\frac{\mathsf{u}}{2}$, for $\mathsf{u}\ge3$ odd. Starting from the irreducible modules of the corresponding simple Bershadsky-Polyakov vertex operator algebras, we show that inverse reduction constructs all irreducible lower-bounded weight $\mathsf{A}_{2}(\mathsf{u},2)$-modules. This proceeds by first constructing a complete set of coherent families of fully relaxed highest-weight $\mathsf{A}_{2}(\mathsf{u},2)$-modules and then noting that the reducible members of these families degenerate to give all remaining irreducibles. Using this fully relaxed construction and the degenerations, we deduce modular S-transforms for certain natural generalised characters of these irreducibles and their spectral flows. With this modular data in hand, we verify that the (conjectural) standard Verlinde formula predicts Grothendieck fusion rules with nonnegative-integer multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Exact black hole solutions in scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Relativity allows for a unique black hole solution, characterized by its mass M, angular momentum J, and electric charge Q. Black holes in General Relativity are thus said to have no hair, that is, no other independent physical quantity (no-hair theorem). Despite the numerous successes of General Relativity, some limitations remain, like the central singularity possessed by black holes, where the curvature of spacetime becomes infinite. Modified theories of gravity try to solve some of these shortcomings. This thesis tests the no-hair theorem in a popular modification of gravity, called scalar-tensor theories, where a unique degree of freedom (a scalar field) is added on top of the usual metric of spacetime of General Relativity. Using various symmetries, new black holes, called hairy black holes, are obtained. Some of them evade strongly the no-hair theorem, being characterized by a new quantity (primary scalar hair), distinct from M, J or Q. An interesting progress is also achieved, since in certain cases, the usual singularity disappears: the curvature of spacetime remains bounded even at the core of the black hole. Moreover, theoretical links are established between scalar-tensor theories (which take place in the usual four dimensions of spacetime), and theories of gravity in higher dimensions, by Kaluza-Klein reduction. Finally, certain particular properties of scalar-tensor theories enable to transform initial black hole solutions into other solutions with very distinct geometry, like wormholes or non-stationary black holes.</description>

      <title>Kaniadakis entropy in extreme gravitational and cosmological environments: a review on the state-of-the-art and future prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kaniadakis ($\kappa$-deformed) statistics is being widely used for describing relativistic systems with non-extensive behavior and/or interactions. It is built upon a one-parameter generalization of the classical Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy, possessing the latter as a particular sub-case. Recently, Kaniadakis model has been adapted to accommodate the complexities of systems under the influence of gravity. The ensuing framework exhibits a rich phenomenology that allows for a deeper understanding of the most extreme conditions of the Universe. Here we present the state-of-the-art of $\kappa$-statistics, discussing its virtues and drawbacks at different energy scales. Special focus is dedicated to gravitational and cosmological implications, including effects on the expanding Universe in dark energy scenarios. This review highlights the versatility of Kaniadakis paradigm, demonstrating its broad application across various fields and setting the stage for further advancements in statistical modeling and theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Antisymmetric tensor influence on charged black hole lensing phenomena and time delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the gravitational lensing of a charged black hole (spherically symmetric) within the context of Lorentz violation triggered by an antisymmetric tensor field. Our calculations consider two different scenarios: the weak and strong deflection limits. For the weak deflection limit, we employ the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to obtain our results. In the strong deflection limit, we utilize the Tsukamoto methodology, which provides measurable outcomes such as relativistic image positions and magnifications. Applying the latter methodology, we analyze the gravitational lensing by Sagittarius $A^{*}$ and derive the related observables, which are expressed as functions of the Lorentz violation parameter. Finally, the time delay is addrressed as well.</description>

      <title>Exploring wormhole solutions with global monopole charge in the context of $f(Q)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential existence of traversable wormholes influenced by a global monopole charge within the $f(Q)$ gravity framework. To elucidate the characteristics of these wormholes, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of wormhole solutions employing three different forms of redshift function under a linear $f(Q)$ model. Wormhole shape functions were derived for barotropic, anisotropic, and isotropic Equations of State (EoS) cases. However, in the isotropic EoS case, the calculated shape function failed to satisfy the asymptotic flatness condition. Additionally, we observed that our obtained shape functions adhered to the flaring-out conditions under an asymptotic background for the remaining EoS cases. Furthermore, we examined the energy conditions at the wormhole throat with a radius $r_0$. We noted the influences of the global monopole's parameter $\eta$, the EoS parameter $\omega$, and $n$ in violating energy conditions, particularly the null energy conditions. Finally, we conducted a stability analysis utilizing the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equation and found that our obtained wormhole solution is stable.</description>

      <title>Particle production in HRG with thermodynamically consistent EoS and partially deformable hadrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we analyze several strange as well as non-strange relative hadronic yields obtained in the ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions (URHIC) experiments over a wide range of centre-of-mass collision energy ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$). We invoke the formation of a hot and dense hadronic resonance gas (HRG) in the final stage following the URHIC. We use an earlier proposed thermodynamically consistent approach for obtaining the equation of state (EoS) of a hadronic resonance gas (HRG). It takes into account an important aspect of the hadronic interaction, viz., the hadronic hard-core repulsion, by assigning hard-core volumes to the hadrons, leading to an excluded volume (EV) type effect. We have invoked the bag model approach to assign hard-core volumes to baryons (antibaryons) while treating mesons to be point particles. We employ ansatz to obtain the dependence of the temperature and baryon chemical potential of the HRG system on the centre-of-mass energy in the URHIC. We also find strong evidence of double freeze-out scenario, corresponding to baryons (antibaryons) and mesons, respectively. Strangeness (anti-strangeness) imbalance factor is also seen to play an important role in explaining the ratio of strange hadrons to the non-strange ones. The HRG model can explain the experimental data on various relative hadronic multiplicities quite satisfactorily over a wide range of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, ranging from the lowest RHIC energies to the highest LHC energies for the set of the model parameters obtaining the best theoretical fit to the experimental data by minimizing the $\chi^{2}$/dof value.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the influence of graviton fluctuations on the inflationary spectrum with a Kucha\v{r}-Torre clock</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the search for a coherent and consistent formulation to describe quantum gravity corrections to Quantum Field Theory. We implement two fundamental ingredients discussed in previous analyses: on one hand, the construction of the Wentzel-Kramer-Brillouin and Born-Oppenheimer picture for the Wheeler-DeWitt theory of gravity and matter by using a reference fluid as physical clock; on the other hand, we explicitly separate in the metric field its own purely classical contribution from the quantum graviton degrees of freedom. This allows to derive, by the expansion in a Planckian parameter, a unitary theory properly evaluating the Quantum Field Theory modifications in the considered regime. More specifically, we recover at zero order the standard theory on curved space-time after averaging over the graviton sector. The physical corrections are induced at first order by (quantum) gravitons, thought as the slow-varying component of the system, as opposed to the fast quantum matter and reference fluid. The genuine contribution due to gravitons, non-factorizable into an independent phase, provides a coherent quantum gravity modification on Quantum Field Theory. We show this by determining the predicted inflationary spectrum during an exact de Sitter phase of the primordial Universe, finding a breaking of the scale invariant morphology even when the inflation potential is modelled by a cosmological constant term. Remarkably, the behavior of such non-scale-invariant spectrum overlaps predictions previously obtained in literature by neglecting non-unitary terms emerging in those formulations. In this respect, the present model provides a satisfactory regularization of such approaches, by virtue of a more realistic construction of the physical clock for the total (gravity + matter) quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Brownian Motion in the Hilbert Space of Quantum States and the Stochastically Emergent Lorentz Symmetry: A Fractal Geometric Approach from Wiener Process to Formulating Feynman's Path-Integral Measure for Relativistic Quantum Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.09855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to provide a consistent, finite-valued, and mathematically well-defined reformulation of the Feynman path-integral measure for quantum fields obtained by studying the Wiener stochastic process in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of quantum states. This reformulation will undoubtedly have a crucial role in formulating quantum gravity within a mathematically well-defined framework. In fact, the present study is fundamentally different from any previous research on the relationship between the Feynman path-integral and the Wiener stochastic process. In this research, we focus on the fact that the classic Wiener measure is no longer applicable in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces due to fundamental differences between displacements in low and extremely high dimensions. Thus, an analytic norm motivated by the role of the fractal functions in the Wilsonian renormalization approach is worked out to properly characterize Brownian motion in the Hilbert space of quantum states on a compact flat manifold. This norm, the so-called fractal norm, pushes the rougher functions, or physically the quantum states with higher energies, to the farther points of the Hilbert space until the fractal functions as the roughest ones are moved to infinity. Implementing the Wiener stochastic process with the fractal norm, results in a modified form of the Wiener measure called the Wiener fractal measure, which is a well-defined measure for the Feynman path-integral formulation of quantum fields. ...</description>

      <title>Brownian Motion in the Hilbert Space of Quantum States along with the Ricci Flow and Stochastically Emergent Einstein-Hilbert Action: Formulating a Well-Defined Feynman Path-Integral Measure for Quantum Fields in the Presence of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.09860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to interpret the background gravitational effects appearing in quantum field theory on curved space-time by studying the Brownian motion of quantum states along with the Hamilton-Perelman Ricci flow. It has been shown that the Wiener measure automatically contains the Einstein-Hilbert action and the path-integral formulation of the scalar quantum field theory on curved space-time at the first order of local approximations. This provides a well-defined formulation of the path-integral measure for quantum field theory in the presence of gravity. However, we establish that the emergence of Einstein-Hilbert action is independent of the matter field interactions and is a merely entropic/geometric effect stemming from the nature of the Ricci flow of the universe geometry. We also extract an explicit formula for the cosmological constant in terms of the Ricci flow and the Hamilton theorem for 3-manifolds. Then, we discuss the cosmological features of the FLRW solution in the LambdaCDM Model via the derived equations of the Ricci flow. We also argue the correlation between our formulations and the entropic aspects of gravity. Finally, we provide some theoretical evidence that proves the second law of thermodynamics is the basic source of gravity and probably a more fundamental concept.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the imaginary-time formalism for field theories in thermal equilibrium in uniformly accelerating frames. We show that under a Wick rotation of Minkowski spacetime, the Rindler event horizon shrinks to a point in a two-dimensional subspace tangential to the acceleration direction and the imaginary time. We demonstrate that the accelerated version of the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition implies an identification of all spacetime points related by integer-multiple rotations in the tangential subspace about this Euclidean Rindler event-horizon point, with the rotational quanta defined by the thermal acceleration, $\alpha = a/T$. In the Wick-rotated Rindler hyperbolic coordinates, the KMS relations reduce to standard (anti-)periodic boundary conditions in terms of the imaginary proper time (rapidity) coordinate. Our findings pave the way to study, using first-principle lattice simulations, the Hawking-Unruh radiation in geometries with event horizons, phase transitions in accelerating Early Universe and early stages of quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: We show backreaction of quantum fields on black hole geometries can trigger new thermal phase transitions. Specifically, we study the phase behavior of the three-dimensional quantum-corrected static BTZ black hole, an exact solution to specific semi-classical gravitational equations due to quantum conformal matter, discovered through braneworld holography. Focusing on the canonical ensemble, for large backreaction, we find novel reentrant phase transitions as the temperature monotonically increases, namely, from thermal anti-de Sitter space to the black hole and back to thermal anti-de Sitter. The former phase transition is first-order, a quantum analog of the classical Hawking-Page phase transition, while the latter is zeroth-order and has no classical counterpart.</description>

      <title>Spacetime-Localized Response in Quantum Critical Spin Systems: Insights from Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, certain quantum many-body systems in $d$-dimensions are equivalent to gravitational theories in $(d+1)$-dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetimes. When a massless particle is sent from the AdS boundary to the bulk curved spacetime, it reaches another point of the boundary after a time lag. In the dual quantum system, it should appear as if quasiparticles have been transferred between two separated points. We theoretically demonstrate that this phenomenon, which we call "spacetime-localized response," is actually observed in the dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model near the quantum critical point. This result suggests that, if we can realize a holographic spin system in a laboratory, the experimental probing of the emergent extra-dimension is possible by applying a designed stimulus to a quantum many-body system, which is holographically equivalent to sending a massless particle through the higher-dimensional curved bulk geometry. We also discuss possible experimental realizations using Rydberg atoms in an optical tweezers array.</description>

Abstract: Generalised Complex Geometry provides a natural interpretation of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry conditions for warped solutions of type II supergravity as differential equations on polyforms on the internal manifold. Written in this language the supersymmetry conditions correspond to calibration conditions for probe D-branes: D-string, domain-wall or space-filling branes, depending on the directions they span in the non-compact four-dimensional space. The BPS condition corresponding to the calibration of space-filling D-branes has been reformulated by Tomasiello, eliminating the explicit dependence on the metric. We generalise this derivation to the case of non-supersymmetric backgrounds violating the domain-wall and D-string calibration conditions. We use this reformulation to derive constraints that the ten-dimensional solutions with BPS space-filling sources must respect in order to dimensionally reduce to solutions of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity with non-vanishing F-terms and potentially non-vanishing D-terms. We give the equations of motion for the class of type II vacua satisfying these constraints in the language of pure spinors. We investigate how restrictive these constraints are for the class of type IIB SU$(3)$ backgrounds with BPS space-filling O5-planes.</description>

Abstract: We consider 't Hooft anomalies of four-dimensional gauge theories whose fermion matter content admits $Spin_G(4)$ generalized spin structure, with $G$ either gauged or a global symmetry. We discuss methods to directly compute $w_2\cup w_3$ 't Hooft anomalies involving Stiefel-Whitney classes of gauge and flavor symmetry bundles that such theories can have on non-spin manifolds, e.g. $M_4=\mathbb{CP}^2$. Such anomalies have been discussed for $SU(2)$ gauge theory with adjoint fermions, where they were shown to give an effect that was originally found in the Donaldson-Witten topological twist of ${\cal N}=2$ SYM theory. We directly compute these anomalies for a variety of theories, including general $G$ gauge theories with adjoint fermions, $SU(2)$ gauge theory with fermions in general representations, and $Spin(N)$ gauge theories with fundamental matter. We discuss aspects of matching these and other 't Hooft anomalies in the IR phase where global symmetries are spontaneously broken, in particular for general $G_{\rm gauge}$ theory with $N_f$ adjoint Weyl fermions. For example, in the case of $N_f=2$ we discuss anomaly matching in the IR phase consisting of $h^\vee _{G_{\rm gauge}}$ copies of a $\mathbb{CP}^1$ non-linear sigma model, including for the $w_2w_3$ anomalies when formulated with $Spin_{SU(2)_{\rm global}}(4)$ structure.</description>

Abstract: We devise new boundary conditions for the near-horizon geometries of extremal BTZ and Kerr black holes, as well as for the ultra-cold limit of the Kerr-de Sitter black hole. These boundary conditions are obtained as the higher-dimensional uplift of recently proposed boundary conditions in two-dimensional gravity. Their asymptotic symmetries consist in the semi-direct product of a Virasoro and a current algebra, of which we determine the central extensions.</description>

Abstract: We study the relation between the quantum integrable systems derived from the dimer graphs and five dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories on $S^1 \times \mathbb{R}^4$. We construct integrable systems based on new dimer graphs obtained from modification of hexagon dimer diagram. We study the gauge theories in correspondence to the newly proposed integrable systems. By examining three types of defects -- a line defect, a canonical co-dimensional two defect and a monodromy defect -- in five-dimensional gauge theory with $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry and $\Omega_{\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2}$-background. We identify, in the $\varepsilon_2 \to 0$ limit, the canonical co-dimensional two defect satisfying the Baxter T-Q equation of the generalized $A$-type dimer integrable system, and the monodromy defect as its common eigenstate of the commuting Hamiltonians, with the eigenvalues being the expectation value of the BPS Wilson loop in the anti-symmetric representation of the bulk gauge group.</description>

Abstract: We present a new derivation of gravitational entropy functionals in higher-curvature theories of gravity using corner terms that are needed to ensure well-posedness of the variational principle in the presence of corners. This is accomplished by cutting open a manifold with a conical singularity into a wedge with boundaries intersecting at a corner. Notably, our observation provides a rigorous definition of the action of a conical singularity that does not require regularization. For Einstein gravity, we compute the R\'enyi entropy of gravitational states with either fixed-periodicity or fixed-area boundary conditions. The entropy functional for fixed-area states is equal to the corner term, whose extremization follows from the variation of the Einstein action of the wedge under transverse diffeomorphisms. For general Lovelock gravity the entropy functional of fixed-periodicity states is equal to the Jacobson--Myers (JM) functional, while fixed-area states generalize to fixed-JM-functional states, having a flat spectrum. Extremization of the JM functional is shown to coincide with the variation of the Lovelock action of the wedge. For arbitrary $F$(Riemann) gravity, under special periodic boundary conditions, we recover the Dong--Lewkowycz entropy for fixed-periodicity states. Since the variational problem in the presence of corners is not well-posed, we conjecture the generalization of fixed-area states does not exist for such theories without additional boundary conditions. Thus, our work suggests the existence of entropy functionals is tied to the existence of corner terms which make the Dirichlet variational problem well-posed.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau periods for black hole scattering in classical general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high-precision description of black hole scattering in classical general relativity using the post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion requires the evaluation of single-scale Feynman integrals at increasing loop orders. Up to 4PM, the scattering angle and the impulse are expressible in terms of polylogarithmic functions and Calabi-Yau (CY) two-fold periods. As in QFT, periods of higher dimensional CY n-folds are expected at higher PM order. We find at 5PM in the dissipative leading order self-force sector (5PM-1SF) that the only non-polylogarithmic functions are the K3 periods encountered before and the ones of a new hypergeometric CY three-fold. In the 5PM-2SF sector further CY two- and three-fold periods appear. Griffiths transversality of the CY period motives allows to transform the differential equations for the master integrals into $\epsilon$-factorized form and to solve them in terms of a well controlled function space, as we demonstrate in the 5PM-1SF sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study loop amplitudes in anti de-Sitter space via the spectral representation. We consider loops of spinning fields and in particular gauge fields, and derive various identities connecting different families of loop diagrams, at different number of loops, different spins, different masses. Such identities are useful for the computation of Witten diagrams. Considering the theory of large-$N_f$ conformal scalar QED defined on AdS space, we derive an analytic expression for the exact 4-point correlation function at sub-leading order in $\frac{1}{N_f}$. Additionally, we derive analytic expressions for bulk 2-point functions and boundary 4-point functions for various families of diagrams, which we denote as ``blob diagrams''. Finally we study 4-point ladder diagrams with spinning fields, and we derive integral expressions for the spectral representation of a $k$-loop ladder diagram.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an analogue of the Drinfel'd double for algebroids associated with the $O(D,D+n)$ gauged double field theory (DFT). We show that algebroids defined by the twisted C-bracket in the gauged DFT are built out of a direct sum of three (twisted) Lie algebroids. They exhibit a "tripled", which we call the extended double, rather than the "doubled" structure appeared in (ungauged) DFT. We find that the compatibilities of the extended doubled structure result not only in the strong constraint but also the additional condition in the gauged DFT. We establish a geometrical implementation of these structures in a $(2D+n)$-dimensional product manifold and examine the relations to the generalized geometry for heterotic string theories and non-Abelian gauge symmetries in DFT.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in a cyclic Universe: resilience through cycles and vacuum state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generalised calculation for the spectrum of primordial tensor perturbations in a cyclic Universe, making no assumptions about the vacuum state of the theory and accounting for the contribution of tensor modes produced in the dark energy phase of the previous cycle. We show that these modes have minimal impact on the spectrum observed in the current cycle, except for corrections on scales as large as the comoving Hubble radius today. These corrections are due to sub-horizon modes produced towards the end of the dark energy phase, persisting into the ekpyrotic phase of the next cycle as additional quanta. In relation to the vacuum state, we argue that non-Bunch-Davies quanta can easily overwhelm the energy density driving the dark energy phase, potentially compromising the model. Therefore, avoiding backreaction effects sets restrictive constraints on deviations away from the Bunch-Davies vacuum during this phase, limiting the overall freedom to consider alternative vacua in the cyclic Universe.</description>

Abstract: Comformally flat spacetime converts the Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime into a z-dependent metric. We take advantage of this metric to solve Dirac equations in the AdS geometry analytically, including Dirac, Majorana, Dirac tachyon and Majorana tachyon. Constraints on Majorana wavefunctions limit the mass. Besides, there gives rise flatlands and Majorana particles hop in between, just mimicking the D-brane stack and open strings. Furthermore, a plausible way of ion-trapped experiment is suggested.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of renormalization group flows on line defects that can be described by a generalized free field with ordered planar contractions on the line. They are realized, for example, in large $N$ gauge theories with matter in the fundamental representation and arise generically in non-relativistic CFTs. We analyze the flow exactly and compute the change in the $g$-function between the UV and IR fixed points. We relate the result to the change in the two-point function of the displacement operator and check the monotonicity of the defect entropy along the flow analytically. Finally, we give a general realization of this type of flow starting from the direct sum of the IR fixed point and a trivial line. This type of defect renormalization group flow parallels the well-studied case of double-trace flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the Casimir effect of a rough membrane within the framework of theories that break Lorentz symmetry. We consider two constant Aether vectors: one timelike and other spacelike, simultaneously. We employ an appropriate change of coordinates such that the membrane assumes a completely flat border and the remaining terms associated with the roughness are considered as part of the potential. Quantum fluctuations are induced by a scalar quantum field subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions. The spectrum is obtained through perturbation theory and regularized using the $\zeta$--function method. We provide an explicit example of a membrane with periodic boundaries. The presence of Aether vectors has a significant impact on the dominant term of the Casimir effect, while roughness only affects the secondary terms. Additionally, we examine the finite-temperature case.</description>

      <title>Unconstrained Lagrangian Formulation for Bosonic Continuous Spin Theory in Flat Spacetime of Arbitrary Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14118v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have discovered two unconstrained forms of free Lagrangian for continuous spin(CS) theory in arbitrary flat spacetime dimension for bosonic case. These Lagrangians, unlike that by Schuster and Toro, do not include delta functions and are conventional. The first form consists of five kinds of totally symmetric helicity fields and one kind of gauge parameter. By introducing auxiliary creation and annihilation operators, each is combined into a state vector in Fock space, including all ranks one by one. The Lagrangian imposes no constraints, such as trace conditions, on these fields or the gauge parameter field. Additionally, the Lagrangian does not contain higher-order derivative terms. In the limit as CS parameter $\mu$ approaches zero, it naturally reproduces a Lagrangian for helicity fields in higher spin(HS) theory, known as unconstrained quartet formulation. Permitting third-order derivatives, we also obtain the second unconstrained form of Lagrangian that can be written in terms of three kinds of fields, including $\mu$, similar to the formulation by Francia and Sagnotti. Partial gauge fixing and partial use of equation of motion(EOM) on this Lagrangian yield a Fronsdal-like Lagrangian with a single double-traceless field, including $\mu$. By imposing further gauge fixing on the field in the EOM with respect to divergence and trace, we confirm the reproduction of the modified Wigner equations already known in literature.</description>

Abstract: We propose that generalized symmetries in some string-constructed QFTs are given by twisted K-theory, so as to be manifestly compatible with T-duality. We thus have even-form and odd-form symmetries determined by $K^*_N(\partial X)$, the twisted K-theory as D-brane charges on the asymptotic boundary $\partial X$ of internal geometry $X$ with twist class $N$. For these QFTs, "$p$-form symmetries" are no longer separately well-defined for individual $p$, but instead mixed up. We discuss 6D ADE-type (2,0) SCFTs and some 6d (1,0) LSTs as examples and demonstrate their twisted K-theoretic symmetries to be compatible with T-duality.</description>

      <title>On Holographic Vacuum Misalignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a bottom-up holographic model that provides the dual description of a strongly coupled field theory, in which the spontaneous breaking of an approximate global symmetry yields the SO(5)/SO(4) coset relevant to minimal composite-Higgs models. The gravity background is completely regular and smooth, and has an end of space that mimics confinement on the field theory side. We add to the gravity description a set of localised boundary terms, that introduce additional symmetry-breaking effects, capturing those that would result from coupling the dual strongly coupled field theory to an external, weakly coupled sector. Such terms encapsulate the gauging of a subgroup of the global $SO(5)$ symmetry of the dual field theory, as well as additional explicit symmetry-breaking effects. We show how to combine spurions and gauge fixing and how to take the appropriate limits, so as to respect gauge principles and avoid violations of unitarity.
  The interplay of bulk and boundary-localised couplings leads to the breaking of the SO(5) symmetry to either its SO(4) or SO(3) subgroup, via vacuum misalignment. In field theory terms, the model describes the spontaneous breaking of a SO(4) gauge symmetry to its SO(3) subgroup. We expose the implications of the higgsing phenomenon by computing the spectrum of fluctuations of the model, which we interpret in four-dimensional field-theory terms, for a few interesting choices of parameters. We conclude by commenting on the additional steps needed to build a realistic composite Higgs model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By applying the braneworld model, we investigate the time evolution of two-point functions holographically in expanding universes. In order to explain the FLRW cosmologies, we take into account a $p$-brane gas geometry. When we take the boundary of a $p$-brane gas geometry as the braneworld we are living in, $p$-branes are detected as $(p-1)$-dimensional objects to an observer living in the braneworld. These objects lead to the FLRW cosmology which is related to the radial motion of the braneworld in the $p$-brane gas geometry. Utilizing this $p$-brane gas geometry, we investigate the time-dependent two-point functions of FLRW cosmologies. For $p=4$, we reproduce the known two-point functions of the dS space and find a new analytic two-point function for $p=2$ which corresponds to an expanding universe with uniformly distributed cosmic strings. Moreover, we show that the two-point function suppresses in the late time era with a specific power that is associated with the equation of state parameter of the uniformly distributed matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum mechanical theory of quantum spaces described by large $N$ noncommutative geometry as a model for quantum gravity. The theory admits fuzzy sphere as static solution. Over the fuzzy geometry, the quantum mechanics of the fermions is given by a sum of oscillators with equal frequency. The energy state where exactly half of the Fermi sea is filled contains the maximal amount of degeneracy. This state of the fuzzy sphere obeys the mass-radius relation of a Schwarzschild black hole if the fuzzy sphere is identified with the black hole horizon. Moreover the set of states in the Fermi sea gives precisely the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We thus propose that quantum black holes are described by fuzzy spheres with a half-filled Fermi sea in our theory. We also consider a system of two fuzzy spheres by embedding them as blocks in the matrix quantum mechanics. When the distance $r$ between the two fuzzy spheres is small, the total energy of the system can be computed using perturbation theory. We show that in the leading order of large $N$ limit, the interaction energy depends on the product of the black holes masses and the Newton constant exactly as in Newton gravity. To extract the correct $r$ dependence in the long range, a resummation of all the large $N$ corrections is needed. We outline how Newton gravity for static sources may be reproduced in the long distance limit. We also show that the interaction energy is generally finite in the short distance limit, suggesting that the black hole singularity in general relativity is removed in our quantum description of black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the renormalization of scale-free quadratic gravity coupled to the bumblebee field and its potential for dynamically breaking Lorentz symmetry. We conduct one-loop renormalization of the model and calculate the associated renormalization group functions. Additionally, we compute the one-loop effective potential for the bumblebee field, revealing that it acquires a non-trivial vacuum expectation value induced by radiative corrections - a phenomenon known as the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. This spontaneous breaking of scale invariance arises from the non-vanishing vacuum expectation value of the bumblebee field, implicating Lorentz symmetry violation. Consequently, the non-minimal coupling between the bumblebee and gravitational fields results in a spontaneous generation of the Einstein-Hilbert term due to radiative corrections, thereby linking the Planck scale to Lorentz violation phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Any four-dimensional Supersymmetric Quantum Field Theory with eight supercharges can be associated to a certain complex symplectic manifold called the "K-theoretic Coulomb branch" of the theory. The collection of K-theoretic Coulomb branches include many complex phase spaces of great interest, including in particular the "character varieties" of complex flat connections on a Riemann surface. The SQFT definition endows K-theoretic Coulomb branches with a variety of canonical structures, including a deformation quantization. In this paper we introduce a canonical "Schur" quantization of K-theoretic Coulomb branches. It is defined by a variant of the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, applied to protected Schur correlation functions of half-BPS line defects. Schur quantization produces an actual quantization of the complex phase space. As a concrete application, we apply this construction to character varieties in order to quantize Chern-Simons gauge theory with a complex gauge group. Other applications include the definition of a new quantum deformation of the Lorentz group, and the solution of certain spectral problems via dualities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.09888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dyson series is an infinite sum of multi-dimensional time-ordered integrals, which serves as a formal representation of the quantum time-evolution operator in the interaction-picture. Using the mathematical tool of divided differences, we introduce an alternative representation for the series that is entirely free from both time ordering and integrals. In this new formalism, the Dyson expansion is given as a sum of efficiently-computable divided differences of the exponential function, considerably simplifying the calculation of the Dyson expansion terms, while also allowing for time-dependent perturbation calculations to be performed directly in the Schr{\"o}dinger-picture. We showcase the utility of this novel representation by studying a number of use cases. We also discuss several immediate applications.</description>

      <title>Effects of quantum fluctuations of the metric on a braneworld</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adopting the premise that the expected value of the quantum fluctuating metric is linear, i.e., $\langle g^{\mu\nu}\rangle=\alpha g^{\mu\nu}$, we analyze the modified gravity theory induced by the Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to a matter field. This approach engenders the $f(R,T)$ gravity used to investigate the braneworld. In this scenario, considering a thick brane, the influence of metric fluctuations on brane dynamics is investigated. Consequently, one shows how the metric fluctuations influence the vacuum states. This influence has repercussions for modifying the brane energy and the asymptotic profile of the matter field. After noticing these modifications, we analyzed the most likely and stable structures from the matter field. One performs this analysis considering the theoretical measure of differential configurational entropy.</description>

      <title>Violation of C/CP Symmetry Induced by a Scalar Field Emerging from a Two-Brane Universe: A Gateway to Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10637v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A model of baryogenesis is introduced where our usual visible Universe is a 3-brane coevolving with a hidden 3-brane in a multidimensional bulk. The visible matter and antimatter sectors are naturally coupled with the hidden matter and antimatter sectors, breaking the C/CP invariance and leading to baryogenesis occurring after the quark-gluon era. The issue of leptogenesis is also discussed. The symmetry breaking spontaneously occurs due to the presence of an extra scalar field supported by the $U(1)\otimes U(1)$ gauge group, which extends the conventional electromagnetic gauge field in the two-brane universe. Observational consequences are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02081v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the closed form expression for the metric perturbation around de Sitter spacetime generated by a matter source below Hubble scale both in generalized harmonic gauge and in Bondi gauge up to quadrupolar order in the multipolar expansion, including both parities (i.e. both mass and current quadrupoles). We demonstrate that such a source causes a displacement memory effect close to future infinity that originates, in the even-parity sector, from a $\Lambda$-BMS transition between the two non-radiative regions of future infinity.</description>

      <title>Non-stationary difference equation and affine Laumon space II: Quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Shakirov's non-stationary difference equation, when it is truncated, implies the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov ($q$-KZ) equation for $U_{\mathsf v}(A_1^{(1)})$ with generic spins. Namely we can tune mass parameters so that the Hamiltonian acts on the space of finite Laurent polynomials. Then the representation matrix of the Hamiltonian agrees with the $R$-matrix, or the quantum $6j$ symbols. On the other hand, we prove that the $K$ theoretic Nekrasov partition function from the affine Laumon space is identified with the well-studied Jackson integral solution to the $q$-KZ equation. Combining these results, we establish that the affine Laumon partition function gives a solution to Shakirov's equation, which was a conjecture in our previous paper. We also work out the base-fiber duality and four dimensional limit in relation with the $q$-KZ equation.</description>

      <title>Traversing a kinetic pole during inflation: primordial black holes and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an inflationary kinetic function with an integrable pole that is traversed during inflation. This scenario leads to enhanced spectra of primordial scalar inhomogeneities with detectable signals: formation of primordial black holes (that could explain Dark Matter) and scalar-induced gravitational waves (that could reproduce the recent Pulsar Timing Array observation, or predict signals in future detectors such as LISA or ET). Spectral signatures depend on whether the inflaton mass dimension at the pole is above or below 2. Values mildly below 2 allow a big power spectrum enhancement with a mild tuning. Finally, we discuss the possibility that a kinetic pole can arise as anomalous dimension of the inflaton due to quantum effects of Planckian particles that become light at some specific inflaton field value.</description>

      <title>Area-metric gravity revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Area metrics are an intriguing generalization of length metrics which appears in several quantum-gravity approaches. We describe the space of diffeomorphism-invariant area-metric actions quadratic in fluctuations and derivatives. A general theory is found to be specified by four parameters, two of which are mass parameters for the non-length degrees of freedom. We find that a two-parameter subclass of theories exhibits an additional shift symmetry of the kinetic term, and leads to a ghost-free graviton propagator for the effective theory obtained after integrating out the non-length degrees of freedom. One of the two parameters determines the strength of parity violations, the other defines a mass parameter for the non-length degrees of freedom. The same type of action has been found to appear from modified Plebanski theory and in the continuum limit of (effective) spin foams.
  We moreover find that area-metric actions in Lorentzian (but not in Euclidean) signature feature wrong-sign kinetic and mass terms for the non-length degrees of freedom. Nevertheless, despite a coupling of these degrees of freedom to the length metric, the linearized dynamics turns out to be stable for the above subclass of actions.</description>

      <title>A Complete Set of 4-Point Amplitudes in the Constructive Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a complete set of 4-point amplitudes in the constructive Standard Model at tree level. Any 4-point amplitude can be obtained from the results presented here by a suitable choice of masses, a permutation of the particles (by crossing symmetry), and a reversal of the momenta of the outgoing particles. We have validated all of these amplitudes by comparing with Feynman diagrams for a variety of masses, scattering energy and angles, and helicities of the photons and gluons, when they are in the initial states. The standard constructive techniques work for these amplitudes without the need for any contact terms and indeed, contact terms are not allowed. Only three 4-point vertices are used (allowed), involving the Higgs boson and the W and Z bosons. When external photons or gluons are present, the amplitude simplifies to a single spinor-product structure, present in the numerator. In a few cases, however, the propagator structure is more complex, with different terms depending on the charge or color structure. In the case of internal photons or gluons, we find that the massless limit of a massive photon or gluon diagram gives the correct result in all cases. We have additionally found that using the $x$ factor directly gives the correct result in all cases and agrees with the massless limit calculation.</description>

      <title>Improved Constraints on the Variation of the Weak Scale from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an improved calculation of the light element abundances in the framework of Big Bang nucleosynthesis as a function of the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$. We compare the methods of our calculation to previous literature including the recently published work of Burns et al. [1]. The PDG result for the $^4$He abundance can be explained within $2\sigma$ by $-0.014 \leq \delta v / v \leq 0.026$, for deuterium we find the constraint $-0.005 \leq \delta v / v \leq -0.001$. These bounds are more stringent than what was found earlier.</description>

      <title>Radiation reaction in weakly magnetized black holes: can the tail term be ignored in the strong field regime?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study radiation from charged particles in circular motion around a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field. In curved space, the radiation reaction force is described by the DeWitt-Brehme equation, which includes a complicated, non-local tail term. We show that, contrary to some claims in the literature, this term cannot, in general, be neglected. We account for self-force effects directly by calculating the electromagnetic energy flux at infinity and on the horizon. The radiative field is obtained using black hole perturbation theory. We solve the relevant equations analytically, in the low-frequency and slow-motion approximation, as well as numerically in the general case. Our results show that great care must be taken when neglecting the tail term, which is often fundamental to capture the dynamics of the particle: in fact, it only seems to be negligible when the magnetic force greatly dominates the gravitational force, so that the motion is well described by the Abraham--Lorentz--Dirac equation. We also report a curious "horizon dominance effect" that occurs for a radiating particle in a circular orbit around a black hole (emitting either scalar, electromagnetic or gravitational waves): for fixed orbital radius, the fraction of energy that is absorbed by the black hole can be made arbitrarily large by decreasing the particle velocity.</description>

      <title>Dyons with phase $\delta_{\theta}=n\theta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper (Heras in Eur. Phys. J. Plus 138: 329, 2023), we have demonstrated that when a dyon encircles an infinitely long solenoid enclosing electric and magnetic fluxes, its wave function accumulates a quantum phase invariant under electromagnetic duality transformations. In this paper, we show that this phase, in conjunction with the Witten effect, gives rise to a topological phase proportional to the vacuum angle $\theta$ and thereby connected with CP violation. We show that this phase becomes quantised in a vacuum state $\delta_{\theta}=n\theta$ and that the most general vacuum state associated with this quantisation identifies with an Abelian form of the $\theta$-vacua. We discuss two hypothetical interference effects in the vacuum where the angle $\theta$ could manifest.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Skyrmions: from lumps to supercompactons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic Skyrmion is described by one control parameter and one length scale. We study the two extreme limits of the control parameter - infinitely large and vanishing - and find that the magnetic Skyrmion becomes a "restricted" magnetic Skyrmion and an O(3) sigma model lump, respectively. Depending on the potential under consideration, the restricted limit manifests differently. In the case of the Zeeman term, the restricted magnetic Skyrmion becomes a "supercompacton" that develops a discontinuity, whereas for the Zeeman term to the power 3/2 it becomes a normal compacton. In both the lump and the restricted limit the solution is given in exact explicit form. We observe that the case of the Zeeman term squared, which can also be understood as a special combination of the Zeeman term and the easy-plane potential - realizable in the laboratory, the analytically exact solution for all values of the coupling - including the BPS case - is also of the lump type. Finally, we notice that certain materials (e.g. Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si or Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Ge) have a rather large control parameter $\epsilon$ of order 100, making the restricted limit a suitable rough approximation.</description>

      <title>Shear Viscosity of an $N$-Component Gas Mixture using the Chapman--Enskog Method under Anisotropic Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analytical Chapman-Enskog formula for calculating the shear viscosity $\eta$ of a relativistic ideal gas, such as a massless quark-gluon plasma, has consistently demonstrated good agreement with the numerical results obtained using the Green-Kubo relation under both isotropic and anisotropic two-body scatterings. However, past analyses of massless, multicomponent quark-gluon plasma have focused on an effective single-component "gluon gas." The Chapman-Enskog formula for multicomponent mixtures with nonzero yet adjustable masses was previously developed for simpler cases of isotropic scatterings. This study aims to obtain the Chapman-Enskog shear viscosity formula for a massless, multicomponent mixture under general anisotropic scatterings. Since the shear viscosity depends on a linearized collision kernel, an approximation formula for the linearized collision kernel is derived under elastic and anisotropic $l+k\rightarrow l+k$ scatterings. This derived approximation agrees very well with the isotropic two-body kernels provided in previous works for both like and different species. Furthermore, for multicomponent mixtures beyond two species types, an alternative expansion method of the $N$-component Chapman-Enskog viscosity is presented. This is applied to a two-component "binary" mixture and compared with the conventional formula for binary viscosity. The agreement between the two, for interacting and noninteracting binary mixtures, varies from moderate to well.</description>
