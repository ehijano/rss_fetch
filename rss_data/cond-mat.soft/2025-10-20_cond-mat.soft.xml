      <title>Active Ionic Fluxes Induce Symmetry Breaking in Charge-Patterned Nanochannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological systems rely on autonomous modes of charge transport to transmit signals, whereas conventional artificial systems typically depend on external fields, such as voltage or pressure gradients, limiting their adaptability. Here we investigate nanochannels in which an electrolyte is confined by symmetric boundary configurations combining patterned surface charge with active ionic fluxes. We show that the interplay between diffusive, electrostatic and hydrodynamic interactions in such active-charged nanosystems can trigger a symmetry breaking as the activity increases. Our results suggest that active-charged nanochannels could amplify directed flows up to the order of meters per second, opening pathways toward adaptable iontronic devices and neuromorphic architectures.</description>

      <title>Friction-controlled reentrant aging and fluidization in granular materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular materials densify under repeated mechanical perturbations, a nonequilibrium dynamics that underlies many natural and industrial processes. Because granular relaxation is governed by frictional contacts and energy dissipation, this aging behavior fundamentally differs from that of thermal glasses despite their apparent similarities. Here, we uncover how friction controls the compaction dynamics of granular packings subjected to cyclic shear. Using discrete element simulations, we construct a dynamic state diagram as a function of strain amplitude and friction, revealing a rich interplay between jamming marginality, stabilization, and fluidization. We identify a friction-dependent crossover strain that separates aging and fluidized regimes, showing reentrant, non-monotonic behavior: Increasing friction first suppresses fluidization, then promotes it through smooth, creep-like rearrangements. This transition is marked by a shift from intermittent, avalanche-like rearrangements to continuous, diffusive motion. Our findings demonstrate that friction exerts a dual role in granular aging -- both stabilizing and fluidizing -- thereby uncovering the fundamental nonequilibrium mechanisms that govern compaction, rheology, and aging in athermal disordered systems. More broadly, our results reveal a general principle for how friction governs metastability and flow in athermal matter -- from granular and frictional colloids to soils and seismic faults -- linking microscopic contact mechanics to macroscopic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Confinement-Induced Delay in Chiral Active Brownian Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between chirality and confinement in harmonically trapped active particles. The circular character of chiral motion combines with the radial symmetry of the potential to create distinctive non-equilibrium behavior. Chirality induces oscillatory cross-correlations between positional components that vanish in the absence of torque while the harmonic potential generates a finite delay between orientation and velocity - a signature of time-reversal symmetry breaking distinct from inertial delay mechanisms. The delay function exhibits characteristic temporal evolution with depth and persistence controlled by trap strength and rotational noise. The stationary probability distribution displays strongly non-Maxwellian characteristics, transitioning from broad annuli to compact localized peaks as confinement increases with the distribution radius governed by the competition between chiral propulsion and trap strength. These features emerge from the interplay between chiral swimming and the restoring force of the trap, revealing how confinement and activity jointly shape particle dynamics and transport properties in nonequilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Response Theory of Non-Equilibrium Complex Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in soft matter physics is to describe materials, such as the living cytoplasm and tissues, that are simultaneously active, chemically driven, and exhibit long-lasting memory of mechanical stresses. Here, we construct a generalized hydrodynamic framework at finite wavevectors and frequencies that can be applicable to non-equilibrium fluids with memory. Our approach is based on a non-equilibrium fluctuation-response relation in a steady state using correlation function identities. This approach provides a general formalism to derive hydrodynamic constitutive equations that is distinct from Mori-Zwanzig projection formalism. As a corollary, we obtain a generalized fluctuation-response relation in non-equilibrium steady states similar to the relation obtained by Harada-Sasa. Applying our theory to chemically driven active fluids reveals Active Viscoelastic Memory, whereby chemical reaction cycles renormalize the system's viscous response. We find that this active viscoelastic memory can produce a negative storage modulus at finite frequency, behavior absent in ordinary viscoelastic fluids. Our first-principles framework provides a general basis for understanding memory-dependent dynamics across a wide range of biological and synthetic active systems.</description>

      <title>Mapping the discrete folding landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Folding is emerging as a promising manufacturing process to transform flat materials into functional structures, offering efficiency by reducing the need for welding, gluing, and molding, while minimizing waste and enabling automation. Designing target shapes requires not only to determine cuts and folds, but also folding pathways. Simple combinatorics is impractical as the possibilities grow factorially with the number of folds. To address this, we present a graph-based algorithm for polyhedral shapes. By representing the target shape as a graph, where nodes correspond to faces and edges represent adjacency, the algorithm identifies all possible fold sequences and maps the configuration space into a discrete set of intermediate configurations. This systematic mapping is critical for the design of optimized processes, the simplifying of folding operations, the reduction of failures, and the improvement of manufacturing reliability.</description>

      <title>Experimental and simulation study of resin infiltration in carbon fiber rovings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-fiber-reinforced polymers are vital for lightweight structural applications, where fiber-matrix wetting critically influences composite performance. Understanding dynamic wetting behavior during resin infiltration remains challenging, especially under realistic processing conditions. Here we investigate the dynamic wetting of commercial carbon fiber rovings by a commonly used epoxy resin through combined optical experiments and two-phase flow simulations informed by microscale roving geometries. We measure velocity-dependent advancing contact angles and observe roving geometry changes during capillary-driven resin infiltration. Simulations using microscale-derived capillary pressure and permeability parameters quantitatively reproduce the time-dependent infiltration dynamics. Our findings demonstrate that while dynamic contact angles vary with velocity, the microscale roving structure predominantly governs resin impregnation behavior. This integrated experimental and modeling approach enhances insight into fiber-resin interactions, offering a pathway to optimize composite manufacturing processes and improve material quality.</description>

      <title>Modeling chiral active particles: from circular motion to odd interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss microscopic models for chiral active particles, i.e., rotating active units that exhibit circular or spinning motion. While non-chiral active particles are typically governed by self-propulsion and conservative interactions, the rotating motion of chiral particles generates additional non-conservative forces that cannot be derived from a potential. These manifest as effective transverse forces, acting perpendicular to the line connecting the centres of two interacting particles, and are referred to as odd interactions, because they break the mirror symmetry of the system. Here, we demonstrate that odd interactions arise from a limiting case of a well-established model describing spinning granular objects. In addition, we show that these models for chiral active objects give rise to a novel collective phenomenon that emerges uniquely from transverse forces and, hence, chirality. Specifically, the system undergoes a transition from a homogeneous phase to an inhomogeneous one characterised by regions depleted of particles, referred to as bubbles. This collective behaviour, termed BIO (bubbles induced by odd interactions), is a general emergent phenomenon arising from chirality and odd interactions. In this work, we review theoretical approaches to this problem, including a scaling argument and predictions for spatial velocity correlations that account for the BIO phase. Finally, we outline perspectives and open challenges concerning this collective phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Self-Organization and Cyclic Positioning of Active Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active transport of biomolecular condensates and cell migration in collectives are fundamental to development, homeostasis, and processes such as cancer progression, wound healing, and infection response. Yet how these assemblies are positioned, regulated, and driven through cycles of dissolution and reassembly is not fully understood. We address this using a model of attractive active Brownian particles (ABPs). Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we show that these particles undergo liquid-gas phase separation, and spatially varying activity fields induce striking emergent dynamics. Droplets migrate up activity gradients, and above a critical activity, they fragment into a gas phase. The gas then migrates down the gradient, and droplets reassemble, yielding robust positioning cycles. This emergent condensate cycle arises without biochemical feedback loops and relies only on the interplay of attractions, motility, and gradients. In binary mixtures of active-passive particles, differential cohesion leads to self-sorting of particles, where strongly-cohesive ABPs compact into dense cores surrounded by peripheries enriched with weakly-cohesive passive particles. The passive particles stabilize the dynamic clusters of ABPs, and they migrate toward high-activity regions. Our findings suggest a generic mechanism for spatial control and turnover of condensates in biology.</description>

      <title>Latch, Spring and Release: The Efficiency of Power-Amplified Jumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many small animals, particularly insects, use power-amplification to generate rapid motions such as jumping, which would otherwise not be possible with the standard power density of muscle. A common framework for understanding this power amplification is Latch-Mediated, Spring Actuated (or LaMSA) jumping, in which a spring is slowly compressed, latched in its compressed state and the latch released to allow jumping. Motivated by the jumps of certain insect larvae, we consider a variant of this in which the latching occurs externally via adhesion to a substrate that is quickly released for jumping. We show that the rate at which this adhesion is lost is crucial in determining the efficiency of jumping and, indeed, whether jumping occurs at all. As well as showing how release rate should be chosen to facilitate optimal jumping, our analysis suggests that it is possible to control jumps even once the latch has been set.</description>

      <title>Shape transitions of sedimenting confined droplets and capsules: from oblate to bullet-like geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport and deformation of confined droplets and flexible capsules are central to diverse phenomena and applications, from biological flows in microcapillaries to industrial processes in porous media. Inspired by experiments, we perform numerical simulations to investigate their shape dynamics under varying levels of confinement and particle flexibility. A transition from an oblate to a bullet-like shape is observed at a confinement threshold, independent of flexibility, which agrees with our analytical calculations. A fluid-structure interaction analysis reveals two regimes: a pressure-dominated and a viscous-dominated regime. For highly flexible particles, the pressure-dominated regime prevails and the deformation is enhanced. These findings offer new insights into the transport of flexible particles in confined environments, with implications for biomedical applications, filtration technologies, and multiphase fluid mechanics.</description>

      <title>polyBART: A Chemical Linguist for Polymer Property Prediction and Generative Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing polymers for targeted applications and accurately predicting their properties is a key challenge in materials science owing to the vast and complex polymer chemical space. While molecular language models have proven effective in solving analogous problems for molecular discovery, similar advancements for polymers are limited. To address this gap, we propose polyBART, a language model-driven polymer discovery capability that enables rapid and accurate exploration of the polymer design space. Central to our approach is Pseudo-polymer SELFIES (PSELFIES), a novel representation that allows for the transfer of molecular language models to the polymer space. polyBART is, to the best of our knowledge, the first language model capable of bidirectional translation between polymer structures and properties, achieving state-of-the-art results in property prediction and design of novel polymers for electrostatic energy storage. Further, polyBART is validated through a combination of both computational and laboratory experiments. We report what we believe is the first successful synthesis and validation of a polymer designed by a language model, predicted to exhibit high thermal degradation temperature and confirmed by our laboratory measurements. Our work presents a generalizable strategy for adapting molecular language models to the polymer space and introduces a polymer foundation model, advancing generative polymer design that may be adapted for a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Mechanically Interlocked Polymers in Dilute Solution under Shear and Extensional Flows: A Brownian Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs) are a novel class of polymer structures in which the components are connected by mechanical bonds instead of covalent bonds. We measure the single-molecule rheological properties of polyrotaxanes, daisy chains, and polycatenanes under steady shear and steady uniaxial extension using coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations with hydrodynamic interactions. We obtain key rheological features, including tumbling dynamics, molecular extension, stress, and viscosity. By systematically varying structural features, we demonstrate how MIP topology governs flow response. Compared to linear polymers, all three MIP architectures exhibit enhanced tumbling in shear flow and lower normal stress differences in extensional flow. While polyrotaxanes show higher shear and extensional viscosities, polycatenanes and daisy chains have lower viscosities. In extensional flow, polyrotaxanes and polycatenanes extend earlier than linear polymers. We find that mechanical bonds suppress shear thinning and alter the coil-stretch transition observed in linear polymers. These effects arise from the mechanically bonded rings in MIPs, which expand the polymer profile in gradient direction and increase backbone stiffness due to ring-backbone repulsions. This study provides key insights into MIP flow properties, providing the foundation for their systematic development in engineering applications.</description>
