      <title>Time-resolved Charge Detection in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate electronic transport through gate-defined quantum dots in molybdenum disulfide MoS$_2$ using an integrated charge detector. We observe a crossover from two weakly coupled single dots to a strongly coupled double quantum dot. In the regime of extremely weak dot-lead coupling, where the direct transport current is below the detection limit, we measure the dot occupation via charge detection and access the few-electron regime. Due to the large band gap of MoS$_2$, tunneling rates can be sufficiently suppressed to resolve individual tunneling events. These results establish a platform for single-shot spin- and valley-to-charge conversion and highlight the potential of transition-metal dichalcogenide quantum dots for quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>Quadrupolar and dipolar phases of excitons in transition-metal dichalcogenide trilayer heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments on trilayer transition-metal dichalcogenide heterostructures have revealed the rich behavior of dipolar excitons. Motivated by these experimental observations, we investigate the collective dynamics of planar quantum dipoles whose orientation fluctuates due to charge tunneling between the outer layers. Using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the low-temperature phase diagram as a function of experimentally tunable parameters. We uncover a diverse landscape of phases driven by dipolar correlations. Under strong dipole fluctuations, a quadrupolar superfluid emerges. Suppressing charge tunneling nucleates a droplet state stabilized by the attractive interaction between antiparallel dipoles. At high exciton densities, the system gives way to a partially fragmented condensate, characterized by competing quadrupolar and dipolar superfluid states. Furthermore, at a large exciton mass and high density, we find a staggered dipolar crystal. Our detailed study of the dependence of exciton energy shifts on an external electric field directly interprets existing experimental data and underscores the crucial role of the antiparallel dipolar configuration. Our results provide a guide for future experimental explorations of quantum phases of trilayer excitons.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Signatures of Kondo Physics in Geometry-Tunable Double Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equilibrium thermoelectric and spectral properties of a double quantum dot system are investigated, with the geometry continuously tuned from series to parallel via a parameter $ p $. Within the non-crossing approximation in the infinite-$ U $ limit, the Kondo peak remains robust, while satellite features and the Kondo temperature show strong sensitivity to the geometry. The Seebeck coefficient exhibits sign reversals and non-monotonic behavior as a result of the interplay between Kondo and satellite peaks. These findings underscore the role of interference and coupling asymmetry in governing transport properties, suggesting routes for geometry-based optimization in nanoscale devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory for edge current and noise in 2D topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the edge current and its fluctuations, i.e. noise, in a 2D topological superconductor using the T-matrix and the Green function techniques. We show that the current is zero for non-chiral edge states and non-zero for chiral edge states, while the edge noise is non-zero whatever the chirality of the edge states. By applying our results to toy models with chiral edge states, we find that the noise is closely related to the Chern number. The edge noise is non-zero only when the Chern number is non-zero, and the bulk noise exhibits a peak each time the Chern number varies, meaning that there is strong current fluctuations when a topological phase transition occurs. Our results suggest that the bulk noise could be seen as a topological susceptibility.</description>

Abstract: We propose a pathway to engineer Z3 parafermion zero modes in fractional Chern insulator-superconductor heterostructures. Using numerical Bogoliubov-de Gennes calculations and edge-theory analysis, we demonstrate how realistic materials such as MoTe2/NbSe2 can host parafermionic excitations with experimentally accessible signatures, including fractional Josephson effects, localized zero modes, interferometry, and thermal transport. Our work outlines concrete strategies for experimentally accessing parafermionic excitations in FCI-superconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Quartic energy band engineering in artificial semiconductor honeycomb lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificially engineered lattices provide a flexible platform for reproducing and extending the electronic behavior of atomic-scale materials. Artificial graphene systems, in particular, mimic graphene-like linear dispersion with tunable Dirac cones and offer a route to realizing more exotic band structures. Here we examine the emergence of quartic energy dispersion in artificial graphene heterostructures using analytical modeling and numerical solutions of the effective Hamiltonian. We identify three distinct quartic band types: Mexican-hat-shaped (MHS), purely quartic, and non-MHS quartic bands, and determine the conditions under which each arises. We find that a staggered honeycomb lattice supports all three classes of quartic dispersion, whereas its planar counterpart yields only purely quartic and non-MHS forms. These results demonstrate the feasibility of engineering quartic band edges in artificial lattices and clarify how lattice geometry can be used to tailor their characteristics.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of Wigner crystal polarons in an atomically thin semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly interacting electrons in two-dimensional systems can spontaneously break translational symmetry, forming a periodic Wigner crystal. Although these crystals have been realized in several platforms, experimental studies of their collective many-body excitations in the absence of a magnetic field remain an outstanding challenge. Here, we access this regime optically by uncovering Wigner crystal polarons: novel light-matter excitations arising from the dressing of excitons by collective excitations of the Wigner crystal. These hybrid quasiparticles manifest as new optical resonances in cryogenic reflectance spectra of a charge-tunable WSe$_2$ monolayer, appearing concurrently with previously identified exciton umklapp transitions. In contrast to the latter, the energies of Wigner crystal polarons are governed not only by the electronic lattice constant but also by their hybridization with attractive exciton-polarons, whose strength is controlled by electronic interactions. These novel many-body excitations provide an optical interface to the spin state of the Wigner crystal, which as we demonstrate, can be controlled both magnetically and optically. Our work establishes layered materials as a unique platform for exploring dynamical impurity dressing by strongly correlated electronic orders.</description>

      <title>Current-Induced Modulation of Spin-Wave Propagation in a Y-Junction via Transverse Spin-Transfer Torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the transverse control of spin-wave propagation in the configuration where the spin-wave wavevector k is perpendicular to the charge-current density J. Building on theoretical predictions of spin-wave refraction by nonuniform spin-polarized currents, and guided by micromagnetic simulations used to optimize the device geometry and current distribution, we experimentally explore a Y-shaped Permalloy structure in which a locally injected current perturbs the spin-wave dispersion. Measurements reveal current-dependent amplitude differences between the two output branches, providing initial experimental indications consistent with transverse, spin-transfer-torque-driven deflection. Although the magnitude of the effect is modest and accompanied by significant uncertainties, the observed trends qualitatively follow expectations from the simulations. These results demonstrate the feasibility of influencing spin-wave routing through local current injection and establish a proof-of-concept basis for current-controlled manipulation of spin-wave propagation in reconfigurable magnonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Turing instability and electronic self-oscillatory dynamics in Dirac fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viscous films flowing down an incline can form self-sustained running waves, known as Kapitsa roll waves. Here we describe an analogous electron-hydrodynamic instability that produces similar running waves in Dirac materials such as graphene mono- and multilayers. It arises when carrier kinetics near charge neutrality make current dissipation strongly density-dependent. As the flow velocity $u$ exceeds a critical value, the system transitions to a state with coupled spatial and temporal oscillations. Experimentally, the instability should manifest as (i) a nonanalytic behavior characteristic of a second-order transition--an abrupt increase in time-averaged current--and (ii) narrow-band emission at the characteristic ``washboard'' frequency $f=u/\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the modulation wavelength. This behavior parallels the AC and DC transport of sliding charge-density waves, but here it originates from a distinct, intrinsic mechanism unrelated to disorder. Estimates indicate that the emission frequency $f$, tunable by current, spans a broad range, highlighting Dirac bands as a promising platform for high-frequency electron-fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Controlling Spin-Waves by Inhomogeneous Spin-Transfer Torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between spin currents and spin waves in nanofabricated Permalloy waveguides with geometrical constrictions. Using propagating spin-wave spectroscopy, micromagnetic simulations, and analytical modeling, we provide experimental evidence that spin-wave phase can be modulated by inhomogeneous spin-transfer torques generated by current-density gradients shaped by the constriction geometry. Narrower constrictions enhance these gradients and modify the internal field for Damon-Eshbach spin waves, resulting in pronounced changes in spin-wave group velocity and phase. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first demonstration of deterministic phase modulation via engineered nonuniform spin-transfer torques. Beyond enabling a scalable route to magnonic interferometry - a building block for spin-wave-based computing - our findings establish a platform to control spin-wave dynamics in spatially varying current landscapes, relevant for analogue-gravity experiments in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Wigner polarons reveal Wigner crystal dynamics in a monolayer semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wigner crystals, lattices made purely of electrons, are a quintessential paradigm of studying correlation-driven quantum phase transitions. Despite decades of research, the internal dynamics of Wigner crystals has remained extremely challenging to access, with most experiments probing only static order or collective motion. Here, we establish monolayer WSe2 as a new materials platform to host zero-field Wigner crystals and then demonstrate that exciton spectroscopy provides a direct means to probe both static and dynamic properties of these electron lattices. We uncover striking optical resonances that we identify as Wigner polarons, quasiparticles formed when the electron lattice is locally distorted by exciton-Wigner crystal coupling. We further achieve all-optical control of spins in the Wigner crystal, directly probing valley-dependent Wigner polaron scattering well above the magnetic ordering temperature and in the absence of any external magnetic field. Finally, we demonstrate optical melting of the Wigner crystal and observe intriguingly different responses of the umklapp (static) and Wigner polaron (dynamic) resonances to optical excitation. Our results open up exciting new avenues for elucidating electron dynamics and achieving ultrafast optical control of interaction-driven quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Signatures of real-space geometry, topology, and metric tensor in quantum transport in periodically corrugated spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of a quantum particle constrained to a two-dimensional non-compact Riemannian manifold with non-trivial metric can be described by a flat-space Schroedinger-type equation at the cost of introducing local mass and metric and geometry-induced effective potential with no classical counterpart. For a metric tensor periodically modulated along one dimension, the formation of bands is demonstrated and transport-related quantities are derived. Using S-matrix approach, the quantum conductance along the manifold is calculated and contrasted with conventional quantum transport methods in flat spaces. The topology, e.g. whether the manifold is simply connected, compact or non-compact shows up in global, non-local properties such as the Aharonov-Bohm phase. The results vividly demonstrate emergent phenomena due to the interplay of reduced-dimensionality, particles quantum nature, geometry, and topology.</description>

      <title>Machine learning assisted high throughput prediction of moir\'e materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The world of 2D materials is rapidly expanding with new discoveries of stackable and twistable layered systems composed of lattices of different symmetries, orbital character, and structural motifs. Often, however, it is not clear a priori whether a pair of monolayers twisted at a small angle will exhibit correlated or interaction-driven phenomena. The computational cost to make accurate predictions of the single particle states is significant, as small twists require very large unit cells, easily encompassing 10,000 atoms, and therefore implementing a high throughput prediction has been out of reach. Here we show a path to overcome this challenge by introducing a machine learning (ML) based methodology that efficiently estimates the twisted interlayer tunneling at arbitrarily low twist angles through the local-configuration based approach that enables interpolating the local stacking for a range of twist angles using a random forest regression algorithm. We leverage the kernel polynomial method to compute the density of states (DOS) on large real space graphs by reconstructing a lattice model of the twisted bilayer with the ML fitted hoppings. For twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), we show the ability of the method to resolve the magic angle DOS at a substantial improvement in computational time. We use this new technique to scan through the database of stable 2D monolayers (MC2D) and reveal new twistable candidates across the five possible points groups in two-dimensions with a large DOS near the Fermi energy, with potentially exciting interacting physics to be probed in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the amorphous ice layer during premelting using AFM integrating machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Premelting plays a key role across physics, chemistry, materials and biology sciences but remains poorly understood at the atomic level due to surface characterization limitations. We report the discovery of a novel amorphous ice layer (AIL) preceding the quasi-liquid layer (QLL) during ice premelting, enabled by a machine learning framework integrating atomic force microscopy (AFM) with molecular dynamics simulations. This approach overcomes AFM's depth and signal limitations, allowing for three-dimensional surface structure reconstruction from AFM images. It further enables structural exploration of premelting interfaces across a wide temperature range that are experimentally inaccessible. We identify the AIL, present between 121-180K, displaying disordered two-dimensional hydrogen-bond network with solid-like dynamics. Our findings refine the ice premelting phase diagram and offering new insights into the surface growth dynamic, dissolution and interfacial chemical reactivity. Methodologically, this work establishes a novel framework for AFM-based 3D structural discovery, marking a significant leap in our ability to probe complex disordered interfaces with unprecedented precision and paving the way for future disciplinary research, including surface reconstruction, crystallization, ion solvation, and biomolecular recognition.</description>

Abstract: To delve deeply into the nonlinear large-deformation and fracture behaviors of 2D carbon nanostructures (2D CNs), including bilayer graphene, diamane, and their transitional structures, this paper introduces a multiscale auxiliary nodes (MAN) method rooted in atomic structures and potentials. This approach simulates 2D CNs by constructing two virtual continuum sheets with high-order continuity. The moving least squares (MLS) approximation is employed to facilitate the transformation between atomic displacements and nodal displacements, thereby converting atomic potential energy into strain energy within the continuum model. Through iterative solutions of nonlinear stiffness equations, the equilibrium configuration of the system under specified loading conditions can be obtained. The flexibility in the density and arrangement of nodes allows for a smooth and seamless cross-scale transition from discrete atomic structures to a continuum model. Numerical simulations demonstrate that MAN method accurately predicts the nonlinear large-deformation and fracture behaviors of 2D CNs. The Young's modulus and shear modulus of diamane in both zigzag and armchair directions closely approach those of diamond and are notably higher than those of graphene. Furthermore, the quantity and distribution of interlayer sp3 bonds significantly influence the fracture behavior of 2D CNs, with strategic placement of these bonds effectively enhancing the tensile strength of the structures.</description>

      <title>Anyon Dispersion in Aharonov-Casher Bands and Implications for Twisted MoTe${}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states in two-dimensional heterostructures has opened the door to realizing phases of dispersing anyons. Here, we develop an analytically controlled theory of anyon dispersion in FQAH states realized in ideal or Aharonov-Casher (AC) bands by projecting interactions onto the space of Laughlin quasiholes. Constructing quasihole momentum eigenstates allows efficient evaluation of the single quasihole dispersion using Monte Carlo. We find that the quasihole bandwidth grows with increasing quantum-geometry inhomogeneity of the AC band and with increasing interaction screening length. For realistic parameters relevant to the bands of twisted MoTe${}_2$, the quasihole bandwidth is of order 1 meV, suggesting that itinerant-anyon physics may play an important role in sufficiently clean samples. Furthermore, we develop a microscopic Lagrangian framework in terms of a quasihole guiding-center coordinate, which reproduces the momentum-space formula for the dispersion. This approach reveals that quasihole dispersion originates from the combined effects of an interaction-generated periodic potential, arising from non-uniform quantum geometry of the single particle bands, and the quasihole many-body Berry phase arising from the background magnetic field. The latter endows the guiding-center coordinate with a noncommutative structure, converting the periodic potential into a finite dispersion. Finally, we outline how this framework generalizes to multiple quasiholes, enabling a microscopic theory of charged excitations in FQAH systems that retains only the anyon degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Visualizing metal-mediated nucleation and growth of GaN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the atomic-scale mechanisms governing metal-mediated nucleation and growth of gallium nitride (GaN) and related alloys is critical for tailoring their structural and functional properties in advanced electronic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices. Using real-time environmental transmission electron microscopy (E-TEM) in conjunction with Gibbs free energy calculations, we elucidate the distinct processes of GaN nucleation and growth from Ga droplet arrays with and without GaN pre-nuclei. For the lowest temperatures, although GaN nucleation at Ga droplet arrays is not observed, GaN growth occurs preferentially at pre-existing GaN nuclei, presumably due to the reduced Gibbs free energy for NH3 decomposition at Ga/GaN interfaces. For intermediate to high temperatures, E-TEM reveals nucleation and growth of GaN from Ga droplets with and without GaN nuclei, with enhanced crystallinity for the GaN nuclei, due to epitaxial templating. These results highlight the critical role of the Ga/GaN interface in facilitating NH3 decomposition and GaN growth, offering fundamental insights into metal-mediated nucleation and growth of GaN and related materials.</description>

      <title>Tuning Carrier Type and Density in Highly Conductive and Infrared-Transparent (Bi1-xSbx)2Te3 films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared transparent conductors have long been sought due to their broad optoelectronic applications in the infrared wavelength range. However, the search for ideal materials has been limited by the inherent trade-off between electrical conductance and optical transmittance. Band engineering offers an effective approach to modulate carrier type and density, enabling concurrent tuning of both conductance and transmittance. In this work, we present a band engineering strategy that enables effective tuning of both infrared transmittance and electrical conductance in topological insulator (Bi1-xSbx)2Te3, bridging the gap and paving the way for applying topological insulators to infrared photoelectric devices. More importantly, with the combination of high carrier mobility and a large optical dielectric constant as suggested by previous report, Sb2Te3 achieves a high electrical conductance (~1000 S/cm) and outstanding infrared transmittance (92.3%) in the wavelength range of 8~13 um, demonstrating strong potential as an infrared transparent conductor. Our findings reveal that concurrent enhancement of both carrier mobility and optical dielectric constant is key to overcoming the conductance-transmittance trade-off. This work provides valuable insight for the exploration of high-performance infrared transparent conducting materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth iron garnet (RE3Fe5O12) films are promising insulating ferrimagnets. They can show low magnetic damping, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and ultrafast spin dynamics, which makes them ideal for spin transport applications. In this work, we investigate the interaction between the magnetic sublattices in Er3Fe5O12 thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition on a Gd3Ga5O12 substrate. Structural and magnetic characterization reveals high-quality single-crystal growth, with compensation temperature close to the reported bulk value (~80 K). Magnetic phase diagrams based on element-specific measurements map out the regions where ferrimagnetic, canted, and aligned phases are stable across the compensation temperature. The micromagnetic dynamics resulting from perpendicular magnetic pulse perturbation of an in-plane magnetized layer was investigated at room temperature and reveals complex configurations. These results are a key feature for modulating magnetization dynamics through the compensation phenomenon, which is essential for spin-based devices operating in a low-temperature regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying the thermodynamic work costs of quantum operations is essential for the continued development and optimisation of emerging quantum technologies. This present a significant challenge in regimes of rapid control within complex, non-equilibrium environments - conditions under which many contemporary quantum devices operate and conventional approximations break down. Here, we introduce a process tensor framework that enables the computation of the full numerically exact quantum work statistics of driven open quantum systems. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to a Landauer erasure protocol operating beyond the weak-coupling, Markovian, and slow-driving limits. The resulting work probability distributions reveal distinct quantum signatures that are missed by low-order moments yet significantly impact the erasure fidelity of the protocol. Our framework delivers non-perturbative accuracy and detail in characterising energy-exchange fluctuations in driven open quantum systems, establishing a powerful and versatile tool for exploring thermodynamics and control in the operating regimes of both near-term and future quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: The use of highly sensitive pixelated direct detectors has dramatically improved the performance of high energy instrumentation such as transmission electron microscopy. Here, we describe a recently developed monolithic active pixel sensor designed for low energy scanning electron microscopy applications. This detector enables electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) at lower energies and dose than are accessible with existing scintillator-coupled detectors, expanding grain orientation mapping capabilities to materials such as ceramics that are poor electron conductors. The high detector sensitivity allows collection of rich diffraction information - providing dislocation defect contrast that is otherwise not accessible via EBSD. Indeed, even the energy of single electron interaction events can be measured with this detector, which we demonstrate to energy filter diffraction patterns revealing details of how diffraction occurs at low energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01261v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been considerable effort to mimic analog black holes and wormholes in solid state systems. Lattice realizations in particular present specific challenges. One of those is that event horizons in general have both white and black hole (grey hole) character, a feature guaranteed by the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We here explore and extend the capability of superconducting circuit hardware to implement on-demand spacetime geometries on lattices, combining nonreciprocity of gyrators with the nonlinearity of Josephson junctions. We demonstrate the possibility of the metric sharply changing within a single lattice point, thus entering a regime where the modulation of system parameters is "trans-Planckian", and the Hawking temperature ill-defined. Instead of regular Hawking radiation, we find an instability in the form of an exponential burst of charge and phase quantum fluctuations over short time scales - a robust signature even in the presence of an environment. Moreover, we present a loop-hole for the typical black/white hole ambiguity in lattice simulations: exceptional points in the dispersion relation allow for the creation of pure black (or white) hole horizons, at the expense of a radical change in the dynamics of the wormhole interior.</description>

Abstract: We report a linear-scaling numerical method for exploring nonequilibrium electron dynamics in systems of arbitrary complexity. Based on the Chebyshev expansion of the time evolution of the single-particle density matrix, the method gives access to nonperturbative excitation and relaxation phenomena in models of disordered materials with sizes on the experimental scale. After validating the method by applying it to saturable optical absorption in clean graphene, we uncover that disorder can enhance absorption in graphene and that the interplay between light, anisotropy, and disorder in nanoporous graphene might be appealing for sensing applications. Beyond the optical properties of graphene-like materials, the method can be applied to a wide range of large-area materials and systems with arbitrary descriptions of defects and disorder.</description>

      <title>Electrical generation of surface plasmon polaritons in plasmonic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) can be understood as two-dimensional light confined to a conductor-dielectric interface via plasmonic excitations. While low-energy SPPs behave similarly to photons, higher-frequency SPPs resemble surface plasmons. Electrically generating mid-range SPPs is particularly challenging because it requires compensating for momentum mismatch, a process conventionally achieved through inelastic electron transport in nanostructures. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that electrical SPP generation is possible by directly coupling electron-hole dipoles to the quantized SPP field across an insulating spacer without accompanying electron transport. This approach can be realized in plasmonic van der Waals heterostructures composed of strongly-biased monolayer graphene as the emitter, few-layer hexagonal boron nitride as the spacer, and silver (or gold) as the plasmonic material. In this configuration, graphene's remarkable ability to support a strongly non-equilibrium steady-state electron-hole population results in non-thermal, bias-tunable SPP emission that is uniform along the hBN/Ag interface, achieving a power conversion efficiency of up to 1% and a Purcell factor of up to 100. These findings pave the way for integrating photonic and electronic functionalities within a single two-dimensional heterostructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kondo effect originates from the spin exchange scattering of itinerant electrons with a localized magnetic impurity. Here, we consider generalization of Weyl-type electrons with their spin locked on a spherical Fermi surface in an arbitrary way and study how such spin-momentum locking affects the Kondo effect. After introducing a suitable model Hamiltonian, a simple formula for the Kondo temperature is derived with the second-order perturbation theory, which proves to depend only on the spin averaged over the Fermi surface. In particular, the Kondo temperature is unaffected as long as the average spin vanishes, but decreases as the average spin increases in its magnitude, and eventually vanishes when the spin is completely polarized on the Fermi surface, illuminating the role of spin-momentum locking in the Kondo effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The planar Hall effect is a phenomenon that the Hall conductivity emerges perpendicular to the electric field in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. We investigate the planar Hall effect in two-dimensional metal coupled with higher symmetric $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,f,g,i$,\ where those with $X=d,g,i$ are altermagnets. The $X$-wave magnet is characterized by the number $N_{X}$ of the nodes in the band structure, where $N_{X}=1,2,3,4,6$ corresponding to $X=p,d,f,g,i$. Although the system is metallic, provided the Dirac gap is tiny, we demonstrate that the Hall conductivities are almost half quantized and well approximated by the formula $\sigma _{xy}=\pm (e^{2}/2h)$ sgn$\left( J\sin N_{X}\Phi \right) $, where $J$ is the coefficient of the coupling between the $X$-wave magnet and the electrons, and $\Phi $ is the direction of the applied magnetic field. Hence, the Hall conductivity is periodic in $\Phi $, and the periodicity is equal to the number $N_{X}$ of the nodes. This property may be used to confirm that the target material is indeed an $X $-wave magnet. Furthermore, the sign of $J$ may be used as a bit for antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

Abstract: Archimedean lattices constitute a unique family of two-dimensional tilings formed from regular polygons arranged with uniform vertex configurations. While the kagome and snub square lattices, the simplest members of the Archimedean lattice family, have been extensively investigated -- the former as a paradigmatic system for geometric frustration and nontrivial band topology, and the latter primarily as a quasicrystal approximant -- the broader family remains largely unexplored in terms of electronic and topological properties. In this work, we present a systematic Python-based tight-binding study of all eight pure Archimedean lattices, modeled as two-dimensional carbon-based networks serving as a proof-of-principle system. We analyze their band structures, investigate topological edge states arising from unconventional nanoribbon geometries, and evaluate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants as well as intrinsic spin Hall conductivities using the Kubo formalism. Our results reveal that several Archimedean lattices, such as the truncated hexagonal and truncated trihexagonal lattices, host nearly dispersionless flat bands extending across the Brillouin zone, which remain robust even in the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping and strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the truncated trihexagonal lattice supports topologically protected, highly spin-polarized edge states across multiple ribbon geometries. These states are stable against defects and spin-flip scattering, and give rise to quantized spin Hall currents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the localization behavior in a non-Hermitian system subject to a quasiperiodic onsite potential. We characterize localization transitions using multiple quantitative indicators, including inverse participation ratio (IPR), eigenstate fractal dimension (EFD), extended eigenstate ratio (EER), and spectral survival ratio. Despite the breaking of self-dual symmetry due to non-Hermiticity, our results reveal the existence of a critical potential strength, with its value increasing linearly with the nearest-neighbor antisymmetric hopping term. On the other hand, the inclusion of longer-range hopping not only enriches the topological properties but also gives rise to novel localization phenomena. In particular, it induces the emergence of mobility edges, as evidenced by both IPR and EFD, along with distinct features in the spectrum fractal dimension, which we extract using the box-counting method applied to the complex energy spectrum. Additionally, we uncover self-similar structures in various quantities, such as EER and complex eigenvalue ratio, as the potential strength varies. These findings highlight important aspects of localization and fractal phenomena in non-Hermitian quasiperiodic systems.</description>

Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a topology-related transport phenomenon being of potential interest in spintronics, because this effect enables the efficient probe of magnetic orders (i.e., data readout in memory devices). It is well known that AHE spontaneously occurs in ferromagnets or antiferromagnets with magnetization. While recent studies reveal electric-field induced AHE (via linear magnetoelectric coupling), an AHE originating from {\it nonlinear} magnetoelectric coupling remains largely unexplored. Here, by symmetry analysis, we establish the phenomenological theory regarding the spontaneous and electric-field driven AHE in magnets. We show that a large variety of magnetic point groups host an AHE that is driven by uni-axial, bi-axial, or tri-axial electric field and that comes from nonlinear magnetoelectric coupling. Such electric-field driven anomalous Hall conductivities are reversible by reversing the magnetic orders. Furthermore, our first-principles calculations suggest Cr$_2$O$_3$ and CoF$_2$ as candidates hosting the aforementioned AHE. Our work emphasizes the important role of nonlinear magnetoelectric coupling in creating exotic transport phenomena, and offers alternative avenues for the probe of magnetic orders.</description>

      <title>Near-deterministic photon entanglement from a spin qudit in silicon using third quantisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01096</link>

Abstract: Unlike other quantum hardware, photonic quantum architectures can produce millions of qubits from a single device. However, controlling photonic qubits remains challenging, even at small scales, due to their weak interactions, making non-deterministic gates in linear optics unavoidable. Nevertheless, a single photon can readily spread over multiple modes and create entanglement within the multiple modes deterministically. Rudolph's concept of third quantization leverages this feature by evolving multiple single-photons into multiple modes, distributing them uniformly and randomly to different parties, and creating multipartite entanglement without interactions between photons or non-deterministic gates. This method requires only classical communication and deterministic entanglement within multi-mode single-photon states and enables universal quantum computing. The multipartite entanglement generated within the third quantization framework is nearly deterministic, where ``deterministic'' is achieved in the asymptotic limit of a large system size. In this work, we propose a near-term experiment using antimony donor in a silicon chip to realize third quantization. Utilizing the eight energy levels of antimony, one can generate two eight-mode single-photon states independently and distribute them to parties. This enables a random multipartite Bell-state experiment, achieving a Bell state with an upper-bound efficiency of 87.5% among 56 random pairs without non-deterministic entangling gates. This approach opens alternative pathways for silicon-based photonic quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Atomic structure of the PL5 defect in silicon carbide revealed by single-spin spectroscopy and oxygen implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PL5 and PL6 centers in 4H-SiC are promising for quantum applications due to their superior charge stability and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) properties at room temperature. However, their atomic structures remain unresolved, with ongoing controversy regarding their potential association with stacking faults. Previous measurements relying on spin ensemble detection were insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In this work, we conduct correlative imaging of stacking faults and PL5/PL6 at the single-defect level, definitively ruling out any spatial correlation and demonstrating that these centers are not associated with stacking faults. Furthermore, we find that substituting oxygen for nitrogen in ion implantation enhances the yields of PL5 and PL6 by more than $11$-fold and $23$-fold, respectively. Single-spin ODMR spectroscopy of PL5 reveals six distinct orientations, determines the transverse zero-field splitting parameter $E$, and characterizes the hyperfine coupling. Combined with our ab initio calculations, these results provide compelling evidence for the assignment of PL5 as an OV($kh$) defect, consisting of an oxygen atom occupying the C($k$) site as the nearest neighbor to a Si($h$) vacancy. The structural analysis together with the demonstrated defect yield enhancement lays the foundation for fabricating high-sensitivity, high-contrast ensemble quantum sensors in two and three dimensions.</description>
