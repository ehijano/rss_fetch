      <title>Polarization resolved hyperspectral imaging of the beetle Protaetia speciosa jousselini</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and classifying chiral structural color of scarab beetles across the phylogenetic tree is an important scientific tool to explore the origins of the homochiral optical response in biological structures with a potential relation to the homochirality of (chitin) molecules. We report hyperspectral polarization resolved images of the scarab beetle \textit{Protaetia speciosa jousselini} (Gory \&amp; Percheron, 1833) and resolve the state of polarization as a function of both position (spatial resolution of $\sim$20 $\mu$m $\times$ 10 $\mu$m) and wavelength (spectral resolution of 5.5 nm). We observe a strong left-handed chiral Bragg reflection and analyze the center wavelength and width of the spectrum. The reflection and state of polarization scale with the center wavelength of the Bragg reflection, while the relative width of reflection spectrum is characterized by a chiral photonic strength parameter $\psi_C \approx 0.14$ that is independent of the reflected color and position. Based on the self-similarity of the reflection spectra we interpret variation in reflectivity as variations in the thickness of the chiral Bragg reflector across the beetle.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity microsecond-scale cellular imaging using two-axis compressed streak imaging fluorescence microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressed streak imaging (CSI), introduced in 2014, has proven to be a powerful imaging technology for recording ultrafast phenomena such as light propagation and fluorescence lifetimes at over 150 trillion frames per second. Despite these achievements, CSI has faced challenges in detecting subtle intensity fluctuations in slow-moving, continuously illuminated objects. This limitation, largely attributable to high streak compression and motion blur, has curtailed broader adoption of CSI in applications such as cellular fluorescence microscopy. To address these issues and expand the utility of CSI, we present a novel encoding strategy, termed two-axis compressed streak imaging (TACSI) that results in significant improvements to the reconstructed image fidelity. TACSI introduces a second scanning axis which shuttles a conjugate image of the object with respect to the coded aperture. The moving image decreases the streak compression ratio and produces a flash and shutter phenomenon that reduces coded aperture motion blur, overcoming the limitations of current CSI technologies. We support this approach with an analytical model describing the two-axis streak compression ratio, along with both simulated and empirical measurements. As proof of concept, we demonstrate the ability of TACSI to measure rapid variations in cell membrane potentials using voltage-sensitive dye, which were previously unattainable with conventional CSI. This method has broad implications for high-speed photography, including the visualization of action potentials, muscle contractions, and enzymatic reactions that occur on microsecond and faster timescales using fluorescence microscopy.</description>

      <title>Optoelectronic generative adversarial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence generative content technology has experienced remarkable breakthroughs in recent years and is quietly leading a profound transformation. Diffractive optical networks provide a promising solution for implementing generative model with high-speed and low-power consumption. In this work, we present the implementation of a generative model on the optoelectronic computing architecture, based on generative adversarial network, which is called optoelectronic generative adversarial network. The network strategically distributes the generator and discriminator across the optical and electronic components, which are seamlessly integrated to leverage the unique strengths of each computing paradigm and take advantage of transfer learning. The network can efficiently and high-speed process the complex tasks involved in the training and inference of the generative model. The superior performance of these networks is verified by engaging three types of generative tasks, image generation, conditional generation, and image restoration. By synergistically combining the strengths of optical and electronic computing, the optoelectronic generative adversarial network paves the way for the development of more powerful and accessible artificial intelligence generative content technology that can unlock new creative possibilities across a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Highly coherent phase-lock of an 8.1 $\mu$m quantum cascade laser to a turn-key mid-IR frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A continuous-wave Fabry-Perot quantum cascade laser (QCL) emitting at 8.1 $\mu$m operating in the single mode regime has been coherently phase locked to a turn-key low-noise commercial mid-Infrared (mid-IR) optical frequency comb. The stability of the comb used as a reference is transferred to the QCL resulting in an integrated residual phase error of 0.4 rad. The laser linewidth is narrowed by more than two orders of magnitude reaching sub-kHz level at 1 ms observation time, limited by the spectral purity of the mid-IR comb. Our experiment is an important step toward the development of both powerful and metrology-grade QCLs and fully stabilized QCL frequency comb and opens perspectives for precision measurements and frequency metrology in the mid-IR.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired super-resolution of fluorescent point-like sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the experimental super-resolution of pairs of simultaneously emitting point-like fluorescent sources using a modified image inversion interferometer microscope. The technique is inspired by recent developments in the application of quantum parameter estimation theory to semiclassical imaging problems. We find that the image inversion technique requires special polarization filtering to account for the dipolar nature of the emission. Using an azimuthal polarizer, we obtain improvements in the Fisher information of point-source separation by over an order of magnitude relative to direct imaging. Unlike established super-resolution fluorescence techniques, the method does not require sequential photoswitching/blinking of the fluorophores, and thus could facilitate significant speed-ups for certain biological imaging/tracking tasks.</description>

      <title>Enhanced third-harmonic generation empowered by doubly degenerate quasi-bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in nonlinear nanophotonics are driven by the exploration of sharp resonances within high-index dielectric metasurfaces. In this work, we leverage doubly degenerate quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs) to demonstrate robust enhancement of third-harmonic generation (THG) in silicon metasurfaces. These quasi-BICs are governed by $C_{4v}$ symmetry and therefore can be equally excited with the pump light regardless of polarization. By tailoring the geometric parameters, we effectively control $Q$-factors and field confinement of quasi-BICs, and thus regulate their resonantly enhanced THG process. A maximum THG conversion efficiency up to $1.03\times10^{-5}$ is recorded under a pump intensity of 5.85 GW/cm$^{2}$. Polarization-independent THG profile is further confirmed by mapping its signal across the polarization directions. This work establishes foundational strategies for the ultracompact design of robust and high-efficiency photon upconversion systems.</description>

      <title>Phase-change metasurfaces for reconfigurable image processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces have enabled high-speed, low-power image processing within a compact footprint. However, reconfigurable imaging in such flat devices remains a critical challenge for fully harnessing their potential in practical applications. Here, we propose and demonstrate phase-change metasurfaces capable of dynamically switching between edge detection and bright-field imaging in the visible spectrum. This reconfigurability is achieved through engineering angular dispersion at electric and magnetic Mie-type resonances. The customized metasurface exhibits an angle-dependent transmittance profile in the amorphous state of Sb$_{2}$S$_{3}$ meta-atoms for efficient isotropic edge detection, and an angle-independent profile in the crystalline state for uniform bright-field imaging. The nanostructured Sb$_{2}$S$_{3}$-based reconfigurable image processing metasurfaces hold significant potential for applications in computer vision for autonomous driving systems.</description>

      <title>Black GeSn on Silicon for Enhanced Short-Wave Infrared Detection and Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensitive and cost-effective Group-IV short-wave infrared (SWIR) photodetectors (PDs), compatible with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) processes, are crucial for various emerging applications. Here, we developed a black GeSn thin-film PD on silicon, optimised for efficient SWIR photodetection and imaging. Incorporating Sn into the Ge layer effectively extended the photodetection range to 1960 nm. The blackening of the GeSn surface resulted in a substantial reduction of reflection loss across a broad spectral range of 1200-2200 nm. Furthermore, the responsivity experienced a remarkable increase of 1.45 times through reduced reflection loss and carrier multiplication by the carrier ionization. The black GeSn surface significantly boosts the detectivity, enhances the wide-angle SWIR photodetection, and improves the quality of the resultant images. This demonstration heralds a new era for CMOS-compatible, cost-effective, high-performance black GeSn PDs and imagers for a wide range of applications in the underexplored SWIR region.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced continuous-wave microscopy using unstabilized cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopy gives access to spatially resolved dynamics in different systems, from biological cells to cold atoms. A big challenge is maximizing the information per used probe particle to limit the damage to the probed system. We present a cavity-enhanced continuous-wave microscopy approach that provides enhanced signal-to-noise ratios at fixed damage. Employing a self-imaging 4f cavity, we show contrast enhancement for controlled test samples as well as biological samples. For thick samples, the imaging cavity leads to a new form of dark-field microscopy, where the separation of scattered and unscattered light is based on optical path length. We theoretically show that enhanced signal, signal-to-noise, and signal-to-noise per damage are also retrieved when the cavity cannot be stabilized. Our results provide an approach to cavity-enhanced microscopy with unstabilized cavities and might be used to enhance the performance of dispersive imaging of ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Massively Multiplexed Wide-field Photon Correlation Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal photon correlations have been a crucial resource for quantum and quantum-enabled optical science for over half a century. However, attaining non-classical information through these correlations has typically been limited to a single point (or at best, a few points) at-a-time. We perform here a massively multiplexed wide-field photon correlation measurement using a large $500\times500$ single-photon avalanche diode array, the SwissSPAD3. We demonstrate the performance of this apparatus by acquiring wide-field photon correlation measurements of single-photon emitters, and illustrate two applications of the attained quantum information: wide-field emitter counting and quantum-enabled super-resolution imaging (by a factor of $\sqrt{2})$. The considerations and limitations of applying this technique in a practical context are discussed. Ultimately, the realization of massively multiplexed wide-field photon correlation measurements can accelerate quantum sensing protocols and quantum-enabled imaging techniques by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>X-Ray-Driven Photon Bunching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) interferometry is a milestone experiment that transformed our understanding of the nature of light. The concept was demonstrated in 1956 to measure the radii of stars through photon coincidence detection. This form of coincidence detection later became a cornerstone of modern quantum optics. Here we connect HBT interferometry to the physics of scintillation, the process of spontaneous light emission upon excitation by high-energy particles, such as x-rays. Our work reveals intrinsic photon bunching in the scintillation process, which we utilize to elucidate its underlying light emission mechanisms. Specifically, g^((2) ) ({\tau}) enables the quantitative extraction of scintillation lifetime and light yield, showing their dependence on temperature and X-ray flux as well. This approach provides a characterization method that we benchmark on a wide gamut of scintillators, including rare-earth-doped garnets and perovskite nanocrystals. Our method is particularly important for nano- and micro-scale scintillators, whose properties are challenging to quantify by conventional means: We extract the scintillation properties in perovskite nanocrystals of only a few hundreds of nanometers, observing strong photon bunching (g^((2) ) (0)&gt;50). Our research paves the way for broader use of photon-coincidence measurement and methods from quantum optics in studying materials with complex optical properties in extremes regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.</description>

      <title>Time-reversed Young's experiment: Deterministic, diffractionless second-order interference effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic Young's double-slit experiment exhibits first-order interference, producing alternating bright and dark fringes modulated by the diffraction effect of the slits. In contrast, here we demonstrate that its time-reversed configuration produces an ideal, deterministic second-order 'ghost' interference pattern devoid of diffraction and first-order effect, with the size dependent on the dimensions of the `effectively extended light source.' Furthermore, the new system enables a range of effects and phenomena not available in traditional double-slit interference studies, including the formation of programmed and digitized interference fringes and the coincidence of the pattern plane and the source plane. Despite the absence of first-order interference, our proposed experiment does not rely on nonclassical correlations or quantum entanglement. The elimination of diffraction through time-reversal symmetry holds promise for advancing superresolution optical imaging and sensing techniques beyond existing capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate advanced CMOS-compatible Graphene/Silicon active metasurfaces based on guided-mode resonance filters. The simulated results show a high extinction ratio (&gt;25 dB), narrow linewidth (~1.5 nm @1550 nm), quality factor of Q~1000, and polarization-insensitive operation. By taking advantage of graphene broadband absorption, we present a multispectral operation in the MIR using simple geometrical scaling rules. We further showcase that the same device architecture can be employed for thermo-optic tuning using graphene as an integrated microheater. Our work contributes to the development of advanced broadband silicon-based active metasurfaces for tunable spectral filters and laser mirrors, optical switches, modulators, and sensors.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient broadband THz upconversion with Dirac materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of the THz frequency domain in future network generations offers an unparalleled level of capacity, which can enhance innovative applications in wireless communication, analytics, and imaging. Communication technologies rely on frequency mixing, enabling signals to be converted from one frequency to another and transmitted from a sender to a receiver. Technically, this process is implemented using nonlinear components such as diodes or transistors. However, the highest operation frequency of this approach is limited to sub-THz bands. Here, we demonstrate the upconversion of a weak sub-THz signal from a photoconductive antenna to multiple THz bands. The key element is a high-mobility HgTe-based heterostructure with electronic band inversion, leading to one of the strongest third-order nonlinearities among all materials in the THz range. Due to the Dirac character of electron dispersion, the highly intense sub-THz radiation is efficiently mixed with the antenna signal, resulting in a THz response at linear combinations of their frequencies. The field conversion efficiency above 2$\%$ is provided by a bare tensile-strained HgTe layer with a thickness below 100 nm at room temperature under ambient conditions. Devices based on Dirac materials allow for high degree of integration, with field-enhancing metamaterial structures, making them very promising for THz communication with unprecedented data transfer rate.</description>

      <title>Analytic 3D vector non-uniform Fourier crystal optics in arbitrary $\bar{\bar{\varepsilon}}$ dielectric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and heart-like shapes, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</description>

      <title>Tunable beam splitting via photorefractive nonlinearity and its applications in chiral waveguide induction and vortex generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report experimental observation and theoretical explanation of novel propagation regimes for optical beams in an artificial nonlinear material with outstanding photorefractive properties. Nondiffractive beams, which keep their shapes invariant in the free space, feature self-splitting from the middle in two separating secondary beams, due to the light-matter interaction. The splitting degree is controlled by means of a phase-pre-modulation method. We propose applications of the self-splitting to the creation of an effectively chiral waveguide and the generation of even-order vortices.</description>

      <title>Complex energy structures of exceptional point pairs in two level systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of multiple exceptional points in non-Hermitian two-level systems, emphasizing vorticity as a topological invariant arising from complex energy structures. We categorize EP pairs as fundamental building blocks of larger EP assemblies, distinguishing two types: type-I pairs with opposite vorticities and type-II pairs with identical vorticities. By analyzing the branch cut formation in a two-dimensional parameter space, we reveal the distinct topological features of each EP pair type. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to configurations with multiple EPs, demonstrating the cumulative vorticity and topological implications. To illustrate these theoretical structures, we model complex energy bands within a two-dimensional photonic crystal composed of lossy materials, identifying various EP pairs and their branch cuts. These findings contribute to the understanding of topological characteristics in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report room temperature heterodyne detection of a quantum cascade laser beaten with a local oscillator on a unipolar quantum photodetector in two different atmospheric windows, at 4.8 $\mu$m and 9 $\mu$m. A noise equivalent power of few pW is measured by employing an active stabilization technique in which the local oscillator and the signal are locked in phase. The measured heterodyne noise equivalent power is six orders of magnitude lower than that obtained with direct detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical and plasmonic properties of the chains of prolate metallic spheroids of the dielectric substrate are studied in the work using the local field approximation. The case when spheroids are arranged in such a way that their major semi-axis belongs to the substrate plane is considered. The relations for the transverse component of the chain polarizability tensor and the frequency of the transverse chain resonance are obtained. The comparative analysis of spectral shifts of the maxima of the imaginary part of the transverse chain polarizability and the polarizability of isolated prolate spheroid is performed. The influence of the variation of the material of particles in the chain and the dielectric environment on the location of the maxima of the imaginary part of the transverse polarizability is studied. The limits of applicability of the theory proposed in the paper are established.</description>

      <title>Thermo-optic tuning of directional infrared emissivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuning the spatial extent of directional thermal emission across an arbitrary, and fixed spectral bandwidth is a fundamentally enabling capability for a range of emerging applications such as thermophotovoltaics, thermal imaging, and radiative cooling. However, previous experimental demonstrations were limited to narrow bandwidths, and the resonance frequency itself changed significantly as a function of the reconfigured directional response. Here, we present a thermally reconfigurable metamaterial platform demonstrate thermo-optic tuning of directional infrared emissivity using InAs-based gradient ENZ materials , functioning as a broadband directional thermal emitters whose angular extent of "thermal beaming", and thus its angular selectivity, can be gradually modified reconfigured via thermal free-carrier effects. We experimentally demonstrate two emitters achievingexhibiting a 5{\deg} and 10{\deg} increase in theeir angular extent of strongof their directional emissivity in the p- polarization across a prescribed, broad wavelength range of operation (12.5 to 15{\mu}m), for moderate temperatures below 400 K. Central to this capability is the decoupling of the angular and spectral response over the entire spectral emissivity bandwidth.Temperature-driven control of directional emissivity offers a new mode of post-fabrication control of radiative heat transfer that may in turn enable novel device functionalities.</description>

      <title>A Versatile Chip-Scale Platform for High-Rate Entanglement Generation using an AlGaAs Microresonator Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated photonic microresonators have become an essential resource for generating photonic qubits for quantum information processing, entanglement distribution and networking, and quantum communications. The pair generation rate is enhanced by reducing the microresonator radius, but this comes at the cost of increasing the frequency mode spacing and reducing the quantum information spectral density. Here, we circumvent this rate-density trade-off in an AlGaAs-on-insulator photonic device by multiplexing an array of 20 small-radius microresonators each producing a 650-GHz-spaced comb of time-energy entangled-photon pairs. The resonators can be independently tuned via integrated thermo-optic heaters, enabling control of the mode spacing from degeneracy up to a full free spectral range. We demonstrate simultaneous pumping of five resonators with up to $50$ GHz relative comb offsets, where each resonator produces pairs exhibiting time-energy entanglement visibilities up to 95$\%$, coincidence-to-accidental ratios exceeding 5,000, and an on-chip pair rate up to 2.6 GHz/mW$^2$ per comb line -- more than 40 times improvement over prior work. As a demonstration, we generate frequency-bin qubits in a maximally entangled two-qubit Bell state with fidelity exceeding 87$\%$ (90$\%$ with background correction) and detected frequency-bin entanglement rates up to 7 kHz ($\sim 70$ MHz on-chip pair rate) using $\sim 250$ $\mu$W pump power. Multiplexing small-radius microresonators combines the key capabilities required for programmable and dense photonic qubit encoding while retaining high pair-generation rates, heralded single-photon purity, and entanglement fidelity.</description>

Abstract: Intra-system entanglement occurs between non-separable modes within the same system. For optical systems, the various degrees of freedom of light represent different modes, and the potential use of light to create higher dimensional classical entangle states offers a promising potential to drive new technological developments. In this work, we present experimental results demonstrating the orthogonality between transverse orbital angular momentum (t-OAM) of different spatiotemporal topological charges, a previously unverified property of t-OAM. Based on those results, we developed methods to create and characterize a novel family of t-OAM and polarization entangled spatiotemporal structured light. We further provide theoretical analysis to support our study of the entanglement between those modes. By demonstrating the feasibility of leveraging t-OAM as a new family of modes for classical entanglement, our work represents a new advancement towards higher dimensional classical entanglement strategies.</description>

      <title>All-Angle Nonlocal Metasurfaces on Demand: Universal Realization of Normal Susceptibilities via Multilayered Printed-Circuit-Board (PCB) Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embedding normal susceptibilities in metasurfaces (MS), in tandem with their tangential counterparts, greatly enriches their spatial dispersion. Particularly, judicious siphoning of the microscopic nonlocality associated with such enhanced meta-atoms facilitates global control over the MS response across the entire angular range, specifically at challenging near-grazing scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a rigorous closed-form methodology to realize such intricate mixtures of tangential and normal components via a highly practical platform -- printed-circuit-board- (PCB) compatible cascaded admittance sheets. To this end, we derive a universal all-angular link between this MS-level composite, which leverages macroscopic nonlocality of multiple reflections, to its underlying meta-atom-level susceptibilities. We demonstrate this scheme by devising a PCB all-angle-transparent generalized Huygens' MS radome and an all-angle perfect-magnetic-conductor (PMC) PCB MS. Validated in simulation and experiment, our results pave the path toward a new insightful paradigm for studying and engineering nonlocal metadevices, e.g., optical analog computers and spaceplates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous work [Physical Review Letters 114, 213601 (2015)] has shown that thermal light with a blackbody spectrum cannot be decomposed as a mixture of independent localized pulses. We find that thermal light with a flat spectrum, which can occur when spectral filtering is applied, can be decomposed into a direct product of independent localized pulses. Furthermore, we show in the weak-source limit that the first non-vacuum term of thermal light with a flat spectrum is a mixture of independent localized pulses. We quantify the deviation from independent pulses when the spectrum is not flat.</description>

      <title>Intrinsically chiral exciton polaritons in an atomically-thin semiconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as a versatile tool for enhancing light-matter interactions by strongly confining light fields. Chiral BICs are photonic resonances with a high degree of circular polarisation, which hold great promise for spin-selective applications in quantum optics and nanophotonics. Here, we demonstrate a novel application of a chiral BIC for inducing strong coupling between the circularly polarised photons and spin-polarised (valley) excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) in atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenide crystals (TMDCs). By placing monolayer WS$_2$ onto the BIC-hosting metasurface, we observe the formation of intrinsically chiral, valley-selective exciton polaritons, evidenced by circularly polarised photoluminescence (PL) at two distinct energy levels. The PL intensity and degree of circular polarisation of polaritons exceed those of uncoupled excitons in our structure by an order of magnitude. Our microscopic model shows that this enhancement is due to folding of the Brillouin zone creating a direct emission path for high-momenta polaritonic states far outside the light cone, thereby providing a shortcut to thermalisation (energy relaxation) and suppressing depolarisation. Moreover, while the polarisation of the upper polariton is determined by the valley excitons, the lower polariton behaves like an intrinsic chiral emitter with its polarisation fixed by the BIC. Therefore, the spin alignment of the upper and lower polaritons ($\uparrow\downarrow$ and $\uparrow \uparrow$) can be controlled by $\sigma^+$ and $\sigma^-$ polarised optical excitation, respectively. Our work introduces a new type of chiral light-matter quasi-particles in atomically-thin semiconductors and provides an insight into their energy relaxation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Two-Photon Interference of Photons from Remote Tin-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable quantum networks rely on optical connections between long-lived qubits to distribute entanglement. Tin vacancies in diamond have emerged as promising long-lived qubits, offering extended spin coherence times at liquid helium temperatures and spin-dependent, highly coherent optical transitions for effective photon-based communication. Connecting remote nodes requires quantum interference of indistinguishable photons, which is challenging in an inhomogeneous solid-state environment. Here, we demonstrate a two-node experiment with tin vacancies in diamond, which exhibit a resonant frequency distribution spanning approximately 8 GHz. To overcome the frequency mismatch, we tune the resonant frequencies of one node using the Stark effect. We achieve tunability up to 4 GHz while maintaining optical coherence. As a demonstration, we achieve detuning-dependent remote two-photon interference between separate nodes, obtaining 80(6)% interference visibility without postprocessing when the defects' optical transitions are tuned into resonance, and 63(8)% with detuning up to 20 times their natural linewidths. These results highlight the potential of tin-vacancy centres in diamond for establishing robust optical links between remote quantum registers.</description>

Abstract: Frequency-bin encoding furnishes a compelling pathway for quantum information processing systems compatible with established lightwave infrastructures based on fiber-optic transmission and wavelength-division multiplexing. Yet although significant progress has been realized in proof-of-principle tabletop demonstrations, ranging from arbitrary single-qubit gates to controllable multiphoton interference, challenges in scaling frequency-bin processors to larger systems remain. In this Perspective, we highlight recent advances at the intersection of frequency-bin encoding and integrated photonics that are fundamentally transforming the outlook for scalable frequency-based quantum information. Focusing specifically on results on sources, state manipulation, and hyperentanglement, we envision a possible future in which on-chip frequency-bin circuits fulfill critical roles in quantum information processing, particularly in communications and networking.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Optimization of Interferometric Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy (iDWS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that light speckle fluctuations provide a means for noninvasive measurements of cerebral blood flow index (CBFi). While conventional Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS) provides marginal brain sensitivity for CBFi in adult humans, new techniques have recently emerged to improve diffuse light throughput and thus, brain sensitivity. Here we further optimize one such approach, interferometric diffusing wave spectroscopy (iDWS), with respect to number of independent channels, camera duty cycle and full well capacity, incident power, noise and artifact mitigation, and data processing. We build the system on a cart and define conditions for stable operation. We show pulsatile CBFi monitoring at 4-4.5 cm source-collector separation in adults with moderate pigmentation (Fitzpatrick 4). We also report preliminary clinical measurements in the Neuro Intensive Care Unit (Neuro ICU). These results push the boundaries of iDWS CBFi monitoring performance beyond previous reports.</description>

      <title>Broadband High-Performance Terahertz Polarizers by Nanoimprint Lithography for Advanced Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.10029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz polarizers are essential for advanced spectroscopic systems but face challenges like low transmission, short bandwidths and low extinction ratios. This study demonstrates the development of ultrabroadband THz polarizers using nanoimprint lithography, achieving high performance through double-wire-grid polarizer (DWGP) structures on cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) substrates. Compared to silicon-based alternatives, the polymer DWGPs demonstrated over twice the TM-polarized transmittance across the 0.1 - 25 THz range. The degree of polarization exceeded 98% in a 0.1-16 THz range, with a maximum extinction ratio above 65.4 dB at 4.2 THz.
  Simultaneous characterization of materials using THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) covered extended frequency ranges of 0.1 - 40 THz and 0.9 - 20 THz, respectively. Nanofabricated polymer DWGP revealed the superior optical properties, including enhanced TM transmittance and reduced TE leakage when compared to Si DWGP. Additionally, the fabricated polymer polarizers showcased cost-effectiveness, scalability, and durability, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional Si-based polarizers.
  The significant developments demonstrated in this study position polymer-based DWGPs as significant components for THz imaging, sensing, and wireless communication systems, paving the way for next-generation technologies.</description>

Abstract: We present 4D topological textures in (quasi)monochromatic nonparaxial optical lattices that contain all possible polarization ellipses with every combination of ellipticity and orientation in 3D space. These fields span the nonparaxial polarization space (a complex projective plane) and a 4-sphere within specific spatiotemporal regions, forming 4D skyrmionic structures. Constructed from five plane waves with adiabatically varying relative amplitudes, they are experimentally realizable in free space by focusing a temporally variant beam with a high numerical aperture lens.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for understanding diffuse multiple scattering (DMS) in single crystals, focusing on diffuse scattering-Bragg (DS-Bragg) channels. These channels, when probed with high-flux, low-divergent monochromatic synchrotron X-rays, provide well-defined visualizations of Kossel lines. Our main contribution lies in modeling the intensity distribution along these lines by considering DS around individual reciprocal lattice nodes. The model incorporates contributions from both general DS and mosaicity, elucidating their connection to second-order scattering events. This comprehensive approach advances our understanding of DMS phenomena, enabling their use as probes for complex material behavior, particularly under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Robust High-frequency Laser Phase Noise Suppression by Adaptive Pound-Drever-Hall Feedforward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppressing high-frequency laser phase noise, particularly at frequencies near and beyond typical feedback bandwidths of a few MHz, is a critical yet challenging task in many advanced applications. Feedforward-based methods generally outperform feedback in high-frequency range, but their performances are more susceptible to perturbations. In this work, we focus on the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH)-feedforward method we demonstrated recently [Yu-Xin Chao et al., Optica 11(7), 945-950 (2024)] and analyze the factors that affect its long-term stability. By constructing a simple circuit allowing for adaptive control of the feedforward gain in response to power fluctuations of cavity transmission, we demonstrate a robust $\geq 40$ dB suppression of laser phase noise around 2 MHz and a noise suppression bandwidth up to 50 MHz. In comparison, when using normal PDH feedback, robust noise suppression of over 40 dB can only occur for frequencies below tens of kHz in most setups. Our findings may pave the way for general usage of PDH feedforward and allow for simple construction of low-noise lasers for precise quantum controls and precision metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) waveguides, which enable efficient quadratic nonlinear processes, serve as crucial foundation for classical and quantum signal processing. To expand their application scope, we provide the first investigation of nonlinear conversion processes in periodically poled TFLN waveguides at cryogenic condition (7 K). Through systematic experimental characterization, we find that the periodically poled TFLN waveguide retains its high conversion efficiency at both cryogenic and room temperatures for both classical second-harmonic generation and quantum photon-pair generation processes. Particularly, the photon-pair source at cryogenic condition shows high brightness and broad bandwidth. These results demonstrate the significant potential of TFLN wavelength conversion devices for cryogenic applications and foster future scalable quantum photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Cartesian and spherical multipole expansions in anisotropic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multipole expansion can be formulated in spherical and Cartesian coordinates. By constructing an explicit map linking both formulations in isotropic media, we discover a lack of equivalence between them in anisotropic media. In isotropic media, the Cartesian multipole tensor can be reduced to a spherical tensor containing fewer entries. In anisotropic media, however, the loss of propagation symmetry prevents this reduction. Consequently, non-harmonic sources radiate fields that can be projected onto a finite set of Cartesian multipole moments but require potentially infinitely many spherical moments. For harmonic sources, the link between the two approaches provides a systematic way to construct the spherical multipole expansion from the Cartesian one. The lack of equivalence between both approaches results in physically significant effects wherever the field propagation includes the Laplace operator. We demonstrate this issue in an electromagnetic radiation inverse problem in anisotropic media, including an analysis of a large-anisotropy regime and an introduction to vector spherical harmonics. We show that the use of the Cartesian approach increases the efficiency and interpretability of the model. The proposed approach opens the door to wider applications of the multipole expansion and new degrees of freedom in anisotropic media.</description>

      <title>Ultrabroadband tunable difference frequency generation in standardized thin-film lithium niobate platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) on insulator is a promising platform for nonlinear photonic integrated circuits (PICs) due to its strong light confinement, high second-order nonlinearity, and flexible quasi-phase matching for three-wave mixing processes via periodic poling. Among the three-wave mixing processes of interest, difference frequency generation (DFG) can produce long wave infrared (IR) light from readily available near IR inputs. While broadband DFG is well studied for mid-IR frequencies, achieving broadband idler generation within the telecom window (near C-band) and the short-wave infrared (near 2 micron) is more challenging due to stringent dispersion profile requirements, especially when using standardized TFLN thicknesses. In this paper, we investigate various standard waveguide designs to pinpoint favorable conditions for broadband DFG operation covering several telecom bands. Our simulations identify viable designs with a possible 3-dB conversion efficiency bandwidth (CE-BW) of 300 nm and our measurements show idler generation from 1418 nm to 1740 nm, limited by our available sources, experimentally confirming our design approach. Furthermore, temperature tuning allows further shift of the idler towards the mid-IR, up to 1819 nm. We also achieve a stretched wavelength range of idler generation by leveraging the longitudinal variation of the waveguide in addition to poling. Finally, our numerical simulations show the possibility of extending the CE-BW up to 780 nm while focusing on waveguide cross-sections that are available for fabrication within a foundry. Our work provides a methodology that bridges the deviations between fabricated and designed cross-sections, paving a way for standardized broadband DFG building blocks.</description>

      <title>Photoacoustic Iterative Optimization Algorithm with Shape Prior Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) suffers from inherent limitations that can degrade the quality of reconstructed results, such as noise, artifacts and incomplete data acquisition caused by sparse sampling or partial array detection. In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we apply a thermodynamical approach to elucidate the primary constraints on the energy scaling of dissipative solitons (DS). We rely on the adiabatic theory of strongly chirped DS and define the DS energy scaling in terms of dissipative soliton resonance (DSR). Three main experimentally verifiable signatures identify a transition to DSR: i) growth of a Lorentzian spike at the centrum of the DS spectrum, which resembles a spectral condensation in Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), ii) saturation of the spectrum broadening, and iii) asymptotical DS stretching. We connect the DSR breakup with three critical factors: i) decoupling of two correlation scales inherent in strongly chirped DS, ii) resulting rise of the DS entropy with energy, which provokes its disintegration, and iii) transition to a nonequilibrium phase, which is characterized by negative temperature. The breakup results in multiple stable DSs with lower energy. Theoretical results are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental data from a Kerr-lens mode-locked Cr$^{2+}$:ZnS chirped-pulse oscillator (CPO) that paves the way for optimizing high-energy femtosecond pulse generation in solid-state CPO and all-normal-dispersion fiber lasers.</description>

Abstract: Correlative computational microscopy is accelerating the mapping of dynamic biological systems by integrating morphological and molecular measurements across spatial scales, from organelles to entire organisms. Visualization, measurement, and prediction of interactions among the components of biological systems can be accelerated by generalist computational imaging frameworks that relax the trade-offs imposed by multiplex dynamic imaging. This work reports a generalist framework for wave optical imaging of the architectural order (waveOrder) among biomolecules for encoding and decoding multiple specimen properties from a minimal set of acquired channels, with or without fluorescent labels. waveOrder expresses material properties in terms of elegant physically motivated basis vectors directly interpretable as phase, absorption, birefringence, diattenuation, and fluorophore density; and it expresses image data in terms of directly measurable Stokes parameters. We report a corresponding multi-channel reconstruction algorithm to recover specimen properties in multiple contrast modes. With this framework, we implement multiple 3D computational microscopy methods, including quantitative phase imaging, quantitative label-free imaging with phase and polarization, and fluorescence deconvolution imaging, across scales ranging from organelles to whole zebrafish. These advances are available via an extensible open-source computational imaging library, waveOrder, and a napari plugin, recOrder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach using Multiplex-Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (M-CARS) for la-bel-free discriminations in biomedical tissues. The strategy is based on the evaluation of the contrast be-tween resonant and nonresonant contributions in a M-CARS hyperspectral dataset, and tested to identify and differentiate thin actin filaments from thick myosin filaments in muscle tissue without any labeling. First step consists in ensuring knowledge of the spatial regions containing thick myosin filaments thanks to its endogenous second harmonic signal, deducing expected location for thin actin filaments between myosin filaments. The ratio of resonant and nonresonant contributions for each pixel of the hyperspectral image allows then to discriminate actin from myosin filaments, whose localization is in accordance with the SHG probing. This qualitative imaging represents a proof of principle for highlighting and discriminat-ing purposes in biological microscopy, thanks to the difference in the nonlinear properties of the related proteins. This paves the way for considering label-free imaging through a competition between two third-order nonlinear signatures.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate coherent Doppler-free three-photon excitation of the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ optical clock transition and the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{1}$ intercombination transition in free-space thermal clouds of $^{88}$Sr atoms. By appropriate orientation of the wavevectors of three lasers incident on the atoms, the first-order Doppler shift can be eliminated for all velocity classes. Three-photon excitation of the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{1}$ transition enables high-contrast Ramsey spectroscopy with interrogation times comparable to the 21$\mu$s natural lifetime using a single near-resonant laser source. Three-photon spectroscopy on the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ clock transition, using only laser frequencies nearly resonant with the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ and $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{1}$ transitions, enables a reduction in Doppler broadening by two orders of magnitude and a corresponding $\sim470$Hz linewidth without a confining potential.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the fundamental limit of quantum transduction via intraband entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum transducer converts an input signal to an output probe at a distant frequency band while maintaining the quantum information with high fidelity, which is crucial for quantum networking and distributed quantum sensing and computing. In terms of microwave-optical quantum transduction, the state-of-the-art quantum transducers suffer low transduction efficiency from weak nonlinear coupling, wherein increasing pump power to enhance efficiency inevitably leads to thermal noise from heating. Moreover, we reveal that the efficiency-bandwidth product of a cavity electro-optical or electro-optomechanical transducer is fundamentally limited by pump power and nonlinear coupling coefficient, irrespective of cavity engineering efforts. To overcome this fundamental limit, we propose to noiselessly boost the transduction efficiency by consuming intraband entanglement (e.g., microwave-microwave or optical-optical entanglement in the case of microwave-optical transduction). Via a squeezer-coupler-antisqueezer sandwich structure, the protocol enhances the transduction efficiency to unity in the ideal lossless case, given an arbitrarily weak pump and nonlinear coupling. In practical cavity systems, our entanglement-assisted protocol surpasses the non-assisted fundamental limit of the efficiency-bandwidth product and reduces the threshold cooperativity for positive quantum capacity by a factor proportional to two-mode squeezing gain. Given a fixed cooperativity, our approach increases the broadband quantum capacity by orders of magnitude. The entanglement-assisted advantage is robust to ancilla loss and cavity detuning.</description>

Abstract: The extreme electric fields created in high-intensity laser-plasma interactions could generate energetic ions far more compactly than traditional accelerators. Despite this promise, laser-plasma accelerators have remained stagnant at maximum ion energies of 100 MeV/nucleon for the last twenty years. The central challenge is the low charge-to-mass ratio of ions, which has precluded one of the most successful approaches used for electrons: laser wakefield acceleration. Here we show that a laser pulse with a focal spot that moves transverse to the laser propagation direction enables wakefield acceleration of ions to GeV energies in underdense plasma. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that this relativistic-intensity "transverse flying focus" can trap ions in a comoving electrostatic pocket, producing a monoenergetic collimated ion beam. With a peak intensity of $10^{20}\,$W/cm$^2$ and an acceleration distance of $0.44\,$cm, we observe a proton beam with $23.1\,$pC charge, $1.6\,$GeV peak energy, and $3.7\,$% relative energy spread. This approach allows for compact high-repetition-rate production of high-energy ions, highlighting the capability of more generalized spatio-temporal pulse shaping to address open problems in plasma physics.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of The Brightest Nano-size Gamma Source</title>

Abstract: Gamma rays selectively interact with nuclei, induce and mediate nuclear reactions and elementary particle interactions, and exceed x-rays in penetrating power and thus are indispensable for analysis and modification of dense objects. Yet, the available gamma sources lack sufficient power and brightness. The predicted and highly desirable laser-driven gamma flash, from here on termed "Gamma Flash", based on inverse Compton scattering from solid targets at extreme irradiances (&gt;$10^{23}W/cm^2$), would be the highest-power and the brightest terrestrial gamma source with a 30-40% laser-to-gamma energy conversion. However, Gamma Flash remains inaccessible experimentally due to the Bremsstrahlung background. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new interaction regime at the highest effective irradiance where Gamma Flash scaled quickly with the laser power and produced several times the number of Bremsstrahlung photons. Simulations revealed an attosecond, Terawatt Gamma Flash with a nanometre source size achieving a record brightness exceeding $~10^{23}photons/mm^2mrad^2s$ per 0.1% bandwidth at tens of MeV photon energies, surpassing astrophysical Gamma Ray Bursts. These findings could revolutionize inertial fusion energy by enabling unprecedented sub-micrometre/femtosecond resolution radiography of fuel mixing instabilities in extremely-compressed targets. The new gamma source could facilitate significant advances in time-resolved nuclear physics, homeland security, nuclear waste management and non-proliferation, while opening possibilities for spatially-coherent gamma rays.</description>

      <title>Spatial localization and diffusion of Dirac particles and waves induced by random temporal medium variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09208</link>

Abstract: Wave propagation in time-varying media has attracted significant attention for its innovative potential to control wave-matter interactions and to develop versatile active materials. While most research has focused on electromagnetic waves, studies on Dirac-type waves remain limited. In this work, we investigate temporal scattering in pseudospin-1/2 Dirac systems with random temporal mass variations. Using the invariant imbedding method, we derive exact expressions for temporal reflectance in both short- and long-time regimes. In the long-time limit, reflectance probabilities become uniformly distributed, and wave group velocities decay to zero, indicating spatial localization. Numerical simulations reveal that narrow wave pulses evolve into Gaussian shapes, with their centers localizing and their widths growing indefinitely due to diffusive behavior. This universal phenomenon is independent of the initial pulse profile and the statistical properties of the random mass. Our findings demonstrate that random temporal variations can induce insulating behavior in Dirac materials, offering potential applications in solid-state physics and optics.</description>

      <title>Successive optimization of optics and post-processing with differentiable coherent PSF operator and field information</title>

Abstract: Recently, the joint design of optical systems and downstream algorithms is showing significant potential. However, existing rays-described methods are limited to optimizing geometric degradation, making it difficult to fully represent the optical characteristics of complex, miniaturized lenses constrained by wavefront aberration or diffraction effects. In this work, we introduce a precise optical simulation model, and every operation in pipeline is differentiable. This model employs a novel initial value strategy to enhance the reliability of intersection calculation on high aspherics. Moreover, it utilizes a differential operator to reduce memory consumption during coherent point spread function calculations. To efficiently address various degradation, we design a joint optimization procedure that leverages field information. Guided by a general restoration network, the proposed method not only enhances the image quality, but also successively improves the optical performance across multiple lenses that are already in professional level. This joint optimization pipeline offers innovative insights into the practical design of sophisticated optical systems and post-processing algorithms.
