      <title>Infinity thick quasiconvexity and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate geometric properties of a metric measure space where every function in the Newton--Sobolev space $N^{1,\infty}(Z)$ has a Lipschitz representative. We prove that when the metric space is locally complete and the reference measure is infinitesimally doubling, the above property is equivalent to the space being very $\infty$-thick quasiconvex up to a scale. That is, up to some scale, every pair of points can be joined by a family of quasiconvex curves that is not negligible for the $\infty$-modulus.
  As a first application, we prove a local-to-global improvement for the weak $(1,\infty)$-Poincar\'e inequality for locally complete quasiconvex metric spaces that have a doubling reference measure. As a second application, we apply our results to the existence and uniqueness of $\infty$-harmonic extensions with Lipschitz boundary data for precompact domains in a large class of metric measure spaces. As a final application, we illustrate that in the context of Sobolev extension sets, very $\infty$-thick quasiconvexity up to a scale plays an analogous role as local uniform quasiconvexity does in the Euclidean space.
  Our assumptions are adapted to the analysis of Sobolev extension sets and thus avoid stronger assumptions such as the doubling property of the measure. Examples satisfying our assumptions naturally occur as simplicial complexes, GCBA spaces, and metric quotients of Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>Curves with increasing chords in normed planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A curve has the increasing chord property if for any points $a,b,c,d$ in this order on the curve, the distance of $a,d$ is not smaller than that of $b,c$. Answering a conjecture of Larman and McMullen, Rote proved in 1994 that the arclength of a curve in the Euclidean plane with the increasing chord property is at most $\frac{2\pi}{3}$ times the distance of its endpoints, and this inequality is sharp. In this note we generalize the result of Rote for curves in a normed plane with a strictly convex norm, based on an investigation of the geometric properties of involutes in normed planes. We also discuss some related extremum problems.</description>

      <title>Constructions of Large m-Distance Sets on Triangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An $m$-distance set is a collection of points such that the distances between any two points have $m$ possible values. We use two different methods to construct large $m$-distance sets on the triangular lattices. One is to use the first m smallest distances and find the largest cliques, and the other is using the notions of hexagons. Multiplicities of the distances were observed for comparison for the two methods.</description>

      <title>A Colorful Version of Carath\'eodory's Theorem plus a constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a topological framework in an attempt to generalize the classical colourful Caratheodory theorem by imposing an additional constraint. For that we introduce the notion of zero-avoding complexes and covering criteria for the existence of colourful transversals. Using the developed method in combination with the homological Nerve theorem of Meshulam we recover all known versions of the colourful Caratheodory's theorem and prove a constraint extension which, in particular, implies an extension of the original (affine) Tverberg result.</description>

      <title>Geometric properties of unit groups of von Neumann's continuous rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, if $R$ is an irreducible, continuous ring, then its unit group $\mathrm{GL}(R)$, equipped with the topology generated by the rank metric, is topologically simple modulo its center, path-connected, locally path-connected, bounded in the sense of Bourbaki, and not admitting any non-zero escape function. All these topological insights are consequences of more refined geometric results concerning the rank metric, in particular with regard to the set of algebraic elements. Thanks to the phenomenon of automatic continuity, our results also have non-trivial ramifications for the underlying abstract groups.</description>

      <title>Approximation of rearrangements by polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetric decreasing rearrangement of functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$ features in several seminal inequalities, such as the P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality. The latter was shown by the authors to hold for all smoothing rearrangements, a class that includes the more general $(k,n)$-Steiner rearrangement, as well as others introduced by Brock and by Solynin. The theory of rearrangements and their associated set maps is developed, with an emphasis on approximation, particularly by polarizations. The P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality holds with equality for polarizations, so is proved relatively easily for rearrangements that can be suitably approximated by them. One goal here is to show that the Brock rearrangements cannot be approximated in such a way. It turns out that under mild conditions, each set map associated with a rearrangement has in turn an associated contraction map from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$. With this new analytical tool, several general results on the approximation of rearrangements are also proved.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Circle Packings with Flexible Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.07165v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circle packings are arrangement of circles satisfying specified tangency requirements. Many problems about packing of circles and spheres occur in nature particularly in material design and protein structure. Surprisingly, little is known about the stability and rigidity of circle packings. In this paper, we study the rigidity of circle packings representing a given planar graph. The radii of circles are flexible with equality and inequality constraints. We provide a dual condition for the packing to be rigid in the first order. This gives us a sufficient condition to show a packing is rigid. Then we will explore the difficulties on rigidity problems beyond the first order.</description>

      <title>On topological obstructions to the existence of non-periodic Wannier bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, M. Ludewig and G. C. Thiang introduced a notion of a uniformly localized Wannier basis with localization centers in an arbitrary uniformly discrete subset $D$ in a complete Riemannian manifold $X$. They show that, under certain geometric conditions on $X$, the class of the orthogonal projection onto the span of such a Wannier basis in the $K$-theory of the Roe algebra $C^*(X)$ is trivial. In this paper, we clarify the geometric conditions on $X$, which guarantee triviality of the $K$-theory class of any Wannier projection. We show that this property is equivalent to triviality of the unit of the uniform Roe algebra of $D$ in the $K$-theory of its Roe algebra, and provide a geometric criterion for that. As a consequence, we prove triviality of the $K$-theory class of any Wannier projection on a connected proper measure space $X$ of bounded geometry with a uniformly discrete set of localization centers.</description>

      <title>Affine Isoperimetric Inequalities for Higher-Order Projection and Centroid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07859v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1970, Schneider introduced the $m$th order difference body of a convex body, and also established the $m$th-order Rogers-Shephard inequality. In this paper, we extend this idea to the projection body, centroid body, and radial mean bodies, as well as prove the associated inequalities (analogues of Zhang's projection inequality, Petty's projection inequality, the Busemann-Petty centroid inequality and Busemann's random simplex inequality). We also establish a new proof of Schneider's $m$th-order Rogers-Shephard inequality. As an application, a $m$th-order affine Sobolev inequality for functions of bounded variation is provided.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we show that there exists a step-two Carnot group on which the new lower bound of the curvature exponent given in arXiv:2308.15811v2 can be strictly less than the curvature exponent by studying the convergence of the structure constants of Lie algebra.</description>
