      <title>Multi-Task Dynamic Pricing in Credit Market with Contextual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamic pricing problem faced by a broker that buys and sells a large number of financial securities in the credit market, such as corporate bonds, government bonds, loans, and other credit-related securities. One challenge in pricing these securities is their infrequent trading, which leads to insufficient data for individual pricing. However, many of these securities share structural features that can be utilized. Building on this, we propose a multi-task dynamic pricing framework that leverages these shared structures across securities, enhancing pricing accuracy through learning.
  In our framework, a security is fully characterized by a $d$ dimensional contextual/feature vector. The customer will buy (sell) the security from the broker if the broker quotes a price lower (higher) than that of the competitors. We assume a linear contextual model for the competitor's pricing, with unknown parameters a prior. The parameters for pricing different securities may or may not be similar to each other. The firm's objective is to minimize the expected regret, namely, the expected revenue loss against a clairvoyant policy which has the knowledge of the parameters of the competitor's pricing model. We show that the regret of our policy is better than both a policy that treats each security individually and a policy that treats all securities as the same. Moreover, the regret is bounded by $\tilde{O} ( \delta_{\max} \sqrt{T M d} + M d ) $, where $M$ is the number of securities and $\delta_{\max}$ characterizes the overall dissimilarity across securities in the basket.</description>

      <title>Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing Revisited: Did we Find a Fatal Flaw?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.05671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The option pricing formula of Black and Scholes (1973) hinges on the continuous-time self-financing condition, which is a special case of the continuous-time budget equation of Merton (1971). The self-financing condition is believed to formalize the economic concept of portfolio rebalancing without inflows or outflows of external funds, but was never formally derived in continuous time. Moreover, and even more problematically, we discover a timing mistake in the model of Merton (1971) and show that his self-financing condition is misspecified both in discrete and continuous time. Our results invalidate seminal contributions to the literature, including the budget equation of Merton (1971), the option pricing formula of Black and Scholes (1973), the continuous trading model of Harrison and Pliska (1981), and the binomial option pricing model of Cox, Ross and Rubinstein (1979). We also show that Black and Scholes (1973) and alternative derivations of their formula implicitly assumed the replication result.</description>
