      <title>Fast convolution algorithm for state space models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fast, robust algorithm for applying a matrix transfer function of a linear time invariant system (LTI) in time domain. Computing $L$ states of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) LTI appears to require $L$ matrix-vector multiplications. We demonstrate that, for any finite user-selected accuracy, the number of matrix-vector multiplications can be reduced to $\mathcal{O}\left(\log_{2}L\right)$ (within an $\mathcal{O}\left(L\right)$ algorithm). The algorithm uses an approximation of the rational transfer function in the z-domain by a matrix polynomial of degree $2^{N+1}-1$, where $N$ is chosen to achieve any user-selected accuracy. Importantly, using a cascade implementation in time domain, applying the transfer function requires only $N+1$ matrix-vector multiplications. We note that LTI systems are used in state space models (SSMs) for modeling long range dependencies where $L$ is large. In applications where the state matrix of LTI system is approximated by a structured matrix, the computational cost is further reduced. We briefly describe several structured approximations of matrices that can be used for such purpose.</description>

      <title>A robust time-split linearized explicit/implicit technique for solving a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model: an application to floods in Cameroon far north region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a time-split linearized explicit/implicit approach for solving a two-dimensional hydrodynamic flow model with appropriate initial and boundary conditions. The time-split technique is employed to upwind the convection term and to treat the friction slope so that the numerical oscillations and stability are well controlled. A suitable time step restriction for stability and convergence accurate of the new algorithm is established using the $L^{\infty}(0,T; L^{2})$-norm. Under a time step requirement, some numerical examples confirm the theoretical studies and suggest that the proposed computational technique is spatial fourth-order accurate and temporal second-order convergent. An application to floods observed in the far north region of Cameroon is considered and discussed.</description>

      <title>Posterior sampling with Adaptive Gaussian Processes in Bayesian parameter identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Posterior sampling by Monte Carlo methods provides a more comprehensive solution approach to inverse problems than computing point estimates such as the maximum posterior using optimization methods, at the expense of usually requiring many more evaluations of the forward model. Replacing computationally expensive forward models by fast surrogate models is an attractive option. However, computing the simulated training data for building a sufficiently accurate surrogate model can be computationally expensive in itself, leading to the design of computer experiments problem of finding evaluation points and accuracies such that the highest accuracy is obtained given a fixed computational budget. Here, we consider a fully adaptive greedy approach to this problem. Using Gaussian process regression as surrogate, samples are drawn from the available posterior approximation while designs are incrementally defined by solving a sequence of optimization problems for evaluation accuracy and positions. The selection of training designs is tailored towards representing the posterior to be sampled as good as possible, while the interleaved sampling steps discard old inaccurate samples in favor of new, more accurate ones. Numerical results show a significant reduction of the computational effort compared to just position-adaptive and static designs.</description>

      <title>Simplified Weak Galerkin Methods for Linear Elasticity on Nonconvex Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a weak Galerkin (WG) finite element method for linear elasticity on general polygonal and polyhedral meshes, free from convexity constraints, by leveraging bubble functions as central analytical tools. The proposed method eliminates the need for stabilizers commonly used in traditional WG methods, resulting in a simplified formulation. The method is symmetric, positive definite, and straightforward to implement. Optimal-order error estimates are established for the WG approximations in the discrete $H^1$-norm, assuming sufficient smoothness of the exact solution, and in the standard $L^2$-norm under regularity assumptions for the dual problem. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed stabilizer-free WG method.</description>

      <title>An adaptive two-grid preconditioner for flow in fractured porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a numerical solution of the mixed dimensional discrete fracture model with highly conductive fractures. We construct an unstructured mesh that resolves lower dimensional fractures on the grid level and use the finite element approximation to construct a discrete system with an implicit time approximation. Constructing an efficient preconditioner for the iterative method is challenging due to the high resolution of the process and high-contrast properties of fractured porous media. We propose a two-grid algorithm to construct an efficient solver for mixed-dimensional problems arising in fractured porous media and use it as a preconditioner for the conjugate gradient method. We use a local pointwise smoother on the fine grid and carefully design an adaptive multiscale space for coarse grid approximation based on a generalized eigenvalue problem. The construction of the basis functions is based on the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method, where we solve local spectral problems with adaptive threshold to automatically identify the dominant modes which correspond to the very small eigenvalues. We remark that such spatial features are automatically captured through our local spectral problems, and connect these to fracture information in the global formulation of the problem. Numerical results are given for two fracture distributions with 30 and 160 fractures, demonstrating iterative convergence independent of the contrast of fracture and porous matrix permeability.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Lagrangian Adaptive-Rank (SLAR) Method for Linear Advection and Nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order semi-Lagrangian methods for kinetic equations have been under rapid development in the past few decades. In this work, we propose a semi-Lagrangian adaptive rank (SLAR) integrator in the finite difference framework for linear advection and nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson systems without dimensional splitting. The proposed method leverages the semi-Lagrangian approach to allow for significantly larger time steps while also exploiting the low-rank structure of the solution. This is achieved through cross approximation of matrices, also referred to as CUR or pseudo-skeleton approximation, where representative columns and rows are selected using specific strategies. To maintain numerical stability and ensure local mass conservation, we apply singular value truncation and a mass-conservative projection following the cross approximation of the updated solution. The computational complexity of our method scales linearly with the mesh size $N$ per dimension, compared to the $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ complexity of traditional full-rank methods per time step. The algorithm is extended to handle nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson systems using a Runge-Kutta exponential integrator. Moreover, we evolve the macroscopic conservation laws for charge densities implicitly, enabling the use of large time steps that align with the semi-Lagrangian solver. We also perform a mass-conservative correction to ensure that the adaptive rank solution preserves macroscopic charge density conservation. To validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, we conduct a series of benchmark tests on both linear advection and nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson systems. The propose algorithm will have the potential in overcoming the curse of dimensionality for beyond 2D high dimensional problems, which is the subject of our future work.</description>

      <title>Linearly scalable fast direct solver based on proxy surface method for two-dimensional elastic wave scattering by cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an $O(N)$ fast direct solver for two-dimensional elastic wave scattering problems. The proxy surface method is extended to elastodynamics to obtain shared coefficients for low-rank approximations from discretized integral operators. The proposed method is a variant of the Martinsson-Rokhlin-type fast direct solver. Our variant avoids the explicit computation of the inverse of the coefficient matrix, thereby reducing the required number of matrix-matrix multiplications. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed solver has a complexity of $O(N)$ in the low-frequency range and has a highly parallel computation efficiency with a strong scaling efficiency of 70\%. Furthermore, multiple right-hand sides can be solved efficiently; specifically, when solving problems with 180 right-hand side vectors, the processing time per vector from the second vector onward was approximately 28,900 times faster than that for the first vector. This is a key advantage of fast direct methods.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Parameter Prediction in Cardiovascular Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patient-specific modeling of cardiovascular flows with high-fidelity is challenging due to its dependence on accurately estimated velocity boundary profiles, which are essential for precise simulations and directly influence wall shear stress calculations - key in predicting cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis. This data, often derived from in vivo modalities like 4D flow MRI, suffers from low resolution and noise. To address this, we employ a stochastic data assimilation technique that integrates computational fluid dynamics with an advanced Ensemble-based Kalman filter, enhancing model accuracy while accounting for uncertainties. Our approach sequentially collects velocity data over time within the vascular model, enabling real-time refinement of unknown boundary estimations. The mathematical model uses the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation to simulate aortic blood flow. We consider unknown boundaries as constant, time-dependent, and space-time dependent in two- and three-dimensional models. In our 2-dimensional model, relative errors were as low as 0.996\% for constant boundaries and up to 2.63\% and 2.61\% for time-dependent and space-time dependent boundaries, respectively, over an observation span of two-time steps. For the 3-dimensional patient-specific model, the relative error was 7.37\% for space-time dependent boundaries. By refining the velocity boundary profile, our method improves wall shear stress predictions, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of models specific to individual cardiovascular patients. These advancements could contribute to better diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.</description>

      <title>Nonnegative Tensor Decomposition Via Collaborative Neurodynamic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel collaborative neurodynamic model for computing nonnegative Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). The model relies on a system of recurrent neural networks to solve the underlying nonconvex optimization problem associated with nonnegative CPD. Additionally, a discrete-time version of the continuous neural network is developed. To enhance the chances of reaching a potential global minimum, the recurrent neural networks are allowed to communicate and exchange information through particle swarm optimization (PSO). Convergence and stability analyses of both the continuous and discrete neurodynamic models are thoroughly examined. Experimental evaluations are conducted on random and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Constructive Approximation of High-Dimensional Functions with Small Efficient Dimension with Applications in Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the approximation of high-dimensional functions, which are effectively low-dimensional, does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. This is shown first in a general reproducing kernel Hilbert space set-up and then specifically for Sobolev and mixed-regularity Sobolev spaces. Finally, efficient estimates are derived for deciding whether a high-dimensional function is effectively low-dimensional by studying error bounds in weighted reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The results are applied to parametric partial differential equations, a typical problem from uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of multilinear algebra for reducing the order of multidimensional linear time-invariant (MLTI) systems. Our main tools are tensor rational Krylov subspace methods, which enable us to approximate the systems solution within a low-dimensional subspace. We introduce the tensor rational block Arnoldi and tensor rational block Lanczos algorithms. By utilizing these methods, we develop a model reduction approach based on projection techniques. Additionally, we demonstrate how these approaches can be applied to large-scale Lyapunov tensor equations, which are critical for the balanced truncation method, a well-known technique for order reduction. An adaptive method for choosing the interpolation points is also introduced. Finally, some numerical experiments are reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive approaches.</description>

      <title>Validated matrix multiplication transform for orthogonal polynomials with applications to computer-assisted proofs for PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we achieve three primary objectives related to the rigorous computational analysis of nonlinear PDEs posed on complex geometries such as disks and cylinders. First, we introduce a validated Matrix Multiplication Transform (MMT) algorithm, analogous to the discrete Fourier transform, which offers a reliable framework for evaluating nonlinearities in spectral methods while effectively mitigating challenges associated with rounding errors. Second, we examine the Zernike polynomials, a spectral basis well-suited for problems on the disk, and highlight their essential properties. We further demonstrate how the MMT approach can be effectively employed to compute the product of truncated Zernike series, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we combine the MMT framework and Zernike series to construct computer-assisted proofs that establish the existence of solutions to two distinct nonlinear elliptic PDEs on the disk.</description>

      <title>Compact finite-difference scheme for some Sobolev type equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to construct a stable, high-order compact finite difference method for solving Sobolev-type equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions in one-space dimension. Approximation of higher-order mixed derivatives in some specific Sobolev-type equations requires a bigger stencil information. One can approximate such derivatives on compact stencils, which are higher-order accurate and take less stencil information but are implicit and sparse. Spatial derivatives in this work are approximated using the sixth-order compact finite difference method (Compact6), while temporal derivatives are handled with the explicit forward Euler difference scheme. We examine the accuracy and convergence behavior of the proposed scheme. Using the von Neumann stability analysis, we establish $L_2-$stability theory for the linear case. We derive conditions under which fully discrete schemes are stable. Also, the amplification factor $\mathcal{C}(\theta)$ is analyzed to ensure the decay property over time. Real parts of $\mathcal{C}(\theta)$ lying on the negative real axis confirm the exponential decay of the solution. A series of numerical experiments were performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. These tests include advection-free flow, and applications to the equal width equation, such as single solitary wave propagation, interactions of two and three solitary waves, undular bore formation, and the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-Burgers equation.</description>

      <title>Exponential speed up in Monte Carlo sampling through Radial Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very recently it has been shown that the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is guaranteed to converge exponentially to a given target probability distribution $p(x)\propto e^{-V(x)}$ on non-compact spaces if augmented by an appropriate radial update. In this work we present a simple way to derive efficient radial updates meeting the necessary requirements for any potential $V$. We reduce the task to finding a substitution of the radial direction $||x||=f(z)$ so that the effective potential $V(f(z))$ grows exponentially with $z\rightarrow\pm\infty$. Any additive update of $z$ then leads to the desired convergence. We show that choosing this update from a normal distribution with standard deviation $\sigma\approx 1/\sqrt{d}$ in $d$ dimensions yields very good results. We further generalise the previous results on radial updates to a wide class of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms beyond the HMC and we quantify the convergence behaviour of MCMC algorithms with badly chosen radial update. Finally, we apply the radial update to the sampling of heavy-tailed distributions and achieve a speed up of many orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>What do physics-informed DeepONets learn? Understanding and improving training for scientific computing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed deep operator networks (DeepONets) have emerged as a promising approach toward numerically approximating the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we aim to develop further understanding of what is being learned by physics-informed DeepONets by assessing the universality of the extracted basis functions and demonstrating their potential toward model reduction with spectral methods. Results provide clarity about measuring the performance of a physics-informed DeepONet through the decays of singular values and expansion coefficients. In addition, we propose a transfer learning approach for improving training for physics-informed DeepONets between parameters of the same PDE as well as across different, but related, PDEs where these models struggle to train well. This approach results in significant error reduction and learned basis functions that are more effective in representing the solution of a PDE.</description>

      <title>A neural network approach to learning solutions of a class of elliptic variational inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a weak adversarial approach to solving obstacle problems using neural networks. By employing (generalised) regularised gap functions and their properties we rewrite the obstacle problem (which is an elliptic variational inequality) as a minmax problem, providing a natural formulation amenable to learning. Our approach, in contrast to much of the literature, does not require the elliptic operator to be symmetric. We provide an error analysis for suitable discretisations of the continuous problem, estimating in particular the approximation and statistical errors. Parametrising the solution and test function as neural networks, we apply a modified gradient descent ascent algorithm to treat the problem and conclude the paper with various examples and experiments. Our solution algorithm is in particular able to easily handle obstacle problems that feature biactivity (or lack of strict complementarity), a situation that poses difficulty for traditional numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fast Krasnosel'ki\u{\i}-Mann Method with Preconditioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study accelerated Krasnosel'ki\u{\i}-Mann-type methods with preconditioners in both continuous and discrete time. From a continuous time model, we derive a generalized fast Krasnosel'ki\u{\i}-Mann method, providing a new yet simple proof of convergence that allows for unprecedented flexibility in parameter tuning. Our analysis unifies inertial and anchoring acceleration mechanisms and offers a broad range of parameter choices, which prove beneficial in practice. Additionally, we extend our analysis to the case where preconditioners are allowed to be degenerate, unifying the treatment of various splitting methods and establishing the weak convergence of shadow sequences.</description>

      <title>Hard thresholding hyperinterpolation over general regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14634v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel variant of hyperinterpolation, called hard thresholding hyperinterpolation. This approximation scheme of degree $n$ leverages a hard thresholding operator to filter all hyperinterpolation coefficients, which approximate the Fourier coefficients of a continuous function by a quadrature rule with algebraic exactness $2n$. We prove that hard thresholding hyperinterpolation is the unique solution to an $\ell_0$-regularized weighted discrete least squares approximation problem. Hard thresholding hyperinterpolation is not only idempotent and commutative with hyperinterpolation, but also adheres to the Pythagorean theorem in terms of the discrete (semi) inner product. By the estimate of the reciprocal of Christoffel function, we present the upper bound of the uniform norm of hard thresholding hyperinterpolation operator. Additionally, hard thresholding hyperinterpolation possesses denoising and basis selection abilities akin to Lasso hyperinterpolation. To judge the $L_2$ errors of both hard thresholding and Lasso hyperinterpolations, we propose a criterion that integrates the regularization parameter with the product of noise coefficients and the signs of hyperinterpolation coefficients. Numerical examples on the sphere, spherical triangle and the cube demonstrate the denoising ability of hard thresholding hyperinterpolation.</description>

      <title>Radial perfectly matched layers and infinite elements for the anisotropic wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the scalar anisotropic wave equation. Recently a convergence analysis for radial perfectly matched layers (PML) in the frequency domain was reported and in the present article we continue this approach into the time domain. First we explain why there is a good hope that radial complex scalings can overcome the instabilities of PML methods caused by anisotropic materials. Next we discuss some sensitive details, which seem like a paradox at the first glance: If the absorbing layer and the inhomogeneities are sufficiently separated, then the solution is indeed stable. However, for more general data the problem becomes unstable. In numerical computations we observe instabilities regardless of the position of the inhomogeneities, although the instabilities arise only for fine enough discretizations. As a remedy we propose a complex frequency shifted scaling and discretizations by Hardy space infinite elements or truncation-free PMLs. We show numerical experiments which confirm the stability and convergence of these methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient numerical methods for the Maxey-Riley-Gatignol equations with Basset history term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Maxey-Riley-Gatignol equations (MRGE) describe the motion of a finite-sized, spherical particle in a fluid. Because of wake effects, the force acting on a particle depends on its past trajectory. This is modelled by an integral term in the MRGE, also called Basset force, that makes its numerical solution challenging and memory intensive. A recent approach proposed by Prasath et al. exploits connections between the integral term and fractional derivatives to reformulate the MRGE as a time-dependent partial differential equation on a semi-infinite pseudo-space. They also propose a numerical algorithm based on polynomial expansions. This paper develops a numerical approach based on finite difference instead, by adopting techniques by Koleva et al. and Fazio et al. to cope with the issues of having an unbounded spatial domain. We compare convergence order and computational efficiency for particles of varying size and density of the polynomial expansion by Prasath et al., our finite difference schemes and a direct integrator for the MRGE based on multi-step methods proposed by Daitche. While all methods achieve their theoretical convergence order for neutrally buoyant particles with zero initial relative velocity, they suffer from various degrees of order reduction if the initial relative velocity is non-zero or the particle has a different density than the fluid.</description>

      <title>Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks for transport models in porous materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are a machine learning tool that can be used to solve direct and inverse problems related to models described by Partial Differential Equations. This paper proposes an adaptive inverse PINN applied to different transport models, from diffusion to advection-diffusion-reaction problems. Once a suitable PINN is established to solve the forward problem, the transport parameters are added as trainable parameters. We find that, for the inverse problem to converge to the correct solution, the different components of the loss function (data misfit, initial conditions, boundary conditions and residual of the transport equation) need to be weighted adaptively as a function of the training iteration (epoch). Similarly, gradients of trainable parameters are scaled at each epoch accordingly. Several examples are presented for different test cases to support our PINN architecture and its scalability and robustness.</description>

      <title>asQ: parallel-in-time finite element simulations using ParaDiag for geoscientific models and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern high performance computers are massively parallel; for many PDE applications spatial parallelism saturates long before the computer's capability is reached. Parallel-in-time methods enable further speedup beyond spatial saturation by solving multiple timesteps simultaneously to expose additional parallelism. ParaDiag is a particular approach to parallel-in-time based on preconditioning the simultaneous timestep system with a perturbation that allows block diagonalisation via a Fourier transform in time. In this article, we introduce asQ, a new library for implementing ParaDiag parallel-in-time methods, with a focus on applications in the geosciences, especially weather and climate. asQ is built on Firedrake, a library for the automated solution of finite element models, and the PETSc library of scalable linear and nonlinear solvers. This enables asQ to build ParaDiag solvers for general finite element models and provide a range of solution strategies, making testing a wide array of problems straightforward. We use a quasi-Newton formulation that encompasses a range of ParaDiag methods, and expose building blocks for constructing more complex methods. The performance and flexibility of asQ is demonstrated on a hierarchy of linear and nonlinear atmospheric flow models. We show that ParaDiag can offer promising speedups and that asQ is a productive testbed for further developing these methods.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of regulatory network dynamics: equilibria and saddle-node bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.13739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we describe a combined combinatorial/numerical approach to studying equilibria and bifurcations in network models arising in Systems Biology. ODE models of the dynamics suffer from high dimensional parameters which presents a significant obstruction to studying the global dynamics via numerical methods. The main point of this paper is to demonstrate that adapting and combining classical techniques with recently developed combinatorial methods provides a richer picture of the global dynamics despite the high parameter dimension.
  Given a network topology describing state variables which regulate one another via monotone and bounded functions, we first use the {\em Dynamic Signatures Generated by Regulatory Networks} (DSGRN) software to obtain a combinatorial summary of the dynamics. This summary is coarse but global and we use this information as a first pass to identify ``interesting'' subsets of parameters in which to focus. We construct an associated ODE model with high parameter dimension using our {\em Network Dynamics Modeling and Analysis} (NDMA) Python library. We introduce algorithms for efficiently investigating the dynamics in these ODE models restricted to these parameter subsets. Finally, we perform a statistical validation of the method and several interesting dynamical applications including finding saddle-node bifurcations in a $54$ parameter model.</description>

      <title>Discrete approximations to Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians on a half-space and norm resolvent convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend recent results on discrete approximations of the Laplacian in $\mathbf{R}^d$ with norm resolvent convergence to the corresponding results for Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians on a half-space. The resolvents of the discrete Dirichlet/Neumann Laplacians are embedded into the continuum using natural discretization and embedding operators. Norm resolvent convergence to their continuous counterparts is proven with a quadratic rate in the mesh size. These results generalize with a limited rate to also include operators with a real, bounded, and H\"older continuous potential, as well as certain functions of the Dirichlet/Neumann Laplacians, including any positive real power.

      <title>Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks for Data Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10270v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new scattering networks for signals measured on simplicial complexes, which we call \emph{Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks} (MHSNs). Our construction is based on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial complexes, i.e., the $\kappa$-GHWT and $\kappa$-HGLET, which we recently developed for simplices of dimension $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ in a given simplicial complex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar-Walsh Transform (GHWT) and Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). The $\kappa$-GHWT and the $\kappa$-HGLET both form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs use a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to cascade the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation that is akin to local pooling in CNNs, and which may be performed either locally or per-scale. These pooling operations are harder to define in both traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets, and geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, we are able to extract a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be used along with very simple machine learning methods (i.e., logistic regression or support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification systems with far fewer parameters to train than most modern graph neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our MHSNs in three distinct types of problems: signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction.</description>

      <title>Strong Error Bounds for Trotter &amp; Strang-Splittings and Their Implications for Quantum Chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient error estimates for the Trotter product formula are central in quantum computing, mathematical physics, and numerical simulations. However, the Trotter error's dependency on the input state and its application to unbounded operators remains unclear. Here, we present a general theory for error estimation, including higher-order product formulas, with explicit input state dependency. Our approach overcomes two limitations of the existing operator-norm estimates in the literature. First, previous bounds are too pessimistic as they quantify the worst-case scenario. Second, previous bounds become trivial for unbounded operators and cannot be applied to a wide class of Trotter scenarios, including atomic and molecular Hamiltonians. Our method enables analytical treatment of Trotter errors in chemistry simulations, illustrated through a case study on the hydrogen atom. Our findings reveal: (i) for states with fat-tailed energy distribution, such as low-angular-momentum states of the hydrogen atom, the Trotter error scales worse than expected (sublinearly) in the number of Trotter steps; (ii) certain states do not admit an advantage in the scaling from higher-order Trotterization, and thus, the higher-order Trotter hierarchy breaks down for these states, including the hydrogen atom's ground state; (iii) the scaling of higher-order Trotter bounds might depend on the order of the Hamiltonians in the Trotter product for states with fat-tailed energy distribution. Physically, the enlarged Trotter error is caused by the atom's ionization due to the Trotter dynamics. Mathematically, we find that certain domain conditions are not satisfied by some states so higher moments of the potential and kinetic energies diverge. Our analytical error analysis agrees with numerical simulations, indicating that we can estimate the state-dependent Trotter error scaling genuinely.</description>

      <title>Latent Neural Operator for Solving Forward and Inverse PDE Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03923v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators effectively solve PDE problems from data without knowing the explicit equations, which learn the map from the input sequences of observed samples to the predicted values. Most existing works build the model in the original geometric space, leading to high computational costs when the number of sample points is large. We present the Latent Neural Operator (LNO) solving PDEs in the latent space. In particular, we first propose Physics-Cross-Attention (PhCA) transforming representation from the geometric space to the latent space, then learn the operator in the latent space, and finally recover the real-world geometric space via the inverse PhCA map. Our model retains flexibility that can decode values in any position not limited to locations defined in the training set, and therefore can naturally perform interpolation and extrapolation tasks particularly useful for inverse problems. Moreover, the proposed LNO improves both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments show that LNO reduces the GPU memory by 50%, speeds up training 1.8 times, and reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on four out of six benchmarks for forward problems and a benchmark for inverse problem. Code is available at https://github.com/L-I-M-I-T/LatentNeuralOperator.</description>

Abstract: Pretraining methods gain increasing attraction recently for solving PDEs with neural operators. It alleviates the data scarcity problem encountered by neural operator learning when solving single PDE via training on large-scale datasets consisting of various PDEs and utilizing shared patterns among different PDEs to improve the solution precision. In this work, we propose the Latent Neural Operator Pretraining (LNOP) framework based on the Latent Neural Operator (LNO) backbone. We achieve universal transformation through pretraining on hybrid time-dependent PDE dataset to extract representations of different physical systems and solve various time-dependent PDEs in the latent space through finetuning on single PDE dataset. Our proposed LNOP framework reduces the solution error by 31.7% on four problems and can be further improved to 57.1% after finetuning. On out-of-distribution dataset, our LNOP model achieves roughly 50% lower error and 3$\times$ data efficiency on average across different dataset sizes. These results show that our method is more competitive in terms of solution precision, transfer capability and data efficiency compared to non-pretrained neural operators.</description>

Abstract: We study algorithms for approximating the spectral density of a symmetric matrix $A$ that is accessed through matrix-vector product queries. By combining a previously studied Chebyshev polynomial moment matching method with a deflation step that approximately projects off the largest magnitude eigendirections of $A$ before estimating the spectral density, we give an $\epsilon\cdot\sigma_\ell(A)$ error approximation to the spectral density in the Wasserstein-$1$ metric using $O(\ell\log n+ 1/\epsilon)$ matrix-vector products, where $\sigma_\ell(A)$ is the $\ell^{th}$ largest singular value of $A$. In the common case when $A$ exhibits fast singular value decay, our bound can be much stronger than prior work, which gives an error bound of $\epsilon \cdot ||A||_2$ using $O(1/\epsilon)$ matrix-vector products. We also show that it is nearly tight: any algorithm giving error $\epsilon \cdot \sigma_\ell(A)$ must use $\Omega(\ell+1/\epsilon)$ matrix-vector products.
  We further show that the popular Stochastic Lanczos Quadrature (SLQ) method matches the above bound, even though SLQ itself is parameter-free and performs no explicit deflation. This bound explains the strong practical performance of SLQ, and motivates a simple variant of SLQ that achieves an even tighter error bound. Our error bound for SLQ leverages an analysis that views it as an implicit polynomial moment matching method, along with recent results on low-rank approximation with single-vector Krylov methods. We use these results to show that the method can perform implicit deflation as part of moment matching.</description>
