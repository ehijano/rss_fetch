      <title>Breaching the light barrier without paradoxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the regularization principle that resolves the temporal paradoxes associated with faster-than-light particles or tachyons at the macroscopic scale. The principle involves using the properties of the {\zeta}-function to regularize the unphysical momenta of tachyons that moves backwards in-time as an infinite sum of physical tachyon momenta that travel forwards in-time. Since, the tachyon moves forward in-time in all interial frames, this ensures that the tachyon processes are paradox-free without invoking the Reinterpretation Principle (RIP). Apart from resolving these paradoxes associated with faster-than-light particles, its other notable consequences especially pertaining to the censorship of naked singularities and faster-than-light communication are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Nonzero RMS Magnetoresistance Yielding Control Space Partition of CrTe2 Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of magnetic phenomena in low-dimensional systems has largely explored after the discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials, such as CrI3 and Cr2Ge2Te6 in 2017. These materials presents intrinsic magnetic order, overcoming the limitations predicted by the Mermin-Wagner theorem, due to magnetic crystalline anisotropy energy. Among these, CrTe2, a van der Waals 2D magnet, has gather significant interest due to its in-plane anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) and high Curie temperature. This study investigates the magnetic field-regulated resistance of CrTe2 monolayers in the context of spintronics applications. Utilizing the zigzag-ordered parameters obtained from prior simulations, we examine how external magnetic fields influence resistance states and control the ON/OFF state of nano-devices. The analysis demonstrates that specific magnetic field configurations, particularly those in the form of (0, 0, Bz), which is out-of-plane directed field, gives a non-zero root mean square resistance, indicating a functional ON state. This provides a novel method for magnetically controlled current regulation in spintronic devices. The experimental results also reveal an interesting spin-flop transition in CrTe2 under a z-directed magnetic field, leading to y-directional magnetization. This phenomenon, combined with the material's robust magnetic properties, positions CrTe2 as a promising candidate for next-generation memory and logic devices. By advancing the understanding of magnetic field manipulation in 2D magnetic materials, this research opens new pathways in the development of energy-efficient spintronics technology.</description>

      <title>Quaternion Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the Dirac equation when the spin symmetry is changed from SU(2) to the quaternion group, $Q_8$, achieved by multiplying one of the gamma matrices by the imaginary number, $i$. The reason for doing this is to introduce a bivector into the spin algebra, which complexifies the Dirac field. It then separates into two distinct and complementary spaces: one describing polarization and the other coherence. The former describes a 2D structured spin, and the latter its helicity, generated by a unit quaternion.</description>

      <title>Einstein, tea leaves, meandering rivers, and the origin of supermassive black holes in ekpyrotic universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central supermassive black holes are found in most massive galaxies. However, their origin is still poorly understood. Observations of quasars show that many supermassive black holes existed less than 700 million years after the Big Bang. To explain the existence of such black holes with masses comparable to the stellar mass of the host galaxy, just ~500 million years after the Big Bang, it is probably necessary to assume that they originated from heavy seeds. In an ekpyrotic universe, a hot Big Bang occurs as a result of the collision of two branes. Quantum fluctuations create ripples on the brane surfaces, leading to spatial variations in the timing of collisions, thereby creating density perturbations that can facilitate the formation of massive black hole seeds. I hypothesize that perhaps Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard-Marangoni type convection in the extra dimension is a more efficient source of macroscopic density perturbations than quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Exploring light propagation in nonlinear electrodynamics: phase and group velocities and related phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear electrodynamics has been an important area of research for a long time. Investigations based on nonlinear Lagrangians, such as Euler-Heisenberg and Born-Infeld, are instrumental in exploring the limits of classical and quantum field theories, providing valuable insights into strong-field phenomena. In this context, this work considers how light propagates in strong-field environments, where such nonlinearities play significant roles, offering a way to investigate events in high-energy astrophysics, quantum optics, and fundamental physics beyond classical Maxwell's framework. Here, several aspects of light propagation in nonlinear electrodynamics are discussed. Phase and group velocities are derived and several interesting behaviors are unveiled, such as birefringence, non-reciprocal propagation, and asymmetries between phase and group velocities in special configurations. Specific solutions based on commonly studied nonlinear theories are also investigated, and phenomena like slow-light and one-way propagation are discussed.</description>
