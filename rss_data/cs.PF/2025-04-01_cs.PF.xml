      <title>Are We There Yet? A Measurement Study of Efficiency for LLM Applications on Mobile Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have prompted interest in deploying these models on mobile devices to enable new applications without relying on cloud connectivity. However, the efficiency constraints of deploying LLMs on resource-limited devices present significant challenges. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive measurement study to evaluate the efficiency tradeoffs between mobile-based, edge-based, and cloud-based deployments for LLM applications. We implement AutoLife-Lite, a simplified LLM-based application that analyzes smartphone sensor data to infer user location and activity contexts. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Only small-size LLMs (&lt;4B parameters) can run successfully on powerful mobile devices, though they exhibit quality limitations compared to larger models; (2) Model compression is effective in lower the hardware requirement, but may lead to significant performance degradation; (3) The latency to run LLMs on mobile devices with meaningful output is significant (&gt;30 seconds), while cloud services demonstrate better time efficiency (&lt;10 seconds); (4) Edge deployments offer intermediate tradeoffs between latency and model capabilities, with different results on CPU-based and GPU-based settings. These findings provide valuable insights for system designers on the current limitations and future directions for on-device LLM applications.</description>

      <title>HistogramTools for Efficient Data Analysis and Distribution Representation in Large Data Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Histograms provide a powerful means of summarizing large data sets by representing their distribution in a compact, binned form. The HistogramTools R package enhances R built-in histogram functionality, offering advanced methods for manipulating and analyzing histograms, especially in large-scale data environments. Key features include the ability to serialize histograms using Protocol Buffers for distributed computing tasks, tools for merging and modifying histograms, and techniques for measuring and visualizing information loss in histogram representations. The package is particularly suited for environments utilizing MapReduce, where efficient storage and data sharing are critical. This paper presents various methods of histogram bin manipulation, distance measures, quantile approximation, and error estimation in cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) derived from histograms. Visualization techniques and efficient storage representations are also discussed alongside applications for large data processing and distributed computing tasks.</description>

      <title>Carbon and Reliability-Aware Computing for Heterogeneous Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of data centers (DCs) has intensified energy and carbon footprint, incurring a massive environmental computing cost. While carbon-aware workload migration strategies have been examined, existing approaches often overlook reliability metrics such as server lifetime degradation, and quality-of-service (QoS) that substantially affects both carbon and operational efficiency of DCs. Hence, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization framework for spatio-temporal workload migration across distributed DCs that jointly minimizes operational and embodied carbon emissions while complying with service-level agreements (SLA). A key contribution is the development of an embodied carbon emission model based on servers' expected lifetime analysis, which explicitly considers server heterogeneity resulting from aging and utilization conditions. These issues are accommodated using new server dispatch strategies, and backup resource allocation model, accounting hardware, software and workload-induced failure. The overall model is formulated as a mixed-integer optimization problem with multiple linearization techniques to ensure computational tractability. Numerical case studies demonstrate that the proposed method reduces total carbon emissions by up to 21%, offering a pragmatic approach to sustainable DC operations.</description>
