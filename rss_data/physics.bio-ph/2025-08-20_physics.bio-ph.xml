      <title>Perspective: An outlook on fluorescence tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking single fluorescent molecules has offered resolution into dynamic molecular processes at the single-molecule level. This perspective traces the evolution of single-molecule tracking, highlighting key developments across various methodological branches within fluorescence microscopy. We compare the strengths and limitations of each approach, ranging from conventional widefield offline tracking to real-time confocal tracking. In the final section, we explore emerging efforts to advance physics-inspired tracking techniques, a possibility for parallelization and artificial intelligence, and discuss challenges and opportunities they present toward achieving higher spatiotemporal resolution and greater computational and data efficiency in next-generation single-molecule studies.</description>

      <title>Quantum biosensing on a multiplexed functionalized diamond microarray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond promises to revolutionize biological research and medical diagnostics. Thanks to their high sensitivity, NV sensors could, in principle, detect specific binding events with metabolites and proteins in a massively parallel and label-free way, avoiding the complexity of mass spectrometry. Realizing this vision has been hindered by the lack of quantum sensor arrays that unite high-density spatial multiplexing with uncompromising biochemical specificity. Here, we introduce a scalable quantum biosensing platform that overcomes these barriers by integrating the first multiplexed DNA microarray directly onto a subnanometer antifouling diamond surface. The 7x7 DNA array, patterned onto a diamond chip, enables simultaneous detection of 49 distinct biomolecular features with high spatial resolution and reproducibility, as verified by fluorescence microscopy. Molecular recognition is converted into a quantum signal via a target-induced displacement mechanism in which hybridization removes a Gd$^{3+}$-tagged DNA strand, restoring NV center spin relaxation times (T$_1$) and producing a binary quantum readout. This platform establishes a new paradigm for high-throughput, multiplexed quantum biosensing and opens the door to advanced molecular diagnostics and large-scale quantum sensor networks operable in complex biological environments.</description>

      <title>Stochastic synaptic dynamics under learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning is based on synaptic plasticity, which drives and is driven by neural activity. Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by randomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a probabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a paradigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population impinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of integrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We first analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single synapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump process to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging new analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations seen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this microdynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations are trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses connecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By mapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the single-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural and synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation and the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case of sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which are strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are ignored. We conclude with a discussion of the many directions in which our framework can be extended.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical response of biological membranes to localized currents and external electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrochemical phenomena in biology often unfold in confined geometries where micrometer- to millimeter-scale domains coexist with nanometer-scale interfacial diffuse charge layers. We analyze a model lipid membrane-electrolyte system where an ion channel-like current flows across the membrane while parallel electrodes simultaneously apply a step voltage, emulating an extrinsic electric field. Matched asymptotic expansions of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations show that, under physiological conditions, the diffuse charge layers rapidly reach a quasi-steady state, and the bulk electrolyte remains electroneutral. As a result, all free charge is confined to the nanometer-scale screening layers at the membrane and electrode interfaces. The bulk electric potential satisfies Laplace's equation, and is dynamically coupled to the interfacial layers through time-dependent boundary conditions. This multiscale coupling partitions the space-time response into distinct regimes. At sufficiently long times, we show that the system can be represented by an equivalent circuit analogous to those used in classical cable theory. We derive closed-form expressions of the transmembrane potential within each regime, and verify them against nonlinear numerical simulations. Our results show how electrode-induced screening and confinement effects influence the electrochemical response over multiple length and time scales in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Potential Global Sequestration of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide by Drylands Forestation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10641v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drylands forestation offers the potential for significant long-term sequestration of atmospheric CO$_2$. Consider sequestration of both organic and inorganic carbon by a planted semi-arid forest, based on carbon that originates from atmospheric CO$_2$. Measurements at Israel's Yatir forest give a sequestration rate of $\sim$550 gram CO$_2$ m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ as organic carbon in the tree's biomass. In addition, $\sim$216 gram CO$_2$ m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ precipitates as calcite (CaCO$_3$) in the soil due to a combination of microbial activity on organic soil carbon, and the reaction of soil water with CO$_2$ exhaled from tree roots. The exhaled CO$_2$ is formed when glucose (produced by photosynthesis) is oxidized to supply energy for the trees' cellular processes. Significantly, low rainfall in drylands precludes dissolving precipitated calcite. Published estimates restrict the potential drylands surface available for sustainable forestation to $\sim$4.5 million km$^2$, only $\sim$10$\%$ of the global drylands. The dominant limitation is the apparent lack of water. However, immediately under many drylands, there are fossil waters that had recharged underlying aquifers during prior wetter climatic regimes. Conservatively, including this water, at least 9.0 million km$^2$ is available for afforestation. Such an area may yield a potential total annual sequestration rate of $\sim$7.0 Gt CO$_2$ yr$^{-1}$, divided between $\sim$5.0 Gt CO$_2$ yr$^{-1}$ (organic) and $\sim$2.0 Gt CO$_2$ yr$^{-1}$ (inorganic); a respectable $\sim$35$\%$ of the annual rate of atmospheric CO$_2$ increase. However, considering the reduction in land surface albedo (reflectivity), the effective cooling would be $\sim$5.0 Gt CO$_2$ yr$^{-1}$. Drylands reforestation would provide additional area for sequestration.</description>
