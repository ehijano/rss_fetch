      <title>Bridging Language Models and Financial Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have unlocked transformative possibilities in natural language processing, particularly within the financial sector. Financial data is often embedded in intricate relationships across textual content, numerical tables, and visual charts, posing challenges that traditional methods struggle to address effectively. However, the emergence of LLMs offers new pathways for processing and analyzing this multifaceted data with increased efficiency and insight. Despite the fast pace of innovation in LLM research, there remains a significant gap in their practical adoption within the finance industry, where cautious integration and long-term validation are prioritized. This disparity has led to a slower implementation of emerging LLM techniques, despite their immense potential in financial applications. As a result, many of the latest advancements in LLM technology remain underexplored or not fully utilized in this domain. This survey seeks to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of recent developments in LLM research and examining their applicability to the financial sector. Building on previous survey literature, we highlight several novel LLM methodologies, exploring their distinctive capabilities and their potential relevance to financial data analysis. By synthesizing insights from a broad range of studies, this paper aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners, offering direction on promising research avenues and outlining future opportunities for advancing LLM applications in finance.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry in Distributions of Accumulated Gains and Losses in Stock Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study decades-long historic distributions of accumulated S\&amp;P500 returns, from daily returns to those over several weeks. The time series of the returns emphasize major upheavals in the markets -- Black Monday, Tech Bubble, Financial Crisis and Covid Pandemic -- which are reflected in the tail ends of the distributions. De-trending the overall gain, we concentrate on comparing distributions of gains and losses. Specifically, we compare the tails of the distributions, which are believed to exhibit power-law behavior and possibly contain outliers. Towards this end we find confidence intervals of the linear fits of the tails of the complementary cumulative distribution functions on a log-log scale, as well as conduct a statistical U-test in order to detect outliers. We also study probability density functions of the full distributions of the returns with the emphasis on their asymmetry. The key empirical observations are that the mean of de-trended distributions increases near-linearly with the number of days of accumulation while the overall skew is negative -- consistent with the heavier tails of losses -- and depends little on the number of days of accumulation. At the same time the variance of the distributions exhibits near-perfect linear dependence on the number of days of accumulation, that is it remains constant if scaled to the latter. Finally, we discuss the theoretical framework for understanding accumulated returns. Our main conclusion is that the current state of theory, which predicts symmetric or near-symmetric distributions of returns cannot explain the aggregate of empirical results.</description>

      <title>A cost of capital approach to determining the LGD discount rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loss Given Default (LGD) is a key risk parameter in determining a bank's regulatory capital. During LGD-estimation, realised recovery cash flows are to be discounted at an appropriate rate. Regulatory guidance mandates that this rate should allow for the time value of money, as well as include a risk premium that reflects the "undiversifiable risk" within these recoveries. Having extensively reviewed earlier methods of determining this rate, we propose a new approach that is inspired by the cost of capital approach from the Solvency II regulatory regime. Our method involves estimating a market-consistent price for a portfolio of defaulted loans, from which an associated discount rate may be inferred. We apply this method to mortgage and personal loans data from a large South African bank. The results reveal the main drivers of the discount rate to be the mean and variance of these recoveries, as well as the bank's cost of capital in excess of the risk-free rate. Our method therefore produces a discount rate that reflects both the undiversifiable risk of recovery recoveries and the time value of money, thereby satisfying regulatory requirements. This work can subsequently enhance the LGD-component within the modelling of both regulatory and economic capital.</description>

      <title>Liquidity Jump, Liquidity Diffusion, and Crypto Wash Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05803v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new framework to detect wash trading in crypto assets through real-time liquidity fluctuation. We propose that short-term price jumps in crypto assets results from wash trading-induced liquidity fluctuation, and construct two complementary liquidity measures, liquidity jump (size of fluctuation) and liquidity diffusion (volatility of fluctuation), to capture the behavioral signature of wash trading. Using US stocks as a benchmark, we demonstrate that joint elevation in both liquidity metrics indicates wash trading in crypto assets. A simulated regulatory treatment that removes likely wash trades confirms this dynamic: it reduces liquidity diffusion significantly while leaving liquidity jump largely unaffected. These findings align with a theoretical model in which manipulative traders amplify both the level and variance of price pressure, whereas passive investors affect only the level. Our model offers practical tools for investors to assess market quality and for regulators to monitor manipulation risk on crypto exchanges without oversight.</description>
