      <title>Thompson Sampling For Combinatorial Bandits: Polynomial Regret and Mismatched Sampling Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Thompson Sampling (TS) for linear combinatorial semi-bandits and subgaussian rewards. We propose the first known TS whose finite-time regret does not scale exponentially with the dimension of the problem. We further show the "mismatched sampling paradox": A learner who knows the rewards distributions and samples from the correct posterior distribution can perform exponentially worse than a learner who does not know the rewards and simply samples from a well-chosen Gaussian posterior. The code used to generate the experiments is available at https://github.com/RaymZhang/CTS-Mismatched-Paradox</description>

      <title>Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning shared structure across environments facilitates rapid learning and adaptive behavior in neural systems. This has been widely demonstrated and applied in machine learning to train models that are capable of generalizing to novel settings. However, there has been limited work exploiting the shared structure in neural activity during similar tasks for learning latent dynamics from neural recordings. Existing approaches are designed to infer dynamics from a single dataset and cannot be readily adapted to account for statistical heterogeneities across recordings. In this work, we hypothesize that similar tasks admit a corresponding family of related solutions and propose a novel approach for meta-learning this solution space from task-related neural activity of trained animals. Specifically, we capture the variabilities across recordings on a low-dimensional manifold which concisely parametrizes this family of dynamics, thereby facilitating rapid learning of latent dynamics given new recordings. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on few-shot reconstruction and forecasting of synthetic dynamical systems, and neural recordings from the motor cortex during different arm reaching tasks.</description>

      <title>The Power of Adaptivity in Experimental Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given n experiment subjects with potentially heterogeneous covariates and two possible treatments, namely active treatment and control, this paper addresses the fundamental question of determining the optimal accuracy in estimating the treatment effect. Furthermore, we propose an experimental design that approaches this optimal accuracy, giving a (non-asymptotic) answer to this fundamental yet still open question. The methodological contribution is listed as following. First, we establish an idealized optimal estimator with minimal variance as benchmark, and then demonstrate that adaptive experiment is necessary to achieve near-optimal estimation accuracy. Secondly, by incorporating the concept of doubly robust method into sequential experimental design, we frame the optimal estimation problem as an online bandit learning problem, bridging the two fields of statistical estimation and bandit learning. Using tools and ideas from both bandit algorithm design and adaptive statistical estimation, we propose a general low switching adaptive experiment framework, which could be a generic research paradigm for a wide range of adaptive experimental design. Through information-theoretic lower bound combined with Bayes risk analysis, we demonstrate the optimality of our proposed experiment. Numerical result indicates that the estimation accuracy approaches optimal with as few as two or three policy updates.</description>

      <title>SMART: A Flexible Approach to Regression using Spline-Based Multivariate Adaptive Regression Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision trees are powerful for predictive modeling but often suffer from high variance when modeling continuous relationships. While algorithms like Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) excel at capturing such continuous relationships, they perform poorly when modeling discontinuities. To address the limitations of both approaches, we introduce Spline-based Multivariate Adaptive Regression Trees (SMART), which uses a decision tree to identify subsets of data with distinct continuous relationships and then leverages MARS to fit these relationships independently. Unlike other methods that rely on the tree structure to model interaction and higher-order terms, SMART leverages MARS's native ability to handle these terms, allowing the tree to focus solely on identifying discontinuities in the relationship. We test SMART on various datasets, demonstrating its improvement over state-of-the-art methods in such cases. Additionally, we provide an open-source implementation of our method to be used by practitioners.</description>

      <title>Amortized Control of Continuous State Space Feynman-Kac Model for Irregular Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world datasets, such as healthcare, climate, and economics, are often collected as irregular time series, which poses challenges for accurate modeling. In this paper, we propose the Amortized Control of continuous State Space Model (ACSSM) for continuous dynamical modeling of time series for irregular and discrete observations. We first present a multi-marginal Doob's $h$-transform to construct a continuous dynamical system conditioned on these irregular observations. Following this, we introduce a variational inference algorithm with a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO), leveraging stochastic optimal control (SOC) theory to approximate the intractable Doob's $h$-transform and simulate the conditioned dynamics. To improve efficiency and scalability during both training and inference, ACSSM employs amortized inference to decouple representation learning from the latent dynamics. Additionally, it incorporates a simulation-free latent dynamics framework and a transformer-based data assimilation scheme, facilitating parallel inference of the latent states and ELBO computation. Through empirical evaluations across a variety of real-world datasets, ACSSM demonstrates superior performance in tasks such as classification, regression, interpolation, and extrapolation, while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>The Breakdown of Gaussian Universality in Classification of High-dimensional Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The assumption of Gaussian or Gaussian mixture data has been extensively exploited in a long series of precise performance analyses of machine learning (ML) methods, on large datasets having comparably numerous samples and features. To relax this restrictive assumption, subsequent efforts have been devoted to establish "Gaussian equivalent principles" by studying scenarios of Gaussian universality where the asymptotic performance of ML methods on non-Gaussian data remains unchanged when replaced with Gaussian data having the same mean and covariance. Beyond the realm of Gaussian universality, there are few exact results on how the data distribution affects the learning performance.
  In this article, we provide a precise high-dimensional characterization of empirical risk minimization, for classification under a general mixture data setting of linear factor models that extends Gaussian mixtures. The Gaussian universality is shown to break down under this setting, in the sense that the asymptotic learning performance depends on the data distribution beyond the class means and covariances. To clarify the limitations of Gaussian universality in classification of mixture data and to understand the impact of its breakdown, we specify conditions for Gaussian universality and discuss their implications for the choice of loss function.</description>

      <title>On the Impacts of the Random Initialization in the Neural Tangent Kernel Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to discuss the impact of random initialization of neural networks in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory, which is ignored by most recent works in the NTK theory. It is well known that as the network's width tends to infinity, the neural network with random initialization converges to a Gaussian process $f^{\mathrm{GP}}$, which takes values in $L^{2}(\mathcal{X})$, where $\mathcal{X}$ is the domain of the data. In contrast, to adopt the traditional theory of kernel regression, most recent works introduced a special mirrored architecture and a mirrored (random) initialization to ensure the network's output is identically zero at initialization. Therefore, it remains a question whether the conventional setting and mirrored initialization would make wide neural networks exhibit different generalization capabilities. In this paper, we first show that the training dynamics of the gradient flow of neural networks with random initialization converge uniformly to that of the corresponding NTK regression with random initialization $f^{\mathrm{GP}}$. We then show that $\mathbf{P}(f^{\mathrm{GP}} \in [\mathcal{H}^{\mathrm{NT}}]^{s}) = 1$ for any $s &lt; \frac{3}{d+1}$ and $\mathbf{P}(f^{\mathrm{GP}} \in [\mathcal{H}^{\mathrm{NT}}]^{s}) = 0$ for any $s \geq \frac{3}{d+1}$, where $[\mathcal{H}^{\mathrm{NT}}]^{s}$ is the real interpolation space of the RKHS $\mathcal{H}^{\mathrm{NT}}$ associated with the NTK. Consequently, the generalization error of the wide neural network trained by gradient descent is $\Omega(n^{-\frac{3}{d+3}})$, and it still suffers from the curse of dimensionality. On one hand, the result highlights the benefits of mirror initialization. On the other hand, it implies that NTK theory may not fully explain the superior performance of neural networks.</description>

      <title>Long-Context Linear System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of long-context linear system identification, where the state $x_t$ of a dynamical system at time $t$ depends linearly on previous states $x_s$ over a fixed context window of length $p$. We establish a sample complexity bound that matches the i.i.d. parametric rate up to logarithmic factors for a broad class of systems, extending previous works that considered only first-order dependencies. Our findings reveal a learning-without-mixing phenomenon, indicating that learning long-context linear autoregressive models is not hindered by slow mixing properties potentially associated with extended context windows. Additionally, we extend these results to (i) shared low-rank representations, where rank-regularized estimators improve rates with respect to dimensionality, and (ii) misspecified context lengths in strictly stable systems, where shorter contexts offer statistical advantages.</description>

      <title>Pathwise Gradient Variance Reduction with Control Variates in Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational inference in Bayesian deep learning often involves computing the gradient of an expectation that lacks a closed-form solution. In these cases, pathwise and score-function gradient estimators are the most common approaches. The pathwise estimator is often favoured for its substantially lower variance compared to the score-function estimator, which typically requires variance reduction techniques. However, recent research suggests that even pathwise gradient estimators could benefit from variance reduction. In this work, we review existing control-variates-based variance reduction methods for pathwise gradient estimators to assess their effectiveness. Notably, these methods often rely on integrand approximations and are applicable only to simple variational families. To address this limitation, we propose applying zero-variance control variates to pathwise gradient estimators. This approach offers the advantage of requiring minimal assumptions about the variational distribution, other than being able to sample from it.</description>

      <title>Temperature Optimization for Bayesian Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cold Posterior Effect (CPE) is a phenomenon in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL), where tempering the posterior to a cold temperature often improves the predictive performance of the posterior predictive distribution (PPD). Although the term `CPE' suggests colder temperatures are inherently better, the BDL community increasingly recognizes that this is not always the case. Despite this, there remains no systematic method for finding the optimal temperature beyond grid search. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach to select the temperature that maximizes test log-predictive density, treating the temperature as a model parameter and estimating it directly from the data. We empirically demonstrate that our method performs comparably to grid search, at a fraction of the cost, across both regression and classification tasks. Finally, we highlight the differing perspectives on CPE between the BDL and Generalized Bayes communities: while the former primarily focuses on predictive performance of the PPD, the latter emphasizes calibrated uncertainty and robustness to model misspecification; these distinct objectives lead to different temperature preferences.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Fairness-Adaptive Classification Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era where artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms increasingly impact human life, it is crucial to develop models that account for potential discrimination in their predictions. This paper tackles this problem by introducing a new classification tree algorithm using a novel splitting criterion that incorporates fairness adjustments into the tree-building process. The proposed method integrates a fairness-aware impurity measure that balances predictive accuracy with fairness across protected groups. By ensuring that each splitting node considers both the gain in classification error and the fairness, our algorithm encourages splits that mitigate discrimination. Importantly, in penalizing unfair splits, we account for the uncertainty in the fairness metric by utilizing its confidence interval instead of relying on its point estimate. Experimental results on benchmark and synthetic datasets illustrate that our method effectively reduces discriminatory predictions compared to traditional classification trees, without significant loss in overall accuracy.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Bandits for Egalitarian Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study EgalMAB, an egalitarian assignment problem in the context of stochastic multi-armed bandits. In EgalMAB, an agent is tasked with assigning a set of users to arms. At each time step, the agent must assign exactly one arm to each user such that no two users are assigned to the same arm. Subsequently, each user obtains a reward drawn from the unknown reward distribution associated with its assigned arm. The agent's objective is to maximize the minimum expected cumulative reward among all users over a fixed horizon. This problem has applications in areas such as fairness in job and resource allocations, among others. We design and analyze a UCB-based policy EgalUCB and establish upper bounds on the cumulative regret. In complement, we establish an almost-matching policy-independent impossibility result.</description>

      <title>Manifolds, Random Matrices and Spectral Gaps: The geometric phases of generative diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the latent geometry of generative diffusion models under the manifold hypothesis. To this purpose, we analyze the spectrum of eigenvalues (and singular values) of the Jacobian of the score function, whose discontinuities (gaps) reveal the presence and dimensionality of distinct sub-manifolds. Using a statistical physics approach, we derive the spectral distributions and formulas for the spectral gaps under several distributional assumptions and we compare these theoretical predictions with the spectra estimated from trained networks. Our analysis reveals the existence of three distinct qualitative phases during the generative process: a trivial phase; a manifold coverage phase where the diffusion process fits the distribution internal to the manifold; a consolidation phase where the score becomes orthogonal to the manifold and all particles are projected on the support of the data. This `division of labor' between different timescales provides an elegant explanation on why generative diffusion models are not affected by the manifold overfitting phenomenon that plagues likelihood-based models, since the internal distribution and the manifold geometry are produced at different time points during generation.</description>

      <title>Generalized Sparse Additive Model with Unknown Link Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized additive models (GAM) have been successfully applied to high dimensional data analysis. However, most existing methods cannot simultaneously estimate the link function, the component functions and the variable interaction. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new sparse additive model, named generalized sparse additive model with unknown link function (GSAMUL), in which the component functions are estimated by B-spline basis and the unknown link function is estimated by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network. Furthermore, $\ell_{2,1}$-norm regularizer is used for variable selection. The proposed GSAMUL can realize both variable selection and hidden interaction. We integrate this estimation into a bilevel optimization problem, where the data is split into training set and validation set. In theory, we provide the guarantees about the convergence of the approximate procedure. In applications, experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real world data sets consistently validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-based Differentiable Structure Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing approaches to differentiable structure learning of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) rely on strong identifiability assumptions in order to guarantee that global minimizers of the acyclicity-constrained optimization problem identifies the true DAG. Moreover, it has been observed empirically that the optimizer may exploit undesirable artifacts in the loss function. We explain and remedy these issues by studying the behavior of differentiable acyclicity-constrained programs under general likelihoods with multiple global minimizers. By carefully regularizing the likelihood, it is possible to identify the sparsest model in the Markov equivalence class, even in the absence of an identifiable parametrization. We first study the Gaussian case in detail, showing how proper regularization of the likelihood defines a score that identifies the sparsest model. Assuming faithfulness, it also recovers the Markov equivalence class. These results are then generalized to general models and likelihoods, where the same claims hold. These theoretical results are validated empirically, showing how this can be done using standard gradient-based optimizers, thus paving the way for differentiable structure learning under general models and losses.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Kernel Regularisation Improves Generalisation in Deep Kernel Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work developed convolutional deep kernel machines, achieving 92.7% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 using a ResNet-inspired architecture, which is SOTA for kernel methods. However, this still lags behind neural networks, which easily achieve over 94% test accuracy with similar architectures. In this work we introduce several modifications to improve the convolutional deep kernel machine's generalisation, including stochastic kernel regularisation, which adds noise to the learned Gram matrices during training. The resulting model achieves 94.5% test accuracy on CIFAR-10. This finding has important theoretical and practical implications, as it demonstrates that the ability to perform well on complex tasks like image classification is not unique to neural networks. Instead, other approaches including deep kernel methods can achieve excellent performance on such tasks, as long as they have the capacity to learn representations from data.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Estimation and Tuning-Free Rank Detection for Probability Mass Function Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining a reliable estimate of the joint probability mass function (PMF) of a set of random variables from observed data is a significant objective in statistical signal processing and machine learning. Modelling the joint PMF as a tensor that admits a low-rank canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) has enabled the development of efficient PMF estimation algorithms. However, these algorithms require the rank (model order) of the tensor to be specified beforehand. In real-world applications, the true rank is unknown. Therefore, an appropriate rank is usually selected from a candidate set either by observing validation errors or by computing various likelihood-based information criteria, a procedure which is computationally expensive for large datasets. This paper presents a novel Bayesian framework for estimating the joint PMF and automatically inferring its rank from observed data. We specify a Bayesian PMF estimation model and employ appropriate prior distributions for the model parameters, allowing for tuning-free rank inference via a single training run. We then derive a deterministic solution based on variational inference (VI) to approximate the posterior distributions of various model parameters. Additionally, we develop a scalable version of the VI-based approach by leveraging stochastic variational inference (SVI) to arrive at an efficient algorithm whose complexity scales sublinearly with the size of the dataset. Numerical experiments involving both synthetic data and real movie recommendation data illustrate the advantages of our VI and SVI-based methods in terms of estimation accuracy, automatic rank detection, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Covering Numbers for Deep ReLU Networks with Applications to Function Approximation and Nonparametric Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covering numbers of families of (deep) ReLU networks have been used to characterize their approximation-theoretic performance, upper-bound the prediction error they incur in nonparametric regression, and quantify their classification capacity. These results are based on covering number upper bounds obtained through the explicit construction of coverings. Lower bounds on covering numbers do not seem to be available in the literature. The present paper fills this gap by deriving tight (up to a multiplicative constant) lower and upper bounds on the covering numbers of fully-connected networks with bounded weights, sparse networks with bounded weights, and fully-connected networks with quantized weights. Thanks to the tightness of the bounds, a fundamental understanding of the impact of sparsity, quantization, bounded vs. unbounded weights, and network output truncation can be developed. Furthermore, the bounds allow to characterize the fundamental limits of neural network transformation, including network compression, and lead to sharp upper bounds on the prediction error in nonparametric regression through deep networks. Specifically, we can remove a $\log^6(n)$-factor in the best-known sample complexity rate in the estimation of Lipschitz functions through deep networks thereby establishing optimality. Finally, we identify a systematic relation between optimal nonparametric regression and optimal approximation through deep networks, unifying numerous results in the literature and uncovering general underlying principles.</description>

      <title>Gridded Transformer Neural Processes for Large Unstructured Spatio-Temporal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many important problems require modelling large-scale spatio-temporal datasets, with one prevalent example being weather forecasting. Recently, transformer-based approaches have shown great promise in a range of weather forecasting problems. However, these have mostly focused on gridded data sources, neglecting the wealth of unstructured, off-the-grid data from observational measurements such as those at weather stations. A promising family of models suitable for such tasks are neural processes (NPs), notably the family of transformer neural processes (TNPs). Although TNPs have shown promise on small spatio-temporal datasets, they are unable to scale to the quantities of data used by state-of-the-art weather and climate models. This limitation stems from their lack of efficient attention mechanisms. We address this shortcoming through the introduction of gridded pseudo-token TNPs which employ specialised encoders and decoders to handle unstructured observations and utilise a processor containing gridded pseudo-tokens that leverage efficient attention mechanisms. Our method consistently outperforms a range of strong baselines on various synthetic and real-world regression tasks involving large-scale data, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. The real-life experiments are performed on weather data, demonstrating the potential of our approach to bring performance and computational benefits when applied at scale in a weather modelling pipeline.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Vulnerability as a Consequence of On-Manifold Inseparibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have shown theoretically and empirically that redundant data dimensions are a source of adversarial vulnerability. However, the inverse doesn't seem to hold in practice; employing dimension-reduction techniques doesn't exhibit robustness as expected. In this work, we consider classification tasks and characterize the data distribution as a low-dimensional manifold, with high/low variance features defining the on/off manifold direction. We argue that clean training experiences poor convergence in the off-manifold direction caused by the ill-conditioning in widely used first-order optimizers like gradient descent. The poor convergence then acts as a source of adversarial vulnerability when the dataset is inseparable in the on-manifold direction. We provide theoretical results for logistic regression and a 2-layer linear network on the considered data distribution. Furthermore, we advocate using second-order methods that are immune to ill-conditioning and lead to better robustness. We perform experiments and exhibit tremendous robustness improvements in clean training through long training and the employment of second-order methods, corroborating our framework. Additionally, we find the inclusion of batch-norm layers hinders such robustness gains. We attribute this to differing implicit biases between traditional and batch-normalized neural networks.</description>

      <title>Do Contemporary CATE Models Capture Real-World Heterogeneity? Findings from a Large-Scale Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present unexpected findings from a large-scale benchmark study evaluating Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) estimation algorithms. By running 16 modern CATE models across 43,200 datasets, we find that: (a) 62\% of CATE estimates have a higher Mean Squared Error (MSE) than a trivial zero-effect predictor, rendering them ineffective; (b) in datasets with at least one useful CATE estimate, 80\% still have higher MSE than a constant-effect model; and (c) Orthogonality-based models outperform other models only 30\% of the time, despite widespread optimism about their performance. These findings expose significant limitations in current CATE models and suggest ample opportunities for further research.
  Our findings stem from a novel application of \textit{observational sampling}, originally developed to evaluate Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimates from observational methods with experiment data. To adapt observational sampling for CATE evaluation, we introduce a statistical parameter, $Q$, equal to MSE minus a constant and preserves the ranking of models by their MSE. We then derive a family of sample statistics, collectively called $\hat{Q}$, that can be computed from real-world data. We prove that $\hat{Q}$ is a consistent estimator of $Q$ under mild technical conditions. When used in observational sampling, $\hat{Q}$ is unbiased and asymptotically selects the model with the smallest MSE. To ensure the benchmark reflects real-world heterogeneity, we handpick datasets where outcomes come from field rather than simulation. By combining the new observational sampling method, new statistics, and real-world datasets, the benchmark provides a unique perspective on CATE estimator performance and uncover gaps in capturing real-world heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>GRU-D Characterizes Age-Specific Temporal Missingness in MIMIC-IV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal missingness, defined as unobserved patterns in time series, and its predictive potentials represent an emerging area in clinical machine learning. We trained a gated recurrent unit with decay mechanisms, called GRU-D, for a binary classification between elderly - and young patients. We extracted time series for 5 vital signs from MIMIC-IV as model inputs. GRU-D was evaluated with means of 0.780 AUROC and 0.810 AUPRC on bootstrapped data. Interpreting trained model parameters, we found differences in blood pressure missingness and respiratory rate missingness as important predictors learned by parameterized hidden gated units. We successfully showed how GRU-D can be used to reveal patterns in temporal missingness building the basis of novel research directions.</description>

      <title>A Functional Extension of Semi-Structured Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-structured networks (SSNs) merge the structures familiar from additive models with deep neural networks, allowing the modeling of interpretable partial feature effects while capturing higher-order non-linearities at the same time. A significant challenge in this integration is maintaining the interpretability of the additive model component. Inspired by large-scale biomechanics datasets, this paper explores extending SSNs to functional data. Existing methods in functional data analysis are promising but often not expressive enough to account for all interactions and non-linearities and do not scale well to large datasets. Although the SSN approach presents a compelling potential solution, its adaptation to functional data remains complex. In this work, we propose a functional SSN method that retains the advantageous properties of classical functional regression approaches while also improving scalability. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach accurately recovers underlying signals, enhances predictive performance, and performs favorably compared to competing methods.</description>

      <title>Online scalable Gaussian processes with conformal prediction for guaranteed coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gaussian process (GP) is a Bayesian nonparametric paradigm that is widely adopted for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in a number of safety-critical applications, including robotics, healthcare, as well as surveillance. The consistency of the resulting uncertainty values however, hinges on the premise that the learning function conforms to the properties specified by the GP model, such as smoothness, periodicity and more, which may not be satisfied in practice, especially with data arriving on the fly. To combat against such model mis-specification, we propose to wed the GP with the prevailing conformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free post-processing framework that produces it prediction sets with a provably valid coverage under the sole assumption of data exchangeability. However, this assumption is usually violated in the online setting, where a prediction set is sought before revealing the true label. To ensure long-term coverage guarantee, we will adaptively set the key threshold parameter based on the feedback whether the true label falls inside the prediction set. Numerical results demonstrate the merits of the online GP-CP approach relative to existing alternatives in the long-term coverage performance.</description>

      <title>Testing Credibility of Public and Private Surveys through the Lens of Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Testing whether a sample survey is a credible representation of the population is an important question to ensure the validity of any downstream research. While this problem, in general, does not have an efficient solution, one might take a task-based approach and aim to understand whether a certain data analysis tool, like linear regression, would yield similar answers both on the population and the sample survey. In this paper, we design an algorithm to test the credibility of a sample survey in terms of linear regression. In other words, we design an algorithm that can certify if a sample survey is good enough to guarantee the correctness of data analysis done using linear regression tools. Nowadays, one is naturally concerned about data privacy in surveys. Thus, we further test the credibility of surveys published in a differentially private manner. Specifically, we focus on Local Differential Privacy (LDP), which is a standard technique to ensure privacy in surveys where the survey participants might not trust the aggregator. We extend our algorithm to work even when the data analysis has been done using surveys with LDP. In the process, we also propose an algorithm that learns with high probability the guarantees a linear regression model on a survey published with LDP. Our algorithm also serves as a mechanism to learn linear regression models from data corrupted with noise coming from any subexponential distribution. We prove that it achieves the optimal estimation error bound for $\ell_1$ linear regression, which might be of broader interest. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithms while trying to reduce the sample complexity for both public and private surveys. We also numerically demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on real and synthetic datasets.</description>

      <title>From Sparse Dependence to Sparse Attention: Unveiling How Chain-of-Thought Enhances Transformer Sample Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) significantly enhances the reasoning performance of large language models (LLM). While current theoretical studies often attribute this improvement to increased expressiveness and computational capacity, we argue that expressiveness is not the primary limitation in the LLM regime, as current large models will fail on simple tasks. Using a parity-learning setup, we demonstrate that CoT can substantially improve sample efficiency even when the representation power is sufficient. Specifically, with CoT, a transformer can learn the function within polynomial samples, whereas without CoT, the required sample size is exponential. Additionally, we show that CoT simplifies the learning process by introducing sparse sequential dependencies among input tokens, and leads to a sparse and interpretable attention. We validate our theoretical analysis with both synthetic and real-world experiments, confirming that sparsity in attention layers is a key factor of the improvement induced by CoT.</description>

Abstract: We consider the portfolio optimisation problem where the terminal function is an S-shaped utility applied at the difference between the wealth and a random benchmark process. We develop several numerical methods for solving the problem using deep learning and duality methods. We use deep learning methods to solve the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for both the primal and dual problems, and the adjoint equation arising from the stochastic maximum principle. We compare the solution of this non-concave problem to that of concavified utility, a random function depending on the benchmark, in both complete and incomplete markets. We give some numerical results for power and log utilities to show the accuracy of the suggested algorithms.</description>

      <title>DOPL: Direct Online Preference Learning for Restless Bandits with Preference Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) has been widely used to model constrained sequential decision making problems, where the state of each restless arm evolves according to a Markov chain and each state transition generates a scalar reward. However, the success of RMAB crucially relies on the availability and quality of reward signals. Unfortunately, specifying an exact reward function in practice can be challenging and even infeasible. In this paper, we introduce Pref-RMAB, a new RMAB model in the presence of preference signals, where the decision maker only observes pairwise preference feedback rather than scalar reward from the activated arms at each decision epoch. Preference feedback, however, arguably contains less information than the scalar reward, which makes Pref-RMAB seemingly more difficult. To address this challenge, we present a direct online preference learning (DOPL) algorithm for Pref-RMAB to efficiently explore the unknown environments, adaptively collect preference data in an online manner, and directly leverage the preference feedback for decision-makings. We prove that DOPL yields a sublinear regret. To our best knowledge, this is the first algorithm to ensure $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T\ln T})$ regret for RMAB with preference feedback. Experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness of DOPL.</description>

      <title>Scalable Inference for Bayesian Multinomial Logistic-Normal Dynamic Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many scientific fields collect longitudinal count compositional data. Each observation is a multivariate count vector, where the total counts are arbitrary, and the information lies in the relative frequency of the counts. Multiple authors have proposed Bayesian Multinomial Logistic-Normal Dynamic Linear Models (MLN-DLMs) as a flexible approach to modeling these data. However, adoption of these methods has been limited by computational challenges. This article develops an efficient and accurate approach to posterior state estimation, called $\textit{Fenrir}$. Our approach relies on a novel algorithm for MAP estimation and an accurate approximation to a key posterior marginal of the model. As there are no equivalent methods against which we can compare, we also develop an optimized Stan implementation of MLN-DLMs. Our experiments suggest that Fenrir can be three orders of magnitude more efficient than Stan and can even be incorporated into larger sampling schemes for joint inference of model hyperparameters. Our methods are made available to the community as a user-friendly software library written in C++ with an R interface.</description>

Abstract: The objective of active level set estimation for a black-box function is to precisely identify regions where the function values exceed or fall below a specified threshold by iteratively performing function evaluations to gather more information about the function. This becomes particularly important when function evaluations are costly, drastically limiting our ability to acquire large datasets. A promising way to sample-efficiently model the black-box function is by incorporating prior knowledge from a related function. However, this approach risks slowing down the estimation task if the prior knowledge is irrelevant or misleading. In this paper, we present a novel transfer learning method for active level set estimation that safely integrates a given prior knowledge while constantly adjusting it to guarantee a robust performance of a level set estimation algorithm even when the prior knowledge is irrelevant. We theoretically analyze this algorithm to show that it has a better level set convergence compared to standard transfer learning approaches that do not make any adjustment to the prior. Additionally, extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm the effectiveness of our method when applied to various different level set estimation algorithms as well as different transfer learning scenarios.</description>

      <title>Log-concave Sampling over a Convex Body with a Barrier: a Robust and Unified Dikin Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a $d$-dimensional log-concave distribution $\pi(\theta) \propto \exp(-f(\theta))$ for $L$-Lipschitz $f$, constrained to a convex body with an efficiently computable self-concordant barrier function, contained in a ball of radius $R$ with a $w$-warm start.
  We propose a \emph{robust} sampling framework that computes spectral approximations to the Hessian of the barrier functions in each iteration. We prove that for polytopes that are described by $n$ hyperplanes, sampling with the Lee-Sidford barrier function mixes within $\widetilde O((d^2+dL^2R^2)\log(w/\delta))$ steps with a per step cost of $\widetilde O(nd^{\omega-1})$, where $\omega\approx 2.37$ is the fast matrix multiplication exponent. Compared to the prior work of Mangoubi and Vishnoi, our approach gives faster mixing time as we are able to design a generalized soft-threshold Dikin walk beyond log-barrier.
  We further extend our result to show how to sample from a $d$-dimensional spectrahedron, the constrained set of a semidefinite program, specified by the set $\{x\in \mathbb{R}^d: \sum_{i=1}^d x_i A_i \succeq C \}$ where $A_1,\ldots,A_d, C$ are $n\times n$ real symmetric matrices. We design a walk that mixes in $\widetilde O((nd+dL^2R^2)\log(w/\delta))$ steps with a per iteration cost of $\widetilde O(n^\omega+n^2d^{3\omega-5})$. We improve the mixing time bound of prior best Dikin walk due to Narayanan and Rakhlin that mixes in $\widetilde O((n^2d^3+n^2dL^2R^2)\log(w/\delta))$ steps.</description>

      <title>Simple Relative Deviation Bounds for Covariance and Gram Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide non-asymptotic, relative deviation bounds for the eigenvalues of empirical covariance and gram matrices in general settings. Unlike typical uniform bounds, which may fail to capture the behavior of smaller eigenvalues, our results provide sharper control across the spectrum. Our analysis is based on a general-purpose theorem that allows one to convert existing uniform bounds into relative ones. The theorems and techniques emphasize simplicity and should be applicable across various settings.</description>

      <title>Training-free Diffusion Model Alignment with Sampling Demons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning diffusion models with user preferences has been a key challenge. Existing methods for aligning diffusion models either require retraining or are limited to differentiable reward functions. To address these limitations, we propose a stochastic optimization approach, dubbed Demon, to guide the denoising process at inference time without backpropagation through reward functions or model retraining. Our approach works by controlling noise distribution in denoising steps to concentrate density on regions corresponding to high rewards through stochastic optimization. We provide comprehensive theoretical and empirical evidence to support and validate our approach, including experiments that use non-differentiable sources of rewards such as Visual-Language Model (VLM) APIs and human judgements. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed approach is the first inference-time, backpropagation-free preference alignment method for diffusion models. Our method can be easily integrated with existing diffusion models without further training. Our experiments show that the proposed approach significantly improves the average aesthetics scores for text-to-image generation.</description>

      <title>A noise-corrected Langevin algorithm and sampling by half-denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Langevin algorithm is a classic method for sampling from a given pdf in a real space. In its basic version, it only requires knowledge of the gradient of the log-density, also called the score function. However, in deep learning, it is often easier to learn the so-called "noisy score function", i.e. the gradient of the log-density of noisy data, more precisely when Gaussian noise is added to the data. Such an estimate is biased and complicates the use of the Langevin method. Here, we propose a noise-corrected version of the Langevin algorithm, where the bias due to noisy data is removed, at least regarding first-order terms. Unlike diffusion models, our algorithm needs to know the noisy score function for one single noise level only. We further propose a simple special case which has an interesting intuitive interpretation of iteratively adding noise the data and then attempting to remove half of that noise.</description>

      <title>Improved Sample Complexity for Private Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study differentially private (DP) optimization algorithms for stochastic and empirical objectives which are neither smooth nor convex, and propose methods that return a Goldstein-stationary point with sample complexity bounds that improve on existing works. We start by providing a single-pass $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP algorithm that returns an $(\alpha,\beta)$-stationary point as long as the dataset is of size $\widetilde{\Omega}\left(1/\alpha\beta^{3}+d/\epsilon\alpha\beta^{2}+d^{3/4}/\epsilon^{1/2}\alpha\beta^{5/2}\right)$, which is $\Omega(\sqrt{d})$ times smaller than the algorithm of Zhang et al. [2024] for this task, where $d$ is the dimension. We then provide a multi-pass polynomial time algorithm which further improves the sample complexity to $\widetilde{\Omega}\left(d/\beta^2+d^{3/4}/\epsilon\alpha^{1/2}\beta^{3/2}\right)$, by designing a sample efficient ERM algorithm, and proving that Goldstein-stationary points generalize from the empirical loss to the population loss.</description>

      <title>Sparse Repellency for Shielded Generation in Text-to-image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increased adoption of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has triggered concerns on their reliability. Such models are now closely scrutinized under the lens of various metrics, notably calibration, fairness, or compute efficiency. We focus in this work on two issues that arise when deploying these models: a lack of diversity when prompting images, and a tendency to recreate images from the training set. To solve both problems, we propose a method that coaxes the sampled trajectories of pretrained diffusion models to land on images that fall outside of a reference set. We achieve this by adding repellency terms to the diffusion SDE throughout the generation trajectory, which are triggered whenever the path is expected to land too closely to an image in the shielded reference set. Our method is sparse in the sense that these repellency terms are zero and inactive most of the time, and even more so towards the end of the generation trajectory. Our method, named SPELL for sparse repellency, can be used either with a static reference set that contains protected images, or dynamically, by updating the set at each timestep with the expected images concurrently generated within a batch. We show that adding SPELL to popular diffusion models improves their diversity while impacting their FID only marginally, and performs comparatively better than other recent training-free diversity methods. We also demonstrate how SPELL can ensure a shielded generation away from a very large set of protected images by considering all 1.2M images from ImageNet as the protected set.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Learning of Causal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing acquisition of datasets over time, we now have access to precise and varied descriptions of the world, capturing all sorts of phenomena. These datasets can be seen as empirical observations of unknown causal generative processes, which can commonly be described by Structural Causal Models (SCMs). Recovering these causal generative processes from observations poses formidable challenges, and often require to learn a specific generative model for each dataset. In this work, we propose to learn a \emph{single} model capable of inferring in a zero-shot manner the causal generative processes of datasets. Rather than learning a specific SCM for each dataset, we enable the Fixed-Point Approach (FiP) proposed in~\cite{scetbon2024fip}, to infer the generative SCMs conditionally on their empirical representations. More specifically, we propose to amortize the learning of a conditional version of FiP to infer generative SCMs from observations and causal structures on synthetically generated datasets. We show that our model is capable of predicting in zero-shot the true generative SCMs, and as a by-product, of (i) generating new dataset samples, and (ii) inferring intervened ones. Our experiments demonstrate that our amortized procedure achieves performances on par with SoTA methods trained specifically for each dataset on both in and out-of-distribution problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that SCMs are inferred in a zero-shot manner from observations, paving the way for a paradigmatic shift towards the assimilation of causal knowledge across datasets.</description>

      <title>Benign Overfitting for Regression with Trained Two-Layer ReLU Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the least-square regression problem with a two-layer fully-connected neural network, with ReLU activation function, trained by gradient flow. Our first result is a generalization result, that requires no assumptions on the underlying regression function or the noise other than that they are bounded. We operate in the neural tangent kernel regime, and our generalization result is developed via a decomposition of the excess risk into estimation and approximation errors, viewing gradient flow as an implicit regularizer. This decomposition in the context of neural networks is a novel perspective of gradient descent, and helps us avoid uniform convergence traps. In this work, we also establish that under the same setting, the trained network overfits to the data. Together, these results, establishes the first result on benign overfitting for finite-width ReLU networks for arbitrary regression functions.</description>

      <title>SymDiff: Equivariant Diffusion via Stochastic Symmetrisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose SymDiff, a novel method for constructing equivariant diffusion models using the recently introduced framework of stochastic symmetrisation. SymDiff resembles a learned data augmentation that is deployed at sampling time, and is lightweight, computationally efficient, and easy to implement on top of arbitrary off-the-shelf models. Notably, in contrast to previous work, SymDiff typically does not require any neural network components that are intrinsically equivariant, avoiding the need for complex parameterizations and the use of higher-order geometric features. Instead, our method can leverage highly scalable modern architectures as drop-in replacements for these more constrained alternatives. We show that this additional flexibility yields significant empirical benefit on $\mathrm{E}(3)$-equivariant molecular generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of symmetrisation to generative modelling, suggesting its potential in this domain more generally.</description>

      <title>Think While You Generate: Discrete Diffusion with Planned Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion has achieved state-of-the-art performance, outperforming or approaching autoregressive models on standard benchmarks. In this work, we introduce Discrete Diffusion with Planned Denoising (DDPD), a novel framework that separates the generation process into two models: a planner and a denoiser. At inference time, the planner selects which positions to denoise next by identifying the most corrupted positions in need of denoising, including both initially corrupted and those requiring additional refinement. This plan-and-denoise approach enables more efficient reconstruction during generation by iteratively identifying and denoising corruptions in the optimal order. DDPD outperforms traditional denoiser-only mask diffusion methods, achieving superior results on language modeling benchmarks such as text8, OpenWebText, and token-based generation on ImageNet $256 \times 256$. Notably, in language modeling, DDPD significantly reduces the performance gap between diffusion-based and autoregressive methods in terms of generative perplexity.

      <title>Model Predictive Control is Almost Optimal for Restless Bandit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the discrete time infinite horizon average reward restless markovian bandit (RMAB) problem. We propose a \emph{model predictive control} based non-stationary policy with a rolling computational horizon $\tau$. At each time-slot, this policy solves a $\tau$ horizon linear program whose first control value is kept as a control for the RMAB. Our solution requires minimal assumptions and quantifies the loss in optimality in terms of $\tau$ and the number of arms, $N$. We show that its sub-optimality gap is $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ in general, and $\exp(-\Omega(N))$ under a local-stability condition. Our proof is based on a framework from dynamic control known as \emph{dissipativity}. Our solution easy to implement and performs very well in practice when compared to the state of the art. Further, both our solution and our proof methodology can easily be generalized to more general constrained MDP settings and should thus, be of great interest to the burgeoning RMAB community.</description>

      <title>Learning in complex action spaces without policy gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom suggests that policy gradient methods are better suited to complex action spaces than action-value methods. However, foundational studies have shown equivalences between these paradigms in small and finite action spaces (O'Donoghue et al., 2017; Schulman et al., 2017a). This raises the question of why their computational applicability and performance diverge as the complexity of the action space increases. We hypothesize that the apparent superiority of policy gradients in such settings stems not from intrinsic qualities of the paradigm, but from universal principles that can also be applied to action-value methods to serve similar functionality. We identify three such principles and provide a framework for incorporating them into action-value methods. To support our hypothesis, we instantiate this framework in what we term QMLE, for Q-learning with maximum likelihood estimation. Our results show that QMLE can be applied to complex action spaces with a controllable computational cost that is comparable to that of policy gradient methods, all without using policy gradients. Furthermore, QMLE demonstrates strong performance on the DeepMind Control Suite, even when compared to the state-of-the-art methods such as DMPO and D4PG.</description>

      <title>A convex formulation of covariate-adjusted Gaussian graphical models via natural parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) are widely used for recovering the conditional independence structure among random variables. Recently, several key advances have been made to exploit an additional set of variables for better estimating the GGMs of the variables of interest. For example, in co-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, both the mean expression level of genes as well as their pairwise conditional independence structure may be adjusted by genetic variants local to those genes. Existing methods to estimate covariate-adjusted GGMs either allow only the mean to depend on covariates or suffer from poor scaling assumptions due to the inherent non-convexity of simultaneously estimating the mean and precision matrix. In this paper, we propose a convex formulation that jointly estimates the covariate-adjusted mean and precision matrix by utilizing the natural parametrization of the multivariate Gaussian likelihood. This convexity yields theoretically better performance as the sparsity and dimension of the covariates grow large relative to the number of samples. We verify our theoretical results with numerical simulations and perform a reanalysis of an eQTL study of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), an aggressive form of brain cancer.</description>

      <title>Batched Bayesian optimization with correlated candidate uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Batched Bayesian optimization (BO) can accelerate molecular design by efficiently identifying top-performing compounds from a large chemical library. Existing acquisition strategies for batch design in BO aim to balance exploration and exploitation. This often involves optimizing non-additive batch acquisition functions, necessitating approximation via myopic construction and/or diversity heuristics. In this work, we propose an acquisition strategy for discrete optimization that is motivated by pure exploitation, qPO (multipoint Probability of Optimality). qPO maximizes the probability that the batch includes the true optimum, which is expressible as the sum over individual acquisition scores and thereby circumvents the combinatorial challenge of optimizing a batch acquisition function. We differentiate the proposed strategy from parallel Thompson sampling and discuss how it implicitly captures diversity. Finally, we apply our method to the model-guided exploration of large chemical libraries and provide empirical evidence that it performs better than or on par with state-of-the-art methods in batched Bayesian optimization.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Federated Group Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning faces challenges due to the heterogeneity in data volumes and distributions at different clients, which can compromise model generalization ability to various distributions. Existing approaches to address this issue based on group distributionally robust optimization (GDRO) often lead to high communication and sample complexity. To this end, this work introduces algorithms tailored for communication-efficient Federated Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (FGDRO). Our contributions are threefold: Firstly, we introduce the FGDRO-CVaR algorithm, which optimizes the average top-K losses while reducing communication complexity to $O(1/\epsilon^4)$, where $\epsilon$ denotes the desired precision level. Secondly, our FGDRO-KL algorithm is crafted to optimize KL regularized FGDRO, cutting communication complexity to $O(1/\epsilon^3)$. Lastly, we propose FGDRO-KL-Adam to utilize Adam-type local updates in FGDRO-KL, which not only maintains a communication cost of $O(1/\epsilon^3)$ but also shows potential to surpass SGD-type local steps in practical applications. The effectiveness of our algorithms has been demonstrated on a variety of real-world tasks, including natural language processing and computer vision.</description>

      <title>A Skewness-Based Criterion for Addressing Heteroscedastic Noise in Causal Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world data often violates the equal-variance assumption (homoscedasticity), making it essential to account for heteroscedastic noise in causal discovery. In this work, we explore heteroscedastic symmetric noise models (HSNMs), where the effect $Y$ is modeled as $Y = f(X) + \sigma(X)N$, with $X$ as the cause and $N$ as independent noise following a symmetric distribution. We introduce a novel criterion for identifying HSNMs based on the skewness of the score (i.e., the gradient of the log density) of the data distribution. This criterion establishes a computationally tractable measurement that is zero in the causal direction but nonzero in the anticausal direction, enabling the causal direction discovery. We extend this skewness-based criterion to the multivariate setting and propose SkewScore, an algorithm that handles heteroscedastic noise without requiring the extraction of exogenous noise. We also conduct a case study on the robustness of SkewScore in a bivariate model with a latent confounder, providing theoretical insights into its performance. Empirical studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: In this note we analyze the performance of a simple root-finding algorithm in uniform attachment trees. The leaf-stripping algorithm recursively removes all leaves of the tree for a carefully chosen number of rounds. We show that, with probability $1 - \epsilon$, the set of remaining vertices contains the root and has a size only depending on $\epsilon$ but not on the size of the tree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equity market dynamics are conventionally investigated in name space where stocks are indexed by company names. In contrast, by indexing stocks based on their ranks in capitalization, we gain a different perspective of market dynamics in rank space. Here, we demonstrate the superior performance of statistical arbitrage in rank space over name space, driven by a robust market representation and enhanced mean-reverting properties of residual returns in rank space. Our statistical arbitrage algorithm features an intraday rebalancing mechanism for effective conversion between portfolios in name and rank space. We explore statistical arbitrage with and without neural networks in both name and rank space and show that the portfolios obtained in rank space with neural networks significantly outperform those in name space.</description>

      <title>Efficient Weight-Space Laplace-Gaussian Filtering and Smoothing for Sequential Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiently learning a sequence of related tasks, such as in continual learning, poses a significant challenge for neural nets due to the delicate trade-off between catastrophic forgetting and loss of plasticity. We address this challenge with a grounded framework for sequentially learning related tasks based on Bayesian inference. Specifically, we treat the model's parameters as a nonlinear Gaussian state-space model and perform efficient inference using Gaussian filtering and smoothing. This general formalism subsumes existing continual learning approaches, while also offering a clearer conceptual understanding of its components. Leveraging Laplace approximations during filtering, we construct Gaussian posterior measures on the weight space of a neural network for each task. We use it as an efficient regularizer by exploiting the structure of the generalized Gauss-Newton matrix (GGN) to construct diagonal plus low-rank approximations. The dynamics model allows targeted control of the learning process and the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge, such as modeling the type of shift between tasks. Additionally, using Bayesian approximate smoothing can enhance the performance of task-specific models without needing to re-access any data.</description>

      <title>Mixing of the No-U-Turn Sampler and the Geometry of Gaussian Concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the mixing time of the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), when initialized in the concentration region of the canonical Gaussian measure, scales as $d^{1/4}$, up to logarithmic factors, where $d$ is the dimension. This scaling is expected to be sharp. This result is based on a coupling argument that leverages the geometric structure of the target distribution. Specifically, concentration of measure results in a striking uniformity in NUTS' locally adapted transitions, which holds with high probability. This uniformity is formalized by interpreting NUTS as an accept/reject Markov chain, where the mixing properties for the more uniform accept chain are analytically tractable. Additionally, our analysis uncovers a previously unnoticed issue with the path length adaptation procedure of NUTS, specifically related to looping behavior, which we address in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of diffusion models as neural density estimators. The current approach to this problem involves converting the generative process to a smooth flow, known as the Probability Flow ODE. The log density at a given sample can be obtained by solving the ODE with a black-box solver. We introduce a new, highly parallelizable method that computes log densities without the need to solve a flow. Our approach is based on estimating a path integral by Monte Carlo, in a manner identical to the simulation-free training of diffusion models. We also study how different training parameters affect the accuracy of the density calculation, and offer insights into how these models can be made more scalable and efficient.</description>

      <title>Efficient Distribution Matching of Representations via Noise-Injected Deep InfoMax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep InfoMax (DIM) is a well-established method for self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) based on maximization of the mutual information between the input and the output of a deep neural network encoder. Despite the DIM and contrastive SSRL in general being well-explored, the task of learning representations conforming to a specific distribution (i.e., distribution matching, DM) is still under-addressed. Motivated by the importance of DM to several downstream tasks (including generative modeling, disentanglement, outliers detection and other), we enhance DIM to enable automatic matching of learned representations to a selected prior distribution. To achieve this, we propose injecting an independent noise into the normalized outputs of the encoder, while keeping the same InfoMax training objective. We show that such modification allows for learning uniformly and normally distributed representations, as well as representations of other absolutely continuous distributions. Our approach is tested on various downstream tasks. The results indicate a moderate trade-off between the performance on the downstream tasks and quality of DM.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Estimators of Squared Calibration Errors in Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a mean-squared error-based risk that enables the comparison and optimization of estimators of squared calibration errors in practical settings. Improving the calibration of classifiers is crucial for enhancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of machine learning models, especially in sensitive decision-making scenarios. Although various calibration (error) estimators exist in the current literature, there is a lack of guidance on selecting the appropriate estimator and tuning its hyperparameters. By leveraging the bilinear structure of squared calibration errors, we reformulate calibration estimation as a regression problem with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) input pairs. This reformulation allows us to quantify the performance of different estimators even for the most challenging calibration criterion, known as canonical calibration. Our approach advocates for a training-validation-testing pipeline when estimating a calibration error on an evaluation dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline by optimizing existing calibration estimators and comparing them with novel kernel ridge regression-based estimators on standard image classification tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collusion is a complex phenomenon in which companies secretly collaborate to engage in fraudulent practices. This paper presents an innovative methodology for detecting and predicting collusion patterns in different national markets using neural networks (NNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). GNNs are particularly well suited to this task because they can exploit the inherent network structures present in collusion and many other economic problems. Our approach consists of two phases: In Phase I, we develop and train models on individual market datasets from Japan, the United States, two regions in Switzerland, Italy, and Brazil, focusing on predicting collusion in single markets. In Phase II, we extend the models' applicability through zero-shot learning, employing a transfer learning approach that can detect collusion in markets in which training data is unavailable. This phase also incorporates out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to evaluate the models' performance on unseen datasets from other countries and regions. In our empirical study, we show that GNNs outperform NNs in detecting complex collusive patterns. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on preventing collusion and optimizing detection methodologies, providing valuable guidance on the use of NNs and GNNs in economic applications to enhance market fairness and economic welfare.</description>

      <title>Causal Inference with Double/Debiased Machine Learning for Evaluating the Health Effects of Multiple Mismeasured Pollutants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One way to quantify exposure to air pollution and its constituents in epidemiologic studies is to use an individual's nearest monitor. This strategy results in potential inaccuracy in the actual personal exposure, introducing bias in estimating the health effects of air pollution and its constituents, especially when evaluating the causal effects of correlated multi-pollutant constituents measured with correlated error. This paper addresses estimation and inference for the causal effect of one constituent in the presence of other PM2.5 constituents, accounting for measurement error and correlations. We used a linear regression calibration model, fitted with generalized estimating equations in an external validation study, and extended a double/debiased machine learning (DML) approach to correct for measurement error and estimate the effect of interest in the main study. We demonstrated that the DML estimator with regression calibration is consistent and derived its asymptotic variance. Simulations showed that the proposed estimator reduced bias and attained nominal coverage probability across most simulation settings. We applied this method to assess the causal effects of PM2.5 constituents on cognitive function in the Nurses' Health Study and identified two PM2.5 constituents, Br and Mn, that showed a negative causal effect on cognitive function after measurement error correction.</description>

      <title>One Initialization to Rule them All: Fine-tuning via Explained Variance Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then fine-tuned on a downstream task for a specific application. The most successful and most commonly used fine-tuning method is to update the pre-trained weights via a low-rank adaptation (LoRA). LoRA introduces new weight matrices that are usually initialized at random with a uniform rank distribution across model weights. Recent works focus on weight-driven initialization or learning of adaptive ranks during training. Both approaches have only been investigated in isolation, resulting in slow convergence or a uniform rank distribution, in turn leading to sub-optimal performance. We propose to enhance LoRA by initializing the new weights in a data-driven manner by computing singular value decomposition on minibatches of activation vectors. Then, we initialize the LoRA matrices with the obtained right-singular vectors and re-distribute ranks among all weight matrices to explain the maximal amount of variance and continue the standard LoRA fine-tuning procedure. This results in our new method Explained Variance Adaptation (EVA). We apply EVA to a variety of fine-tuning tasks ranging from language generation and understanding to image classification and reinforcement learning. EVA exhibits faster convergence than competitors and attains the highest average score across a multitude of tasks per domain.</description>

Abstract: Iterative regularization is a classic idea in regularization theory, that has recently become popular in machine learning. On the one hand, it allows to design efficient algorithms controlling at the same time numerical and statistical accuracy. On the other hand it allows to shed light on the learning curves observed while training neural networks. In this paper, we focus on iterative regularization in the context of classification. After contrasting this setting with that of linear inverse problems, we develop an iterative regularization approach based on the use of the hinge loss function. More precisely we consider a diagonal approach for a family of algorithms for which we prove convergence as well as rates of convergence and stability results for a suitable classification noise model. Our approach compares favorably with other alternatives, as confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Gradient for Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization with Decoupled Evaluations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization aims to find the Pareto front of trade-offs between a set of expensive objectives while collecting as few samples as possible. In some cases, it is possible to evaluate the objectives separately, and a different latency or evaluation cost can be associated with each objective. This decoupling of the objectives presents an opportunity to learn the Pareto front faster by avoiding unnecessary, expensive evaluations. We propose a scalarization based knowledge gradient acquisition function which accounts for the different evaluation costs of the objectives. We prove asymptotic consistency of the estimator of the optimum for an arbitrary, D-dimensional, real compact search space and show empirically that the algorithm performs comparably with the state of the art and significantly outperforms versions which always evaluate both objectives.</description>

      <title>Error Reduction from Stacked Regressions</title>

Abstract: Stacking regressions is an ensemble technique that forms linear combinations of different regression estimators to enhance predictive accuracy. The conventional approach uses cross-validation data to generate predictions from the constituent estimators, and least-squares with nonnegativity constraints to learn the combination weights. In this paper, we learn these weights analogously by minimizing a regularized version of the empirical risk subject to a nonnegativity constraint. When the constituent estimators are linear least-squares projections onto nested subspaces separated by at least three dimensions, we show that thanks to an adaptive shrinkage effect, the resulting stacked estimator has strictly smaller population risk than best single estimator among them, with more significant gains when the signal-to-noise ratio is small. Here "best" refers to an estimator that minimizes a model selection criterion such as AIC or BIC. In other words, in this setting, the best single estimator is inadmissible. Because the optimization problem can be reformulated as isotonic regression, the stacked estimator requires the same order of computation as the best single estimator, making it an attractive alternative in terms of both performance and implementation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Interpretability and Generalizability in Extended Isolation Forests</title>

Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) focuses on identifying unusual behaviors in complex datasets. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and Decision Support Systems (DSSs) provide effective solutions for AD, but detecting anomalies alone may not be enough, especially in engineering, where diagnostics and maintenance are crucial. Users need clear explanations to support root cause analysis and build trust in the model. The unsupervised nature of AD, however, makes interpretability a challenge. This paper introduces Extended Isolation Forest Feature Importance (ExIFFI), a method that explains predictions made by Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) models, which split data using hyperplanes. ExIFFI provides explanations at both global and local levels by leveraging feature importance.
  We also present an improved version, Enhanced Extended Isolation Forest (EIF+), designed to enhance the model's ability to detect unseen anomalies through a revised splitting strategy. Using five synthetic and eleven real-world datasets, we conduct a comparative analysis, evaluating unsupervised AD methods with the Average Precision metric. EIF+ consistently outperforms EIF across all datasets when trained without anomalies, demonstrating better generalization.
  To assess ExIFFI's interpretability, we introduce the Area Under the Curve of Feature Selection (AUC\_FS), a novel metric using feature selection as a proxy task. ExIFFI outperforms other unsupervised interpretability methods on 8 of 11 real-world datasets and successfully identifies anomalous features in synthetic datasets. When trained only on inliers, ExIFFI also outperforms competing models on real-world data and accurately detects anomalous features in synthetic datasets. We provide open-source code to encourage further research and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Tilting the Odds at the Lottery: the Interplay of Overparameterisation and Curricula in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A wide range of empirical and theoretical works have shown that overparameterisation can amplify the performance of neural networks. According to the lottery ticket hypothesis, overparameterised networks have an increased chance of containing a sub-network that is well-initialised to solve the task at hand. A more parsimonious approach, inspired by animal learning, consists in guiding the learner towards solving the task by curating the order of the examples, i.e. providing a curriculum. However, this learning strategy seems to be hardly beneficial in deep learning applications. In this work, we undertake an analytical study that connects curriculum learning and overparameterisation. In particular, we investigate their interplay in the online learning setting for a 2-layer network in the XOR-like Gaussian Mixture problem. Our results show that a high degree of overparameterisation -- while simplifying the problem -- can limit the benefit from curricula, providing a theoretical account of the ineffectiveness of curricula in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Conformal Prediction with Approximate Conditional Validity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new method for generating prediction sets that combines the flexibility of conformal methods with an estimate of the conditional distribution $P_{Y \mid X}$. Existing methods, such as conformalized quantile regression and probabilistic conformal prediction, usually provide only a marginal coverage guarantee. In contrast, our approach extends these frameworks to achieve approximately conditional coverage, which is crucial for many practical applications. Our prediction sets adapt to the behavior of the predictive distribution, making them effective even under high heteroscedasticity. While exact conditional guarantees are infeasible without assumptions on the underlying data distribution, we derive non-asymptotic bounds that depend on the total variation distance of the conditional distribution and its estimate. Using extensive simulations, we show that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of conditional coverage, leading to more reliable statistical inference in a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Outlier Detection with Cluster Catch Digraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel family of outlier detection algorithms based on Cluster Catch Digraphs (CCDs), specifically tailored to address the challenges of high dimensionality and varying cluster shapes, which deteriorate the performance of most traditional outlier detection methods. We propose the Uniformity-Based CCD with Mutual Catch Graph (U-MCCD), the Uniformity- and Neighbor-Based CCD with Mutual Catch Graph (UN-MCCD), and their shape-adaptive variants (SU-MCCD and SUN-MCCD), which are designed to detect outliers in data sets with arbitrary cluster shapes and high dimensions. We present the advantages and shortcomings of these algorithms and provide the motivation or need to define each particular algorithm. Through comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations, we assess their performance and demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our algorithms across various settings and contamination levels. We also illustrate the use of our algorithms on various real-life data sets. The U-MCCD algorithm efficiently identifies outliers while maintaining high true negative rates, and the SU-MCCD algorithm shows substantial improvement in handling non-uniform clusters. Additionally, the UN-MCCD and SUN-MCCD algorithms address the limitations of existing methods in high-dimensional spaces by utilizing Nearest Neighbor Distances (NND) for clustering and outlier detection. Our results indicate that these novel algorithms offer substantial advancements in the accuracy and adaptability of outlier detection, providing a valuable tool for various real-world applications.

      <title>Asymmetry of the Relative Entropy in the Regularization of Empirical Risk Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of relative entropy asymmetry is analyzed in the context of empirical risk minimization (ERM) with relative entropy regularization (ERM-RER). Two regularizations are considered: $(a)$ the relative entropy of the measure to be optimized with respect to a reference measure (Type-I ERM-RER); or $(b)$ the relative entropy of the reference measure with respect to the measure to be optimized (Type-II ERM-RER). The main result is the characterization of the solution to the Type-II ERM-RER problem and its key properties. By comparing the well-understood Type-I ERM-RER with Type-II ERM-RER, the effects of entropy asymmetry are highlighted. The analysis shows that in both cases, regularization by relative entropy forces the solution's support to collapse into the support of the reference measure, introducing a strong inductive bias that can overshadow the evidence provided by the training data. Finally, it is shown that Type-II regularization is equivalent to Type-I regularization with an appropriate transformation of the empirical risk function.</description>

      <title>Nested Deep Learning Model Towards A Foundation Model for Brain Signal Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epilepsy affects over 50 million people globally, with EEG/MEG-based spike detection playing a crucial role in diagnosis and treatment. Manual spike identification is time-consuming and requires specialized training, limiting the number of professionals available to analyze EEG/MEG data. To address this, various algorithmic approaches have been developed. However, current methods face challenges in handling varying channel configurations and in identifying the specific channels where spikes originate. This paper introduces a novel Nested Deep Learning (NDL) framework designed to overcome these limitations. NDL applies a weighted combination of signals across all channels, ensuring adaptability to different channel setups, and allows clinicians to identify key channels more accurately. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real EEG/MEG datasets, NDL demonstrates superior accuracy in spike detection and channel localization compared to traditional methods. The results show that NDL improves prediction accuracy, supports cross-modality data integration, and can be fine-tuned for various neurophysiological applications.</description>

      <title>Conformal confidence sets for biomedical image segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop confidence sets which provide spatial uncertainty guarantees for the output of a black-box machine learning model designed for image segmentation. To do so we adapt conformal inference to the imaging setting, obtaining thresholds on a calibration dataset based on the distribution of the maximum of the transformed logit scores within and outside of the ground truth masks. We prove that these confidence sets, when applied to new predictions of the model, are guaranteed to contain the true unknown segmented mask with desired probability. We show that learning appropriate score transformations on a learning dataset before performing calibration is crucial for optimizing performance. We illustrate and validate our approach on a polpys tumor dataset. To do so we obtain the logit scores from a deep neural network trained for polpys segmentation and show that using distance transformed scores to obtain outer confidence sets and the original scores for inner confidence sets enables tight bounds on tumor location whilst controlling the false coverage rate.</description>

      <title>Reliable Part-of-Speech Tagging of Historical Corpora through Set-Valued Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.01377v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Syntactic annotation of corpora in the form of part-of-speech (POS) tags is a key requirement for both linguistic research and subsequent automated natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This problem is commonly tackled using machine learning methods, i.e., by training a POS tagger on a sufficiently large corpus of labeled data. While the problem of POS tagging can essentially be considered as solved for modern languages, historical corpora turn out to be much more difficult, especially due to the lack of native speakers and sparsity of training data. Moreover, most texts have no sentences as we know them today, nor a common orthography. These irregularities render the task of automated POS tagging more difficult and error-prone. Under these circumstances, instead of forcing the POS tagger to predict and commit to a single tag, it should be enabled to express its uncertainty. In this paper, we consider POS tagging within the framework of set-valued prediction, which allows the POS tagger to express its uncertainty via predicting a set of candidate POS tags instead of guessing a single one. The goal is to guarantee a high confidence that the correct POS tag is included while keeping the number of candidates small. In our experimental study, we find that extending state-of-the-art POS taggers to set-valued prediction yields more precise and robust taggings, especially for unknown words, i.e., words not occurring in the training data.</description>

      <title>Learning from a Biased Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The empirical risk minimization approach to data-driven decision making requires access to training data drawn under the same conditions as those that will be faced when the decision rule is deployed. However, in a number of settings, we may be concerned that our training sample is biased in the sense that some groups (characterized by either observable or unobservable attributes) may be under- or over-represented relative to the general population; and in this setting empirical risk minimization over the training set may fail to yield rules that perform well at deployment. We propose a model of sampling bias called conditional $\Gamma$-biased sampling, where observed covariates can affect the probability of sample selection arbitrarily much but the amount of unexplained variation in the probability of sample selection is bounded by a constant factor. Applying the distributionally robust optimization framework, we propose a method for learning a decision rule that minimizes the worst-case risk incurred under a family of test distributions that can generate the training distribution under $\Gamma$-biased sampling. We apply a result of Rockafellar and Uryasev to show that this problem is equivalent to an augmented convex risk minimization problem. We give statistical guarantees for learning a model that is robust to sampling bias via the method of sieves, and propose a deep learning algorithm whose loss function captures our robust learning target. We empirically validate our proposed method in a case study on prediction of mental health scores from health survey data and a case study on ICU length of stay prediction.</description>

      <title>Double Robust Bayesian Inference on Average Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16298v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a double robust Bayesian inference procedure on the average treatment effect (ATE) under unconfoundedness. For our new Bayesian approach, we first adjust the prior distributions of the conditional mean functions, and then correct the posterior distribution of the resulting ATE. Both adjustments make use of pilot estimators motivated by the semiparametric influence function for ATE estimation. We prove asymptotic equivalence of our Bayesian procedure and efficient frequentist ATE estimators by establishing a new semiparametric Bernstein-von Mises theorem under double robustness; i.e., the lack of smoothness of conditional mean functions can be compensated by high regularity of the propensity score and vice versa. Consequently, the resulting Bayesian credible sets form confidence intervals with asymptotically exact coverage probability. In simulations, our method provides precise point estimates of the ATE through the posterior mean and credible intervals that closely align with the nominal coverage probability. Furthermore, our approach achieves a shorter interval length in comparison to existing methods. We illustrate our method in an application to the National Supported Work Demonstration following LaLonde [1986] and Dehejia and Wahba [1999].</description>

      <title>A Bias-Accuracy-Privacy Trilemma for Statistical Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a rigorous notion of data privacy, used for private statistics. The canonical algorithm for differentially private mean estimation is to first clip the samples to a bounded range and then add noise to their empirical mean. Clipping controls the sensitivity and, hence, the variance of the noise that we add for privacy. But clipping also introduces statistical bias. This tradeoff is inherent: we prove that no algorithm can simultaneously have low bias, low error, and low privacy loss for arbitrary distributions.
  Additionally, we show that under strong notions of DP (i.e., pure or concentrated DP), unbiased mean estimation is impossible, even if we assume that the data is sampled from a Gaussian. On the positive side, we show that unbiased mean estimation is possible under a more permissive notion of differential privacy (approximate DP) if we assume that the distribution is symmetric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the initial work by Robbins, we rigorously present an extended theory of nonnegative supermartingales, requiring neither integrability nor finiteness. In particular, we derive a key maximal inequality foreshadowed by Robbins, which we call the extended Ville's inequality, that strengthens the classical Ville's inequality (for integrable nonnegative supermartingales), and also applies to our nonintegrable setting. We derive an extension of the method of mixtures, which applies to $\sigma$-finite mixtures of our extended nonnegative supermartingales. We present some implications of our theory for sequential statistics, such as the use of improper mixtures (priors) in deriving nonparametric confidence sequences and (extended) e-processes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Tsallis entropic regularized optimal transport in the continuous setting and establish fundamental results such as the $\Gamma$-convergence of the Tsallis regularized optimal transport to the Monge--Kantorovich problem as the regularization parameter tends to zero. In addition, using the quantization and shadow arguments developed by Eckstein--Nutz, we derive the convergence rate of the Tsallis entropic regularization and provide explicit constants. Furthermore, we compare these results with the well-known case of the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence regularization and show that the KL regularization achieves the fastest convergence rate in the Tsallis framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains where robustness against adversarial attacks is crucial and erroneous predictions could lead to potentially catastrophic consequences. This highlights the need for learning systems to be equipped with the means to determine a model's confidence in its prediction and the epistemic uncertainty associated with it, 'to know when a model does not know'. In this paper, we propose a novel Random-Set Neural Network (RS-NN) for classification. RS-NN predicts belief functions rather than probability vectors over a set of classes using the mathematics of random sets, i.e., distributions over the power set of the sample space. RS-NN encodes the 'epistemic' uncertainty induced in machine learning by limited training sets via the size of the credal sets associated with the predicted belief functions. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art Bayesian (LB-BNN, BNN-R) and Ensemble (ENN) methods in a classical evaluation setting in terms of performance, uncertainty estimation and out-of-distribution (OoD) detection on several benchmarks (CIFAR-10 vs SVHN/Intel-Image, MNIST vs FMNIST/KMNIST, ImageNet vs ImageNet-O) and scales effectively to large-scale architectures such as WideResNet-28-10, VGG16, Inception V3, EfficientNetB2, and ViT-Base.</description>

      <title>Outlier-Robust Neural Network Training: Efficient Optimization of Transformed Trimmed Loss with Variation Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we consider outlier-robust predictive modeling using highly-expressive neural networks. To this end, we employ (1) a transformed trimmed loss (TTL), which is a computationally feasible variant of the classical trimmed loss, and (2) a higher-order variation regularization (HOVR) of the prediction model. Note that using only TTL to train the neural network may possess outlier vulnerability, as its high expressive power causes it to overfit even the outliers perfectly. However, simultaneously introducing HOVR constrains the effective degrees of freedom, thereby avoiding fitting outliers. We newly provide an efficient stochastic algorithm for optimization and its theoretical convergence guarantee. (*Two authors contributed equally to this work.)</description>

      <title>Independent projections of diffusions: Gradient flows for variational inference and optimal mean field approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What is the optimal way to approximate a high-dimensional diffusion process by one in which the coordinates are independent? This paper presents a construction, called the \emph{independent projection}, which is optimal for two natural criteria. First, when the original diffusion is reversible with invariant measure $\rho_*$, the independent projection serves as the Wasserstein gradient flow for the relative entropy $H(\cdot\,|\,\rho_*)$ constrained to the space of product measures. This is related to recent Langevin-based sampling schemes proposed in the statistical literature on mean field variational inference. In addition, we provide both qualitative and quantitative results on the long-time convergence of the independent projection, with quantitative results in the log-concave case derived via a new variant of the logarithmic Sobolev inequality. Second, among all processes with independent coordinates, the independent projection is shown to exhibit the slowest growth rate of path-space entropy relative to the original diffusion. This sheds new light on the classical McKean-Vlasov equation and recent variants proposed for non-exchangeable systems, which can be viewed as special cases of the independent projection.</description>

      <title>Pessimistic Nonlinear Least-Squares Value Iteration for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL), where the agent aims to learn the optimal policy based on the data collected by a behavior policy, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. While offline RL with linear function approximation has been extensively studied with optimal results achieved under certain assumptions, many works shift their interest to offline RL with non-linear function approximation. However, limited works on offline RL with non-linear function approximation have instance-dependent regret guarantees. In this paper, we propose an oracle-efficient algorithm, dubbed Pessimistic Nonlinear Least-Square Value Iteration (PNLSVI), for offline RL with non-linear function approximation. Our algorithmic design comprises three innovative components: (1) a variance-based weighted regression scheme that can be applied to a wide range of function classes, (2) a subroutine for variance estimation, and (3) a planning phase that utilizes a pessimistic value iteration approach. Our algorithm enjoys a regret bound that has a tight dependency on the function class complexity and achieves minimax optimal instance-dependent regret when specialized to linear function approximation. Our work extends the previous instance-dependent results within simpler function classes, such as linear and differentiable function to a more general framework.</description>

      <title>A Stability Principle for Learning under Non-Stationarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a versatile framework for statistical learning in non-stationary environments. In each time period, our approach applies a stability principle to select a look-back window that maximizes the utilization of historical data while keeping the cumulative bias within an acceptable range relative to the stochastic error. Our theory and numerical experiments showcase the adaptivity of this approach to unknown non-stationarity. We prove regret bounds that are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors when the population losses are strongly convex, or Lipschitz only. At the heart of our analysis lie two novel components: a measure of similarity between functions and a segmentation technique for dividing the non-stationary data sequence into quasi-stationary pieces.</description>

      <title>LISBET: a machine learning model for the automatic segmentation of social behavior motifs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social behavior is crucial for survival in many animal species, and a heavily investigated research subject. Current analysis methods generally rely on measuring animal interaction time or annotating predefined behaviors. However, these approaches are time consuming, human biased, and can fail to capture subtle behaviors. Here we introduce LISBET (LISBET Is a Social BEhavior Transformer), a machine learning model for detecting and segmenting social interactions. Using self-supervised learning on body tracking data, our model eliminates the need for extensive human annotation. We tested LISBET in three scenarios across multiple datasets in mice: supervised behavior classification, unsupervised motifs segmentation, and unsupervised animal phenotyping. Additionally, in vivo electrophysiology revealed distinct neural signatures in the Ventral Tegmental Area corresponding to motifs identified by our model. In summary, LISBET automates data annotation and reduces human bias in social behavior research, offering a promising approach to enhance our understanding of behavior and its neural correlates.</description>

      <title>A Poincar\'e Inequality and Consistency Results for Signal Sampling on Large Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale graph machine learning is challenging as the complexity of learning models scales with the graph size. Subsampling the graph is a viable alternative, but sampling on graphs is nontrivial as graphs are non-Euclidean. Existing graph sampling techniques require not only computing the spectra of large matrices but also repeating these computations when the graph changes, e.g., grows. In this paper, we introduce a signal sampling theory for a type of graph limit -- the graphon. We prove a Poincar\'e inequality for graphon signals and show that complements of node subsets satisfying this inequality are unique sampling sets for Paley-Wiener spaces of graphon signals. Exploiting connections with spectral clustering and Gaussian elimination, we prove that such sampling sets are consistent in the sense that unique sampling sets on a convergent graph sequence converge to unique sampling sets on the graphon. We then propose a related graphon signal sampling algorithm for large graphs, and demonstrate its good empirical performance on graph machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>On diffusion-based generative models and their error bounds: The log-concave case with full convergence estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13584v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide full theoretical guarantees for the convergence behaviour of diffusion-based generative models under the assumption of strongly log-concave data distributions while our approximating class of functions used for score estimation is made of Lipschitz continuous functions avoiding any Lipschitzness assumption on the score function. We demonstrate via a motivating example, sampling from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean, the powerfulness of our approach. In this case, explicit estimates are provided for the associated optimization problem, i.e. score approximation, while these are combined with the corresponding sampling estimates. As a result, we obtain the best known upper bound estimates in terms of key quantities of interest, such as the dimension and rates of convergence, for the Wasserstein-2 distance between the data distribution (Gaussian with unknown mean) and our sampling algorithm.
  Beyond the motivating example and in order to allow for the use of a diverse range of stochastic optimizers, we present our results using an $L^2$-accurate score estimation assumption, which crucially is formed under an expectation with respect to the stochastic optimizer and our novel auxiliary process that uses only known information. This approach yields the best known convergence rate for our sampling algorithm.</description>

      <title>Standard Gaussian Process Can Be Excellent for High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02746v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A longstanding belief holds that Bayesian Optimization (BO) with standard Gaussian processes (GP) -- referred to as standard BO -- underperforms in high-dimensional optimization problems. While this belief seems plausible, it lacks both robust empirical evidence and theoretical justification. To address this gap, we present a systematic investigation. First, through a comprehensive evaluation across eleven widely used benchmarks, we found that while the popular Square Exponential (SE) kernel often leads to poor performance, using Matern kernels enables standard BO to consistently achieve top-tier results, frequently surpassing methods specifically designed for high-dimensional optimization. Second, our theoretical analysis reveals that the SE kernels failure primarily stems from improper initialization of the length-scale parameters, which are commonly used in practice but can cause gradient vanishing in training. We provide a probabilistic bound to characterize this issue, showing that Matern kernels are less susceptible and can robustly handle much higher dimensions. Third, we propose a simple robust initialization strategy that dramatically improves the performance of the SE kernel, bringing it close to state of the art methods, without requiring any additional priors or regularization. We prove another probabilistic bound that demonstrates how the gradient vanishing issue can be effectively mitigated with our method. Our findings advocate for a re-evaluation of standard BOs potential in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>An analysis of the noise schedule for score-based generative models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) aim at estimating a target data distribution by learning score functions using only noise-perturbed samples from the target.Recent literature has focused extensively on assessing the error between the target and estimated distributions, gauging the generative quality through the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and Wasserstein distances.  Under mild assumptions on the data distribution, we establish an upper bound for the KL divergence between the target and the estimated distributions, explicitly depending on any time-dependent noise schedule. Under additional regularity assumptions, taking advantage of favorable underlying contraction mechanisms, we provide a tighter error bound in Wasserstein distance compared to state-of-the-art results. In addition to being tractable, this upper bound jointly incorporates properties of the target distribution and SGM hyperparameters that need to be tuned during training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address private deep offline reinforcement learning (RL), where the goal is to train a policy on standard control tasks that is differentially private (DP) with respect to individual trajectories in the dataset. To achieve this, we introduce PriMORL, a model-based RL algorithm with formal differential privacy guarantees. PriMORL first learns an ensemble of trajectory-level DP models of the environment from offline data. It then optimizes a policy on the penalized private model, without any further interaction with the system or access to the dataset. In addition to offering strong theoretical foundations, we demonstrate empirically that PriMORL enables the training of private RL agents on offline continuous control tasks with deep function approximations, whereas current methods are limited to simpler tabular and linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We furthermore outline the trade-offs involved in achieving privacy in this setting.</description>

      <title>Average gradient outer product as a mechanism for deep neural collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13728v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Collapse (DNC) refers to the surprisingly rigid structure of the data representations in the final layers of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Though the phenomenon has been measured in a variety of settings, its emergence is typically explained via data-agnostic approaches, such as the unconstrained features model. In this work, we introduce a data-dependent setting where DNC forms due to feature learning through the average gradient outer product (AGOP). The AGOP is defined with respect to a learned predictor and is equal to the uncentered covariance matrix of its input-output gradients averaged over the training dataset. The Deep Recursive Feature Machine (Deep RFM) is a method that constructs a neural network by iteratively mapping the data with the AGOP and applying an untrained random feature map. We demonstrate empirically that DNC occurs in Deep RFM across standard settings as a consequence of the projection with the AGOP matrix computed at each layer. Further, we theoretically explain DNC in Deep RFM in an asymptotic setting and as a result of kernel learning. We then provide evidence that this mechanism holds for neural networks more generally. In particular, we show that the right singular vectors and values of the weights can be responsible for the majority of within-class variability collapse for DNNs trained in the feature learning regime. As observed in recent work, this singular structure is highly correlated with that of the AGOP.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein: A Scalable Metric for Heterogeneous Joint Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sliced Wasserstein (SW) and Generalized Sliced Wasserstein (GSW) have been widely used in applications due to their computational and statistical scalability. However, the SW and the GSW are only defined between distributions supported on a homogeneous domain. This limitation prevents their usage in applications with heterogeneous joint distributions with marginal distributions supported on multiple different domains. Using SW and GSW directly on the joint domains cannot make a meaningful comparison since their homogeneous slicing operator i.e., Radon Transform (RT) and Generalized Radon Transform (GRT) are not expressive enough to capture the structure of the joint supports set. To address the issue, we propose two new slicing operators i.e., Partial Generalized Radon Transform (PGRT) and Hierarchical Hybrid Radon Transform (HHRT). In greater detail, PGRT is the generalization of Partial Radon Transform (PRT), which transforms a subset of function arguments non-linearly while HHRT is the composition of PRT and multiple domain-specific PGRT on marginal domain arguments. By using HHRT, we extend the SW into Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein (H2SW) distance which is designed specifically for comparing heterogeneous joint distributions. We then discuss the topological, statistical, and computational properties of H2SW. Finally, we demonstrate the favorable performance of H2SW in 3D mesh deformation, deep 3D mesh autoencoders, and datasets comparison.</description>

      <title>The lazy (NTK) and rich ($\mu$P) regimes: a gentle tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central theme of the modern machine learning paradigm is that larger neural networks achieve better performance on a variety of metrics. Theoretical analyses of these overparameterized models have recently centered around studying very wide neural networks. In this tutorial, we provide a nonrigorous but illustrative derivation of the following fact: in order to train wide networks effectively, there is only one degree of freedom in choosing hyperparameters such as the learning rate and the size of the initial weights. This degree of freedom controls the richness of training behavior: at minimum, the wide network trains lazily like a kernel machine, and at maximum, it exhibits feature learning in the active $\mu$P regime. In this paper, we explain this richness scale, synthesize recent research results into a coherent whole, offer new perspectives and intuitions, and provide empirical evidence supporting our claims. In doing so, we hope to encourage further study of the richness scale, as it may be key to developing a scientific theory of feature learning in practical deep neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network scientists often use complex dynamic processes to describe network contagions, but tools for fitting contagion models typically assume simple dynamics. Here, we address this gap by developing a nonparametric method to reconstruct a network and dynamics from a series of node states, using a model that breaks the dichotomy between simple pairwise and complex neighborhood-based contagions. We then show that a network is more easily reconstructed when observed through the lens of complex contagions if it is dense or the dynamic saturates, and that simple contagions are better otherwise.</description>

      <title>ROSE: Register Assisted General Time Series Forecasting with Decomposed Frequency Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing collection of time series data from various domains, there arises a strong demand for general time series forecasting models pre-trained on a large number of time-series datasets to support a variety of downstream prediction tasks. Enabling general time series forecasting faces two challenges: how to obtain unified representations from multi-domian time series data, and how to capture domain-specific features from time series data across various domains for adaptive transfer in downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a Register Assisted General Time Series Forecasting Model with Decomposed Frequency Learning (ROSE), a novel pre-trained model for time series forecasting. ROSE employs Decomposed Frequency Learning for the pre-training task, which decomposes coupled semantic and periodic information in time series with frequency-based masking and reconstruction to obtain unified representations across domains. We also equip ROSE with a Time Series Register, which learns to generate a register codebook to capture domain-specific representations during pre-training and enhances domain-adaptive transfer by selecting related register tokens on downstream tasks. After pre-training on large-scale time series data, ROSE achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance on 8 real-world benchmarks. Remarkably, even in few-shot scenarios, it demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods trained with full data.</description>

      <title>Posterior Sampling via Autoregressive Generation</title>

Abstract: Real-world decision-making requires grappling with a perpetual lack of data as environments change; intelligent agents must comprehend uncertainty and actively gather information to resolve it. We propose a new framework for learning bandit algorithms from massive historical data, which we demonstrate in a cold-start recommendation problem. First, we use historical data to pretrain an autoregressive model to predict a sequence of repeated feedback/rewards (e.g., responses to news articles shown to different users over time). In learning to make accurate predictions, the model implicitly learns an informed prior based on rich action features (e.g., article headlines) and how to sharpen beliefs as more rewards are gathered (e.g., clicks as each article is recommended). At decision-time, we autoregressively sample (impute) an imagined sequence of rewards for each action, and choose the action with the largest average imputed reward. Far from a heuristic, our approach is an implementation of Thompson sampling (with a learned prior), a prominent active exploration algorithm. We prove our pretraining loss directly controls online decision-making performance, and we demonstrate our framework on a news recommendation task where we integrate end-to-end fine-tuning of a pretrained language model to process news article headline text to improve performance.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Deep Kernel Learning of Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital twins require computationally-efficient reduced-order models (ROMs) that can accurately describe complex dynamics of physical assets. However, constructing ROMs from noisy high-dimensional data is challenging. In this work, we propose a data-driven, non-intrusive method that utilizes stochastic variational deep kernel learning (SVDKL) to discover low-dimensional latent spaces from data and a recurrent version of SVDKL for representing and predicting the evolution of latent dynamics. The proposed method is demonstrated with two challenging examples -- a double pendulum and a reaction-diffusion system. Results show that our framework is capable of (i) denoising and reconstructing measurements, (ii) learning compact representations of system states, (iii) predicting system evolution in low-dimensional latent spaces, and (iv) quantifying modeling uncertainties.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Categorical and Hierarchical Concepts in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis is the informal idea that semantic concepts are encoded as linear directions in the representation spaces of large language models (LLMs). Previous work has shown how to make this notion precise for representing binary concepts that have natural contrasts (e.g., {male, female}) as directions in representation space. However, many natural concepts do not have natural contrasts (e.g., whether the output is about an animal). In this work, we show how to extend the formalization of the linear representation hypothesis to represent features (e.g., is_animal) as vectors. This allows us to immediately formalize the representation of categorical concepts as polytopes in the representation space. Further, we use the formalization to prove a relationship between the hierarchical structure of concepts and the geometry of their representations. We validate these theoretical results on the Gemma and LLaMA-3 large language models, estimating representations for 900+ hierarchically related concepts using data from WordNet.</description>

      <title>Selecting the Number of Communities for Weighted Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how to select the number of communities for weighted networks without a full likelihood modeling. First, we propose a novel weighted degree-corrected stochastic block model (DCSBM), in which the mean adjacency matrix is modeled as the same as in standard DCSBM, while the variance profile matrix is assumed to be related to the mean adjacency matrix through a given variance function. Our method of selecting the number of communities is based on a sequential testing framework, and in each step the weighted DCSBM is fitted via some spectral clustering method. A key step is to carry out matrix scaling on the estimated variance profile matrix. The resulting scaling factors can be used to normalize the adjacency matrix, from which the testing statistic is obtained. Under mild conditions on the weighted DCSBM, our proposed procedure is shown to be consistent in estimating the true number of communities. Numerical experiments on both simulated and real-world network data also demonstrate the desirable empirical properties of our method.</description>

      <title>How Far Can Transformers Reason? The Globality Barrier and Inductive Scratchpad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can Transformers predict new syllogisms by composing established ones? More generally, what type of targets can be learned by such models from scratch? Recent works show that Transformers can be Turing-complete in terms of expressivity, but this does not address the learnability objective. This paper puts forward the notion of 'globality degree' of a target distribution to capture when weak learning is efficiently achievable by regular Transformers, where the latter measures the least number of tokens required in addition to the tokens histogram to correlate nontrivially with the target. As shown experimentally and theoretically under additional assumptions, distributions with high globality cannot be learned efficiently. In particular, syllogisms cannot be composed on long chains. Furthermore, we show that (i) an agnostic scratchpad cannot help to break the globality barrier, (ii) an educated scratchpad can help if it breaks the globality at each step, however not all such scratchpads can generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, (iii) a notion of 'inductive scratchpad', that composes the prior information more efficiently, can both break the globality barrier and improve the OOD generalization. In particular, some inductive scratchpads can achieve length generalizations of up to 6x for some arithmetic tasks depending on the input formatting.</description>

      <title>Schur's Positive-Definite Network: Deep Learning in the SPD cone with structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating matrices in the symmetric positive-definite (SPD) cone is of interest for many applications ranging from computer vision to graph learning. While there exist various convex optimization-based estimators, they remain limited in expressivity due to their model-based approach. The success of deep learning motivates the use of learning-based approaches to estimate SPD matrices with neural networks in a data-driven fashion. However, designing effective neural architectures for SPD learning is challenging, particularly when the task requires additional structural constraints, such as element-wise sparsity. Current approaches either do not ensure that the output meets all desired properties or lack expressivity. In this paper, we introduce SpodNet, a novel and generic learning module that guarantees SPD outputs and supports additional structural constraints. Notably, it solves the challenging task of learning jointly SPD and sparse matrices. Our experiments illustrate the versatility and relevance of SpodNet layers for such applications.</description>

      <title>What is the long-run distribution of stochastic gradient descent? A large deviations analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the long-run distribution of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in general, non-convex problems. Specifically, we seek to understand which regions of the problem's state space are more likely to be visited by SGD, and by how much. Using an approach based on the theory of large deviations and randomly perturbed dynamical systems, we show that the long-run distribution of SGD resembles the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution of equilibrium thermodynamics with temperature equal to the method's step-size and energy levels determined by the problem's objective and the statistics of the noise. In particular, we show that, in the long run, (a) the problem's critical region is visited exponentially more often than any non-critical region; (b) the iterates of SGD are exponentially concentrated around the problem's minimum energy state (which does not always coincide with the global minimum of the objective); (c) all other connected components of critical points are visited with frequency that is exponentially proportional to their energy level; and, finally (d) any component of local maximizers or saddle points is "dominated" by a component of local minimizers which is visited exponentially more often.</description>

      <title>Directly Handling Missing Data in Linear Discriminant Analysis for Enhancing Classification Accuracy and Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models expands into critical real-world applications, ensuring the explainability of these models becomes paramount, particularly in sensitive fields such as medicine and finance. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) remains a popular choice for classification due to its interpretable nature, derived from its capacity to model class distributions and enhance class separation through linear combinations of features. However, real-world datasets often suffer from incomplete data, posing substantial challenges for both classification accuracy and model interpretability. In this paper, we introduce a novel and robust classification method, termed Weighted missing Linear Discriminant Analysis (WLDA), which extends LDA to handle datasets with missing values without the need for imputation. Our approach innovatively incorporates a weight matrix that penalizes missing entries, thereby refining parameter estimation directly on incomplete data. This methodology not only preserves the interpretability of LDA but also significantly enhances classification performance in scenarios plagued by missing data. We conduct an in-depth theoretical analysis to establish the properties of WLDA and thoroughly evaluate its explainability. Experimental results across various datasets demonstrate that WLDA consistently outperforms traditional methods, especially in challenging environments where missing values are prevalent in both training and test datasets. This advancement provides a critical tool for improving classification accuracy and maintaining model transparency in the face of incomplete data.</description>

      <title>Learning Noise-Robust Stable Koopman Operator for Control with Hankel DMD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06607v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a noise-robust learning framework for the Koopman operator of nonlinear dynamical systems, ensuring long-term stability and robustness to noise. Unlike some existing approaches that rely on ad-hoc observables or black-box neural networks in extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD), our framework leverages observables generated by the system dynamics through a Hankel matrix, which shares similarities with discrete Polyflow. To enhance noise robustness and ensure long-term stability, we developed a stable parameterization of the Koopman operator, along with a progressive learning strategy for roll-out recurrent loss. To further improve model performance in the phase space, a simple iterative strategy of data augmentation was developed. Numerical experiments of prediction and control of classic nonlinear systems with ablation study showed the effectiveness of the proposed techniques over several state-of-the-art practices.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Performance Study on Solving Oscillator ODEs via Soft-constrained Physics-informed Neural Network with Small Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11077v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper compared physics-informed neural network (PINN), conventional neural network (NN) and traditional numerical discretization methods on solving differential equations (DEs) through literature investigation and experimental validation. We focused on the soft-constrained PINN approach and formalized its mathematical framework and computational flow for solving Ordinary DEs and Partial DEs (ODEs/PDEs). The working mechanism and its accuracy and efficiency were experimentally verified by solving typical linear and non-linear oscillator ODEs. We demonstrate that the DeepXDE-based implementation of PINN is not only light code and efficient in training, but also flexible across CPU/GPU platforms. PINN greatly reduces the need for labeled data: when the nonlinearity of the ODE is weak, a very small amount of supervised training data plus a few unsupervised collocation points are sufficient to predict the solution; in the minimalist case, only one or two training points (with initial values) are needed for first- or second-order ODEs, respectively. We also find that, with the aid of collocation points and the use of physical information, PINN has the ability to extrapolate data outside the time domain of the training set, and especially is robust to noisy data, thus with enhanced generalization capabilities. Training is accelerated when the gains obtained along with the reduction in the amount of data outweigh the delay caused by the increase in the loss function terms. The soft-constrained PINN can easily impose a physical law (e.g., conservation of energy) constraint by adding a regularization term to the total loss function, thus improving the solution performance to ODEs that obey this physical law. Furthermore, PINN can also be used for stiff ODEs, PDEs, and other types of DEs, and is becoming a favorable catalyst for the era of Digital Twins.</description>

      <title>RoCP-GNN: Robust Conformal Prediction for Graph Neural Networks in Node-Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for predicting outcomes in graph-structured data. However, a notable limitation of GNNs is their inability to provide robust uncertainty estimates, which undermines their reliability in contexts where errors are costly. One way to address this issue is by providing prediction sets that contain the true label with a predefined probability margin. Our approach builds upon conformal prediction (CP), a framework that promises to construct statistically robust prediction sets or intervals. There are two primary challenges: first, given dependent data like graphs, it is unclear whether the critical assumption in CP - exchangeability - still holds when applied to node classification. Second, even if the exchangeability assumption is valid for conformalized link prediction, we need to ensure high efficiency, i.e., the resulting prediction set or the interval length is small enough to provide useful information. In this article, we propose a novel approach termed Robust Conformal Prediction for GNNs (RoCP-GNN), which integrates conformal prediction (CP) directly into the GNN training process. This method generates prediction sets, instead of just point predictions, that are valid at a user-defined confidence level, assuming only exchangeability. Our approach robustly predicts outcomes with any predictive GNN model while quantifying the uncertainty in predictions within the realm of graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL). Experimental results demonstrate that GNN models with size loss provide a statistically significant increase in performance. We validate our approach on standard graph benchmark datasets by coupling it with various state-of-the-art GNNs in node classification. The code will be made available after publication.</description>

      <title>ESG Rating Disagreement and Corporate Total Factor Productivity:Inference and Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines how ESG rating disagreement (Dis) affects corporate total factor productivity (TFP) in China based on data of A-share listed companies from 2015 to 2022. We find that Dis reduces TFP, especially in state-owned, non-capital-intensive, and low-pollution firms. Mechanism analysis shows that green innovation strengthens the dampening effect of Dis on TFP, and that Dis lowers corporate TFP by increasing financing constraints. Furthermore, XGBoost regression demonstrates that Dis plays a significant role in predicting TFP, with SHAP showing that the dampening effect of ESG rating disagreement on TFP is still pronounced in firms with large Dis values.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Curse of Multiagency in Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are vulnerable to sim-to-real gaps. To address this, distributionally robust Markov games (RMGs) have been proposed to enhance robustness in MARL by optimizing the worst-case performance when game dynamics shift within a prescribed uncertainty set. Solving RMGs remains under-explored, from problem formulation to the development of sample-efficient algorithms. A notorious yet open challenge is if RMGs can escape the curse of multiagency, where the sample complexity scales exponentially with the number of agents. In this work, we propose a natural class of RMGs where the uncertainty set of each agent is shaped by both the environment and other agents' strategies in a best-response manner. We first establish the well-posedness of these RMGs by proving the existence of game-theoretic solutions such as robust Nash equilibria and coarse correlated equilibria (CCE). Assuming access to a generative model, we then introduce a sample-efficient algorithm for learning the CCE whose sample complexity scales polynomially with all relevant parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to break the curse of multiagency for RMGs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Graph Self-Supervised Learning with Graph Interplay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning (GSSL) has emerged as a compelling framework for extracting informative representations from graph-structured data without extensive reliance on labeled inputs. In this study, we introduce Graph Interplay (GIP), an innovative and versatile approach that significantly enhances the performance equipped with various existing GSSL methods. To this end, GIP advocates direct graph-level communications by introducing random inter-graph edges within standard batches. Against GIP's simplicity, we further theoretically show that \textsc{GIP} essentially performs a principled manifold separation via combining inter-graph message passing and GSSL, bringing about more structured embedding manifolds and thus benefits a series of downstream tasks. Our empirical study demonstrates that GIP surpasses the performance of prevailing GSSL methods across multiple benchmarks by significant margins, highlighting its potential as a breakthrough approach. Besides, GIP can be readily integrated into a series of GSSL methods and consistently offers additional performance gain. This advancement not only amplifies the capability of GSSL but also potentially sets the stage for a novel graph learning paradigm in a broader sense.</description>

      <title>The Optimization Landscape of SGD Across the Feature Learning Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider neural networks (NNs) where the final layer is down-scaled by a fixed hyperparameter $\gamma$. Recent work has identified $\gamma$ as controlling the strength of feature learning. As $\gamma$ increases, network evolution changes from "lazy" kernel dynamics to "rich" feature-learning dynamics, with a host of associated benefits including improved performance on common tasks. In this work, we conduct a thorough empirical investigation of the effect of scaling $\gamma$ across a variety of models and datasets in the online training setting. We first examine the interaction of $\gamma$ with the learning rate $\eta$, identifying several scaling regimes in the $\gamma$-$\eta$ plane which we explain theoretically using a simple model. We find that the optimal learning rate $\eta^*$ scales non-trivially with $\gamma$. In particular, $\eta^* \propto \gamma^2$ when $\gamma \ll 1$ and $\eta^* \propto \gamma^{2/L}$ when $\gamma \gg 1$ for a feed-forward network of depth $L$. Using this optimal learning rate scaling, we proceed with an empirical study of the under-explored "ultra-rich" $\gamma \gg 1$ regime. We find that networks in this regime display characteristic loss curves, starting with a long plateau followed by a drop-off, sometimes followed by one or more additional staircase steps. We find networks of different large $\gamma$ values optimize along similar trajectories up to a reparameterization of time. We further find that optimal online performance is often found at large $\gamma$ and could be missed if this hyperparameter is not tuned. Our findings indicate that analytical study of the large-$\gamma$ limit may yield useful insights into the dynamics of representation learning in performant models.</description>

      <title>Graph Fourier Neural Kernels (G-FuNK): Learning Solutions of Nonlinear Diffusive Parametric PDEs on Multiple Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting time-dependent dynamics of complex systems governed by non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) with varying parameters and domains is a challenging task motivated by applications across various fields. We introduce a novel family of neural operators based on our Graph Fourier Neural Kernels, designed to learn solution generators for nonlinear PDEs in which the highest-order term is diffusive, across multiple domains and parameters. G-FuNK combines components that are parameter- and domain-adapted with others that are not. The domain-adapted components are constructed using a weighted graph on the discretized domain, where the graph Laplacian approximates the highest-order diffusive term, ensuring boundary condition compliance and capturing the parameter and domain-specific behavior. Meanwhile, the learned components transfer across domains and parameters using our variant Fourier Neural Operators. This approach naturally embeds geometric and directional information, improving generalization to new test domains without need for retraining the network. To handle temporal dynamics, our method incorporates an integrated ODE solver to predict the evolution of the system. Experiments show G-FuNK's capability to accurately approximate heat, reaction diffusion, and cardiac electrophysiology equations across various geometries and anisotropic diffusivity fields. G-FuNK achieves low relative errors on unseen domains and fiber fields, significantly accelerating predictions compared to traditional finite-element solvers.</description>

      <title>Strong Model Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the scaling laws paradigm, which underpins the training of large neural networks like ChatGPT and Llama, we consider a supervised regression setting and establish the existance of a strong form of the model collapse phenomenon, a critical performance degradation due to synthetic data in the training corpus. Our results show that even the smallest fraction of synthetic data (e.g., as little as 1\% of the total training dataset) can still lead to model collapse: larger and larger training sets do not enhance performance. We further investigate whether increasing model size, an approach aligned with current trends in training large language models, exacerbates or mitigates model collapse. In a simplified regime where neural networks are approximated via random projections of tunable size, we both theoretically and empirically show that larger models can amplify model collapse. Interestingly, our theory also indicates that, beyond the interpolation threshold (which can be extremely high for very large datasets), larger models may mitigate the collapse, although they do not entirely prevent it. Our theoretical findings are empirically verified through experiments on language models and feed-forward neural networks for images.</description>

      <title>Failure-Proof Non-Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify sufficient conditions to avoid known failure modes, including representation, dimensional, cluster and intracluster collapses, occurring in non-contrastive self-supervised learning. Based on these findings, we propose a principled design for the projector and loss function. We theoretically demonstrate that this design introduces an inductive bias that promotes learning representations that are both decorrelated and clustered without explicit enforcing these properties and leading to improved generalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solution that achieves robust training with respect to these failure modes while guaranteeing enhanced generalization performance in downstream tasks. We validate our theoretical findings on image datasets including SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet-100, and show that our solution, dubbed FALCON, outperforms existing feature decorrelation and cluster-based self-supervised learning methods in terms of generalization to clustering and linear classification tasks.</description>

      <title>FreSh: Frequency Shifting for Accelerated Neural Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently gained attention as a powerful approach for continuously representing signals such as images, videos, and 3D shapes using multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). However, MLPs are known to exhibit a low-frequency bias, limiting their ability to capture high-frequency details accurately. This limitation is typically addressed by incorporating high-frequency input embeddings or specialized activation layers. In this work, we demonstrate that these embeddings and activations are often configured with hyperparameters that perform well on average but are suboptimal for specific input signals under consideration, necessitating a costly grid search to identify optimal settings. Our key observation is that the initial frequency spectrum of an untrained model's output correlates strongly with the model's eventual performance on a given target signal. Leveraging this insight, we propose frequency shifting (or FreSh), a method that selects embedding hyperparameters to align the frequency spectrum of the model's initial output with that of the target signal. We show that this simple initialization technique improves performance across various neural representation methods and tasks, achieving results comparable to extensive hyperparameter sweeps but with only marginal computational overhead compared to training a single model with default hyperparameters.</description>

      <title>Tuning-Free Bilevel Optimization: New Algorithms and Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization has recently attracted considerable attention due to its abundant applications in machine learning problems. However, existing methods rely on prior knowledge of problem parameters to determine stepsizes, resulting in significant effort in tuning stepsizes when these parameters are unknown. In this paper, we propose two novel tuning-free algorithms, D-TFBO and S-TFBO. D-TFBO employs a double-loop structure with stepsizes adaptively adjusted by the "inverse of cumulative gradient norms" strategy. S-TFBO features a simpler fully single-loop structure that updates three variables simultaneously with a theory-motivated joint design of adaptive stepsizes for all variables. We provide a comprehensive convergence analysis for both algorithms and show that D-TFBO and S-TFBO respectively require $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ and $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\log^4(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ iterations to find an $\epsilon$-accurate stationary point, (nearly) matching their well-tuned counterparts using the information of problem parameters. Experiments on various problems show that our methods achieve performance comparable to existing well-tuned approaches, while being more robust to the selection of initial stepsizes. To the best of our knowledge, our methods are the first to completely eliminate the need for stepsize tuning, while achieving theoretical guarantees.</description>
