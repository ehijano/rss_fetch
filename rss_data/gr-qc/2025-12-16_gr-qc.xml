      <title>Dynamical Systems Analysis of an Einstein-Cartan Ekpyrotic Nonsingular Bounce Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I construct an Einstein-Cartan ekpyrotic model (ECEM): a homogeneous, nearly Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background in Einstein-Cartan (EC) gravity whose spin-torsion sector, modeled phenomenologically as a Weyssenhoff fluid with stiff scaling $\propto a^{-6}$, is coupled to a scalar field with a steep exponential potential that interpolates between a negative ekpyrotic branch and a positive plateau. Extending the Copeland-Liddle-Wands (CLW) scalar-fluid dynamical system to a six-dimensional phase space including shear, curvature, and spin-torsion, I recast the equations in a compact deceleration-parameter form, compute the full Jacobian, and evaluate maximal Lyapunov exponents. Numerical solutions show that the ekpyrotic branch ($w_\phi\gg1$) exponentially damps homogeneous shear, while the softened branch ($w_\phi&lt;1$) allows $\rho_s$ to overtake the scalar during contraction and trigger a torsion-supported bounce at high but finite densities where the EC spin-torsion term becomes dynamically dominant. Scans in a two-parameter softening plane $(\phi_{\rm b},\Delta)$ identify a finite region of nonsingular trajectories and quantify the required tuning; in the parameter ranges explored the maximal Lyapunov exponent on the constrained phase space is negative, giving no indication of chaotic behavior in this homogeneous truncation even when the usual curvature mode that destabilizes contracting General Relativity (GR) backgrounds is included. The construction is purely phenomenological and confined to homogeneous backgrounds: it does not address entropy accumulation, the cosmological arrow of time, or a complete cyclic cosmology.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiations from periodic orbits around a black hole in the effective field theory extension of general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of periodic orbits in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals is essential for understanding the dynamics of small bodies orbiting supermassive black holes. In this paper, we study the periodic orbits and their corresponding gravitational wave emissions within the framework of an effective field theory-based extension of general relativity (EFTGR), which incorporates higher-order curvature terms into the Einstein-Hilbert action. We start with a brief analysis of the modified black hole spacetime in EFTGR and examine how its parameters influence the dynamics of a massive neutral particle using the Lagrangian formalism. Focusing on the impact of the higher-order curvature terms in EFTGR, we examine the properties of periodic orbits, which are characterized by three topological integers $(z, w, v)$ that uniquely classify their trajectories. By analyzing these orbits within EFTGR, we aim to provide new insights into how strong-field deviations from general relativity may manifest in observable phenomena. We then calculate the gravitational waveforms generated by these periodic orbits, identifying potential observational signatures. Our analysis reveals a direct connection between the zoom-whirl orbital behavior of the small compact object and the gravitational waveforms it emits: higher zoom numbers lead to increasingly intricate waveform substructures. The results contribute to a clearer understanding of the dynamical features of EFTGR and open new avenues for probing black hole properties via gravitational wave detection.</description>

      <title>Self-gravitating equilibrium with slow steady flow and the correct form of entropy current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium system with spherical symmetry as well as with steady energy flow is investigated perturbatively around the hydrostatic limit, where the radial component of the fluid velocity field $u^\mu$ is sufficiently small. Each component of vectors and tensors consisting of the system is expanded in different powers, which makes the covariant perturbation approach ineffective. The differential equations to determine the subleading correction of the structure variables are presented. The system retains the current $j^\mu$ accounting for the steady flow, which contributes to the entropy current $s^\mu$ in such a general covariant form that $s^\mu=au^\mu+ bj^\mu$ with $a, b$ unknown parametric functions. To determine them, a new condition is proposed. This condition imposes the entropy current to be of an unconventional form $s^\mu=(s-bj^0)u^\mu/u^0+ bj^\mu$, where $s$ is the entropy density. The remaining parameter $b$ is fixed by the current conservation equation. The perturbative analysis shows that $b$ starts with the quadratic order and its leading term is determined explicitly.</description>

      <title>Low finesse scattering and spectral drift of gravitational wave echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave echoes serve as probes for quantum horizon corrections. While steady-state resonances are assumed in the search of gravitational wave echos, realistic barriers are expected to possess intrinsically low reflectivity. In this work, we investigate this low-finesse limit via time-domain simulations and demonstrate that early-time echoes behave as transient scattered wave packets rather than cavity eigenstates. A central finding is the identification of spectral drift, where the central frequency progressively redshifts. This evolution occurs because high-frequency components dissipate significantly faster than the fundamental mode due to the filtering effect of the potential barrier. To distinguish transient interference from genuine resonance, we establish a physical criterion based on cavity lifetime, identifying a critical reflectivity threshold of approximately $0.37$. Since theoretical models typically operate deep within the overdamped regime below this limit, the resulting signals are spectrally non-stationary. We propose that detection strategies should shift towards dynamic time-frequency tracking to capture these drifting signatures.</description>

      <title>Nonconservative Lie series: post-Newtonian binary dynamics at 2.5PN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully analytical solution to the dynamics of the non-spinning 2.5 post-Newtonian binary problem, accounting for both the long-term (secular) and short-term (oscillatory) temporal behavior, with no restriction on eccentricity. The radiative degrees of freedom are handled within the nonconservative Hamiltonian framework introduced in a companion paper. In this work, we apply the Lie series method to construct a resonant Birkhoff normal-form and the corresponding generator of the radiation-reaction dynamics. The secular piece reconstructs exactly the Peters-Mathews relations for semi-major axis and eccentricity. The oscillatory piece completes the dynamics and is well suited for gravitational wave templates. The procedure we present in this paper can be systematically employed to cast arbitrary nonconservative systems into extended Hamiltonian form so that the Lie method can be applied.</description>

      <title>Born-Infeld signatures in AdS black hole thermodynamics and gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic and optical properties of Einstein-Born-Infeld-Anti-de Sitter (EBI-AdS) black holes (BHs). Our study derives the Hawking temperature using standard surface gravity methods and examines quantum corrections through both the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and exponential entropy modifications, showing enhanced thermal radiation and potential remnant formation scenarios. The gravitational redshift analysis separates contributions from mass, cosmological constant, electromagnetic charge, and Born-Infeld (BI) corrections, with the latter scaling as $a^4/r^6$ and thus confined to near-horizon regimes. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we calculate light deflection angles in both vacuum and plasma environments, demonstrating how dispersive media can either enhance or suppress nonlinear electrodynamic signatures depending on observational configurations. The thermodynamic analysis in extended phase space, where the BH mass corresponds to enthalpy, reveals phase structures with heat capacity transitions between positive and negative values, indicating regions of local stability and instability sensitive to parameter choices. We study BH heat engines operating in rectangular thermodynamic cycles, achieving efficiencies of $\eta \sim 0.11$--$0.21$ that reach 30--61\% of the corresponding Carnot limits, consistent with other AdS BH systems. Comparison with Johnson's analysis confirms that BI corrections to heat engine efficiency are of order $10^{-12}$ for typical parameter ranges, though these effects become appreciable in the strong-field regime where $r_h \lesssim 1.5$ in Planck units. The plasma deflection analysis reveals frequency-dependent refractive modifications encoded in the plasma parameter, offering additional possible observational channels.</description>

      <title>On visible effects in the double Schwarzschild solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical aspects of a static solution to the Einstein equations
  with two black holes are studied via ray tracing. The exact
  solution for this double Schwarzschild solution is known in explicit form. The black holes are separated by a singularity called \emph{Weyl strut}. The effect of this strut on null geodesics is shown to be defocusing in contrast to the focusing effect of the black holes. It is shown that black holes with a large separation essentially lead to similar behavior of the null geodesics as a single black hole, whereas nearby holes display a widely changed behavior due to the Weyl strut.</description>

      <title>The macroscopic precession model: describing quasi-periodic oscillations including internal structures of test bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relativistic precession model (RPM) is widely-considered as a benchmark framework to interpret quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), albeit several observational inconsistencies suggest that the model remains incomplete. The RPM ensures \emph{structureless test particles} and attributes precession to geodesic motion alone. Here, we refine the RPM by incorporating the internal structure of rotating test bodies, while preserving the test particle approximation (TPA), and propose a \emph{macroscopic precession model} (MPM) by means of the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) equations, applied to a Schwarzschild background, which introduces 1) a shift in the Keplerian frequency and 2) an \emph{effective spin correction} to the radial epicyclic frequency that, once the spin tensor is modeled, reproduces a quasi-Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) correction. We apply the MPM to eight neutron star low mass X-ray binaries (NS-LMXBs), performing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fits to twin kHz QPOs and find observational and statistical evidence in favor of precise power law spin reconstructions. Further, our model accurately predicts the $3:2$ frequency clustering, the disk boundaries and the NS masses. From the MPM model, we thus conclude that complexity of QPOs can be fully-described including the test particle internal structure.</description>

      <title>Geodesic structure of spacetime near singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geodesic flows emanating from an arbitrary point $\mathscr{P}$ in a manifold $\mathscr{M}$ carry important information about the geometric properties of $\mathscr{M}$. These flows are characterized by Synge's world function and van Vleck determinant - important bi-scalars that also characterize quantum description of physical systems in $\mathscr{M}$. If $\mathscr{P}$ is a regular point, these bi-scalars have well known expansions around their flat space expressions, quantifying \textit{local flatness} and equivalence principle. We show that, if $\mathscr{P}$ is a singular point, the scaling behavior of these bi-scalars changes drastically, capturing the non-trivial structure of geodesic flows near singularities. This yields remarkable insights into classical structure of spacetime singularities and provides useful tool to study their quantum structure.</description>

      <title>Inflation with Gauss-Bonnet Correction and Higgs Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological inflation for the Einstein-Hilbert action plus the Higgs potential function and the Gauss-Bonnet term coupled with the Higgs scalar field through a dilaton-like coupling. Then, using the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric and considering the appropriate slow-roll parameters, we derive the necessary equations of motion. In the proposed model, since the e-folding integral cannot be easily solved analytically, we first utilize a well-known Taylor expansion. Then, with a certain range of values derived for the model parameters, utilizing a mixture of several diagrams and numerical analysis methods, we obtain results for the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the scalar spectral index that are in good agreement with observational data within the acceptable range of the e-folding values. Also, in the absence of the Gauss-Bonnet term, we find that the inflationary observables are roughly the same as the predictions of the chaotic inflation model.</description>

      <title>Equation of the Perfect Fluid in the FRW Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the equation of state and its properties of the perfect fluid in the $D$-dimensional FRW universe under Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity and Lovelock gravity. In Einstein gravity, we get the equation of state and find that it has no critical point in the $P$-$V$ diagram, but its isothermal lines have minima in the $4$-dimensional case and are always negative in higher dimensions. In Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we get the equation of state and find that it has a critical point in the $5,6,7,8$-dimensional cases with phase transitions above the critical temperature. In Lovelock gravity, we get the equation of state and conditions of the critical points. Our work shows that both the theories of gravity and the dimensions of the FRW universe affect the existence of the critical point of the perfect fluid. Interestingly, if the critical point exists, phase transition always occures above the critical temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient searches for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence are crucial for gravitational wave observations. We present a proof-of-concept for a method that utilizes a neural network taking an SNR map, a stack of SNR time series calculated by the matched filter, as input and predicting the presence or absence of gravitational waves in observational data. We demonstrate our algorithm by applying it to a dataset of gravitational-wave signals from stellar-mass black hole mergers injected into stationary Gaussian noise. Our algorithm exhibits comparable performance to the standard matched-filter pipeline and to the machine-learning algorithms that participated in the mock data challenge, MLGWSC-1. The demonstration also shows that our algorithm achieves reasonable sensitivity with practical computational resources.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Spacetime and the Kerr/CFT Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the Kerr/CFT correspondence for extremal Kerr--Bertotti--Robinson (Kerr--BR) black holes, which are exact stationary solutions of the Einstein--Maxwell equations describing a rotating black hole immersed in a uniform Bertotti--Robinson electromagnetic universe. After reviewing the geometry, horizon structure, and thermodynamics of the Kerr--BR family, we demonstrate that the external field non-trivially modifies both the horizon positions and the extremality condition. For extremal configurations, the near-horizon limit yields a warped $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ geometry with an associated Maxwell field aligned to the $U(1)$ fibration. Imposing standard Kerr/CFT boundary conditions, the asymptotic symmetry algebra gives rise to a Virasoro algebra with central charge $c_L$ and left-moving temperature $T_L$ that depend explicitly on the external field strength. The Cardy formula then reproduces exactly the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy of the extremal Kerr--BR black hole for any admissible value of the Bertotti--Robinson field, thereby establishing a consistent Kerr/CFT dual description. Comparisons with the magnetized Melvin--Kerr and Kaluza--Klein black holes are briefly discussed, highlighting qualitative differences in their curvature profiles and horizon geometries.</description>

      <title>Matching the Alcubierre and Minkowski spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work analyzes the Darmois junction conditions matching an interior Alcubierre warp drive spacetime to an exterior Minkowski geometry. The joining hypersurface requires that the shift vector of the warp drive spacetime must satisfy the solution of a particular inviscid Burgers equation, namely, the gauge where the shift vector is not a function of the $y$ and $z$ spacetime coordinates. Such a gauge connects the warp drive metric to shock waves via a Burgers-type equation, which was previously found to be an Einstein equations vacuum solution for the warp drive geometry. It is also shown that not all Ricci and Riemann tensors components are zero at the joining hypersurface, but for that to happen they depend on the shift vector solution of the inviscid Burgers equation at the joining wall. This means that the warp drive geometry is not globally flat.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and Grey body factors of Wormholes: From General prescription to Einstein Gauss Bonnet realizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traversable wormholes are one of the most exciting predictions of General Relativity that offer short-cuts through space-time. However, their feasibility requires the violation of the null energy condition and makes their detection a bit difficult. This paper aims to show the new avenues delving deep into the observational prospects of TWHs via quasinormal modes (QNMs) and gray body factors GBFs. These are the two elementary aspects of wave dynamics. Given their distinct spectral imprints, these features provide a potential means to distinguish wormholes from black holes in gravitational wave observations. The role of QNMs in characterizing the ringdown phase of perturbations and the GBFs in determining transmission probabilities through wormhole barriers have been explored by a general description and then fed to Einstein Gauss Bonnet WH solutions in isotropic as well as anisotropic cases. Finally, a correspondence of the QNM frequencies with radius of the WH shadows has been made and the effect of Gauss Bonnet parameter on the QNM spectra has been discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing the gravity of a Schwarzschild black hole in the presence of a cloud of strings with EMRIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we explore the effect of the cloud of strings (CoS) on the gravitational waveforms of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). The EMRI system consists of a supermassive black hole (BH) and a compact stellar mass object moving around it. We begin with studying the test particle motion around the Schwarzschild BH surrounded by a CoS by using the Lagrangian formalism. Moreover, we investigated the effect of the CoS parameter on the evolution of the semi-latus rectum and eccentricity. We then turn to the exploration of the impact of the CoS parameter on the gravitational waveforms of the EMRI system. The analysis performed shows that Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could detect the CoS imprint in gravitational waveforms when the values of the string cloud parameter $\alpha \gtrsim 2 \times 10^{-6}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a parameterized equation of state for dark energy and perform observational tests with the Hubble parameter measurements, the Pantheon supernova sample, baryon acoustic oscillations, and DESI DR2 data. We obtain the best-fit values for the parameters as: $H_0=73.96\pm 0.16$, $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.2434\pm 0.0079$, and $\alpha=-0.00049\pm 0.00092$, demonstrating that the model exhibits a high degree of consistency with astronomical observations and provides a promising parameterized method for addressing the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Extracting the expression for the field equations of a diffeomorphism invariant theory of gravity from surface term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a contribution towards the understanding for the field equations of diffeomorphism invariant theories of pure gravity, we demonstrate in great detail that the expression for the field equations of such theories can be derived within the perspective of the surface term coming from the variation of the Lagrangian. Specifically, starting with the surface term, we extract a symmetric rank-two tensor together with an anti-symmetric one out of this term with the variation operator replaced with the Lie derivative along an arbitrary vector field. By utilizing an equality stemming from the Lie derivative of the Lagrangian density along an arbitrary vector field, it is proved that the resulting symmetric rank-two tensor is identified with the functional derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to the metric. Such a result further brings forth the expression for the field equations constructed from the symmetric rank-two tensor, which naturally rules out the derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to the metric and coincides with the one for the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion. Furthermore, it is illustrated that the construction of the expression for the field equations from the symmetric rank-two tensor must be feasible as long as the variation operator in the variation equation of the Lagrangian is allowed to be substituted by the Lie derivative along an arbitrary vector field. On the other hand, as a byproduct, the anti-symmetric rank-two tensor turns out to be the Noether charge two-form. Our results offer a straightforward support on the proposal in our previous work that the surface term gives a unified description for field equations and Noether charges in the context of theories of gravity admitting diffeomorphism invariance symmetry.</description>

      <title>On the magnetic 2+1- D space-time and its non-relativistic counterpart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here an interesting non-relativistic limit, referred to as the Newton-Hooke (NH) limit, of the purely magnetic BTZ solution by starting from the Einstein-Maxwell system in the 2+1 dimensions. The Newton-Hooke limit is different from the Galilean limit in the sense that the former contains an additional parameter {\Lambda}, the cosmological constant, over and above the speed of light, c. We show that under this limit, the geodesics of the magnetic BTZ solution reduce to the two-dimensional motion of a charged particle in a normal magnetic field together with the presence of an extra harmonic potential, sometimes called the Fock-Darwin problem, which serves as a precursor to model certain condensed matter theories. Our present study has significance in analyzing the symmetries of different dynamical systems, from relativistic and/to nonrelativistic theories. Also, we discuss here one of the applications of the generalized (magnetic) NH_3 symmetry in the context of the Virial theorem, where this symmetry is the symmetry group of the Fock-Darwin problem mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Shadow and Optical Imaging in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates photon motion in black hole of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory, exploring black hole shadows and observational characteristics under various accretion models. We first give the relation of the event horizon, photon sphere, and critical impact parameter in terms of the magnetic charge $q$. We then use the Event Horizon Telescope data to constrain $q$. For the two spherical accretion models, the infalling scenario yields a darker shadow due to the Doppler effect. However, the shadow radius remains unchanged for different models. In the case of an optically thin, geometrically thin disk accretion model, the observed brightness is predominantly determined by direct emission. The lensing ring provides a secondary contribution to the intensity, whereas the photon ring's emission is negligible. The widths of the lensing and photon rings exhibit a positive correlation with the magnetic charge $q$. Additionally, within the disk model framework, the black hole shadow radius is found to depend on the specific emission model.</description>

      <title>Through the Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a dangerous journey -- a journey through the strong singularity from one universe to another or from inside of a black hole to its 'inverse' as a white hole. Such singularities are hidden in the Friedman and Schwarzschild solutions; we call them malicious singularities. The journey is made possible owing to two generalizations. The first generalization consists in considering spaces with differential structures on them (the so-called ringed spaces) rather than the usual manifolds. This entails a generalization of the concept of smoothness, which allows us to think about a smooth passage through the singularity. The second generalization is related to the concept of curve. We show that if a kind of singularity is implanted in the set of curve's parameters, along with an appropriate topology, in such a way that the structure of the set of parameters corresponds to the structure of the singular space-time, the curve can smoothly -- in a generalized sense -- pass through the singularity.</description>

      <title>Shadows of rotating traversable wormholes surrounded by plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of the plasma environment on the shadows of stationary axisymmetric wormholes. We consider a sample of several wormhole solutions and plasma distributions for which the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the light rays is separable. This allows us to derive analytical expressions for the shadow boundary and examine the behavior of the photon regions as the plasma frequency varies. We observe that plasma profiles which depend only on radial coordinate lead to common evolution of the photon region which does not depend on the wormhole metric and is consistent with the Kerr black hole. For plasma profiles with angular dependence the evolution of the photon region is specific for every spacetime thus wormholes are observationally distinguishable. We further investigate the formation of forbidden regions in the plasma medium where light cannot propagate. They lead to the formation of plasma frequency ranges where the shadow is no longer observable and we show that this phenomenon is characteristic for all the configurations in our sample. We obtain the critical frequencies for which the shadow vanishes and demonstrate that for all the wormholes they are lower than the critical frequencies for the Kerr black hole in the same environment. This implies that there exist plasma frequency ranges in which the Kerr black hole casts a shadow but wormholes do not, creating a strong observational signature for discriminating between compact objects. In the frequency ranges where both black hole and wormhole shadows exist the wormhole shadows are consistently smaller than those for the Kerr black hole. As the plasma frequency grows the discrepancy progresses showing that plasma medium facilitates the experimental detection of wormholes. Finally we consider aberrational effects on the wormhole shadows. They further increase the deviation from black holes making wormholes easier to detect.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic analysis of a compact object in Rastall-Rainbow gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic behavior of a horizonless compact object within the framework of Rastall-Rainbow (RR) gravity. Working with local shell thermodynamics for gravastar and an exterior fiducial temperature, we show that the RR modification bends temperature to produce two extrema and a stable mass remnant at zero temperature. We show that the gravastar's shell entropy is smaller than that of a comparable black hole, and that RR modifications introduce a logarithmic correction which contributes to specific heat positivity and a smoother free energy landscape of small gravastars.
  A Central finding of this work is that, from heat capacity and Helmholtz free energy analyses, we uncover small, middle, and large branches and demonstrate that unlike Rainbow modified black holes, the small RR gravastar is both locally and globally favored over hot curved space. At the parameter level, both Rastall and Rainbow play distinct roles. Increasing the Rastall parameter, by strengthening matter-curvature coupling, adjusts the redshift between the shell and the exterior, shifts the temperature maximum to higher values at larger masses, and narrows the unstable window. In contrast, increasing the Rainbow parameter enhances energy dependent UV suppression and bends the temperature in lower values at larger masses. Altogether, these results highlight a controlled route to thermodynamic stabilization and the emergence of a stable remnant in horizonless compact objects within RR gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Correlations and Gravity: From the Emergence of a Cosmological Constant to the Gravitation of Particles in Superposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main technical obstacles in constructing a consistent theory of quantum gravity is that the metric itself defines the causal structure required for quantization. This motivates implementing quantum aspects of gravity through an independent connection. Moreover, the experimentally confirmed violation of Bell inequalities, together with the natural structure of the energy--momentum tensor in semiclassical gravity, suggests that nonlocality should be incorporated into the gravitational formalism. Motivated by these considerations, we propose a model in which the connection is treated as an independent bitensorial field, leading to a bitensorial generalization of the Einstein equations. The model reduces to General Relativity when the matter source is classical. We apply it in two regimes: the late-time universe and the Newtonian limit. In the cosmological case, the model naturally gives rise to a positive effective cosmological constant. In the Newtonian regime, we analyze a situation in which the gravitational source is in a quantum superposition and find that the model predicts a novel, nonconservative effective force that depends on the velocity of the test particle.</description>

      <title>Silencing Newtonian noise using fusion sensor arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Newtonian noise (NN) from seismic density fluctuations is expected to limit the low-frequency sensitivity of third-generation gravitational-wave detectors, in particular the Einstein Telescope (ET). Current NN mitigation relies on seismometer arrays and Wiener filtering, while distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) offers a complementary, low-cost means of obtaining dense strain measurements. We investigate fusion sensor arrays composed of both displacement-measuring seismometers and strain-measuring DAS-type sensors. We extend the Wiener filter formalism to mixed sensor types and introduce analytic S-wave strain correlation coefficients. Using a hybrid differential evolution and covariance matrix adaptation scheme, we validate our approach against established seismometer-only results and analyze the geometry, robustness, and performance of optimized fusion arrays. Fusion arrays enhance P/S-wave disentanglement and achieve NN cancellation levels comparable to, and sometimes exceeding, those of seismometer-only arrays, particularly for small sensor numbers. When sensors are constrained to the ET infrastructure, we find that six seismometers complemented by fourteen strainmeters inside the ET arms can match the performance of twenty seismometers in boreholes, achieving a residual at the 10% level, and thereby offering a cost-efficient pathway toward ET-scale NN mitigation.</description>

      <title>Could a thin-shell configuration lie hidden within the Universe?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the cosmological scenario in which our Universe contains a hidden thin-shell configuration. We investigate a degenerate modification of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric obtained through a coordinate transformation applied to the radial coordinate, analogous to recent approaches that address the Big Bang singularity via spacetime defects. The resulting metric, while formally satisfying the standard homogeneous Friedmann equations, actually describes an evolving wormhole geometry with two asymptotically flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker regions connected by a throat located at the coordinate singularity. Using Israel's junction formalism, we demonstrate that this coordinate singularity corresponds to a thin shell characterized by exotic matter with well-defined surface energy density and isotropic pressure. The shell obeys the barotropic equation of state $p = -\rho/2$, confirming the presence of exotic matter that violates the standard energy condition, which is a requirement for maintaining wormhole geometries. As the universe expands, this thin shell becomes increasingly diluted, scaling as $1/a(t)$ with the cosmic scale factor.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study a Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) quantum cosmology model with positively curved spatial sections. The matter content of the model is given by a radiation fluid, a Chaplygin gas, and an ad hoc potential. After writing the Hamiltonian of the model, we notice that the effective potential ($V_{eff}$) depends on three parameters: $A$ and $B$ associated with the Chaplygin gas, and $\sigma$ associated with the ad hoc potential. Depending on the values of these parameters $V_{eff}$ becomes a double barrier potential. We quantize the model and obtain the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We solve that equation using the WKB approximation and compute the corresponding probability ($TP_{WKB}$) that the wavefunction of the universe tunnels through the double barrier potential $V_{eff}$. We study how $TP_{WKB}$ behaves as a function of the parameters $A$, $B$, $\sigma$ and the radiation energy $E$. We notice a significant occurrence of resonances in $TP_{WKB}$ when varying it as a function of $E$ or $\sigma$. It is a very interesting phenomenon because it may cause the universe to be born with selected values of $E$ or $\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Two-point correlators in de Sitter-prepared states with bra-ket wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the finiteness of de Sitter (dS) horizon entropy, we study how ``bra-ket wormholes'' modify correlation functions in gravitationally prepared states. Euclidean wormhole saddles in gravitational path integrals can generate non-factorizing contributions to correlation functions, as in replica-wormhole explanation of the Page curve and bra-ket-wormhole restoration of strong subadditivity. By defining `time' variables and computing observables in a flat region attached to the dS boundary, we evaluate bra-ket wormhole contributions to scalar two-point functions and find a late-time transition in the dominant saddle, accompanied by ramp-and-plateau behavior of correlations and characteristic timescale comparable to the fast scrambling. Our results are built upon (i) inflationary horizon exit and re-entry, (ii) enhancement of correlation at small comoving momentum $k$ by wormhole contribution, and (iii) a competition between mode counting and topological suppression that drives a transition to wormhole dominance. Although results are qualitatively consistent, one needs to address wormhole stabilization to clearly interpret in terms of the entropy context.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger Symmetry in Spherically-symmetric Static Mini-superspaces with Matter Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger symmetry emerged in a ``fluid limit" from a full superspace to several mini-superspace models. We consider two spherically-symmetric static mini-superspace models with matter fields and verify the robustness of this emergent symmetry at the classical level: (i) Maxwell field with cosmological constant and (ii) $n$ massless scalar fields. We develop a method based on canonical transformations and show that: for model (i), 3D Schr\"odinger symmetry emerges, and the solution is the (anti-) de Sitter Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime, and for model (ii), $(2+n)$D Schr\"odinger symmetry appears, and the solution is a generalized Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime and its ``interior", a Kantowski-Sachs type closed universe. In the matter decoupling limit, both cases lead to 2D Schr\"odinger symmetry in different lapse functions and mini-superspace coordinates, which implies the covariance of Schr\"odinger symmetry. Finally, we propose a physical interpretation of the symmetry under Hamiltonian constraints $H$ and explain it with examples: Symmetry generators commuting with $H$ map a solution to another one, while those non-commuting with $H$ generate a new theory with the Schr\"odinger symmetry and the transformed configuration is a solution to the new theory. These support the robustness of the emergence of Schr\"odinger symmetry and open new possibilities for exploring quantum dynamics of matter and gravity based on the symmetry.</description>

      <title>Completeness from Gravitational Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that symmetry in the presence of gravity implies a version of the completeness hypothesis. For a broad class of theories, we demonstrate that the existence of finitely many charged particles logically necessitates the existence of infinitely many charged particles populating the entire charge lattice. Our conclusions follow from the consistency of perturbative gravitational scattering and require the following ingredients: 1) a weakly coupled ultraviolet completion of gravity, 2) a nonabelian symmetry $G$, gauged or global, whose Cartan subgroup generates the abelian charge lattice, and 3) a spectrum containing some finite set of charged representations, in the simplest cases taken to be a single particle in the fundamental. Under these conditions, the abelian charge lattice is completely filled by single-particle states for $G=SO(N)$ with $N\geq 5$ and $G=SU(N)$ with $N\geq 3$, which in turn implies completeness for other symmetry groups such as $Spin(N)$, $Sp(N)$, and $E_8$. Curiously, a corollary of our results is that the $SU(5)$ and $SO(10)$ grand unified theories have precisely the minimal field content needed to derive completeness using our methodology.</description>

      <title>ESO Expanding Horizons White Paper: Electromagnetic characterisation of millihertz gravitational-wave sources in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The millihertz band is densely populated by continuous gravitational-wave signals from Galactic compact binaries, dominated by double white dwarfs (DWDs; binaries of two white dwarfs) with contributions from systems containing neutron stars and black holes (Amaro-Seoane et al. 2023). As these binaries inspiral due to gravitational-wave radiation, they can reach contact and begin mass transfer in the millihertz band. Gravitational-wave detectors like LISA will survey such compact binaries across the Milky Way, yielding samples numbering in the tens of thousands, with essentially complete sensitivity to orbital periods shorter than ~10-20 min (e.g. Lamberts et al. 2019). Assessing the nature of the binary components - and deriving masses, temperatures and compositions - requires systematic electromagnetic characterisation that breaks gravitational-wave degeneracies and enables full atmospheric and orbital solutions. At present, no dedicated facility or coordinated survey is planned to deliver electromagnetic follow-up at the scale necessary to maximise the science return of the millihertz gravitational-wave data; this white paper discusses the need and requirements of such a capability.</description>

      <title>On the gravitational partition function under volume constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Euclidean action serves as a bridge between gravitational thermodynamics and the partition function. In this work, we further examine the gravitational partition function under a fixed volume constraint, extending the fixed volume on-shell geometry in the massless case. Moving beyond this massless configuration, we construct solutions with nonzero mass functions, leading to a new class of volume-constrained Euclidean geometries (VCEGs). The VCEG contains both a boundary and a horizon, and its Euclidean action is determined solely by the contribution from the horizon. However, further investigation suggests that this boundary appears to be artificially constructed and can be extended, giving rise to the extended VCEGs. These geometries feature two horizons, each with a conical singularity, and their action is given by one-quarter of the sum of the areas of the two horizons. In general, the conical singularities on both horizons cannot be simultaneously removed, except at a critical mass $m = m^*$, which defines the critical extended VCEG. Configurations with conical singularities are interpreted as constrained gravitational instantons. An analysis of their contributions to the partition function and topology reveals a close analogy between the extended VCEGs and the Euclidean Schwarzschild-de Sitter static patch, suggesting that the volume constraint effectively plays a role akin to that of a cosmological constant in semiclassical quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>The tunneling decay rate in QFT beyond the thin wall approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tunneling decay rate per unit volume in Quantum Field Theory (QFT), at order $\hbar$, is given by $\Gamma/V = Ae^{-B}$, where $B$ is the Euclidean action evaluated at the so-called bounce, and $A$ is proportional to the determinant of a second-order differential operator. The dominant contribution comes from the exponential factor. To estimate $\Gamma/V$, one must determine the bounce configuration, which satisfies a highly nonlinear equation. A common approach in the literature is the thin-wall approximation. In this work, we extend the formalism to cases where the thin-wall approximation is not valid. We employ a simple variational method to estimate both the bounce and the decay rate, and we find good agreement between our results and full numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>New Massless Spectra from Cosmic String Cusps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the standard picture of cosmic strings, cusps are generic features of Nambu-Goto loops where the string momentarily reaches the speed of light. They have a characteristic sharp profile, following $y \sim x^{2/3}$ in the $(x,y)$ plane, and produce strong gravitational-wave (GW) bursts with frequency-domain strain $\mathop{\tilde{\!\kappa}}(\omega) \propto \omega^{-4/3}$, making them key targets for current and future GW searches. However, under certain conditions, this generic picture can differ. We identify cusp solutions with different, including smooth, shapes, and compute their massless GW and axion spectra. We derive a general expression for all possible Nambu-Goto cusp spectra with the asymptotic form $\mathop{\tilde{\!\kappa}}(\omega) \propto \omega^{-n/(2n-1)} \omega^{-m/(2m-1)}$ where $n, m\geq 2$. We investigate the effect of realistic corrections to the Nambu-Goto description, such as those from backreaction and finite string width, which introduce a high frequency cutoff.</description>

      <title>The Effect of a Self-bound Equation of State on the Structure of Rotating Compact Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates how a self bound equation of state (EOS), which describes strange quark stars, affects the rotational properties of compact stars, focusing on deviations from universal relations governing gravitational mass and radius changes due to rotation. The analysis reveals significant deviations in stars with higher surface-to-center total energy-density ratios, $\frac{\epsilon_s}{\epsilon_c+c^2P_c}$, challenging the established universal relations.
  For Newtonian stars, hydrostatic equilibrium ensures that the difference between the gravitational potential at the center, $\Phi_c$, and at the poles, $\Phi_p$, remains constant within sequences of rotating neutron stars characterized by the same central and polar specific enthalpy ($\Phi_c - \Phi_p = -h_c +h_p$). Combined with the scaling $\Phi \propto R_e^2$, where $R_e$ denotes the equatorial radius, this condition naturally leads to a quasi-universal behavior in the rotational change of radius within these sequences. Similarly, in general relativistic stars, the hydrostatic equilibrium maintains that $\Phi^{GR}_{p} - \Phi^{GR}_{c}$ remains unchanged within these sequences, where $\Phi^{GR}$ is one of the metric potentials.
  Inspired by this theoretical framework, a toy model has been developed to capture the dependence of gravitational mass and radius deviations on the surface-to-central total energy density ratio. Subsequently, an improved set of empirical universal relations has been proposed, for accurately modeling rapidly rotating compact stars with self-bound EOSs.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Dispersion Spectra across Lorentz boosted frames: Spurious modes and the enigma of causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of linearized perturbations in relativistic field theories involving derivative corrections frequently leads to pathologies that, although generic, may not always be manifest, like in a local rest frame scenario. Hence, analyzing such theories conclusively in a more general state of equilibrium, like in a Lorentz boosted inertial frame, is imperative, albeit extracting the boosted modes could be quite nontrivial. Motivated by this problem, in this study, we develop a general framework for deriving the dispersion spectra in Lorentz-boosted inertial frames solely from the information of the local rest frame dispersion coefficients. Apart from the well-behaved modes, which are observed to follow an exact mapping across the boost, we show that in some cases, unphysical ``spurious" modes might turn up, which diverge at zero boost limit and thus lack any rest-frame analogue. Finally, we investigate the conflict between the existence of these spurious modes and the causality for a given relativistic theory. The key developments provided here are (i) a convenient way for obtaining the dispersion spectra across inertial frames, bypassing the traditional method of solving the boosted polynomial, and (ii) exploring the direct connection between the mode conservation and the causality of a theory with detailed proof. Due to the general approach, these results can find direct applications for a range of other effective theory formulations, like gauge theory plasmas, strongly coupled systems, and heavy quark effective theory.</description>

      <title>AttenGW: A Lightweight Attention-Based Multi-Detector Gravitational-Wave Detection Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present AttenGW, an attention-based multi-detector gravitational-wave detection model and accompanying software stack designed for analysis of real LIGO data. AttenGW combines a per-detector hierarchical dilated convolutional network with an attention-based aggregation module that enforces cross-detector coherence, providing an alternative to graph-based aggregation schemes used in previous work. The pipeline adopts a LIGO-style preprocessing and data-loading workflow based on GWOSC time series, with standard whitening and filtering, and is released as a documented Python/PyTorch package. We benchmark AttenGW using simulated injections to estimate sensitive volume and on real O3 data, focusing on the February 2020 segment previously used to evaluate a spatiotemporal graph ensemble. On this month of data, a single AttenGW model reduces the false-positive rate relative to a single graph-based detector by a factor of a few, and an ensemble of three AttenGW models matches the performance of the corresponding six-model ensemble. Injection studies on real LIGO noise further indicate that attention-based aggregation yields stable performance on non-Gaussian backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Constraint on magnetized black bounce spacetime from HFQPOs data and the selection of resonance models via information criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper primarily explores the dynamics of charged particle in the magnetized SV spacetime, and constrains the parameters of the SV spacetime along with its surrounding magnetic fields. The constraints are given by using $\chi^2$ analysis combined with high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (HFQPO) data observed from three microquasars: GRS 1915+105, XTE 1550-564, and GRO J1655-40. The results indicate that the magnetic field significantly influences the position of the innermost stable circular orbit of charged particle and frequency distribution of epicyclic motion, which excites more resonance model variants, enhancing observational effects. Additionally, we employ the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to evaluate resonance model and its various variants. The support for different models from observational data shows significant variation: $E R_8$ as the best model is supported strongly, $ER_3$ model has moderate evidence of support, $ER_6$ and $ER_7$ models are considerably less support, while other resonance models have essentially no support. For models more supported by the observational data, the allowed ranges of the regularization parameter: $0\leq a&lt;0.736$ ($68\%$ confidence level) suggests that HFQPOs data support the magnetized black bounce spacetime as a regular black hole, and the smaller value of the regularization parameter indicates a possibility of the presence of quantum effects. According to the constraint results, we get the best-fit values of magnetic field strength around $10^{-5}\sim 10^{-4}$ GS for electrons and around $10^{-2}\sim 10^{-1}$ GS for protons. Finally, as a comparison, we test the SV spacetime without a magnetic field using microquasar observational data, and the calculated results of AIC show that this case is incompatible with the HFQPOs data, further supporting the existence of a magnetic field in SV spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12723v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically investigate the Widom line and universal supercritical crossover for charged AdS black holes threaded by a global monopole. We compute thermodynamic variables in both the extended and canonical ensembles. We derive the scaled variance $\Omega$ using the Gibbs free energy and locate the Widom line as the extrema of this. Using mean-field expansion of the equation of state near criticality, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Widom line and the two branching crossover lines $L^\pm$. We show that the monopole parameter shifts the critical parameters but does not change the mean-field universal scaling: the leading linear term and the nonanalytic correction remain universal in both ensembles. We also verify this with numerical computation and show the Widom line and the two branching crossover lines $L^\pm$.</description>

      <title>Holographic Codes from Enriched Link Entanglement in Spin Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an enriched entanglement structure for spin networks, inspired by tensor-network constructions, in which internal links can carry a controlled and discrete amount of entanglement. In the spin-network picture, vertices are dual to simplices and links are dual to their faces. Standard spin-network gluing corresponds to fully identifying two simplices along a face, implemented by a maximally entangled, gauge-invariant singlet state on the corresponding link, while unglued faces correspond to links carrying no entanglement. Working on a complete graph, we promote this binary choice to a controlled and tunable structure by allowing each link to carry a variable amount of entanglement, interpolating between product states and the fully entangled singlet. The additional link variables therefore control not only the amount of entanglement but also the extent to which gauge invariance at internal links is preserved or broken, admitting an interpretation in terms of emergent edge-mode-like degrees of freedom. Within this framework, spin-network contraction defines a bulk-to-boundary map from link-entanglement data to boundary states. Adapting techniques developed in random tensor networks, we show that in a suitable large-spin regime the map is a co-isometry in expectation value. Restricting to a code subspace defined by configurations in which links are either effectively glued or open, with small fluctuations around this pattern, the map becomes an exact isometry. This yields a discrete and geometrically meaningful realization of holographic and error-correcting features within the spin-network Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Perturbations of Hausdorff Dimension in Quantum Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a seminal paper, Abbott et al. analyzed the relationship between a particle's trajectory and the resolution of position measurements performed by an observer at fixed time intervals. They predicted that quantum paths exhibit a universal Hausdorff dimension that transitions from $d=2$ to $d=1$ as the momentum of the particle increases. However, although measurements were assumed to occur at intervals of time, the calculations only involved evaluating the expectation value of operators for the free evolution of wave function within a single interval, with no actual physical measurements performed. In this work we investigate how quantum measurements alter the fractal geometry of quantum particle paths. By modelling sequential measurements using Gaussian wave packets for both the particle and the apparatus, we reveal that the dynamics of the measurement change the roughness of the path and shift the emergent Hausdorff dimension towards a lower value in nonselective evolution. For selective evolution, feedback control forces must be introduced to counteract stochastic wave function collapse, stabilising trajectories and enabling dimensionality to be tuned. When the contribution of the measurement approaches zero, our result reduces to that of Abbott et al. Our work can thus be regarded as a more realistic formulation of their approach, and it connects theoretical quantum fractality with measurement physics, quantifying how detectors reshape spacetime statistics at quantum scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic microstructure of electrically charged AdS black holes in Einstein-Kalb-Ramond bumblebee gravity in the presence of a spherically symmetric cloud of strings. Employing Weinhold and Ruppeiner thermodynamic geometries in complementary thermodynamic representations, we show that curvature singularities consistently track the spinodal boundaries and the second-order critical point associated with a Van der Waals-like small/large black-hole phase transition. Moreover, the sign structure of the Ruppeiner curvature provides a transparent characterization of the competing microscopic interactions across the coexisting phases. We find that the Lorentz-violating parameter $\ell$ and the string-cloud parameter $\alpha$ shift the critical scales and rescale correlation measures while preserving the universality class of the critical behavior. We further comment on dynamical and holographic implications and contrast the thermodynamic sensitivity to $(\ell,\alpha)$ with thin-disk optical signatures.</description>

      <title>Standardizing reverberation-mapped H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using time-averaged radius$-$luminosity relations with 5100\,\AA\,, broad H$\beta$, and narrow \OIII\ luminosities</title>

Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been studied as alternate probes in cosmology due to their large and stable luminosities and broad redshift range. Previously it was shown that higher-redshift AGN that were reverberation-mapped (RM) using broad Mg\,\textsc{ii} and C\,\textsc{iv} lines are standardizable and yield weak cosmological constraints that are consistent with those from better-established probes. In contrast, lower-redshift AGN that were reverberation-mapped using the broad H$\beta$ line exhibited tensions with the standard cosmological model, in particular they preferred currently decelerating cosmological expansion. Here we study the standardizability of a homogeneous RM H$\beta$ sample of $\sim 100$ AGN (over redshifts $0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$), whose H$\beta$ time delays and three luminosity tracers (at 5100\,\AA\,, broad H$\beta$, and narrow [O\,\textsc{iii}]) are averaged over several epochs. We find that this averaged sample is standardizable using three $R-L$ relations. While for luminosities corresponding to 5100\,\AA\, and the broad H$\beta$ line the cosmological constraints prefer currently decelerating cosmological expansion, the cosmological parameters for the narrow [O\,\textsc{iii}] luminosity are more consistent with those from better-established probes and they are in agreement with currently accelerating cosmological expansion. This demonstrates for the first time that narrow-line region [O\,\textsc{iii}] can be utilized for AGN standardization and cosmological constraints. Selecting proper photoionizing flux proxies for the broad-line region is thus crucial in studies of RM AGN standardizability.</description>

      <title>Extending Weinberg's EFT: effective scalar-tensor theories up to sixth order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic construction of the six-derivative effective scalar-tensor theories, extending the four-derivative framework previously developed by Steven Weinberg. The on-shell effective field theory comprises five parity-even and three parity-odd independent six-derivative scalar-tensor interactions, representing all inequivalent deformations consistent with general covariance. We further confirm this operator counting through an independent analysis using the scattering amplitude formalism in four-dimensional flat spacetime. The six-derivative Lagrangian constructed here provides the next-to-leading-order extension of scalar-tensor gravity, furnishing a robust framework for exploring quantum or stringy corrections, parity-violating interactions, and strong-curvature effects in cosmology, black hole physics and gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>The Serendipitous Axiodilaton: A Self-Consistent Recombination-Era Solution to the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axio-dilaton cosmology provides a minimal benchmark model for both Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE) that is well motivated by fundamental physics. The axion and dilaton arise as pseudo-Goldstone modes of symmetries that predict particle masses depend on the dilaton, and therefore to evolve cosmologically, leading to correlated modifications of recombination physics, the sound horizon, and late-time expansion and growth histories. We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field. We find that it fits the data somewhat better than $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, with the $\chi^2$ lowered by $\simeq 7$ for three additional parameters, and significantly raises the inferred Hubble constant to $H_0 \simeq 69.2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the Hubble tension to $\lesssim 3\sigma$ and thereby allowing a joint fit of CMB and SH0ES data. The model fits this enlarged data set as well as the $w_0w_a$ model with an electron mass modified by hand at recombination, though it does so with calculable dynamics. Axio-dilaton self-interactions robustly fake a phantom equation of state in DESI measurements. There is a sting: cosmology prefers dilaton-matter couplings $|\mathbf{g}|\sim 10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$, which are large enough to have been detected in solar-system tests of General Relativity. These results show how axio-dilatons can provide a viable cosmology preferred by current data at surprisingly large couplings, within a framework that links dark energy, dark matter, and time-dependent particle masses in a coherent way. They suggest both new observable signals and new theoretical directions, aimed at resolving the apparent inconsistency with non-cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>The impact of non-Gaussianity when searching for Primordial Black Holes with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LISA can observe cosmological millihertz (mHz) gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds that may offer a decisive test for asteroid-mass primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter (DM). In standard scenarios, failing to detect a scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background would exclude the last viable window for PBH DM formed through critical collapse. We show that this conclusion becomes much weaker in the presence of astrophysical foregrounds and strongly non-Gaussian primordial density perturbations, by studying how these phenomena affect the link between SIGWs and PBHs, and reevaluate LISA's sensitivity to asteroid-mass PBHs. In addition, we analyse the interplay between PBHs and SIGWs to gain further insights into the nature of primordial non-Gaussianity. We find that uncertainties in $f_{\rm NL}$ can induce substantial uncertainties in the PBH abundance, which ultimately limits LISA's capacity to fully probe the asteroid-mass PBH DM window.</description>

      <title>Using overlap of sky localization probability maps for filtering potentially lensed pairs of gravitational-wave signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.05932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing creates multiple images of a gravitational wave transient. The current state-of-the-art method for identifying such lensing events is a computationally expensive full Bayesian analysis. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and efficiency of using the overlap of sky localization probability maps (skymaps) to quickly filter potentially lensed gravitational wave signal pairs. We introduce three overlap statistics and test their performance using 200 simulated lensed pairs of gravitational-wave signals across five sets of signal-to-noise ratios. By setting a threshold with a false positive rate of $\mathrm{FPR} = 10^{-2}$ for the three overlap statistics, we find that we can filter out over $99\%$ of nonlensed events while retaining all lensed events. The statistics for each event pair can be computed instantly, and can be used in practice to quickly analyze existing events using the skymaps from the low-latency localization pipelines when results from the full parameter estimation are not available.</description>

      <title>Graviscalar quasinormal modes and asymptotic tails of a thick brane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the graviscalar quasinormal modes (QNMs) and their asymptotic tail behavior of a thick brane. Considering the scalar perturbations of the thick brane metric, we obtain the main equations of graviscalar Kaluza-Klein modes. Based on these equations, the frequencies of the graviscalar QNMs of the thick brane are obtained by the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin, asymptotic iteration, and numerical evolution methods. The results show that the scalar fluctuation of the thick brane has a series of discrete QNMs, similar to the tensor perturbation of the brane. These modes appear as decaying massive scalar particles in four-dimensional spacetime. We also studied in detail the late time tails of these QNMs and found that some modes have slowly decaying oscillatory tails that may be new sources of the gravitational wave backgrounds. Obviously, the QNMs contain the information of the brane and are characteristic modes of the thick brane.</description>

      <title>Motion of spinning particles around black hole in a dark matter halo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motion of a rapidly rotating object in curved spacetime is affected by the spin-curvature force, an effect captured in the motion of spinning test particles. Recently, Cardoso et al.~[Phys. Rev. D 105, L061501 (2022)] found an exact solution describing a black hole immersed in a Hernquist distribution of dark matter. In this work, we investigate the motion of spinning particles around this black hole. We use the Mathison-Papapetrou-Dixon equation and the Tulczyjew spin-supplementary condition to calculate the effective potential, four-momentum, and four-velocity of the spinning particle. The equatorial motion of spinning test particles and the properties of the marginally bound orbits, innermost stable circular orbits, and periodic orbits are further studied. We find that the existence of dark matter halos can significantly change the orbital eccentricity, energy, and the marginally bound orbits, innermost stable circular orbits, and periodic orbits parameters of spinning test particles. Compared to the Schwarzschild black hole, dark matter halos bring the marginally bound orbit and innermost stable circular orbit of a spinning test particle closer to the event horizon. These results could help us understand the properties of black holes in dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and echoes of a double braneworld</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the gravitational quasinormal modes and the gravitational echoes of a double braneworld. The double braneworld is a kind of split thick brane, which is crucial for addressing the hierarchy problem in the thick brane scenarios. Using the Bernstein spectral method, direct integration method, and asymptotic iteration method, we calculate the quasinormal mode frequencies of the double brane. We find that the quasinormal spectrum is very different from that of the single brane model, especially the high overtone mode. We also perform numerical evolution to study the time-domain properties of the characteristic modes of the double brane. The results show that when the degree of brane splitting is large, gravitational echoes of oscillation attenuation between sub-branes will appear in the thick brane. Furthermore, different long-lived Kaluza-Klein modes interfere with each other, resulting in a beating effect. Compared to a single brane model, the phenomenon of the split double brane is richer, and the lifetime of the massive Kaluza-Klein graviton of the double brane is longer. These phenomena may have potential phenomenological interest. We hope to detect these extra-dimensional signals in future gravitational wave detectors or accelerators.</description>

      <title>Searching for quantum-gravity footprint around stellar-mass black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the asymptotically safe gravity, black holes may have characteristics different from those described according to general relativity if the running of the gravitational constant coupling happens at low energies. Particularly, they should be more compact, with a smaller event horizon, which in turn affects the other quantities dependent on it, like the photon ring and the size of the innermost stable circular orbit. We decided to test the latter hypothesis by searching in the literature for observational measurements of the inner radius of the accretion disk around stellar-mass black holes. We selected the smallest values measured when the disk was in high/soft state, made them homogeneous by taking into account the most recent and more reliable values of mass, spin, viewing angle, and distance from the Earth, and compared with the expectations of the Kerr metric. We do not find any significant deviation. Some doubtful cases can be easily understood as due to specific states of the object during the observation or instrumental biases. We set the tightest constraint on the parameter $\xi$ obtained to date.</description>

Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), consisting of a stellar-mass compact object spiraling into a massive black hole, are key sources for future space-based gravitational wave observatories such as LISA. Accurate modeling of these systems requires incorporating the spin effects of both the primary and secondary bodies, particularly for waveforms at the precision required for LISA detection and astrophysical parameter extraction. In this work, we develop a framework for modeling flux-driven spherical inspirals (orbits of approximately constant Boyer-Lindquist radius) of a spinning secondary into a Kerr black hole. We leverage recently found solutions for the motion of spinning test particles and compute the associated gravitational wave fluxes to linear order in the secondary spin. Next, we show that spherical orbits remain spherical under radiation reaction at linear order in spin, and derive the evolution of the orbital parameters throughout the inspiral. We implement a numerical scheme for waveform generation in the frequency domain and assess the impact of the secondary spin on the gravitational wave signal. In contrast to quasi-circular inspirals, we find that neglecting the secondary spin in spherical inspirals induces large mismatches in the waveforms that will plausibly be detectable by LISA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21148v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study black hole imaging in the context of geometrically thick accretion disks in Schwarzschild spacetime. By decomposing the emitting region into a set of one-dimensional luminous segments, each characterized by its inclination angle and inner radius, we construct transfer functions that capture key image features-namely, the direct image, lensing ring, and photon ring. This approach allows a unified treatment of disk geometry and viewing angle. We explore three regimes: optically thin, optically thick, and partially optically thick disks. For optically thin flows, increasing the disk thickness (characterized by the half-opening angle $\psi_0$) broadens the lensing ring, gradually bridging the photon ring and the direct image. The photon ring remains narrow, but its position robustly defines the innermost edge of the lensing structure. In the optically thick case, image features are primarily determined by the first intersection of traced light rays with the disk, and we provide analytical criteria for the presence of lensing and photon rings based on the critical deflection angles. For partially optically thick disks, we adopt a simplified radiative transport model and find a critical absorption coefficient $\chi \sim (6M\psi_0)^{-1}$ beyond which the image rapidly transitions from an optically thin- to thick-disk appearance. These results help clarify the respective roles of the photon and lensing rings across different disk configurations, and may offer a useful framework for interpreting future high-resolution black hole observations.</description>

Abstract: The Dymnikova black hole (BH) is a regular solution that interpolates between a de Sitter core near the origin and a Schwarzschild-like behavior at large distances. In this work, we investigate the properties of a Dymnikova BH immersed in a quintessential field, characterized by the state parameter $\omega$ and a normalization constant $c$. We explore the thermodynamic behavior, null geodesics, scalar quasinormal modes and shadow profiles for this model. Our analysis shows that the presence of quintessence alters the Hawking temperature and specific heat, leading to parameter-dependent phase transitions. The null geodesics and corresponding black hole shadows are also found to be sensitive to the model parameters, especially $\omega$ and $c$. This sensitivity influences light deflection and shadow size. Furthermore, we compute the scalar quasinormal modes and observe that quintessence tends to enhance the damping of the modes, indicating greater stability under perturbations.</description>

      <title>Prospects for joint multiband detection of intermediate-mass black holes by LGWA and the Einstein Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) detection offers a novel approach to exploring intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). The GW signals from IMBH mergers mainly fall in the decihertz frequency band. The lunar-based GW detector, the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA), exhibits high sensitivity in this band, making it particularly well-suited for detecting IMBHs. However, for lower-mass IMBHs, the late inspiral and merger signals enter the sensitive frequency range of ground-based GW detectors. In this work, we aim to explore how multi-band observations with LGWA and the third-generation ground-based GW detector, the Einstein Telescope (ET), can contribute to detecting the population of IMBHs. We consider three population distribution cases of IMBHs, including two population models based on astrophysical motivations and a uniform distribution, and compute the signal-to-noise ratios for LGWA, ET, and their combination to directly compare their capabilities in detecting IMBH mergers. Our results suggest that LGWA possesses strong detection capability for high-mass IMBH mergers. At redshift $z = 1$, LGWA's detection rate for IMBH binaries with primary masses above $5 \times 10^4~M_\odot$ is largely insensitive to orbital inclination and mass ratio. In contrast, ET is more suited for detecting IMBH binaries with primary masses below $10^3~M_\odot$. The multi-band observation of LGWA and ET possesses strong detection capabilities across the full IMBH mass spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the multi-band detection can significantly and effectively recover the IMBH population distributions. In summary, we conclude that the multi-band observations of LGWA and ET will provide powerful detection capabilities for IMBHs and are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of this important yet still poorly observed class of black holes.</description>

      <title>Heat Capacity and the Violation of Scaling Laws in Gravitational System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the scaling laws in gravitational system from the perspective of free energy landscape and the scaling hypothesis. It has been found that for some special black holes, their critical exponents $(0,1,2,3)$ are beyond the mean field theory, and more surprisingly violate the scaling laws. We find that the main reason for the violation of the scaling laws is that the heat capacity at constant volume $C_V$ is 0, so the critical exponent $\alpha$ is often treated as 0, which can not be derived from the scaling hypothesis. We also find that there is a symmetry violation for the two coexistence states $\omega_l$ and $\omega_s$.</description>

      <title>General Fourier expansion of post-Newtonian binary dynamics based on a quasi-Keplerian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have introduced a new method for computing gravitational-wave emission from nonspinning binaries which systematically unifies the various integrals arising in the Fourier expansions of post-Newtonian dynamics, providing a simple, practical scheme for calculations at arbitrary precision. Using this approach, we derived the full set of 3PN dynamical quantities and gravitational-wave Fourier modes and have released the corresponding numerical code as open source. Furthermore, when radiation-reaction effects is not included, we found that the tail contribution to the energy and angular momentum fluxes can be resummed into an exceptionally compact expression with the help of the new method. These advances pave the way for more convenient and accurate frequency-domain waveform modeling in the future.</description>

      <title>The shadows and photon rings of two minimal deformations of Schwarzschild black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper primarily investigates the optical characteristics of two minimal Schwarzschild black hole deformations, the Kazakov-Solodukhin and Ghosh-Kumar black holes, under different accretion models. The event horizon, photon sphere, and critical impact parameter of the former increase compared with the Schwarzschild black hole, but those of the latter decrease. The data from the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration are used to constrain the parameter ranges of the two black holes. In the case of spherical accretion, the quantum correction of Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole leads to the increase of black hole shadow size and the decrease of integrated intensity, while the shadow size of magnetically charged Ghosh-Kumar black hole decreases and the integrated intensity increases. The shadow radius of the black hole is independent of the spherical accretion models. For an optically and geometrically thin accretion disk, the integrated intensity is mainly contributed by direct emission, and the contributions of photon rings and lensed rings are very small. In addition, the photon rings and lensed rings of Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole are narrower, while those of Ghosh-Kumar black hole are wider. Whereas the Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole exhibits higher brightness, the Ghosh-Kumar black hole shows lower brightness. Additionally, a disk closer to the black hole correlates with a smaller shadow radius. This paper proposes a method to distinguish different black holes in a specific thin disk model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equations for the photon surface in spherical symmetry are worked out, starting from arXiv:gr-qc/0005050, in the most general dynamical setting. We show that the condition for a timelike hypersurface to be a photon surface can be reformulated as a non-autonomous dynamical system, whose analysis reveals that the same condition also holds when the surface is generated by a null radial geodesic.
  As an application, we consider a well-known model of a spherical dust cloud undergoing gravitational collapse. Comparing our findings with those in arXiv:1910.13758 we establish that the photon surface uniquely extends in the interior spacetime as a null hypersurface, allowing us to analytically investigate whether it covers the singularity developing in the LTB model.</description>

      <title>The thermodynamics of readout devices and semiclassical gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the common claim that nonlinear modifications of quantum theory necessarily violate the second law of thermodynamics. We focus on hypothetical extensions of quantum theory that contain readout devices. These black boxes provide a classical description of quantum states without perturbing them. They allow quantum state cloning, though in a way consistent with the relativistic no-signalling principle. We review the existence of such devices in the context of Moller-Rosenfeld semiclassical gravity, which postulates that the gravitational field remains classical and is sourced by the expectation value of a quantum energy-momentum tensor. We show that the definition of information in the models examined in this paper deviates from that given by von Neumann entropy, and that claims of second law violations based on the distinguishability of non-orthogonal states or on violations of uncertainty principles fail to hold in such theories.</description>

Abstract: As in the gravitational context, one of the most challenging open question in analogue black holes formed in Bose-Einstein condensates concerns the backreaction of Hawking-like radiation on the condensate and its subsequent evolution. In this work we derive the basic equations describing this backreaction within the density-phase formalism, which avoids infrared divergences and is particularly well suited to one-dimensional configurations.</description>

Abstract: We present a simplified review of inflationary cosmology across various modified gravity theories. These include models based on curvature, torsion, and non-metricity. We explore how scalar fields interact with different geometric quantities and how these interactions affect inflationary dynamics. Key cosmological features such as background evolution, reheating, and observable parameters are discussed. We also examine exotic scenarios inspired by string theory, extra dimensions, and non-local models. This work aims to connect theoretical models with observational data and future missions, offering guidance for exploring inflation beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Assessing signal cross talk between extreme-mass-ratio inspirals and Galactic binaries in LISA data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The future space-based gravitational wave observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, is expected to observe between 1-1000s extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) per year. Due to the simultaneous presence of other gravitational wave signals in the data, it can be challenging to detect EMRIs and accurately estimate their parameters. In this work, we investigate the interaction between a gravitational signal from an EMRI and millions of signals from inspiralling Galactic white dwarf binaries. We demonstrate that bright Galactic binaries can contaminate the detection and characterization of EMRIs. We perform Bayesian inference of EMRI parameters after removing resolvable Galactic binaries and confirm an accuracy comparable to that expected in Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>Non-linear causal bulk viscosity in Unified Dark Matter Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a bulk viscous unified dark matter scenario based on a nonlinear extension of the full causal Israel-Stewart theory. This framework allows the viscous fluid to remain far from equilibrium, an essential feature for a physically consistent description of viscosity-driven accelerated expansion. We adopt the standard parametrization for the bulk viscosity, $\xi = \xi_{0} \rho_{m}^{s}$, treating $s$ as a free parameter (in contrast to most previous works), and study the model in a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background. By reformulating the cosmological equations as an autonomous dynamical system, we obtain both asymptotic analytical solutions and a numerical characterization of the phase space. At early times, the viscous component can mimic a stiff fluid, while at intermediate epochs it behaves like dark matter. With a suitable choice of dynamical variables, the system admits three distinct classes of late-time attractors. Two of them are separated by a basin-boundary saddle point: (i) a generic quintessence solution for $s = 1/2$, which encompasses a de Sitter-like behavior when $\xi_{0}$ satisfies a specific relation involving the nonlinear parameters; (ii) a global exact de Sitter attractor for $s &lt; 1/2$; and (iii) a phantom-like solution that emerges for $s \ge 1/2$. In contrast to the generic $s \ne 1/2$ case, the $s = 1/2$ scenario exhibits a qualitatively different stability structure, allowing de Sitter and phantom attractors to coexist. All solutions respect entropy production, and cosmic acceleration emerges independently of $\xi_{0}$, relaxing the strong bounds $\xi_{0} \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$ required in Eckart-based viscous models.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Tidal Response of Non-rotating Black Holes: Connecting the MST Formalism and Worldline EFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The response of a black hole (BH) to tidal forces encodes key information about the underlying gravitational theory and affects the waveform of gravitational waves emitted during binary inspiral processes. In this paper, we analyze the dynamical tidal response of static and spherically symmetric BHs in a low-frequency regime within general relativity (GR), based on a matching between the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) methods for an analytical approach to BH perturbations and the worldline effective field theory (EFT) for an efficient and unified computation of the binary dynamics within the post-Newtonian regime. We show that the renormalized tidal response function is subject to inevitable ambiguities associated with the choice of renormalization scheme and with the initial condition of the renormalization flow equation. Once these ambiguities are fixed, we obtain scheme-dependent dynamical tidal Love numbers. We also discuss possible extensions of our formalism, including generic non-rotating compact objects (e.g., neutron stars) in GR and BHs in theories beyond GR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The status of a modification of General Relativity (GR) -- Spontaneously Broken Relativity (SBR) -- for merging gravity, dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) is presented. The modification is principally grounded on a multiscalar-metric concept of spacetime endowed with two dynamical structures: a basic metric and a set of the reversible multiscalar fields. The latter ones serve geometrically as exceptional dynamical coordinates among arbitrary kinematical/observer's ones and physically as a kind of gravitational Higgs fields producing possible spontaneous breaking of the symmetry (SSB) of relativity. The effective field theory (EFT) of the extended gravity based on the multiscalar-metric spacetime -- the metagravity -- is discussed and some of its particular realizations beyond GR as SBR are explicated. Physically, SBR results in appearance of massive tensor and scalar gravitons. Some of the emerging consequences, problems and prospects for SBR for future deeper unification of gravity with matter in the context of the relativity and internal symmetries breaking are shortly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new non-singular cosmological model matched to a Minkowski-core regular black hole by means of a modified Oppenheimer--Snyder framework. Its dynamics is studied in both dust-only and scalar-field scenarios, and compared with that of two other non-singular models as well as the classical standard cosmology. The results show that, although all three non-singular cosmologies share identical late-time behavior and allow for a natural embedding of inflation in the scalar-field setting, they exhibit qualitatively distinct non-singular features at very early times. In particular, the new cosmology approaches Minkowski spacetime in the limits of both the infinite past and the infinite future, thereby manifesting an intriguing symmetry between the two asymptotic regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by integrating the dilaton field (as a UV correction) with dRGT-like massive gravity (as an IR correction) into Einstein gravity, we investigate the thermodynamic and optical properties of black holes within this gravitational framework. We begin by reviewing the black hole solutions in Maxwell-dilaton-dRGT-like massive gravity, followed by an analysis of how various parameters influence on the asymptotical behavior of the spacetime and the event horizon of these black holes. In the subsequent section, we examine the conserved and thermodynamic quantities associated with these black holes, paying particular attention to the effects of parameters like $\beta$, $\alpha$, and the massive parameters ($\eta_{1}$ and $\eta_{2}$) on their local stability by simultaneously evaluating the heat capacity and temperature. We also adopt an alternative method to study phase transitions using geometrothermodynamics. Furthermore, we explore how the parameters of Maxwell-dilaton-dRGT-like massive gravity impacts the optical characteristics and radiative behavior of black holes. In particular, we analyze the effects of the dilaton coupling constant ($\alpha$), charge ($q$), the massive gravity parameter ($\eta_1$), and the graviton mass ($m_g$) on the radius of the photon sphere and the resulting black hole shadow. Moreover, the theoretical shadow radius is compared to the observational data from $Sgr A^*$. Additionally, we investigate the energy emission rate of these black holes, revealing that these parameters substantially influence the emission peak.</description>

      <title>Images from disk and spherical accretions of Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the shadow and optical appearance of the Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) illuminated by various static accretions. First, we find that as the dark matter parameter $\left|\alpha\right|$ increases, the fundamental characteristic quantities of the black hole, the event horizon $r_h$, the photon sphere radius $r_{ph}$, and the critical impact parameter $b_{ph}$ all increase, while the peak of the effective potential $V_{\text{eff}}$ decreases and shifts toward the direction of increasing $r$. In contrast, the magnetic charge parameter $g$ suppresses $r_h$, $r_{ph}$, and $b_{ph}$, while increases the peak of $V_{\text{eff}}$ and shifts it toward the direction of decreasing $r$. This indicates a competing effect between the dark matter parameter $\left|\alpha\right|$ and the magnetic charge parameter $g$ on the fundamental properties of the black hole. Furthermore, we use the EHT observational data to constrain the dark matter parameters $\alpha$ and find that the constraint range given by the supermassive black hole SgrA* is stricter than that of the black hole M87*. Finally, we investigate black hole images under different accretion models. The results reveal that both dark matter parameters $\alpha$ and accretion models significantly influence the black hole images. For larger dark matter parameters $\left|\alpha\right|$, the inner shadow or central faint illuminating region of the Bardeen black hole surrounded by PFDM is larger, but the bright ring of the image is fainter. This provides a potential method for us to distinguish between classical Bardeen black holes and Bardeen black holes surrounded by PFDM. These preliminary results may provide some clues for future investigations of dark matter using black hole shadows and images.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.02925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the status of the Weyl double copy relation for radiative solutions of the vacuum Einstein equations. We show that all type N vacuum solutions, which describe the radiation region of isolated gravitational systems with appropriate fall-off for the matter fields, admit a degenerate Maxwell field that squares to give the Weyl tensor. This relation defines a scalar that satisfies the wave equation on the background. We show that for non-twisting radiative solutions, the Maxwell field and the scalar also satisfy the Maxwell equation and the wave equation on Minkowski spacetime. Hence, non-twisting solutions have a straightforward double copy interpretation.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulation is making a significant impact on scientific research. The prevailing tendency of the field is to build quantum simulators that get closer to real-world systems of interest, in particular electronic materials. However, progress in the microscopic design also provides an opportunity for an orthogonal research direction: building quantum many-body systems beyond real-world limitations. This colloquium takes this perspective: Concentrating on synthetic quantum matter in non-standard lattice geometries, such as fractal lattices or quasicrystals, higher-dimensional or curved spaces, it aims at providing a fresh introduction to the field of quantum simulation aligned with recent trends across various quantum simulation platforms, including atomic, photonic, and electronic devices. We also shine light on the novel phenomena which arise from these geometries: Condensed matter physicists may appreciate the variety of different localization properties as well as novel topological phases which are offered by such exotic quantum simulators. But also in the search of quantum models for gravity and cosmology, quantum simulators of curved spaces can provide a useful experimental tool.</description>

      <title>Holographic R\'enyi $n\to 0$ entropy and Euclidean fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the holographic prescription for computing the refined R\'enyi entropies $\tilde S_n$ in the $n \to 0$ limit within the AdS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_d$ framework. This limit can be interpreted as a high-temperature regime with respect to the energy defined by the modular Hamiltonian of the state reduced to a subregion. To leading order in $n$, we find that the system attains local equilibrium and admits a CFT description in terms of a Euclidean, irrotational perfect fluid. This fluid exhibits vortex-like boundary conditions at the entangling surface. Guided by this physical picture, we construct an ansatz for the dual geometry in terms of the boundary fluid variables. We show that our anzats solves Einstein's equations coupled to a cosmic brane at leading order in $n$, in agreement with Dong's proposal for the holographic dual to the refined R\'enyi entropy. The resulting conical singularity, signaling the brane's location, can be understood from this perspective as the bulk extension of the boundary fluid vortices.</description>

      <title>Constraints Preserving Lax-Wendroff Flux Reconstruction for Relativistic Hydrodynamics with General Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of relativistic astrophysics, the ideal equation of state with a constant adiabatic index provides a poor approximation due to its inconsistency with relativistic kinetic theory. However, it is a common practice to use it for relativistic fluid flow equations due to its simplicity. Here we develop a high-order Lax-Wendroff flux reconstruction method on Cartesian grids for solving relativistic hydrodynamics equations with several general equations of state available in the literature. We also study the conversion from conservative to primitive variables, which depends on the equation of state in use, and provide an alternative method of conversion when the existing approach does not succeed. For the admissibility of the solution, we blend the high-order method with a low-order method on sub-cells and prove its physical admissible property in the case of all the equations of state used here. Lastly, we validate the scheme by several test cases having strong discontinuities, large Lorentz factor, and low density or pressure in one and two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Localized Gravity, de Sitter, and the Horizon Criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing de Sitter-like solutions in string theory remains challenging, prompting speculation about which specific feature might be responsible for their inconsistency in quantum gravity. In this work, we focus on the `Horizon Criterion', which identifies spacetimes as problematic if they exhibit cosmological horizons. In particular, we study the implications for spacetimes with dynamical boundaries. We argue that requiring inertial observers localized on an end-of-the-world (ETW) brane to be in causal contact with every other observer is too restrictive as there exist string-theoretic solutions without this property. Hence, if one does not want to abandon the idea of cosmological horizons being the fundamental issue with de Sitter, a refined condition is needed. The requirement that inertial, boundary-localized observers should be in causal contact with all other observers on the same ETW brane is such an appropriate refinement. We explore the consequences of this criterion for ETW branes whose energy density is governed by a scalar field, considering two cases: First, with a scalar field confined to the ETW brane, and second, with a bulk modulus subject to a brane-localized potential.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Potential Inflation in the ACT Era: From CMB to Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) favor a higher value of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ compared to the Planck data, challenging many well-established inflationary models. In this work, we investigate the viability of polynomial potential inflation in light of the latest ACT data, systematically analyzing cases from $n=2$ to $n=5$. By exploring the parameter space and deriving constraints on the model coefficients, we find that the cubic to quintic models can provide a good fit to the data, while the quadratic model struggles to simultaneously accommodate the ACT data and the requirement of sufficient inflation. Notably, the quintic case ($n=5$) not only matches cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations but also produces an inflection point that simultaneously triggers primordial black hole formation and generates a scalar-induced gravitational wave. These findings establish higher-order polynomial potentials as compelling frameworks and reconcile precision CMB measurements with multi-messenger probes of early-universe physics.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial scalar perturbations that reenter the horizon after inflation may induce a second-order Gravitational Wave spectrum with information about the primordial Universe on scales inaccessible to Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. In this work, we develop a general framework for the study of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ gravity, a theory that was proven to successfully realise inflation and quintessence, and consider the case of the Starobinsky-like model as an example. A regime of radiation domination with a subdominant matter component is assumed, allowing for a well-motivated perturbative approach to the gravity modifications. We calculate the kernel function and the density spectrum numerically and find accurate analytical expressions. The spectral density, which may be tested across a wide range of frequencies by upcoming Gravitational Wave experiments, is shown to differ from the General Relativity and metric $f(R)$ gravity predictions under certain conditions. We comment on previous results in the literature regarding the metric formulation and make special emphasis on the potential of these distinctive features of the spectrum to probe the two formalisms of gravity.</description>

      <title>Observation of entanglement in a cold atom analog of cosmological preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We observe entanglement between collective excitations of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a configuration analogous to particle production during the preheating phase of the early universe. In our setup, the oscillation of the inflaton field is mimicked by the transverse breathing mode of a cigar-shaped condensate, which parametrically excites longitudinal quasiparticles with opposite momenta. After a short modulation period, we observe entanglement of these pairs which reveals the role played by vacuum fluctuations in seeding the parametric growth, confirming the quantum origin of the excitations. As the system continues to evolve, we observe a decrease in correlations and a disappearance of non-classical features. These point towards future experimental probes of the late-time nonlinear regime where further analogies can be drawn with reheating, i.e. the thermalization of the post-inflationary Universe.</description>

      <title>Signature of polarized ultralight vector dark matter in pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate observational signatures of ultralight vector dark matter with masses $m \sim 10^{-24}$-$10^{-22}$ eV in pulsar timing arrays, taking into account general polarization states of the vector field. We find that vector dark matter induces pulsar timing residuals with nontrivial directional dependence, reflecting the anisotropic property and polarization structure specific to vector dark matter, unlike scalar dark matter. We also derive angular correlation curves of the timing residuals. Intriguingly, circular polarization of the vector dark matter enhances the quadrupole nature of the correlation curve, resulting in a more notable bending of the Hellings-Downs curve. The derived correlation curves offer a useful means to distinguish gravitational wave and dark matter contributions and to probe the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Lightcurve Features of Magnetar-Powered Superluminous Supernovae with Gravitational-Wave Emission and High-Energy Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a distinct class of stellar explosions, exhibiting peak luminosities 10-100 times brighter than those of normal SNe. Their extreme luminosities cannot be explained by the radioactive decay of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ and its daughter $^{56}\mathrm{Co}$ alone. Consequently, models invoking newly formed millisecond magnetars have been widely proposed, capable of supplying additional energy through magnetic dipole radiation. For these rapidly rotating magnetars, however, gravitational-wave (GW) emission may also contribute significantly to the spin-down, particularly during their early evolutionary stages. While high-energy photons initially remain trapped within the optically thick ejecta, they will eventually escape as the ejecta becomes transparent during the expansion, thereby influencing the late-time lightcurve. In this work, we adopt an analytical framework to systematically explore the combined effects of GW emission and high-energy leakage on the lightcurve of SLSNe. Compared to scenarios that neglect these processes, we find that for magnetars with initial spin periods of millisecond, the combined influence suppresses early-time luminosities but enhances late-time emission. We further investigate the effects of the neutron-star equation of state to the lightcurve, GW emission efficiency, ejecta mass, and other relevant quantities. Our results highlight the complex interplay between GW-driven spin-down and radiative transport in shaping the observable features of SLSNe, offering new insights into diagnosing the nature of their central engines.</description>

      <title>Stochastic inflation with gradient interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic inflation rests on the separate-universe approximation, i.e. the ability to describe long-wavelength fluctuations in an inflating universe as homogeneous perturbations of its background dynamics. Although this approximation is valid in most cases, it has been recently pointed out that it breaks down during transition periods between attractor and non-attractor phases. Such transitions are ubiquitous in single-field models giving rise to enhanced perturbations at small scales, that are required to form primordial black holes. The current inability to apply the stochastic-inflation program in such models is therefore one of the main obstacles to investigating the role of backreaction in primordial-black-hole scenarios. In this work, we show how gradient interactions can be incorporated in stochastic inflation, via a set of Langevin equations of higher dimension. We apply our formalism to a few cases of interest, including one with a sharp transition. In all cases, in the classical limit we show that gradient corrections as predicted from cosmological perturbation theory are properly recovered. We uncover the existence of a "pullback" effect by which the tails of the first-passage-time distributions are dampened by gradient interactions. We finally discuss the role of backreaction in the presence of gradient interactions.</description>

      <title>Analytic derivation of GW spectrum from bubble collisions in FLRW Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the analytic formula for the gravitational-wave spectrum from bubble collisions during a cosmological first-order phase transition, under the thin-wall and envelope approximations, by incorporating the effect of cosmic expansion in the FLRW metric. Along with presenting the complete analytic expression and corresponding numerical results, we also derive simplified formulas valid in the large- and small-$k$ limits, as well as in the Minkovski limit. The latter expansion reveals that the Minkovski approximation breaks down for $\beta / H_* \lesssim 10$, where $\beta$ denotes the inverse duration of the phase transition and $H_*$ the Hubble parameter at its completion. Furthermore, the next-to-leading-order term contributes about a $10\%$ correction for $\beta / H_* \sim 140$, a typical value for the electroweak phase transition.</description>

      <title>On the Imaginary Part of the Effective Action in de Sitter Spacetime with Different Regularization Schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The imaginary part of the effective action encodes vacuum instability and particle production in the background field. Two standard approaches are commonly used to derive it: the Bogoliubov method and the Green's function method, which are usually expected to agree. However, in de Sitter spacetime they yield different results. We revisit this problem by introducing explicit time and momentum cutoffs in the Green's function representation of the effective action. The apparent discrepancy is found to be due to the different limiting procedures in regularization, which reproduces the Bogoliubov result and the Green's function result respectively. Therefore, the two approaches are understood to be different regularization limits of the same expression, which clarifies the origin of their disagreement.</description>

      <title>Shadows of the Colossus: Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in a 10-million-body Globular Cluster Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (LVK) Collaboration has detected numerous binary black hole mergers with properties that challenge standard binary evolution scenarios, such as component masses above the pair-instability gap and high spin magnitudes. Dense stellar environments such as globular clusters provide a natural channel for producing such systems through hierarchical mergers, where black hole remnants formed in earlier mergers are retained in the cluster and undergo successive mergers. However, gravitational-wave recoil kicks often eject merger remnants from typical globular clusters, which limits hierarchical growth. Massive clusters with deeper potential wells, such as those found in giant elliptical galaxies like M87, may overcome this barrier, but direct simulations of such massive globular clusters remains computationally challenging. In this study, we present a 10-million-body cluster simulation performed with the $\texttt{Cluster Monte Carlo}$ ($\texttt{CMC}$) code, referred to as $\texttt{colossus}$, which serves as a proxy for the most massive low-metallicity globular clusters observed in the local Universe. This simulation demonstrates that extended chains of hierarchical mergers can occur in massive globular clusters, producing black holes up to fifth generation with masses approaching $250\,M_\odot$, comparable to the most massive LVK events observed to date (e.g., GW231123). Combining the $\texttt{colossus}$ simulation with the previous $\texttt{CMC Cluster Catalog}$, we develop a framework to extrapolate binary black hole merger predictions for the thousands of globular clusters seen in the Virgo Supercluster.</description>

      <title>Starobinsky Inflation and the Latest CMB Data: A Subtle Tension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Starobinsky inflation model and the impact of curvature corrections, particularly a cubic $R^3$ term, to assess their behavior in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). With the recent sixth data release (DR6), the scalar spectral index was measured to be $n_s=0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, which appears to exclude the pure Starobinsky model at approximately the $2\sigma$ level. In this paper, we implement the Starobinsky inflationary potential directly into the CLASS code, without relying on the slow-roll approximation, and we constrain the number of e-folds of inflation $N_k$ using a theoretically motivated range derived from reheating considerations and standard couplings between matter fields and gravity. We show that it is still possible to identify a significant region of parameter space where the Starobinsky model remains highly consistent with the latest observational data. While the pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation, we explore how including a cubic $R^3$ term can shift its predictions to better align with the Planck and ACT measurements.</description>

Abstract: Once again, dispute has arisen over the interpretation of proposed quantum information theory experiments to probe the quantum nature of gravity by testing for gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) between two spatially separated massive particles ([1] vs. [11,12]; further contributions in [7,9]). The confusion appears to reside in interpreting applications of a Hamiltonian formalism. But classical gravity cannot mediate entanglement on independent grounds. A Newton-Cartan analysis shows that if gravity is classical, a mediator, and entanglement is observed as an outcome of performing a GIE experiment, something other than gravity must have supplied the (virtual) force needed during the experiment to produce the effect.</description>
