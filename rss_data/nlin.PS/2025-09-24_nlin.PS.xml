      <title>Global Bifurcations and Pattern Formation in Target-Offender-Guardian Crime Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a reaction-advection-diffusion model of a target-offender-guardian system designed to capture interactions between urban crime and policing. Using Crandall-Rabinowitz bifurcation theory and spectral analysis, we establish rigorous conditions for both steady-state and Hopf bifurcations. These results identify critical thresholds of policing intensity at which spatially uniform equilibria lose stability, leading either to persistent heterogeneous hotspots or oscillatory crime-policing cycles. From a criminological perspective, such thresholds represent tipping points in guardian mobility: once crossed, they can lock neighborhoods into stable clusters of criminal activity or trigger recurrent waves of hotspot formation. Numerical simulations complement the theory, exhibiting stationary patterns, periodic oscillations, and chaotic dynamics. By explicitly incorporating law enforcement as a third interacting component, our framework extends classical two-equation models. It offers new tools for analyzing nonlinear interactions, bifurcations, and pattern formation in multi-agent social systems.</description>

      <title>Cusp solitons mediated by a topological nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinearity in the Schr\"odinger equation gives rise to rich phenomena such as soliton formation, modulational instability, and self-organization in diverse physical systems. Motivated by recent advances in engineering nonlinear gauge fields in Bose-Einstein condensates, we introduce a nonlinear Schr\"odinger model whose dynamics are dependent on the curvature of the wavefunction intensity and show that this has a direct link to a topological quantity from persistent homology. Our model energetically penalizes or favours the formation of local extrema and we demonstrate through numerical simulations that this topological nonlinearity leads to the emergence of robust, cusp-like soliton structures and supports flat-top beams which do not suffer from conventional modulational instability. These findings suggest that topological nonlinearities could serve as a versatile tool for controlling nonlinear waves in optics and Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Chimera states on m-directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest and has been widely analyzed, revealing several types of dynamical states. Most studies involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction from neighboring ones, modeled thus via symmetric networks. However, real-world systems often have non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. From previous studies, it is known that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while easier to be found when the latter are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called m-directed hypergraphs, and we show that, not only the higher-order topology allows the emergence of chimera states despite the nonreciprocal coupling, but also that chimera states can emerge because of the directionality. Finally, we compare the latter results with the ones resulting from non-reciprocal pairwise interactions: their elusiveness confirms that the observed phenomenon is thus due to the presence of higher-order interactions. The nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.</description>

      <title>Image Inpainting based on Visual-Neural-Inspired Specific Object-of-Interest Imaging Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional image inpainting methods operate on whole images. Drawing on cortical processing principles this study addresses the bottlenecks of conventional holistic image inpainting methods--susceptibility to informational redundancy and low computational efficiency under occlusions and complex backgrounds, by proposing a novel framework: "Specific Object-of-Interest Imaging". This stage extracts and encodes object-level representations from complex scenes, generating semantic and structural priors that can be seamlessly integrated into any inpainting framework. On our Teapot object dataset, Elephant object dataset, Giraffe object dataset and Zebra object dataset experimental validation demonstrates--compared with the repair model without using this method, the repair model using this method has more advantages, across metrics including SSIM, PSNR, MAE, and LPIPS, while maintaining robustness in extreme scenarios (low illumination, high noise, multi-object occlusion, motion blur). Theoretical analysis integrated with cognitive neuroscience perspectives reveals profound correlations between the "object precedence perception" mechanism and dynamic feature modulation in visual cortices (V1--V4). We demonstrate that incorporating Stage I significantly enhances object consistency and semantic coherence across various mainstream inpainting models. This work not only achieves efficient and precise target-centric imaging but also pioneers interdisciplinary pathways bridging brain-inspired computational frameworks with advanced image inpainting techniques.</description>
