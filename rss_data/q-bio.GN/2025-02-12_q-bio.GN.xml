      <title>Whole-Genome Phenotype Prediction with Machine Learning: Open Problems in Bacterial Genomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we identify causal genetic mechanisms that govern bacterial traits? Initial efforts entrusting machine learning models to handle the task of predicting phenotype from genotype return high accuracy scores. However, attempts to extract any meaning from the predictive models are found to be corrupted by falsely identified "causal" features. Relying solely on pattern recognition and correlations is unreliable, significantly so in bacterial genomics settings where high-dimensionality and spurious associations are the norm. Though it is not yet clear whether we can overcome this hurdle, significant efforts are being made towards discovering potential high-risk bacterial genetic variants. In view of this, we set up open problems surrounding phenotype prediction from bacterial whole-genome datasets and extending those to learning causal effects, and discuss challenges that impact the reliability of a machine's decision-making when faced with datasets of this nature.</description>

      <title>GENERator: A Long-Context Generative Genomic Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in DNA sequencing technologies have significantly improved our ability to decode genomic sequences. However, the prediction and interpretation of these sequences remain challenging due to the intricate nature of genetic material. Large language models (LLMs) have introduced new opportunities for biological sequence analysis. Recent developments in genomic language models have underscored the potential of LLMs in deciphering DNA sequences. Nonetheless, existing models often face limitations in robustness and application scope, primarily due to constraints in model structure and training data scale. To address these limitations, we present GENERator, a generative genomic foundation model featuring a context length of 98k base pairs (bp) and 1.2B parameters. Trained on an expansive dataset comprising 386B bp of eukaryotic DNA, the GENERator demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both established and newly proposed benchmarks. The model adheres to the central dogma of molecular biology, accurately generating protein-coding sequences that translate into proteins structurally analogous to known families. It also shows significant promise in sequence optimization, particularly through the prompt-responsive generation of promoter sequences with specific activity profiles. These capabilities position the GENERator as a pivotal tool for genomic research and biotechnological advancement, enhancing our ability to interpret and predict complex biological systems and enabling precise genomic interventions.</description>

      <title>Life-Code: Central Dogma Modeling with Multi-Omics Sequence Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins are fundamental to biological processes, as illustrated by the central dogma of molecular biology. While modern biological pre-trained models have achieved great success in analyzing these macromolecules individually, their interconnected nature remains under-explored. In this paper, we follow the guidance of the central dogma to redesign both the data and model pipeline and offer a comprehensive framework, Life-Code, that spans different biological functions. As for data flow, we propose a unified pipeline to integrate multi-omics data by reverse-transcribing RNA and reverse-translating amino acids into nucleotide-based sequences. As for the model, we design a codon tokenizer and a hybrid long-sequence architecture to encode the interactions of both coding and non-coding regions with masked modeling pre-training. To model the translation and folding process with coding sequences, Life-Code learns protein structures of the corresponding amino acids by knowledge distillation from off-the-shelf protein language models. Such designs enable Life-Code to capture complex interactions within genetic sequences, providing a more comprehensive understanding of multi-omics with the central dogma. Extensive Experiments show that Life-Code achieves state-of-the-art performance on various tasks across three omics, highlighting its potential for advancing multi-omics analysis and interpretation.</description>

      <title>CausalGeD: Blending Causality and Diffusion for Spatial Gene Expression Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data is crucial for understanding gene expression in spatial context. Existing methods for such integration have limited performance, with structural similarity often below 60\%, We attribute this limitation to the failure to consider causal relationships between genes. We present CausalGeD, which combines diffusion and autoregressive processes to leverage these relationships. By generalizing the Causal Attention Transformer from image generation to gene expression data, our model captures regulatory mechanisms without predefined relationships. Across 10 tissue datasets, CausalGeD outperformed state-of-the-art baselines by 5- 32\% in key metrics, including Pearson's correlation and structural similarity, advancing both technical and biological insights.</description>

      <title>Interpreting artificial neural networks to detect genome-wide association signals for complex traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating the genetic architecture of complex diseases is challenging due to the multifactorial and interactive landscape of genomic and environmental influences. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants for multiple complex traits, conventional statistical approaches can be limited by simplified assumptions such as linearity and lack of epistasis in models. In this work, we trained artificial neural networks to predict complex traits using both simulated and real genotype-phenotype datasets. We extracted feature importance scores via different post hoc interpretability methods to identify potentially associated loci (PAL) for the target phenotype and devised an approach for obtaining p-values for the detected PAL. Simulations with various parameters demonstrated that associated loci can be detected with good precision using strict selection criteria. By applying our approach to the schizophrenia cohort in the Estonian Biobank, we detected multiple loci associated with this highly polygenic and heritable disorder. There was significant concordance between PAL and loci previously associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, with enrichment analyses of genes within the identified PAL predominantly highlighting terms related to brain morphology and function. With advancements in model optimization and uncertainty quantification, artificial neural networks have the potential to enhance the identification of genomic loci associated with complex diseases, offering a more comprehensive approach for GWAS and serving as initial screening tools for subsequent functional studies.</description>
