      <title>Optimal Capital Deployment Under Stochastic Deal Arrivals: A Continuous-Time ADP Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose you are a fund manager with \$100 million to deploy and two years to invest it. A deal comes across your desk that looks appealing but costs \$50 million -- half of your available capital. Should you take it, or wait for something better? The decision hinges on the trade-off between current opportunities and uncertain future arrivals. This work formulates the problem of capital deployment under stochastic deal arrivals as a continuous-time Markov decision process (CTMDP) and solves it numerically via an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach. We model deal economics using correlated lognormal distributions for multiples on invested capital (MOIC) and deal sizes, and model arrivals as a nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP). Our approach uses quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling to efficiently approximate the continuous-time Bellman equation for the value function over a discretized capital grid. We present an interpretable acceptance policy, illustrating how selectivity evolves over time and as capital is consumed. We show in simulation that this policy outperforms a baseline that accepts any affordable deal exceeding a fixed hurdle rate.</description>

      <title>Estimating Covariance for Global Minimum Variance Portfolio: A Decision-Focused Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization constitutes a cornerstone of risk management by quantifying the risk-return trade-off. Since it inherently depends on accurate parameter estimation under conditions of future uncertainty, the selection of appropriate input parameters is critical for effective portfolio construction. However, most conventional statistical estimators and machine learning algorithms determine these parameters by minimizing mean-squared error (MSE), a criterion that can yield suboptimal investment decisions. In this paper, we adopt decision-focused learning (DFL) - an approach that directly optimizes decision quality rather than prediction error such as MSE - to derive the global minimum-variance portfolio (GMVP). Specifically, we theoretically derive the gradient of decision loss using the analytic solution of GMVP and its properties regarding the principal components of itself. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we show that prediction-focused estimation methods may fail to produce optimal allocations in practice, whereas DFL-based methods consistently deliver superior decision performance. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of DFL's mechanism in GMVP construction, focusing on its volatility reduction capability, decision-driving features, and estimation characteristics.</description>

      <title>A 4% withdrawal rate for retirement spending, derived from a discrete-time model of stochastic returns on assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What grounds the rule of thumb that a(n American) retiree can safely withdraw 4% of their initial retirement wealth in their first year of retirement, then increase that rate of consumption with inflation? I investigate that question with a discrete-time model of returns to a retirement portfolio consumed at a rate that grows by $s$ per period. The model hinges on the parameter $\gamma$, an $s$-adjusted rate of return to wealth, derived from the first 2-4 moments of the portfolio's probability distribution of returns; for a retirement lasting $t$ periods the model recommends a rate of consumption of $\gamma / (1 - (1 - \gamma)^t)$. Estimation of $\gamma$ (and hence of the implied rate of spending down in retirement) reveals that the 4% rule emerges from adjusting high expected rates of return down for: consumption growth, the variance in (and kurtosis of) returns to wealth, the longevity risk of a retiree potentially underestimating $t$, and the inclusion of bonds in retirement portfolios without leverage. The model supports leverage of retirement portfolios dominated by the S&amp;P 500, with leverage ratios $&gt; 1.6$ having been historically optimal under the model's approximations. Historical simulations of 30-year retirements suggest that the model proposes withdrawal rates having roughly even odds of success, that leverage greatly improves those odds for stocks-heavy portfolios, and that investing on margin could have allowed safe withdrawal rates $&gt; 6$% per year.</description>
