      <title>Unbiased estimation of second-order parameter sensitivities for stochastic reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic models for chemical reaction networks are increasingly popular in systems and synthetic biology. These models formulate the reaction dynamics as Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs) whose propensities are parameterized by a vector $\theta$ and parameter sensitivities are introduced as derivatives of their expected outputs with respect to components of the parameter vector. Sensitivities characterise key properties of the output like robustness and are also at the heart of numerically efficient optimisation routines like Newton-type algorithms used in parameter inference and the design of of control mechanisms. Currently the only unbiased estimator for second-order sensitivities is based on the Girsanov transform and it often suffers from high estimator variance. We develop a novel estimator for second-order sensitivities by first rigorously deriving an integral representation of these sensitivities. We call the resulting method the Double Bernoulli Path Algorithm and illustrate its efficiency through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Optimal network sizes for most robust Turing patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many cellular patterns exhibit a reaction-diffusion component, suggesting that Turing instability may contribute to pattern formation. However, biological gene-regulatory pathways are more complex than simple Turing activator-inhibitor models and generally do not require fine-tuning of parameters as dictated by the Turing conditions. To address these issues, we employ random matrix theory to analyze the Jacobian matrices of larger networks with robust statistical properties. Our analysis reveals that Turing patterns are more likely to occur by chance than previously thought and that the most robust Turing networks have an optimal size, surprisingly consisting only of a handful of molecular species, thus significantly increasing their identifiability in biological systems. This optimal size emerges from a tradeoff between the highest stability in small networks and the greatest instability with diffusion in large networks. Furthermore, we find that with multiple immobile nodes, differential diffusion ceases to be important for Turing patterns. Our findings may inform future synthetic biology approaches and provide insights into bridging the gap to complex developmental pathways.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics of Non-Ideal Reaction-Diffusion Systems: Implications for Active Self-Organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework describing the dynamics and thermodynamics of open non-ideal reaction-diffusion systems, which embodies Flory-Huggins theories of mixtures and chemical reaction network theories. Our theory elucidates the mechanisms underpinning the emergence of self-organized dissipative structures in these systems. It evaluates the dissipation needed to sustain and control them, discriminating the contributions from each reaction and diffusion process with spatial resolution. It also reveals the role of the reaction network in powering and shaping these structures. We identify particular classes of networks in which diffusion processes always equilibrate within the structures, while dissipation occurs solely due to chemical reactions. The spatial configurations resulting from these processes can be derived by minimizing a kinetic potential, contrasting with the minimization of the thermodynamic free energy in passive systems. This framework opens the way to investigating the energetic cost of phenomena such as liquid-liquid phase separation, coacervation, and the formation of biomolecular condensates.</description>
