      <title>Evaporating black holes in de Sitter expanding universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of evaporating black holes are constructed using the new solutions of Einstein's equations with perfect fluid in space-times with FLRW asymptotic behaviour derived recently [I. I. Cotaescu, Eur. Phys. J. C (2022) 82:86]. The dynamics of these models is due exclusively to the geometries defined by dynamical metric tensors without resorting to additional hypotheses or thermodynamic considerations. During evaporation the black hole mass dissipates into a cloud of dust which replace the black hole while the background expands tending to the asymptotic one.</description>

      <title>Zero Values of the TOV Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis calculates the special-relativistic internal energy of a non-interacting gas. We derive an equation of state (EoS) which we apply to the Tollmann-Oppenheimer Volkoff (TOV) equation. Furthermore we present numerical results of the TOV equation for various configurations of a polytropic EoS. These results show that the zero values of the TOV equation compared to its non-relativistic counterpart, the Lane-Emden (LE) equation, are smaller for identical parameters. We present initial developments to a proof of this theorem. Furthermore, an additional exact solution and index $n=2$ of the LE equation was discovered.</description>

      <title>Influence of Observer{}'s Inclination and Spacetime Structure on Photon Ring Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of the near-horizon regions of BHs, particularly the images captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration, have greatly advanced our understanding of gravity in extreme conditions. These images reveal a bright, ring-like structure surrounding the central dark area of supermassive BHs, created by the images of unstable photon orbits. As observational capabilities improve, future studies are expected to resolve higher-order rings, providing new opportunities to test gravity through observables such as the Lyapunov exponent, time delay, and azimuthal shift. These observables offer valuable insights into the structure of spacetime, BH properties, and the inclination of the observer. In this study, we employ a non-perturbative and non-parametric framework to examine how these observables change with deviations from the no-hair theorem and varying inclinations. We focus particularly on polar observers, which are highly relevant for the supermassive compact object at the centre of the galaxy M87. Our analysis explores how each of these observables can reveal information about the structure of spacetime and the morphology and existence of the ergosphere and event horizon. Furthermore, we illustrate this characterization for several specific alternative spacetimes, investigating how these current and potential future measurements, including those of the shadow size, can provide direct insights into the spin parameter values for each of these spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Null Stream Based Third-generation-ready Glitch Mitigation for Gravitational Wave Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational Wave (GW) detectors routinely encounter transient noise bursts, known as glitches, which are caused by either instrumental or environmental factors. Due to their high occurrence rate, glitches can overlap with GW signals, as in the notable case of GW170817, the first detection of a binary neutron star merger. Accurate reconstruction and subtraction of these glitches is a challenging problem that must be addressed to ensure that scientific conclusions drawn from the data are reliable. This problem will intensify with third-generation observatories like the Einstein Telescope (ET) due to their higher detection rates of GWs and the longer duration of signals within the sensitivity band of the detectors. Robust glitch mitigation algorithms are, therefore, crucial for maximizing the scientific output of next-generation GW observatories. For the first time, we demonstrate how the null stream inherent in ET's unique triangular configuration can be leveraged by state-of-the-art glitch characterization methodology to essentially undo the effect of glitches for the purpose of estimating the parameters of the source. The null stream based approach enables characterization and subtraction of glitches that occur arbitrarily close to the peak of the signal without any significant effect on the quality of parameter measurements, and achieves an order of magnitude computational speed-up compared to when the null stream is not available. By contrast, without the null stream, significant biases can occur in the glitch reconstruction, which deteriorate the quality of subsequent measurements of the source parameters. This demonstrates a clear edge which the null stream can offer for precision GW science in the ET era.</description>

      <title>The Palatini formalism of the $f(R,\mathcal{L}_{m},T)$ theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first formulation of the recently proposed $f(R,\mathcal{L}_m,T)$ theory of gravity within the Palatini formalism, a well-known alternative variational approach where the metric and connection are treated as independent variables. By applying this formalism, we derive a new set of field equations that exhibit, as expected, distinct properties compared to their metric formalism counterparts. We particularly present the Newtonian limit of this formalism, as well as the resulting Friedmann-like equations. We highlight that potential observational signatures may distinguish between the metric and Palatini frameworks. Our results open new pathways for exploring the phenomenology of modified gravity theories and their testability with observational data.</description>

      <title>How parameter constraining can influence the mass accretion process of a Black Hole in the Generalized Rastall Gravity Theory ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes, one of the greatest enigmas of our Universe, are usually quite challenging to decipher. This work is dedicated to observing the changes in the mass of a non-singular black hole with the evolution of the Universe in the generalized Rastall gravity framework when we consider the effects of parameter constraining on it. We examined two recently developed dynamical dark-energy models~:~Chaudhary-Bouali-Debnath-Roy-Mustafa-type parameterization~and~Chaudhary-Debnath-Mustafa-Maurya-Atamurotov-type parameterization. Starting with the concept and fundamental equations of the generalized Rastall gravity theory, we have introduced the two models and their equations of state, energy density equations, and the corresponding Hubble parameter equations, respectively. Next, we have constrained the required parameters using the MCMC analysis. Then, we discussed the non-singular black holes from the perspective of generalized Rastall gravity and some of their necessary properties one by one. Finally, we have pursued the goal of our work, analyzing the mass accretion process after considering the parameter constraining effects. In this quest, we obtained the mass equation for both models in terms of the redshift. Representing the results graphically, we can infer that the accretion of both Chaudhary-Bouali-Debnath-Roy-Mustafa-type dark energy and Chaudhary-Debnath-Mustafa-Maurya-Atamurotov-type dark energy will eventually lead to an increase in the mass of the black hole during the evolution of the universe in the context of the generalized Rastall gravity theory, which exhibits the true nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced entanglement entropy of gravitational wave detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on the projective measurement of gravitons increasingly supports Dysons conclusions that the detection of single gravitons is not physically possible. It is therefore prudent to consider alternative signatures of non-classicality in gravitational wave detections to determine if gravity is quantized. Coincident multiple detector operations make it possible to consider the bipartite measurement-induced entanglement, in the detection process, as a signature of non-classicality. By developing a model of measurement-induced entanglement, based on a fixed number of gravitons for the bipartite system, we demonstrate that the entanglement entropy is on the order of a few percent of the mean number of gravitons interacting with the detectors. The bipartite measurement-induced entanglement is part of the detection process, which avoids the challenges associated with developing signatures of production-induced entanglement, due to the extremely low gravitational wave detector efficiencies. The calculation of normalized measurement-induced entanglement entropy demonstrates the potential of developing physically meaningful signatures of non-classicality based on bipartite detections of gravitational radiation. This result is in stark contrast to the discouraging calculations based on single-point detections.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the massless Dirac field in 1+1D curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating the nature of quantum fields in diverse spacetime backgrounds offers valuable insights for the fundamental comprehension of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Here we introduce a novel method for mapping the massless Dirac equation in 1+1D curved spacetime to a controllable quantum simulation model, applicable to various observers' perspectives. We perform numerical simulations of Simpson spacetime and calculate tunneling rates in Painleve and Schwarzschild coordinates, which align closely with theoretical predictions of Hawking radiation. Additionally, we show the transition of Simpson spacetime from a regular black hole to a wormhole as the parameter $"a &gt; r_s"$. This method facilitates the study of spacetime from various coordinate perspectives (observers), providing deeper insights and understanding.</description>

      <title>A Study of Black Holes in F(R)-ModMax Gravity: Shadow and Gravitational Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of astrophysical phenomena like black hole shadows is an effective approach to properly understand the modified gravity and explore its validity. Motivated by recent astrophysical observations, we consider a black hole (BH) in F(R)-ModMax gravity and study the optical features such as the shadow geometrical shape, energy emission rate, and deflection of light. More specifically, we show how the variation of the parameters of the model imprints specific signatures on these optical quantities. In the following, we consider such black holes as supermassive BH and evaluate the parameters of the model with shadow size estimates done by the observations of M87* from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). According to our findings, no results consistent with EHT data are observed for AdS black holes in $F(R)$-ModMax gravity, while in the case of dS black holes, the resulting shadow is consistent with M87* shadow in a limited region of parameters.</description>

      <title>Some optical properties of rotating wormhole in Bopp-Podolsky electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a static wormhole in Bopp-Podolsky electrodynamics and convert it into its rotating counterpart by reducing it into Morris-Thorne form. We further study the null geodesics and effective potential along with the shadows for inner and outer unstable orbits for specific choices of parameters. It is found that for some cases smooth shadow curves are formed and for a few cases, the shadows formed are cuspy. All parameters have a significant impact on the shadows except for the parameter $b$ when either $a$ or $Q$ are kept small. We also analyze the gravitational lensing in the strong regime, considering that the observer and the source are on opposite sides of the throat. For this situation, we explore in detail the behavior of the deflection angle, Einstein rings and lensing observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a new general solution for the gravitational field equations in quantum fluctuation modified gravity, which reduces to different classes of black holes surrounded by fluids, by taking some specific values of the parameter of the equation of state. We discuss the strong energy condition in a general way and also for some special cases of different fluids. In addition, the Hawking temperature associated to the horizons of solutions and constraints on the parameter characterizing the fluctuation of metric are taken into account in our analysis.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two analytical models of gravitational collapse toward the Schwarzschild black hole, starting from the interior of the revisited Schwarzschild solution recently reported in [Phys. Rev. D 109, 104032 (2024)]. Both models satisfy some energy conditions at all times as long as the collapse is slower than some limit. While a singularity of the Schwarzschild black hole at the origin ($R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}R^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}\sim r^{-6}$) forms immediately after the start of the collapse in one model, such a singularity never appear at finite time during the collapse (except $t\to\infty$) in the other model. The scheme used shows great potential for studying in detail the appearance of singularities in general relativity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently it was demonstrated that by adding to the Einstein-Hilbert action a series in powers of the curvature invariants with specially chosen coefficients one can obtain a theory of gravity which has spherically symmetric solutions describing regular black holes. Its reduced action depends on a function of one of the basic curvature invariants of the corresponding metric. In this paper we study a generalization of this model to the case when this function depends on all the basic curvature invariants. We show that the metrics which are solutions of such a model possess a universal scaling property. We demonstrate that there exists a special class of such models for which the "master" equation basic curvature invariant is a linear second order ordinary differential equation. We specify a domain in the space of parameters of the model for which the corresponding solutions describe regular static spherically symmetric black holes and study their properties.</description>

      <title>Entropic uncertainty and quantum non-classicality of Unruh-Dewitt detectors in relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An object moving with the acceleration will change the temperature of environment around it, because of the presence of the Unruh thermal effect. In this work, we investigate the impact of Unruh thermal noise on the quantum-memory-assisted {entropic} uncertainty and quantum correlation regarding a pair of Unruh-Dewitt detectors. Specifically, we examine how the acceleration, the coupling strength between the external field and the detector, and the initial state affect the uncertainty and the system's quantum discord. It turns out that the Unruh effect will result in the loss of the systemic quantumness and inflation of the uncertainty. Moreover, it is revealed that the uncertainty is reversely correlated with the system's quantum discord. Thereby, it is believed that our investigations provide new insights into understanding the behavior of objects in the relativistic background.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet (EGB) gravity models, the slow-roll approximation was extended taking into account the first order of slow-roll parameter $\delta_1 =-2\,H^2\,\xi^\prime/U_0$ proportional to derivative of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $\xi$ with respect to e-folds. Such extensions lead to the question about accuracy of potential reconstruction during attractors generalization in the EGB gravity. We reconstruct models in the both extended slow-roll approximations, compare them with the exact expressions and the standard slow-roll approximation.</description>

      <title>The $SO(1,4)$ flux-balance laws of de Sitter at quadrupolar order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear solution for quadrupolar perturbations around de Sitter spacetime was recently constructed. In this paper, we provide the flux-balance laws for each background symmetry (dilatations, rotations, spatial translations and cosmological boosts) in terms of source moments at quadrupolar order. We write the dilatation flux-balance law in two distinct ways, which allows to contrast two distinct proposals for the negative definite energy flux. The standard Poincar\'e flux balance laws at future null infinity are recovered in the flat limit of the $SO(1,4)$ flux-balance laws.</description>

      <title>Shadow images of regular black hole with finite boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular black hole is one of the bottom-up solutions designed to eliminate the singularity at the center of black holes. Its horizonless solution has gained interest recently to model ultracompact star. Despite interesting, this proposal is problematic due to the absence of a well-defined boundary. In this work, we introduce a novel regular black hole model inspired by the Hayward black hole, incorporating additional terms to define a clear and well-defined `surface' radius $R$. We analyze the null geodesics around the object, both horizonful and horizonless configurations, by studying the photon effective potential. We further simulate the shadow images of the object surrounded by a thin accretion disk. Our results indicate that for $R &gt; 3M$ the horizonfull shadow differs slightly from that of a Schwarzschild black hole. In the horizonless configuration, we identify distinct inner light ring structures near the central region of the shadow image, which differ from those observed in horizonless Hayward black holes.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scalar and tensor perturbations with a scalar field: quadratic-order effective energy-momentum tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the scalar and tensor modes of the gravitational perturbation in the presence of a scalar field which describes inflation. We investigate the back-reaction of the perturbations to the background by studying the effective energy-momentum tensor (2EMT) which is the second order constructed by the quadratic terms of the linear perturbations. 2EMT is gauge dependent due to the scalar mode. We obtain 2EMT in the slow-roll stage of inflation, and get its cosmological expressions in three (longitudinal, spatially flat, and comoving) gauge conditions. We find that the pure scalar-mode part in 2EMT is stronger in the short-wavelength limit, while the parts involved with the tensor mode (the pure tensor-mode part and the scalar-tensor coupled part) are stronger in the long-wavelength limit.</description>

      <title>A long freeze is hard to achieve in the presence of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain holographic dark energy (HDE) models allow for the possibility of a ``long freeze,'' in which the scale factor evolves to a constant in the long-time limit. Here we extend previous calculations by adding a nonrelativistic matter component. The addition of a matter component tends to destroy the long freeze behavior, driving the universe to recollapse. Long freeze evolution is still possible, but only for a limited set of HDE models.</description>

      <title>Linearized gravitational waves in de Sitter space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a brief note on a recently flagged issue \cite{CHK} regarding the precise characterization of quadrupolar truncation of the linearized gravitational waves in de Sitter space-time. An apparent inconsistency was noted while transforming the linearized solution truncated to quadrupolar contribution to the Bondi-Sachs form. A consistent truncation was identified as one where the transformation of the truncated solution does not generate logarithmic terms inadmissible in the Bondi-Sachs asymptotic form.
  I point out the role of the gauge conditions and the solution of the homogeneous equation in obviating the apparent inconsistency issue.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in massive gravity: Waveforms generated by a particle plunging into a black hole and the excitation of quasinormal modes and quasibound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the aim of testing massive gravity in the context of black hole physics, we investigate the gravitational radiation emitted by a massive particle plunging into a Schwarzschild black hole from slightly below the innermost stable circular orbit. To do so, we first construct the quasinormal and quasibound resonance spectra of the spin-2 massive field for odd and even parity. Then, we compute the waveforms produced by the plunging particle and study their spectral content. This allows us to highlight and interpret important phenomena in the plunge regime, including (i) the excitation of quasibound states, with particular emphasis on the amplification and slow decay of the post-ringdown phase of the even-parity dipolar mode due to harmonic resonance; (ii) during the adiabatic phase, the waveform emitted by the plunging particle is very well described by the waveform emitted by the particle living on the ISCO, and (iii) the regularized waveforms and their unregularized counterparts constructed from the quasinormal mode spectrum are in excellent agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a general procedure for calculating the gravitational wave background (GWB) from cosmic string loops whose typical shape evolves over time, as in gravitational backreaction. Using the results of a large-scale study of numerical gravitational backreaction on Nambu-Goto cosmic string loops, we construct GWBs of backreacted cosmic strings for a range of tensions and frequencies of cosmological interest, and compare them to current and upcoming gravitational wave detectors. The GWBs are lower than prior predictions by anywhere from a few percent to around 30\%, depending on the frequency and tension in question.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the behavior of quantum particles in weak gravitational fields. We examine scalar and spinor particles, showing that these quantum particles in weak gravitational fields follow geodesic trajectories, aligning with classical expectations. Further, we explore the impact of gravitational fields on Yukawa interaction $\lambda \bar{\Psi} \Phi \Psi$, revealing that Feynman diagrams are modified due to the curvature, affecting propagators and interaction dynamics. The presence of spatially-dependent factors in propagators underscores the localized nature of gravitational effects on particle interactions.</description>

      <title>Gravitization Equation and Zero Energy Momentum Tensor with Cancellation Law in Gravitational Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze essential properties about gravitational quantum field theory (GQFT) grounded on spin gauge symmetry by taking the general theory of quantum electrodynamics as example. A constraint equation for the field strength of gravigaiuge field is obtained to be as gravitization equation in spin-related gravigauge spacetime, which indicates how the gravitational effect emerges from non-commutative relation of gravigauge derivative operator. By representing the action in Minkowski spacetime, we show that translational invariance leads to zero energy momentum tensor in GQFT when applying for equations of motion for all basic fields including gravigauge field, which extends conservation law of energy momentum tensor in quantum field theory to cancellation law of energy momentum tensor in GQFT. An equivalence between general gravitational equation and zero energy momentum tensor is naturally resulted in GQFT.</description>

Abstract: We probe four dimensional accelerating black holes with D-brane and build up the notion of metallic holography for spacetime with negative cosmological constant. We explore various thermodynamic entities associated with the boundary QFT at low temperatures and finite chemical potential. The DC conductivity in the boundary QFT is enhanced due to the effects of black hole acceleration in the bulk counterpart. We further compute resistivity in different temperature regime, which reveals a new quantum liquid phase with dynamic critical exponent $ z=3 $.</description>

      <title>The Gravito-Phononic Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The photo-electric effect was a historic milestone in the development of quantum theory, revealing the first evidence of discrete energy of the electromagnetic field through hallmark signatures such as the threshold frequency, intensity-independent energy transfer, and the near instantaneous ejection of photo-electrons. In this work, we revisit the photo-electric effect through the lens of semi-classical, quantum, and neo-classical models to explore their implications on energy conservation and discrete photon exchange. We extend this analysis to include the gravito-phononic effect through modelling energy transfer between coupled harmonic oscillators, rather than traditional atom-field interactions. Our approach demonstrates that two coupled harmonic oscillators, under a beam-splitter interaction, can exhibit hallmark signatures analogous to the photo-electric effect, including resonance conditions and quantised energy absorption. We discuss the implications of this model for the recently proposed gravito-phononic detections of single gravitons. This further clarifies that a gravitational version of the photo-electric effect, modelled as discrete energy transfer between harmonic oscillators can provide the first evidence of the graviton.</description>

Abstract: The curvaton paradigm can realise a part of or all the observed curvature perturbation. Based on the stochastic formalism of inflation and closed-form exact distributions therein, the distribution of the curvature perturbation is presented in an analytical manner by identifying a test field with a curvaton. The parameter space consisting of the decay rate and the mass of the curvaton is studied to discuss the probability that the curvaton can contribute to the curvature perturbation in a non-negligible way.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by recent proposals for detecting gravitational waves by using Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), we investigate the interplay between these two phenomena. A gravitational wave induces a phase shift in the fidelity amplitude of the many-body quantum state. We study the enhancement of the phase shift in the case of Bose condensates confined by an anisotropic harmonic potential, considering both ideal and interacting BEC.</description>

      <title>General parametrization for energy density of quintessence field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general parametrization for energy density of a quintessence field, a minimally coupled canonical scalar field which rolls down slowly during the late time. This parametrization can mimic all classes of quintessence dynamics, namely scaling-freezing, tracker and thawing dynamics for any redshift. For thawing dynamics the parametrization needs two free parameters while for scaling-freezing and tracker dynamics it needs at least four free parameters. More parameters make the model less interesting from the observational data analysis point of view but as we expect more precise data in future it may be possible to constrain the models with multiple free parameters which can tell about the dynamics more precisely. One of the main advantage of this parametrization is that it reduces the computational time to significant amount while mimicking the actual scalar field dynamics for all redshifts which may not be possible with other existing parametrizations. We compare the parametrization with two and four parameters with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model using cosmological observational data from Planck 2018 (distance priors), DESI $2024$ DR1, PantheonPlus, Hubble parameter measurements and the redshift space distortion. We find that the observational data prefers standard $\Lambda$CDM model over other models. If we allow phantom region then it is more preferred by the data compared to non-phantom thawing quintessence. Also, we can not strictly comment on the preference on the dynamical dark energy over a cosmological constant as claimed by the DESI 2024 DR1 results.</description>

      <title>The fate of EMRI-IMRI pairs in AGN accretion disks: long-term simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) are important gravitational-wave (GW) sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). So far, their formation and evolution have been studied independently, but recent theories suggest that stellar-mass black holes (sBHs) and intermediate-mass black hole (IMBHs) can coexist in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), which indicates that EMRIs and IMRIs may form in the same place. Considering the likely encounter of the sBH and IMBH during the migration in the AGN disk, Paper I (Peng &amp; Chen 2023) shows that a gap-opening IMBH can drive a surrounding sBH to migrate synchronously. In this work, we extend the study in Paper I with more sophisticated model. We first use the 3D hydrodynamical simulation to study the co-evolution of the disk and the migration, and found that although the inner disk is partially accreted, the gaseous torque together with the tidal torque of IMBH can keep the synchronized migrate, until $\sim 10$ Schwarzschild radii from the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). We further use a relativistic three-body simulation to study the final fate of the sBH in the GW-dominated regime, and found that in most cases the sBH can be either captured or kicked out by the IMBH, which will result in two successive IMRIs or an EMRI followed by an IMRI. Such successive EMRIs and IMRIs will bring rich information about the formation and evolution of sBHs and IMBHs in AGNs.</description>

Abstract: We derive the Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theories for diffusion including the lowest non-hydrodynamic degree of freedom from holographic Gubser-Rocha systems. At low temperature the dynamical non-hydrodynamic mode could be either an IR mode or a slow mode, which is related to IR quantum critical excitations or encodes the information of all energy scales. This additional dynamical vector mode could be viewed as an ultraviolet sector of the diffusive hydrodynamic theory. We construct two different effective actions for each case and discuss their physical properties. In particular we show that the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger symmetry is preserved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exact analytical solution to the nonlinear relativistic Boltzmann equation for a massless gas with a non-isotropic cross section is given in a homogeneous spacetime. By employing a trial solution, we construct a set of nonlinear coupled equations for scalar moments and solve this set exactly. Our analytical solution with nontrivial scattering angle dependence contained can be mapped onto the BKW solution of a homogeneous nonrelativistic gas of Maxwell molecules. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a feasible region determined by physical requirements. The analytical solution with parameters within the feasible region admits a stable fixed point corresponding to the equilibrium solution of the Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <title>Pre-Big-Bang Cosmology Cannot Explain NANOGrav 15-year Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the Pre-Big Bang (PBB) scenario from string cosmology can explain the stochastic gravitational wave background signal reported in the NANOGrav 15-year dataset. Using Bayesian analysis techniques, we constrain the key parameters of the PBB model by comparing its theoretical predictions with the observed data. Our analysis yields $\beta = 3.2^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ ($90\%$ credible interval) for the dilaton-dynamics parameter, which significantly exceeds the theoretically allowed range of $0 \leq \beta &lt; 3$ at the $5\sigma$ level. Additionally, model comparison strongly favors a simple power-law spectrum over the PBB scenario, with a Bayes factor of approximately $106$. These results demonstrate that the PBB scenario, in its current formulation, cannot adequately explain the NANOGrav observations, highlighting the need for either significant modifications to the model or alternative explanations for the observed signal.</description>

      <title>Systems of Wave Equations on Asymptotically de Sitter Vacuum Spacetimes in All Even Spatial Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second paper of a two part work that establishes a definitive quantitative nonlinear scattering theory for asymptotically de Sitter vacuum solutions $(M,g)$ in $(n+1)$ dimensions with $n\geq4$ even, which are determined by small scattering data at $\mathscr{I}^{\pm}.$ In this paper we prove quantitative estimates for systems of wave equations on the $(M,g)$ backgrounds. The systems considered include the Einstein vacuum equations commuted with suitable time-dependent vector fields, where we treat the nonlinear terms as general inhomogeneous factors. The estimates obtained are essential in establishing sharp top order estimates for the scattering map of the Einstein vacuum equations, taking asymptotic data at $\mathscr{I}^-$ to asymptotic data at $\mathscr{I}^+$.</description>

      <title>The impact of resistivity on the variability of black hole accretion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The accretion of magnetized plasma onto black holes is a complex and dynamic process, where the magnetic field plays a crucial role. The amount of magnetic flux accumulated near the event horizon significantly impacts the accretion flow behavior. Resistivity, a measure of how easily magnetic fields can dissipate, is thought to be a key factor influencing this process. This work explores the influence of resistivity on accretion flow variability. We investigate simulations reaching the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) limit and those with an initial multi-loop magnetic field configuration. Methods. We employ 3D resistive general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations to model the accretion process under various regimes, where resistivity has a global uniform value. Results. Our findings reveal distinct flow behaviors depending on resistivity. High resistivity simulations never achieve the MAD state, indicating a disturbed magnetic flux accumulation process. Conversely, low resistivity simulations converge towards the ideal MHD limit. The key results are: i) For the standard MAD model, resistivity plays a minimal role in flow variability, suggesting that flux eruption events dominate the dynamics. ii) High resistivity simulations exhibit strong magnetic field diffusion into the disk, rearranging efficient magnetic flux accumulation from the accretion flow. iii) In multi-loop simulations, resistivity significantly reduces flow variability, which was not expected. However, magnetic flux accumulation becomes more variable due to frequent reconnection events at very low resistivity values. Conclusions. This study shows that resistivity affects how much the flow is distorted due to magnetic field dissipation. Our findings provide new insights into the interplay between magnetic field accumulation, resistivity, variability and the dynamics of black hole accretion.</description>

      <title>The first variation of the matter energy-momentum tensor with respect to the metric, and its implications on modified gravity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first order variation of the matter energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu \nu}$ with respect to the metric tensor $g^{\alpha \beta}$ plays an important role in modified gravity theories with geometry-matter coupling, and in particular in the $f(R,T)$ modified gravity theory. We obtain the expression of the variation $\delta T_{\mu \nu}/\delta g^{\alpha \beta}$ for the baryonic matter described by an equation given in a parametric form, with the basic thermodynamic variables represented by the particle number density, and by the specific entropy, respectively. The first variation of the matter energy-momentum tensor turns out to be independent on the matter Lagrangian, and can be expressed in terms of the pressure, the energy-momentum tensor itself, and the matter fluid four-velocity. We apply the obtained results for the case of the $f(R,T)$ gravity theory, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar, and $T$ is the trace of the matter energy-momentum tensor, which thus becomes a unique theory, also independent on the choice of the matter Lagrangian. A simple cosmological model, in which the Hilbert-Einstein Lagrangian is generalized through the addition of a term proportional to $T^n$ is considered in detail, and it is shown that it gives a very good description of the observational values of the Hubble parameter up to a redshift of $z\approx 2.5$.</description>

      <title>Decay and non-decay for the massless Vlasov equation on subextremal and extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the massless Vlasov equation on the exterior of the subextremal and extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetimes. We prove that moments decay at an exponential rate in the subextremal case and at a polynomial rate in the extremal case. This polynomial rate is shown to be sharp along the event horizon. In the extremal case we show that transversal derivatives of certain components of the energy momentum tensor do not decay along the event horizon if the solution and its first time derivative are initially supported on a neighbourhood of the event horizon. The non-decay of transversal derivatives in the extremal case is compared to the work of Aretakis on instability for the wave equation. Unlike Aretakis' results for the wave equation, which exploit a hierarchy of conservation laws, our proof is based entirely on a quantitative analysis of the geodesic flow and conservation laws do not feature in the present work.</description>

      <title>Probing modified Hawking evaporation with gravitational waves from the primordial black hole dominated universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently proposed that Hawking evaporation might slow down after a black hole has lost about half of its mass. Such an effect, called "memory burden", is parameterized as a suppression in the mass loss rate by negative powers $n$ of the black hole entropy and could considerably extend the lifetime of a black hole. We study the impact of memory burden on the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario. Modified PBH evaporation leads to a significantly longer PBH dominated stage. Requiring that PBHs evaporate prior enough to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis shrinks the allowed PBH mass range. Indeed, we find that for $n&gt;2.5$ the PBH reheating scenario is not viable. The frequency of the Gravitational Waves (GWs) induced by PBH number density fluctuations is bound to be larger than about a Hz, while the amplitude of the GW spectrum is enhanced due to the longer PBH dominated phase. Interestingly, we show that, in some models, the slope of the induced GW spectrum might be sensitive to the modifications to Hawking evaporation, proving it may be possible to test the "memory burden" effect via induced GWs. Lastly, we argue that our results could also apply to general modifications of Hawking evaporation.</description>

Abstract: The Plebanski-Demianski metric is commonly thought to describe the most general Type D black hole in general relativity (possibly coupled with Maxwell electromagnetism), but in the form we know at the moment, it fails to include the elusive accelerating spacetimes with gravitomagnetic mass without angular momentum. We propose a very general type D metric, stemming from a binary black hole system, which represents a novel branch of the type D spacetimes: accelerating Kerr-Newman-NUT black hole with cosmological constant. It has straightforward limits to all the known type D black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell theory and in particular to the accelerating Reissner-Nordstrom-NUT solution, yet unknown in the literature.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of AdS-Schwarzschild-like black hole in loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08241v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtained the metric of the Schwarzschild-like black hole with loop quantum gravity (LQG) corrections in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time, under the assumption that the cosmological constant is decoupled in LQG. We investigated its thermodynamics, including the equation of state, criticality, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy. The $P-v$ graph was plotted, and the critical behavior was calculated. It was found that, due to the LQG effect, the quantum-corrected Schwarzschild-AdS black hole exhibits a critical point and a critical ratio of $7/18$, which differs from the Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{\mathrm{o}}$m-AdS black hole's ratio of $3/8$ (the same as that of the Van der Waals system) slightly. However, there are still some similarities compared to the Van der Waals system, such as the same critical exponents and a similar $P-v$ graph. Moreover, it is concluded that the energy-momentum tensor related to the black hole's mass could violate the conventional first law of thermodynamics. This modified first law may violate the conservation of Gibbs free energy during the small black hole-large black hole phase transitions, potentially indicating the occurrence of the zeroth-order phase transition. The Joule-Thomson expansion was also studied. Interestingly, compared to the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole, the LQG effect leads to inversion points. The inversion curve divides the $\left(P,T\right)$ coordinate system into two regions: a heating region and a cooling region, as shown in detail by the inversion curves and isenthalpic curves. The results indicated that there is a minimum inversion mass, below which any black hole will not possess an inversion point.</description>

      <title>Robust inference of gravitational wave source parameters in the presence of noise transients using normalizing flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) detection is of paramount importance in fundamental physics and GW astronomy, yet it presents formidable challenges. One significant challenge is the removal of noise transient artifacts known as glitches, which greatly impact the search and identification of GWs. Recent research has achieved remarkable results in data denoising, often using effective modeling methods to remove glitches. However, for glitches from uncertain or unknown sources, current methods cannot completely eliminate them from the GW signal. In this work, we leverage the inherent robustness of machine learning to obtain reliable posterior parameter distributions directly from GW data contaminated by glitches. Our network model provides reasonable and rapid parameter inference even in the presence of glitches, without needing to remove them. We also investigate various factors affecting the rationality of parameter inference in our normalizing flow network, including glitch and GW parameters. The results demonstrate that the normalizing flow can reasonably infer the source parameters of GWs even with unknown contamination. We find that the nature of the glitch itself is the only factor that can affect the rationality of the inferred results. With improvements to our model, we anticipate accelerating the localization of electromagnetic counterparts and providing priors for more accurate deglitching, thereby speeding up subsequent data processing procedures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel dynamical dark energy model within the frameworks of both Einstein gravity and Horava-Lifshitz gravity. Utilizing CDMMA parametrization of the dark energy equation of state $\omega(z)$, we derive solutions to the field equations. By employing recent cosmological datasets, such as cosmic chronometer datasets, Type Ia Supernovae datasets, and Baryonic Oscillation datasets (DESI Y1 and SDSS-IV). We validate our model and determine optimal parameter values. Furthermore, we analyze the evolution of the Universe by showing the redshift dependence plots of key cosmological parameters through graphical representations. We also perform diagnostic analyses to compare our model with the standard model. Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), we compare the three models and find that all of them are supported by the current data, making it impossible to discard any of them. Our model aligns well with recent observations and unveils intriguing features of the Universe, particularly the late-time behavior of the Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the standard von Laue condition, the volume-averaged pressure inside particles of fixed mass and structure vanishes in the Minkowski limit of general relativity. Here we show that this condition is in general not fulfilled in the context of $f(R,T)$ gravity, or of other theories of gravity in which the linear momentum is not conserved in this limit (here, $R$ and $T$ represent the Ricci scalar and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively). We derive a generalized von Laue condition valid for the $\mathcal R(R) + \mathcal F(T)$ subclass of $f(R,T)$ theories of gravity and discuss its cosmological implications. In particular, we show that the standard radiation and matter era evolution of the universe is recovered in the context $R + \mathcal F(T)$ gravity independently of the specific properties of the function $\mathcal F(T)$. We also find that dust -- a perfect fluid whose particles are at rest in the fluid's proper frame -- cannot in general be described as pressureless in the context of these theories. We further discuss the implications of our findings for the form of the on-shell Lagrangian of an ideal gas.</description>

Abstract: The inflationary and pre-inflationary evolution of scalar modes of cosmological perturbations in a closed universe is analyzed for a loop quantum cosmology model with an inflationary regime consistent with the constraints on inflation derived from observations of the cosmic microwave background. The effective background dynamics includes a bounce induced by quantum gravity effects. Initial conditions for the perturbations are set before the bounce, and the perturbations are numerically evolved until the end of inflation, allowing the determination of the primordial power spectrum for comoving curvature perturbations. The power spectrum includes corrections due to the presence of spatial curvature and excitations produced before the onset of slow-roll inflation. The deviations from the usual power-law spectrum can be significant for observable modes even for spatial curvatures much smaller than the observational limit obtained without considering the pre-inflationary evolution of the perturbations.</description>

Abstract: Quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes are crucial in understanding the ringdown phase after a merger. While for Kerr black holes these modes have been known for a long time, their calculation has remained a challenge in alternative theories of gravity. We obtain the spectrum of quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton theory without resorting to perturbation theory in the coupling constant. Our approach is based on a spectral decomposition of the linear perturbations of the metric and the scalar field. The quasinormal modes agree excellently with the perturbatively known slow rotation and weak coupling limits. For large coupling, though, the spectrum changes significantly.</description>

      <title>Holographic thermodynamic relation for dissipative and non-dissipative universes in a flat FLRW cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To clarify a holographic modified thermodynamic relation, the present study applies a general formulation for cosmological equations in a flat FLRW universe to the first law of thermodynamics, using the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S_{\rm{BH}}$ and a dynamical Kodama-Hayward temperature $T_{\rm{KH}}$. For the general formulation, both an effective pressure $p_{e}$ of cosmological fluids for dissipative universes (e.g., bulk viscous cosmology) and an extra driving term $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ for non-dissipative universes (e.g., time-varying $\Lambda (t)$ cosmology) are phenomenologically assumed. When $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ is constant, the modified thermodynamic relation is equivalent to the formulation of the first law in standard cosmology. One side of this modified relation describes thermodynamic quantities in the bulk and can be divided into two time-derivative terms, namely $\dot{\rho}$ and $\dot{V}$ terms, where $\rho$ is the mass density of cosmological fluids and $V$ is the Hubble volume. Using the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm{GH}}$, the other side of this relation, $T_{\rm{KH}} \dot{S}_{\rm{BH}}$, can be formulated as the sum of $T_{\rm{GH}} \dot{S}_{\rm{BH}}$ and $[(T_{\rm{KH}}/T_{\rm{GH}}) -1] T_{\rm{GH}} \dot{S}_{\rm{BH}}$, which are equivalent to the $\dot{\rho}$ and $\dot{V}$ terms, respectively, with the magnitude of the $\dot{V}$ term being proportional to the square of the $\dot{\rho}$ term. In addition, the modified thermodynamic relation for constant $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ is examined by applying the equipartition law of energy on the horizon. This modified thermodynamic relation reduces to a kind of extended holographic-like connection when a constant $T_{\rm{KH}}$ universe is considered. The evolution of thermodynamic quantities is also discussed, using a constant $T_{\rm{KH}}$ model, extending a previous analysis [Phys. Rev. D 108, 083515 (2023) (arXiv:2306.11285)].</description>

      <title>Teleparallel Geometry with Spherical Symmetry: The diagonal and proper frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the proper co-frame and its corresponding (diagonal) co-frame/spin connection pair for spherically symmetric geometries which can be used as an initial ansatz in any theory of teleparallel gravity. The Lorentz transformation facilitating the move from one co-frame to the other is also presented in factored form. The factored form also illustrates the nature of the two degrees of freedom found in the spin connection. The choice of coordinates in restricting the number of arbitrary functions is also presented. Beginning with a thorough presentation of teleparallel gravity using the metric affine gauge theory approach and concentrating on f(T) teleparallel gravity, we express the field equations in the diagonal co-frame. We argue that the choice of diagonal co-frame may be more advantageous over the proper co-frame choice. Finally, assuming one additional symmetry, we restrict ourselves to the Kantowski-Sachs tele-parallel geometries, and determine some solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may have formed through the gravitational collapse of cosmological perturbations that were generated and stretched during the inflationary era, later entering the cosmological horizon during the decelerating phase, if their amplitudes were sufficiently large. In this article, we will briefly introduce the basic concept of PBHs and review the formation dynamics through this mechanism, the estimation of the initial spins of PBHs and the time evolution of type II fluctuations, with a focus on the radiation-dominated and (early) matter-dominated phases.</description>

      <title>The anti-aligned spin of GW191109: glitch mitigation and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With a high total mass and an inferred effective spin anti-aligned with the orbital axis at the 99.9% level, GW191109 is one of the most promising candidates for a dynamical formation origin among gravitational wave events observed so far. However, the data containing GW191109 are afflicted with terrestrial noise transients, i.e., detector glitches, generated by the scattering of laser light in both LIGO detectors. We study the implications of the glitch(es) on the inferred properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW191109. Using time- and frequency-domain analysis methods, we isolate the critical data for spin inference to 35 - 40 Hz and 0.1 - 0.04 s before the merger in LIGO Livingston, directly coincident with the glitch. Using two models of glitch behavior, one tailored to slow scattered light and one more generic, we perform joint inference of the glitch and binary parameters. When the glitch is modeled as slow scattered light, the binary parameters favor anti-aligned spins, in agreement with existing interpretations. When more flexible glitch modeling based on sine-Gaussian wavelets is used instead, a bimodal aligned/anti-aligned solution emerges. The anti-aligned spin mode is correlated with a weaker inferred glitch and preferred by ~ 70 : 30 compared to the aligned spin mode and a stronger inferred glitch. We conclude that if we assume that the data are only impacted by slow scattering noise, then the anti-aligned spin inference is robust. However, the data alone cannot validate this assumption and resolve the anti-aligned spin and potentially dynamical formation history of GW191109.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime with weakly nonminimally coupled monopole charge. We analytically and numerically investigate light ray propagation around such a black hole by employing the common Lagrangian formalism. Our analysis encompasses both radial and angular geodesics, for which we present analytical solutions in terms of incomplete Lauricella hypergeometric functions. Additionally, we explore the impact of the coupling constant on geodesic motion. Based on observations from the Event Horizon Telescope, we constrain the black hole parameters, resulting in a coupling constant range of $-0.5\lesssim \alpha\lesssim 0.5$. Throughout our analysis, we simulate all possible trajectories and, where necessary, perform numerical inversion of the included integrals.</description>

      <title>A Novel Framework for Characterizing Spacetime Microstructure with Scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of physics at the Planck scale has garnered significant attention due to its implications for understanding the fundamental nature of the universe. At the Planck scale, quantum fluctuations challenge the classical notion of spacetime as a smooth continuum, revealing a complex microstructure that defies traditional models. This study introduces a novel scaling-based framework to investigate the properties of spacetime microstructures. By deriving a scaling-characterized metric tensor and reformulating fundamental equations--including the geodesic, Einstein field, Klein-Gordon, and Dirac equation--into scaling forms, the research reveals new properties of local spacetime dynamics. Remarkably, the golden ratio emerges naturally in linear scale measurements, offering a potential explanation for the role of the Planck length in resolving ultraviolet (UV) divergence. Furthermore, the study demonstrates how scale invariance in spacetime can restore classical geometric stability through the renormalization group equations. These findings significantly revise classical geometric intuitions, providing a fresh lens for understanding quantum fluctuations and offering promising insights for advancing quantum gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Schwarzschild-AdS black hole in non-commutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the thermodynamics of Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter black holes within the framework of non-commutative geometry. By solving the Einstein's equations, we derive the corrected Schwarzschild-AdS black hole with Lorentzian distribution and analyze the thermodynamics. Our results confirm that if the energy-momentum tensor outside the event horizon is related to the mass of the black hole, the conventional first law of thermodynamics will be violated. The study of criticality reveals that the black hole undergoes a small black hole-large black hole phase transition similar to that of the Van der Waals system, with a critical point and a critical ratio slightly smaller than that of the Van der Waals fluid. As the non-commutative parameter increases, the phase transition process shortens, leading to a critical point, and ultimately to the disappearance of the phase transition. The violation of the conventional first law results in a discontinuity of the Gibbs free energy during the phase transition, indicating the occurrence of zeroth-order phase transition. Moreover, we investigate the Joule-Thomson expansion, obtaining the minimum inversion temperature and the minimum inversion mass.</description>

      <title>The precession of particle spin in spherical symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we will explore the precession of particle spins in spherical spacetimes. We first argue that the geometrical optics (WKB) approximation is insufficient, due to the absence of a glory spot in the backward scattering of massless particles, making an analysis of spin precession necessary. We then derive the precession equation assuming the spin is parallel transported, which is supported by the sub-leading order of the WKB approximation. The precession equation applies to both massless and massive particles. For particles with speed $v=1$, we show that spin is always reversed after backward scattering in any spherically symmetric spacetime, confirming the absence of a glory spot for massless particles. Finally, we solve the precession equation for Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetimes and discuss the spin precession of massive particles, particularly in the non-relativistic limit. We find that, in Schwarzschild spacetime, the spin precession for particles with $v\approx0$ depends only on the deflection angle, while in Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime, it also depends on the black hole charge, as revealed by the expansion derived from the strong lensing approximation.</description>

      <title>Black holes in scalar multipolar Universes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a scalar counterpart of the Schwarzschild-Melvin Universe was reported [arXiv:2410.02851]. We show this solution is a special case of a Schwarzschild black hole/mass in a scalar multipolar Universe, that can be constructed algebraically combining known vacuum solutions. This builds on the generalized Weyl construction for scalar-vacuum, that admits two, fully decoupled, independent harmonic functions: one for the gravitational sector and another for the scalar sector. Harmonic solutions with growing multipoles lead to naked singularities (at spatial infinity), including for the scalar counterpart of the Schwarzschild-Melvin; harmonic solutions with decaying (scalar) multipoles are asymptotically flat, but have a singular horizon, in accordance with no-scalar-hair theorems. The scalar-vacuum model can be mapped to a five dimensional pure gravity construction via Kaluza-Klein oxidization and, in this way, to the corresponding $D=5$ generalized Weyl construction.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Consequences of Black Holes in Asymptotically Safe Quantum Gravity: Shadows and Strong Gravitational Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the astrophysical consequences of black holes in asymptotically safe quantum gravity, characterized by the parameters $S_0$, $S_2$, $m_0$, and $m_2$, in addition to the black hole mass $M$. To evaluate the physical validity of the fundamental asymptotically safe theory of quantum gravity black hole solutions, we analyze their gravitational lensing properties in the strong field regime. Specifically, we examine the shadow cast by the asymptotically safe quantum gravity black hole and constrain its parameters using observational data from the M87* and Sgr A* supermassive black holes. Our analysis reveals that, within the $1\sigma$ confidence level, a significant portion of the parameter space for asymptotically safe quantum gravity black holes is consistent with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87* and Sgr A*. This suggests these black holes are plausible candidates for describing astrophysical black holes. As an additional observational test, we perform a detailed investigation of the strong gravitational lensing properties of these black holes. We explore the fundamental strong lensing observables in detail, including the angular positions and separations of the lensed images, the relative magnifications, the radius of the outermost Einstein ring, and the relativistic time delay between images. We compare the predictions of the asymptotically safe quantum gravity black hole for each observable with those of the classical Schwarzschild solution using realistic astrophysical data. Our findings provide a pathway for testing asymptotically safe quantum gravity at galactic and extragalactic scales, offering new insights into the observational properties of black hole solutions within this framework.</description>

      <title>Actions of spinning compact binaries: Spinning particle in Kerr matched to dynamics at 1.5 post-Newtonian order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motion of compact binaries is influenced by the spin of their components starting at the 1.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order. On the other hand, in the large mass ratio limit, the spin of the lighter object appears in the equations of motion at first order in the mass ratio, coinciding with the leading gravitational self-force. Frame and gauge choices make it challenging to compare between the two limits, especially for generic spin configurations. We derive novel closed formulas for the gauge-invariant actions and frequencies for the motion of spinning test particles near Kerr black holes. We use this to express the Hamiltonian perturbatively in terms of action variables up to 3PN and compare it with the 1.5 PN action-angle Hamiltonian at finite mass ratios. This allows us to match the actions across both systems, providing a new gauge-invariant dictionary for interpolation between the two limits.</description>

Abstract: Relations between the graviton mass and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ have led to some interesting implications. We show that in any approach which leads to a direct correlation between the graviton mass and $\Lambda$, either through direct substitution of gravitational coupling in dispersion relations or through the linearization of Einstein equations with massive spin-2 fields, the Compton wavelength of the graviton lies in the superhorizon scale. As a result any gravitational approaches where the graviton mass is related directly to the cosmological constant are of no observational significance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00741v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons near rotating black holes can undergo significant growth through superradiant energy extraction, potentially reaching field values close to the Planck scale and transforming black holes into effective transducers for these fields. The interaction between boson fields and fermions may lead to parametric production or Schwinger pair production of fermions, with efficiencies significantly exceeding those of perturbative decay processes. Additionally, the spatial gradients of scalar clouds and the electric components of vector clouds can accelerate fermions, resulting in observable fluxes. This study considers both Standard Model neutrinos and dark sector fermions, which could contribute to boosted dark matter. Energy loss due to fermion emissions can potentially quench the exponential growth of the cloud, leading to a saturated state. This dynamic provides a framework for establishing limits on boson-neutrino interactions, previously constrained by neutrino self-interaction considerations. In the saturation phase, boson clouds have the capacity to accelerate fermions to TeV energies, producing fluxes that surpass those from atmospheric neutrinos near black holes. These fluxes open new avenues for observations through high-energy neutrino detectors like IceCube, as well as through dark matter direct detection efforts focused on targeted black holes.</description>

      <title>All near-horizon symmetries of the Schwarzschild black hole in linearised gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic symmetries are known to constrain the infrared behaviour of scattering processes in asymptotically flat spacetimes. By the same token, one expects symmetries of the black hole horizon to constrain near-horizon gravitational scattering. In this paper, we take a step towards establishing this connection. We find all near-horizon symmetries that can be potentially relevant to gravitational scattering near the horizon of the Schwarzschild black hole. We study large diffeomorphisms of linearised perturbations of the Schwarzschild black hole in a partial wave basis and in a gauge that allows for gravitational radiation crossing the event horizon. This setup is ideally suited for studying processes involving near-horizon gravitons like scattering and black hole evaporation. We find the most general near-horizon symmetries that are consistent with finite perturbations at the horizon. Since we do not impose any further boundary conditions, these symmetries represent the biggest set of symmetries in this setting. We find the associated covariant charges to be finite and non-zero showing that these symmetries are physical. Interestingly, for a large black hole, the dominant symmetries are just two copies of $ u(1)$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic topology of topological black hole in $F(R)$-ModMax gravity's rainbow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to include the effect of high energy and topological parameters on black holes in $F(R)$ gravity, we consider two corrections to this gravity: energy-dependent spacetime with different topological constants, and a nonlinear electrodynamics field. In other words, we combine $F(R)$ gravity's rainbow with ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics theory to see the effects of high energy and topological parameters on the physics of black holes. For this purpose, we first extract topological black hole solutions in $F(R)$% -ModMax gravity's rainbow. Then, by considering black holes as thermodynamic systems, we obtain thermodynamic quantities and check the first law of thermodynamics. The effect of the topological parameter on the Hawking temperature and the total mass of black holes is obvious. We also discuss the thermodynamic topology of topological black holes in $F(R)$-ModMax gravity's rainbow using the off-shell free energy method. In this formalism, black holes are assumed to be equivalent to defects in their thermodynamic spaces. For our analysis, we consider two different types of thermodynamic ensembles. These are: fixed $q$ ensemble and fixed $\phi$ ensemble. We take into account all the different types of curvature hypersurfaces that can be constructed in these black holes. The local and global topology of these black holes are studied by computing the topological charges at the defects in their thermodynamic spaces. Finally, in accordance with their topological charges, we classify the black holes into three topological classes with total winding numbers corresponding to $-1, 0$, and $1$. We observe that the topological classes of these black holes are dependent on the value of the rainbow function, the sign of the scalar curvature, and the choice of ensembles.</description>

      <title>Identifying Host Galaxies of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Found by PTAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) present us with exciting opportunities for multi-messenger science. These systems are thought to form naturally in galaxy mergers and therefore have the potential to produce electromagnetic (EM) radiation as well as gravitational waves (GWs) detectable with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Once GWs from individually resolved SMBHBs are detected, the identification of the host galaxy will be a major challenge due to the ambiguity in possible EM signatures and the poor localization capability of PTAs. In order to aid EM observations in choosing which sources to follow up, we attempt to quantify the number of plausible hosts in both realistic and idealistic scenarios. We outline a host galaxy identification pipeline that injects a single-source GW signal into a simulated PTA dataset, uses production-level techniques to recover the signal, quantifies the localization region and number of galaxies contained therein, and finally imposes cuts on the galaxies using the binary parameters estimated from the GW search. In an ideal case, we find that the 90% credible areas span 29 deg^2 to 241 deg^2, containing about 14 to 341 galaxies. After cuts, the number of galaxies remaining ranges from 22 at worst to 1 (the true host) at best. In a more realistic case, if the signal is sufficiently localized, the sky areas range from 287 deg^2 to 530 deg^2 and enclose about 285 to 1238 galaxies. After cuts, the number of galaxies is 397 at worst and 27 at best. While the signal-to-noise ratio is the primary determinant of the localization area of a given source, we find that the size of the area is also influenced by the proximity of nearby pulsars on the sky and the chirp mass of the source.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario in a type II minimally modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The idea of a rapid sign-switching cosmological constant (mirror AdS-dS transition) in the late universe at $z\sim1.7$, known as the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, has significantly improved the fit to observational data and provides a promising scenario for alleviating major cosmological tensions, such as the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. However, in the absence of a fully predictive model, implementing this fit required conjecturing that the dynamics of the linear perturbations are governed by general relativity. Recent work embedding the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model with the Lagrangian of a type II minimally modified gravity known as VCDM has propelled $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM to a fully predictive model, removing the uncertainty related to the aforementioned assumption; we call this new model $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM. In this work, we demonstrate that not only does $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM fit the data better than the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, but the new model, $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM, performs even better in alleviating cosmological tensions while also providing a better fit to the data, including CMB, BAO, SNe Ia, and cosmic shear measurements. Our findings highlight the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM framework, particularly the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM model, as a compelling alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, especially by successfully alleviating the $H_0$ tension. Additionally, these models predict higher values for $\sigma_8$, indicating enhanced structuring, albeit with lower present-day matter density parameter values and consequently reduced $S_8$ values, alleviating the $S_8$ tension as well. This demonstrates that the data are well fit by a combination of background and linear perturbations, both having dynamics differing from those of $\Lambda$CDM. This paves the way for further exploration of new ways for embedding the sign-switching cosmological constant into other models.</description>

      <title>Supergravity Spectrum of AdS$_5$ Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We embed Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes into $\mathcal{N} = 8$ gauged supergravity and study quadratic fluctuations around the black hole backgrounds of all fields in the larger theory. The equations of motion of the perturbations are partially diagonalized by the group theory of broken symmetry. Nearly all fields in theory have non-minimal couplings, so their equations of motion are not merely massive Klein-Gordon equations with minimal coupling to background gauge fields, and their analogues for fields with spin. In the special case of extremal black holes we identify specific modes of instability, some of which touch supersymmetric locus. For example, we identify scalar fields in supergravity that condense in the near horizon region and transition the black hole into a superconducting phase. We also identify supergravity modes that are susceptible to superradiant instability</description>

      <title>Premerger phenomena in neutron-star binary coalescences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16283v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of high-energy events can take place in the seconds leading up to a binary neutron-star merger. Mechanisms involving tidal resonances, electrodynamic interactions, or shocks in mass-loaded wakes have been proposed as instigators of these precursors. With a view of gravitational-wave and multimessenger astrophysics more broadly, premerger observations and theory are reviewed emphasising how gamma-ray precursors and dynamical tides can constrain the neutron-star equation of state, thermodynamic microphysics, and evolutionary pathways. Connections to post-merger phenomena, notably gamma-ray bursts, are discussed together with how magnetic fields, spin and misalignment, crustal elasticity, and stratification gradients impact observables.</description>

      <title>Performance-Portable Binary Neutron Star Mergers with AthenaK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extension to the AthenaK code for general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) in dynamical spacetimes using a 3+1 conservative Eulerian formulation. Like the fixed-spacetime GRMHD solver, we use standard finite-volume methods to evolve the fluid and a constrained transport scheme to preserve the divergence-free constraint for the magnetic field. We also utilize a first-order flux correction (FOFC) scheme to reduce the need for an artificial atmosphere and optionally enforce a maximum principle to improve robustness. We demonstrate the accuracy of AthenaK using a set of standard tests in flat and curved spacetimes. Using a SANE accretion disk around a Kerr black hole, we compare the new solver to the existing solver for stationary spacetimes using the so-called "HARM-like" formulation. We find that both formulations converge to similar results. We also include the first published binary neutron star (BNS) mergers performed on graphical processing units (GPUs). Thanks to the FOFC scheme, our BNS mergers maintain a relative error of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-11})$ or better in baryon mass conservation up to collapse. Finally, we perform scaling tests of AthenaK on OLCF Frontier, where we show excellent weak scaling of $\geq 80\%$ efficiency up to 32768 GPUs and $74\%$ up to 65536 GPUs for a GRMHD problem in dynamical spacetimes with six levels of mesh refinement. AthenaK achieves an order-of-magnitude speedup using GPUs compared to CPUs, demonstrating that it is suitable for performing numerical relativity problems on modern exascale resources.</description>

      <title>A Note on Kinematic Flow and Differential Equations for Two-Site One-Loop Graph in FRW Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the canonical differential equations governing the two-site one-loop wavefunction coefficient in conformally-coupled scalar theory within a general FRW cosmology. By employing relative twisted cohomology and integration by parts, we systematically derive these equations, providing a solid foundation for further analysis. Notably, we extend the kinematic flow framework to the loop level for the first time, efficiently deriving the differential equations through a graphical approach using family trees generated by tubing graphs, which are associated with the singularities of the system. In addition, we provide a preliminary discussion on higher-loop cases, laying the groundwork for future exploration of more complex scenarios. This methodology offers valuable insights into the dynamical behavior of the differential system for the loop-level cosmological wavefunction coefficient.</description>

      <title>Steepest Growth in the Primordial Power Spectrum from Excited States at a Sudden Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sudden phase transitions during inflation can give rise to strongly enhanced primordial density perturbations on scales much smaller than those directly probed by cosmic microwave background anisotropies. In this paper, we study the effect of the incoming quantum state on the steepest growth found in the primordial power spectrum using a simple model of an instantaneous transition during single-field inflation. We consider the case of a general de Sitter-invariant initial state for the inflaton field (the $\alpha$-vacuum), and also an incoming state perturbed by a preceding transition. For the $\alpha$-vacua we find that $k^6$ growth is possible for $\alpha&gt;0$, while $k^4$ growth is seen for $\alpha\leq0$, including the standard case of an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum state. The features of an enhanced primordial power spectrum on small scales are thus sensitive to the initial quantum state during inflation. We calculate the scalar-induced gravitational wave power spectrum for each case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a wider theoretical framework that has quantum field theory built-in, taking the fact that quantum mechanics is reconstructed from quantum field theory as a hint. We formulate a quantum theory with an embedded structure by introducing functional operators, and we find that it could describe the level II multiverse. Topics related to a beginning of the universe such as inflation, the third quantization and the landscape are discussed in our formulation.</description>

      <title>Does the stability of f(R) theories imply the stability of the dual scalar-tensor theory ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher curvature f(R) gravity theories are often plagued with Ostragadsky instability. In this work we show that such instability manifests itself in the corresponding dual scalar tensor theory in the scalar sector Lagrangian. We explicitly demonstrate the correspondence between the instabilities that appear in an $f(R)$ model and its corresponding scalar tensor theory. Considering various forms of f(R) gravity this feature is illustrated for different choices of the parameters of the theory.</description>
