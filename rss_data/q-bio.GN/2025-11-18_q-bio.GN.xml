      <title>LCPan: efficient variation graph construction using Locally Consistent Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12205v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and consistent string processing is critical in the exponentially growing genomic data era. Locally Consistent Parsing (LCP) addresses this need by partitioning an input genome string into short, exactly matching substrings (e.g., "cores"), ensuring consistency across partitions. Labeling the cores of an input string consistently not only provides a compact representation of the input but also enables the reapplication of LCP to refine the cores over multiple iterations, providing a progressively longer and more informative set of substrings for downstream analyses.
  We present the first iterative implementation of LCP with Lcptools and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying cores with minimal collisions. Experimental results show that the number of cores at the i^th iteration is O(n/c^i) for c ~ 2.34, while the average length and the average distance between consecutive cores are O(c^i). Compared to the popular sketching techniques, LCP produces significantly fewer cores, enabling a more compact representation and faster analyses. To demonstrate the advantages of LCP in genomic string processing in terms of computation and memory efficiency, we also introduce LCPan, an efficient variation graph constructor. We show that LCPan generates variation graphs &gt;10x faster than vg, while using &gt;13x less memory.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Grassmann Manifolds for Single-Cell Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell data analysis seeks to characterize cellular heterogeneity based on high-dimensional gene expression profiles. Conventional approaches represent each cell as a vector in Euclidean space, which limits their ability to capture intrinsic correlations and multiscale geometric structures. We propose a multiscale framework based on Grassmann manifolds that integrates machine learning with subspace geometry for single-cell data analysis. By generating embeddings under multiple representation scales, the framework combines their features from different geometric views into a unified Grassmann manifold. A power-based scale sampling function is introduced to control the selection of scales and balance in- formation across resolutions. Experiments on nine benchmark single-cell RNA-seq datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively preserves meaningful structures and provides stable clustering performance, particularly for small to medium-sized datasets. These results suggest that Grassmann manifolds offer a coherent and informative foundation for analyzing single cell data.</description>

      <title>Genomic Next-Token Predictors are In-Context Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) -- the capacity of a model to infer and apply abstract patterns from examples provided within its input -- has been extensively studied in large language models trained for next-token prediction on human text. In fact, prior work often attributes this emergent behavior to distinctive statistical properties in human language. This raises a fundamental question: can ICL arise organically in other sequence domains purely through large-scale predictive training?
  To explore this, we turn to genomic sequences, an alternative symbolic domain rich in statistical structure. Specifically, we study the Evo2 genomic model, trained predominantly on next-nucleotide (A/T/C/G) prediction, at a scale comparable to mid-sized LLMs. We develop a controlled experimental framework comprising symbolic reasoning tasks instantiated in both linguistic and genomic forms, enabling direct comparison of ICL across genomic and linguistic models. Our results show that genomic models, like their linguistic counterparts, exhibit log-linear gains in pattern induction as the number of in-context demonstrations increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of organically emergent ICL in genomic sequences, supporting the hypothesis that ICL arises as a consequence of large-scale predictive modeling over rich data. These findings extend emergent meta-learning beyond language, pointing toward a unified, modality-agnostic view of in-context learning.</description>

      <title>Rare Genomic Subtype Discovery from RNA-seq via Autoencoder Embeddings and Stability-Aware Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised learning on high-dimensional RNA-seq data can reveal molecular subtypes beyond standard labels. We combine an autoencoder-based representation with clustering and stability analysis to search for rare but reproducible genomic subtypes. On the UCI "Gene Expression Cancer RNA-Seq" dataset (801 samples, 20,531 genes; BRCA, COAD, KIRC, LUAD, PRAD), a pan-cancer analysis shows clusters aligning almost perfectly with tissue of origin (Cramer's V = 0.887), serving as a negative control. We therefore reframe the problem within KIRC (n = 146): we select the top 2,000 highly variable genes, standardize them, train a feed-forward autoencoder (128-dimensional latent space), and run k-means for k = 2-10. While global indices favor small k, scanning k with a pre-specified discovery rule (rare &lt; 10 percent and stable with Jaccard &gt;= 0.60 across 20 seeds after Hungarian alignment) yields a simple solution at k = 5 (silhouette = 0.129, DBI = 2.045) with a rare cluster C0 (6.85 percent of patients) that is highly stable (Jaccard = 0.787). Cluster-vs-rest differential expression (Welch's t-test, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR) identifies coherent markers. Overall, pan-cancer clustering is dominated by tissue of origin, whereas a stability-aware within-cancer approach reveals a rare, reproducible KIRC subtype.</description>

      <title>Combining multiplexed functional data to improve variant classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the surge in the number of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) reported in ClinVar in recent years, there is an imperative to resolve VUS at scale. Multiplexed assays of variant effect (MAVEs), which allow the functional consequence of 100s to 1000s of genetic variants to be measured in a single experiment, are emerging as a powerful source of evidence which can be used in clinical gene variant classification. Increasingly, multiple published MAVEs are available for the same gene, sometimes measuring different aspects of variant impact. When multiple functional roles of a gene need to be considered, combining data from multiple MAVEs may provide a more comprehensive measure of the consequence of a genetic variant, which could impact variant classifications. Here, we provide guidance for combining such multiplexed functional data, incorporating a stepwise process from data curation and collection to model generation and validation. We demonstrate the potential and pitfalls of this approach by showing the integration of multiplexed functional data from five MAVEs for the gene TP53, two MAVEs for the gene LDLR and two MAVEs for PTEN. We also present a web applet that allows users to test various methods for combining score sets from multiple assays, calculate integrated functional scores for all variants, and assess whether combining data enables the application of stronger evidence for pathogenicity or benignity. By following these steps with appropriate guardrails, researchers can maximize the value of MAVEs, strengthen the functional evidence for clinical variant classification, and potentially uncover novel mechanisms of pathogenicity for clinically relevant genes.</description>

      <title>Finding low-complexity DNA sequences with longdust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivation: Low-complexity (LC) DNA sequences are compositionally repetitive sequences that are often associated with spurious homologous matches and variant calling artifacts. While algorithms for identifying LC sequences exist, they either do not define complexity mathematically or are inefficient with long or variable context windows.
  Results: Longdust is a new algorithm that efficiently identifies long LC sequences including centromeric satellite and tandem repeats with moderately long motifs. It defines string complexity by statistically modeling the k-mer count distribution with the parameters: the k-mer length, the context window size and a threshold on complexity. Longdust exhibits high performance on real data and high consistency with existing methods.

      <title>Phospho-Proteomics Method Optimization and Application to Stimulated Jurkat Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In clinical proteomics, available input is often limited. In addition, phospho-proteomics is of particular interest since the dysregulation of these post-translational modifications (PTMs) has been implicated in various diseases such as cancer. We therefore assessed the feasibility of low input phospho-proteomics via phospho-bulk titration and low-input starting material. We found that there was identification of more phospho-peptides through phospho-bulk titration because of sample loss during preparation of low input starting material. Additionally, we explored various lysis buffers and boiling times for efficiency of decrosslinking formalin-fixed cells since cells and tissues are often fixed for preservation and sorting via FACS. We found that boiling in 0.05M Tris pH 7.6 with 5% SDS for 60 min yielded the highest number of phospho-peptides. Lastly, we applied Evotips Pure and phospho-bulk titration to treated Jurkat cells and identified 7 phospho-sites involved in T-cell stimulation.</description>
