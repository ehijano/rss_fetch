      <title>LLM Collusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how delegating pricing to large language models (LLMs) can facilitate collusion in a duopoly when both sellers rely on the same pre-trained model. The LLM is characterized by (i) a propensity parameter capturing its internal bias toward high-price recommendations and (ii) an output-fidelity parameter measuring how tightly outputs track that bias; the propensity evolves through retraining. We show that configuring LLMs for robustness and reproducibility can induce collusion via a phase transition: there exists a critical output-fidelity threshold that pins down long-run behavior. Below it, competitive pricing is the unique long-run outcome. Above it, the system is bistable, with competitive and collusive pricing both locally stable and the realized outcome determined by the model's initial preference. The collusive regime resembles tacit collusion: prices are elevated on average, yet occasional low-price recommendations provide plausible deniability. With perfect fidelity, full collusion emerges from any interior initial condition. For finite training batches of size $b$, infrequent retraining (driven by computational costs) further amplifies collusion: conditional on starting in the collusive basin, the probability of collusion approaches one as $b$ grows, since larger batches dampen stochastic fluctuations that might otherwise tip the system toward competition. The indeterminacy region shrinks at rate $O(1/\sqrt{b})$.</description>

      <title>Agreement with reservation of judgment under risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies preference aggregation under risk. In our model, each agent has an incomplete preference relation represented by a set of expected utility functions. The classical Pareto principle is silent on agreement involving indecisiveness. To examine the implications of respecting such agreement, we introduce the Paretian principle that can be applied when some individuals reserve their judgment. Our main result shows that, under this principle, for each combination of individuals' utility functions, there exists a corresponding social utility function constructed as a weighted sum of the individual ones. These aggregation rules guarantee natural properties that the standard Pareto principle fails to ensure.</description>

      <title>A multi-self model of self-punishment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the choice of a decision maker (DM) who harms herself, by maximizing in each menu some distortion of her true preference, in which the first i alternatives are moved, in reverse order, to the bottom. This pattern has no empirical power, but it allows to define a degree of self-punishment, which measures the extent of the denial of pleasure adopted by the DM. We characterize irrational choices displaying the lowest degree of self-punishment, and we fully identify the preferences that explain the DM's picks by a minimal denial of pleasure. These datasets account for some well known selection biases, such as second-best procedures, and the handicapped avoidance. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the estimation of the degree of self-punishment of a choice are singled out. Moreover the linear orders whose harmful distortions justify choice data are partially elicited. Finally, we offer a simple characterization of the choice behavior that exhibits the highest degree of self-punishment, and we show that this subclass comprises almost all choices.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Energetic Structure of Climate Transitions for Policy Relevant Regime Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how climate and innovation policies perform during socio-technical transitions remains a central challenge in innovation studies. Empirical analyses of the relationship between economic growth and carbon emissions continue to yield conflicting results, partly because they rely on pooled models that implicitly assume stable and homogeneous dynamics. Transition theory, by contrast, emphasizes that decarbonization unfolds through heterogeneous regimes characterized by varying degrees of stability, inertia, and reconfiguration. Yet, empirical tools capable of identifying these regimes prior to policy evaluation or forecasting remain limited. This paper introduces a regime-diagnostic framework designed to condition empirical analysis on the structural state of the climate-economy system. Rather than estimating causal effects or generating forecasts directly, the framework reconstructs latent transition regimes from the time varying responsiveness of emissions to economic activity. These diagnostics are used as a pre-modeling step, allowing econometric and machine learning tools to be applied conditionally on empirically identified regimes. Using a global panel of approximately 150 countries over the period 1991-2022, we apply the framework to the emission-growth relationship.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sports are one of the most significant products of the entertainment industry, accounting for a large portion of all television (and even platform) viewing. Consequently, the sale of broadcasting and media rights is the most important source of revenue for professional sports clubs. We survey the economic literature dealing with this issue, with a special emphasis on the crucial problem that arises with the allocation of revenues when they are raised from the collective sale of broadcasting rights.</description>

      <title>When Is Degree Enough? Bounds on Degree-Eigenvector Misalignment in Assortative Structured Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A tight alignment between the degree vector and the leading eigenvector arises naturally in networks with neutral degree mixing and the absence of local structures. Many real-world networks, however, violate both conditions. We derive bounds on the divergence between the degree vector and the eigenvector in networks with degree assortativity and local mesoscopic structures such as communities, core-peripheries, and cycles. Our approach is constructive. We design sufficiently general degree-preserving rewiring algorithms that start from a neutral benchmark and monotonically increase assortativity and the strength of local structures, with each step inducing a perturbation of the adjacency matrix. Using the Stewart--Sun Perturbation Bound, together with explicit spectral-norm control of the rewiring steps, we derive upper bounds on the angle between the eigenvector and the degree vector for modest levels of assortativity and local structures. Our analytical bounds delineate regions of `spectral safety' in which a node's degree can be used as a reliable measure of its systemic importance in real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Critical volatility threshold for log-normal to power-law transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random walk models with log-normal outcomes fit local market observations remarkably well. Yet interconnected or recursive structures - layered derivatives, leveraged positions, iterative funding rounds - periodically produce power-law distributed events. We show that the transition from log-normal to power-law dynamics requires only three conditions: randomness in the underlying process, rectification of payouts, and iterative feed-forward of expected values. Using an infinite option-on-option chain as an illustrative model, we derive a critical volatility threshold at $\sigma^* = \sqrt{2\pi} \approx 250.66\%$ for the unconditional case. With selective survival - where participants require minimum returns to continue - the critical threshold drops discontinuously to $\sigma_{\text{th}}^{*} = \sqrt{\pi/2} \approx 125.3\%$, and can decrease further with higher survival thresholds. The resulting outcomes follow what we term the Critical Volatility ($V^*$) Distribution - a power-law whose exponent admits closed-form expression in terms of survival pressure and conditional expected growth. The result suggests that fat tails may be an emergent property of iterative log-normal processes with selection rather than an exogenous feature.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory evolutionarily stable state and limit cycle in replicator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea of evolutionarily stable state (ESS) of a population is a cornerstone of evolutionary game theory; moreover, it coincides with the game-theoretic concept of Nash equilibrium. Such a state corresponds to a strategy adopted by the population such that a rare mutant strategy cannot invade the population. In parallel, the dynamical formulation of evolutionary game theory -- particularly through replicator dynamics embodying the tenet of survival of the fittest -- provides a framework for modelling frequency-dependent selection over time. While it is well known that an ESS corresponds to stable fixed point in replicator dynamics, the evolutionary game-theoretic characterization of limit cycles is unknown. Here we fill this lacuna by defining oscillatory ESS (OESS) which we prove to be a stable limit cycle. We also show when an OESS is unique and if there are multiple OESSes, then what their locations are in the phase space.</description>

      <title>Optimal Dispatch of Electricity and Water in Renewable-Integrated Desalination Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework for the optimal dispatch of flexible water desalination plants (WDPs) as hybrid generator-load resources. WDPs integrate thermal generation, membrane-based controllable loads, and renewable energy sources, offering unique operational flexibility for power system operations. They can simultaneously participate in two markets: selling desalinated water to a water utility, and bidirectionally transacting electricity with the grid based on their net electricity demand. We formulate the dispatch decision problem of a profit-maximizing WDP, capturing operational, technological, and market-based coupling between water and electricity flows. The threshold-based structure we derive provides computationally tractable coordination suitable for large-scale deployment, offering operational insights into how thermal generation and membrane-based loads complementarily provide continuous bidirectional flexibility. The thresholds are analytically characterized in closed form as explicit functions of technology and tariff parameters. We examine how small changes in the exogenous tariff and technology parameters affect the WDP's profit. Extensive simulations illustrate the optimal WDP's operation, profit, and water-electricity exchange, demonstrating significant improvements relative to benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>Redeeming Falsifiability?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit Popper's falsifiability criterion. A tester hires a potential expert to produce a theory, offering payments contingent on the observed performance of the theory. In our model, instead of knowing the true data-generating process, the expert knows the state-of-the-art belief over data-generating processes. A non-expert does not. We argue that if the expert can, moreover, acquire additional information to refine this knowledge, falsifiability does have the power to distinguish between experts and non-experts and to identify valuable theories, capitalizing on experts' ability to acquire and refine knowledge.</description>

      <title>Categorize and randomize: a permissive model of stochastic choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model stochastic choices with categorization. The agent preliminarly groups alternatives in homogenous disjoint classes, then randomly chooses one class and randomly picks an item within the selected class. We give a formal definition of a choice generated by this procedure, and provide an axiomatic characterization. The characterizing properties allow an external analyst to elicit that categorization is applied. In a broader interpretation, the model allows to describe the observed choice as the composition of independent subchoices. This composition preserves rationalizability by Random Utility Maximization. A generalization of the model subsumes Luce model and Nested Logit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research analyses the axiomatic link among health expenditures, inflation rate, and gross national income (GNI) per capita concerning the child mortality (CMU5) rate in D-8 nations, employing panel data analysis from 1995 to 2014. Utilising conventional panel unit root tests and linear regression models, we establish that education expenditures, in conjunction with health expenditures, inflation rate, and GNI per capita, display stationarity at level. Additionally, we examine fixed effects and random effects estimators for the pertinent variables, utilising metrics such as the Hausman Test (HT) and comparisons with CCMR correlations. Our data demonstrate that the CMU5 rate in D-8 nations has steadily decreased, according to a somewhat negative linear regression model, therefore slightly undermining the fourth Millennium Development Goal (MDG4) of the World Health Organisation (WHO).</description>

      <title>The Bayesian Origin of the Probability Weighting Function in Human Representation of Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the representation of probability in the human mind has been of great interest to understanding human decision making. Classical paradoxes in decision making suggest that human perception distorts probability magnitudes. Previous accounts postulate a Probability Weighting Function that transforms perceived probabilities; however, its motivation has been debated. Recent work has sought to motivate this function in terms of noisy representations of probabilities in the human mind. Here, we present an account of the Probability Weighting Function grounded in rational inference over optimal decoding from noisy neural encoding of quantities. We show that our model accurately accounts for behavior in a lottery task and a dot counting task. It further accounts for adaptation to a bimodal short-term prior. Taken together, our results provide a unifying account grounding the human representation of probability in rational inference.</description>
