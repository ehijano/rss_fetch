      <title>On Riordan groups involving formal semi-Laurent series and their Lie group structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to introduce and to investigate properties of generalized Riordan arrays and generalized Riordan groups that involve formal semi-Laurent series. In particular, we focus on the problem of isomorphy of generalized Riordan groups with the classical Riordan groups giving the negative answer to this problem. We also examine infinite dimensional Lie group structure of the group of generalized Riordan arrays.</description>

      <title>Lifting Frobenius splittings through geometric vertex decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frobenius splitting, pioneered by Hochster and Roberts in the 1970s and Mehta and Ramanathan in the 1980s, is a technique in characteristic $p$ commutative algebra and algebraic geometry used to control singularities. In the aughts, Knutson showed that Frobenius splittings of a certain type descend through Gr\"obner degeneration of a certain type, called geometric vertex decomposition. In the present paper, we give a partial converse to Knutson's result. We show that a Frobenius splitting that compatibly splits both link and deletion of a geometric vertex decomposition can, under an additional hypothesis on the form of the splitting, be lifted to a splitting that compatibly splits the original ideal. We discuss an example showing that the additional hypothesis cannot be removed. Our argument uses the relationship between geometric vertex decomposition and Gorenstein liaison developed by Klein and Rajchgot. Additionally, we show that Li's double determinantal varieties defined by maximal minors are Frobenius split.</description>

      <title>Bertini's theorem for $F$-rational $F$-pure singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p&gt;0$, and let $X\subseteq\mathbb{P}^n_k$ be a quasi-projective variety that is $F$-rational and $F$-pure. We prove that if $H \subseteq \mathbb{P}^n_k$ is a general hyperplane, then $X \cap H$ is also $F$-rational and $F$-pure. Of related but independent interest, we find a characterization in terms of the torsion index of $\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein varieties with isolated non-$F$-regular loci which are $F$-pure but not $F$-regular.</description>

      <title>Torsion-free Modules over Commutative Domains of Krull Dimension One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a domain of Krull dimension one, we study when the class $\mathcal{F}$ of modules over $R$ that are arbitrary direct sums of finitely generated torsion-free modules is closed under direct summands. If $R$ is local, we show that $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under direct summands if and only if any indecomposable, finitely generated, torsion-free module has local endomorphism ring. If, in addition, $R$ is noetherian this is equivalent to say that the normalization of $R$ is a local ring. If $R$ is an $h$-local domain of Krull dimension $1$ and $\mathcal{F}_R$ is closed under direct summands, then the property is inherited by the localizations of $R$ at maximal ideals. Moreover, any localizations of $R$ at a maximal ideal, except maybe one, satisfies that any finitely generated ideal is $2$-generated. The converse is true when the domain $R$ is, in addition, integrally closed, or noetherian semilocal or noetherian with module-finite normalization. Finally, over a commutative domain of finite character and with no restriction on the Krull dimension, we show that the isomorphism classes of countable generated modules in $\mathcal{F}$ are determined by their genus.</description>

      <title>Rings with uniformly S-w-Noetherian spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the notion of rings with uniformly S-w-Noetherian spectrum is introduced. Several characterizations of rings with uniformly S-w-Noetherian spectrum are given. Actually, we show that a ring R has uniformly S-w-Noetherian spectrum with respect to some s 2 S if and only if each ascending chain of radical w-ideals of R is stationary with respect to s 2 S, if and only if each radical (prime) (w-)ideal of R is radically S-w-finite with respect to s, if and only if each countably generated ideal of R is radically S-w-finite with respect to s, if and only if R[X] has uniformly S-w-Noetherian spectrum, if and only if RfXg has uniformly S-Noetherian spectrum. Beside, we show a ring R has Noetherian (resp., uniformly S-Noetherian) spectrum with respect to s if and only if each countably generated ideal of R is radically finite (S-finite with respect to s), which is a new result in the classical case.</description>

      <title>On homological properties of some Cynk-Szemberg octic hyperplane arrangements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study Cynk-Szemberg octic hyperplane arrangements from the perspective of homological properties of their derivation modules. In particular, we define the notion of the type of hyperplane arrangements that will be used in our characterization of rigid Cynk-Szemberg octic hyperplane arrangements. Moreover, we deliver a combinatorial non-freeness criterion for essential hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{C}^{4}$.</description>

      <title>Algebra and geometry of ASM weak order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Much of modern Schubert calculus is centered on Schubert varieties in the complete flag variety and on their classes in its integral cohomology ring. Under the Borel isomorphism, these classes are represented by distinguished polynomials called Schubert polynomials, introduced by Lascoux and Sch\"utzenberger.
  Knutson and Miller showed that Schubert polynomials are multidegrees of matrix Schubert varieties, affine varieties introduced by Fulton, which are closely related to Schubert varieties. Many roads to studying Schubert polynomials pass through unions and intersections of matrix Schubert varieties. The third author showed that the natural indexing objects of arbitrary intersections of matrix Schubert varieties are alternating sign matrices (ASMs). Every ASM variety is expressible as a union of matrix Schubert varieties.
  Many fundamental algebro-geometric invariants (e.g., codimension, degree, and Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity) are well understood combinatorially for matrix Schubert varieties, substantially via the combinatorics of strong Bruhat order on $S_n$. The extension of strong order to ASM(n), the set of $n \times n$ ASMs, has so far not borne as much algebro-geometric fruit for ASM varieties.
  Hamaker and Reiner proposed an extension of weak Bruhat order from $S_n$ to ASM(n), which they studied from a combinatorial perspective. In the present paper, we place this work on algebro-geometric footing. We use weak order on ASMs to give a characterization of codimension of ASM varieties. We also show that weak order operators commute with K-theoretic divided difference operators and that they satisfy the same derivative formula that facilitated the first general combinatorial computation of Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of matrix Schubert varieties. Finally, we build from these results to generalizations that apply to arbitrary unions of matrix Schubert varieties.</description>

      <title>The approach of cluster symmetry to Diophantine equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to employ a cluster-theoretic approach to provide a class of Diophantine equations whose solutions can be obtained by starting from initial solutions through mutations.
  We establish a novel framework bridging cluster theory and Diophantine equations through the lens of cluster symmetry. On the one hand, we give the necessary and sufficient condition for Laurent polynomials to remain invariant under a given cluster symmetric map. On the other hand, we construct a discriminant algorithm to determine whether a given Laurent polynomial has cluster symmetry and whether it can be realized in a generalized cluster algebra.
  As applications of this framework, we solve Markov-cluster equations, describe three classes of invariant Laurent polynomial rings, resolve two questions posed by Gyoda and Matsushita, and lastly give two MATLAB programs about our main theorems.</description>
