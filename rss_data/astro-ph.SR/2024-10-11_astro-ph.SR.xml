      <title>Spectral classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral classification is the division of stars into classes based on their spectral characteristics. Different classification systems have existed since the 19th century but the term is used nowadays mostly to refer to the Morgan-Keenan (MK) system, which was established in the 1940s and has been developed since then. The MK classification has three components: a spectral type, a luminosity class, and (possibly) suffixes or qualifiers. The first two components represent temperature and luminosity sequences (a 2-D grid), respectively, and the third one includes additional information. The MK system is an Aristotelian morphological classification system that uses the MK process, an inductive approach based on specimens (standard stars) that define the system. In that respect, it is different from and a required preliminary step for quantitative spectroscopy, whose goal is to extract the physical properties and chemical composition of the stars. In this entry we provide a brief history of spectral classification, describe the general properties of the classification criteria of the MK system, analyze the specific spectral type and luminosity class criteria used for each spectral class, and introduce the different peculiar types that can be found within the 2-D classification grid and at its edges.</description>

      <title>The effect of mass loss in models of red supergiants in the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rate and mechanism of mass loss of red supergiants (RSGs) remain poorly understood, especially at low metallicities. Motivated by the new empirical prescription by Yang et al. 2023, based on the largest and most complete sample in the Small Magellanic Cloud, we investigate the impact of different popular and recent RSG mass-loss prescriptions that span a range of RSG mass-loss rates on the evolution and observable properties of single massive stars. Our results show that higher mass-loss rates result in earlier envelope stripping and shorter RSG lifetimes, particularly for the more luminous stars, leading to a steeper luminosity function and predicting hotter final positions for the SN progenitors. None of the considered mass-loss prescriptions is fully consistent with all observational constraints, highlighting ongoing uncertainties in deriving and modeling RSGs mass loss. The mass-loss rates suggested by Kee et al. predict rapid envelope stripping, inconsistent with the observed population of luminous RSGs and SN progenitor detections, while the models implementing the commonly used de Jager et al. and the recent Beasor et al. prescriptions overestimate the number of luminous RSGs. While the increased mass-loss rates for luminous RSGs predicted by Yang et al. lead to better agreement with the observed RSG luminosity function, naturally reproducing the updated Humphreys-Davidson limit, they also produce luminous yellow supergiant progenitors not detected in nearby supernovae. We also estimate that binary interactions tend to slightly increase the formation of luminous RSGs due to mass accretion or merging. Our study examines the impact of RSG mass loss during the late stages of massive stars, highlighting the significance of using comprehensive observational data, exploring the uncertainties involved, and considering the effects of binary-induced or episodic mass loss.</description>

      <title>Energetic Particles from Quasi-Separatrix Layers and Current Sheets at the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) at the Sun are created from regions where channels of open magnetic flux have footpoints near regions of large-scale closed magnetic flux. These regions are particularly prone to magnetic reconnection at the Sun. In recent simulations of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) with the Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) model coupled to the Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Module (EPREM) model, common sources of energetic particles were discovered over broad longitudinal distributions in the background solar wind, far from the sites of particle acceleration driven by compressions and shocks in front of CMEs. Further investigation revealed these to be accelerated energetic particles from the QSLs and current sheets. The energy released from magnetic reconnection near the QSL drives reconnection exhausts and field-aligned flows, which in turn accelerate energetic particles. The reconnection process also releases material previously contained within closed magnetic field structures, which are often rich in heavy ions and $^3$He ions, as corroborated by recent PSP observations. Therefore, the seed populations produced by QSLs are expected to be rich in $^3$He and heavy ions. Thus, we present the first global model of energetic particles accelerated from QSLs and above current sheets from the Sun. Our results provide a plausible source for seed populations near the Sun, which likely have $^3$He and heavy ion enhancements. These results aid in the development of predictive solar energetic particle models.</description>

      <title>Strong Photospheric Heating Indicated by Fe I 6173 {\AA} Line Emission During White-Light Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Between 2017 and 2024, the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory has observed several white-light solar flares. Notably, for the X9.3 flare of September 6, 2017, HMI spectro-polarimetric observations reveal one or more locations within the umbra of the associated active region where the Fe I 6173 {\AA} line goes into full emission, indicating significant heating of the photosphere and lower chromosphere. For these flares, we performed a spectro-polarimetric analysis at the aforementioned locations using HMI 90s cadence Stokes data. At the Fe I emission locations, line-core emission is observed to last for a single 90 s frame and is either concurrent with or followed by increases in the line continuum intensity lasting 90 to 180 seconds. This is followed by a smooth decay to pre-flare conditions over the next three to twenty minutes. For most locations, permanent changes to the Stokes Q, U, and/or V profiles were observed, indicating long-lasting non-transient changes to the photospheric magnetic field. These emissions coincided with local maxima in hard X-ray emission observed by the Konus instrument onboard the Wind spacecraft, as well as local maxima in the time derivative of soft X-ray emission observed by GOES satellites. Comparison of the Fe I 6173 {\AA} line profile synthesis for the ad-hoc heating of the initial empirical VAL-S umbra model and quiescent Sun (VAL-C-like) model indicates that the Fe I 6173 {\AA} line emission in the white-light flare kernels could be explained by the strong heating of initially cool photospheric regions.</description>

      <title>A regularisation technique to precisely infer limb darkening using transit measurements: can we estimate stellar surface magnetic fields?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-precision measurements of exoplanet transit light curves that are now available contain information about the planet properties, their orbital parameters, and stellar limb darkening (LD). Recent 3D magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of stellar atmospheres have shown that LD depends on the photospheric magnetic field, and hence its precise determination can be used to estimate the field strength. Among existing LD laws, the uses of the simplest ones may lead to biased inferences, whereas the uses of complex laws typically lead to a large degeneracy among the LD parameters. We have developed a novel approach in which we use a complex LD model but with second derivative regularisation during the fitting process. Regularisation controls the complexity of the model appropriately and reduces the degeneracy among LD parameters, thus resulting in precise inferences. The tests on simulated data suggest that our inferences are not only precise but also accurate. This technique is used to re-analyse 43 transit light curves measured by the NASA Kepler and TESS missions. Comparisons of our LD inferences with the corresponding literature values show good agreement, while the precisions of our measurements are better by up to a factor of 2. We find that 1D non-magnetic model atmospheres fail to reproduce the observations while 3D MHD simulations are qualitatively consistent. The LD measurements, together with MHD simulations, confirm that Kepler-17, WASP-18, and KELT-24 have relatively high magnetic fields ($&gt;200$ G). This study paves the way for estimating the stellar surface magnetic field using the LD measurements.</description>

      <title>Double-lined Spectroscopic Binaries from the LAMOST Low-Resolution Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a data-driven spectral model that we have developed for the identification of double-lined spectroscopic binary stars (SB2s) in the LAMOST low-resolution survey (R$\sim$1800). Employing simultaneous fitting with both single-star and binary-star models, we detected over 4800 SB2 candidates, where both components are detectably contributing to the spectrum, from an initial pool of 2.6 million objects. Tests show that our model favors FGK-type main-sequence binaries with high mass ratio ($q\geq$ 0.7) and large radial velocity separation ($\Delta \rm RV \geq$ 100~km$\,$s$^{-1}$). Almost all of these candidates are positioned above the main sequence in the color-magnitude diagram, indicating their binary nature. Additionally, we utilized various observational data, including spectroscopy, photometry, parallax, and extinction, to determine multiple physical parameters such as the effective temperature, age, metallicity, radial velocity, mass, mass ratio, stellar radius, along with their associated uncertainties for these SB2 candidates. For the 44 candidates with seven or more observational epochs, we provide complete orbital solutions. We make available catalogs containing various stellar parameters for identified SB2 systems.</description>

      <title>A multi-instrument study of ultraviolet bursts and associated surges in AR 12957</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between UV Bursts and solar surges is complex, with these events sometimes being observed together and sometimes being observed independently. Why this sporadic association exists is unknown, however, it likely relates to the physical conditions at the site of the energy release that drives these events. Here, we aim to better understand the relationship between UV Bursts and solar surges through a multi-instrument analysis of several associated events that occurred around the trailing sunspot in AR 12957. We use data from Solar Orbiter, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) to achieve our aims. These data were sampled on 3rd March 2022 between 09:30:30 UT and 11:00:00 UT, during which time a coordinated observing campaign associated with the Slow Solar Wind Connection Solar Orbiter Observing Plan took place. Numerous small-scale negative polarity magnetic magnetic features (MMFs) are observed to move quickly (potentially up to 3.3 km/s) away from a sunspot until they collide with a more stable positive polarity plage region around 7 Mm away. Several UV Bursts are identified in IRIS slit-jaw imager (SJI) 1400 {\AA} data co-spatial to where these opposite polarity fields interact, with spatial scales (2 Mm&lt;) and lifetimes (20&lt; min) larger than typical values for such events. Two surges are also observed to occur at these locations, with one being short (5 Mm) and hot (bright in IRIS SJI images), whilst the other is a cooler (dark in coronal imaging channels), longer surge that appears to fill an active region loop. Magnetic reconnection between the negative polarity MMFs around the sunspot and the positive polarity plage region appears to be the driver of these events. Both the speed of the MMFs and the locally open magnetic topology of the plage region could possibly be important for forming the surges.</description>

      <title>From spherical stars to disk-like structures: 3D common-envelope evolution of massive binaries beyond inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional simulations usually fail to cover the entire dynamical common-envelope phase of gravitational wave progenitor systems due to the vast range of spatial and temporal scales involved. We investigated the common-envelope interactions of a $10\,M_\odot$ red supergiant primary star with a black hole and a neutron star companion, respectively, until full envelope ejection (${\gtrsim}\,97 \,\mathrm{\%}$ of the envelope mass). We find that the dynamical plunge-in of the systems determines largely the orbital separations of the core binary system, while the envelope ejection by recombination acts only at later stages of the evolution and fails to harden the core binaries down to orbital frequencies where they qualify as progenitors of gravitational-wave-emitting double-compact object mergers. As opposed to the conventional picture of a spherically symmetric envelope ejection, our simulations show a new mechanism: The rapid plunge-in of the companion transforms the spherical morphology of the giant primary star into a disk-like structure. During this process, magnetic fields are amplified, and the subsequent transport of material through the disk around the core binary system drives a fast jet-like outflow in the polar directions. While most of the envelope material is lost through a recombination-driven wind from the outer edge of the disk, about $7\,\mathrm{\%}$ of the envelope leaves the system via the magnetically driven outflows. We further explored the potential evolutionary pathways of the post-common-envelope systems given the expected remaining lifetime of the primary core ($2.97\,M_\odot$) until core collapse ($6{\times}10^{4}\,\mathrm{yr}$), most likely forming a neutron star. We find that the interaction of the core binary system with the circumbinary disk increases the likelihood of giving rise to a double-neutron star merger. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Searching for the mHz variability in the TESS observations of nova-like cataclysmic variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AIMS: We investigated fast optical variability of selected nova-like cataclysmic variables observed by TESS satellite. We searched for break frequencies (f_b) in the corresponding power density spectra (PDS). The goal is to study whether these systems in almost permanent high optical state exhibit preferred f_b around 1 mHz. METHODS: We selected non-interrupted light curve portions with duration of 5 and 10 days. We divided these portions into ten equally long light curve subsamples and calculated mean PDS. We searched for f_b in frequency interval from log(f/Hz) = -3.5 to -2.4. We defined as positive detection when the f_b was present in at least 50% of the light curve portions with a predefined minimum number of detections. RESULTS: We measured f_b in 15 nova-like systems and confirmed that the value of this frequency is clustered around 1 mHz with a maximum of the distribution between log(f/Hz) = -2.95 and -2.84. The confidence that this maximum is not a random feature of a uniform distribution is at least 96%. This is considerably improved since previous value of 69%. We discuss the origin of these f_b in the context of sandwich model where central hot X-ray corona surrounds central optically thick disc. This scenario could be supported by correlation between white dwarf mass and f_b; the larger the mass, the lower the frequency. We see such tendency in the measured data, however the data are too scattered and based on low number of measurements. Finally, it appears that systems with detected f_b have lower inclination than 60-75 degrees. In higher inclination binaries the central disc is not seen and the PDS is dominated by red noise. This also supports the inner disc regions as source of the observed f_b.</description>

      <title>Extending the Asteroseismic Calibration of the Stellar Rossby Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar Rossby number (Ro) is a dimensionless quantity that is used in the description of fluid flows. It characterizes the relative importance of Coriolis forces on convective motions, which is central to understanding magnetic stellar evolution. Here we present an expanded sample of Kepler asteroseismic targets to help calibrate the relation between Ro and Gaia color, and we extend the relation to redder colors using observations of the mean activity levels and rotation periods for a sample of brighter stars from the Mount Wilson survey. Our quadratic fit to the combined sample is nearly linear between 0.55 &lt; G_BP-G_RP &lt; 1.2, and can be used to estimate Ro for stars with spectral types between F5 and K3. The strong deviation from linearity in the original calibration may reflect an observational bias against the detection of solar-like oscillations at higher activity levels for the coolest stars.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermonuclear reaction rates and Maxwellian averaged cross sections (MACS) for the 84Kr(n,{\gamma}) 85Kr and 86Kr(n,{\gamma}) 87Kr processes were examined using the statistical model code Talys v1.96. The effects of nuclear level densities (NLDs) on Maxwellian averaged cross sections and neutron capture rates are examined both quantitatively and qualitatively. The present Talys based MACS and radiative capture rates for 84Kr(n,{\gamma}) 85Kr and 86Kr(n,{\gamma}) 87Kr processes agree well with the earlier reported findings. The statistical models nuclear properties (level density and gamma ray strength) were fine tuned to reproduce the existing experimental nuclear data.</description>

      <title>Intense star cluster formation: stellar masses, the mass function, and the fundamental mass scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the birth environment of a massive globular cluster, the combination of a luminous young stellar population and a high column density induces a state in which the thermal optical depth and radiation pressure are both appreciable. In this state, the sonic mass scale, which influences the peak of the stellar mass function, is tied to a fundamental scale composed of the Planck mass and the mass per particle. Thermal feedback also affects the opacity-limited minimum mass and affects how protostellar outflows and binary fragmentation modify stellar masses. Considering the regions that collapse to form massive stars, we argue that thermal stabilization is likely to flatten the high-mass slope of the initial mass function. Among regions that are optically thick to thermal radiation, we expect the stellar population to become increasingly top-heavy at higher column densities, although this effect can be offset by lowering the metallicity. A toy model is presented that demonstrates these effects, and in which radiation pressure leads to gas dispersal before all of the mass is converted into stars.</description>

Abstract: We report on the statistical confirmation of a second planet inside the TIC 393818343 system. The first planet TIC 393818343 b has been confirmed and classified as a Warm Jupiter planet with a period of P = (16.24921 +- 0.00003) days. The second planet in the system has an orbital period of P = (7.8458 +- 0.0023) days and orbits 2.05 times closer to its host star. The second planet was initially spotted by the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCOGT) and amateur astronomers. This Super-Neptunian exoplanet marks TIC 393818343 as a multi-planetary system.</description>

      <title>Massive Star Cluster Formation with Binaries. I. Evolution of Binary Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of populations of binary stars within massive cluster-forming regions. We simulate the formation of young massive star clusters within giant molecular clouds with masses ranging from 2 x 10$^{4}$ to 3.2 x 10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$. We use Torch, which couples stellar dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, star and binary formation, stellar evolution, and stellar feedback through the AMUSE framework. We find that the binary fraction decreases during cluster formation at all molecular cloud masses. The binaries' orbital properties also change, with stronger and quicker changes in denser, more massive clouds. Most of the changes we see can be attributed to the disruption of binaries wider than 100 au, although the close binary fraction also decreases in the densest cluster-forming region. The binary fraction for O stars remains above 90%, but exchanges and dynamical hardening are ubiquitous, indicating that O stars undergo frequent few-body interactions early during the cluster formation process. Changes to the populations of binaries are a by-product of hierarchical cluster assembly: most changes to the binary population take place when the star formation rate is high and there are frequent mergers between sub-clusters in the cluster-forming region. A universal primordial binary distribution based on observed inner companions in the Galactic field is consistent with the binary populations of young clusters with resolved stellar populations, and the scatter between clusters of similar masses could be explained by differences in their formation history.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Nuclear Structure and $\beta$-decay Properties of As Isotopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nuclear ground state properties of 67 80As nuclei have been investigated within the framework of relativistic mean field (RMF) approach. The RMF model with density dependent (DDME2) interaction is utilized for the calculation of potential energy curves and the nuclear ground state deformation parameters $\beta_2$ of selected As isotopes. Later, the $\beta$ decay properties of As isotopes were studied using the proton neutron quasi particle random phase approximation pnQRPA model. These include Gamow Tellar (GT) strength distributions, log ft values, $\beta$ decay half lives, stellar $\beta$ plus minus decays and stellar electron positron capture rates. The $\beta_2$ values computed from RMF model were employed in the on QRPA model as an input parameter for the calculations of $\beta$-decay properties for 67 80As. The calculated log ft values were in decent agreement with the measured data. The predicted $\beta$-decay half lives matched the experimental values within a factor of 10. The stellar rates were compared with the shell model results. Only at high temperature and density values, the sum of $\beta$ plus and electron capture rates had a finite contribution. On the other hand, the sum of $\beta$ negative and positron capture rates were sizeable only at low density and high temperature values. For all such cases, the pn QRPA rates were found to be bigger than the shell model rates up to a factor of 33 or more. The findings reported in the current investigation could prove valuable for simulating the late stage stellar evolution of massive stars.</description>

      <title>Ice origins of OCS and chemistry of CS2-bearing ice mantles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the formation of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) in interstellar ices is key to constrain the sulfur chemistry in the interstellar medium (ISM), since it is the only ice S-bearing molecule securely detected thus far. Two general pathways for OCS formation have been proposed: sulfurization of CO (CO+S) and oxidation of CS (CS+O), but their relative contribution in interstellar ices remains unconstrained. We have evaluated the contribution of both pathways to OCS formation upon energetic processing in isotopically-labeled CO2:CS2 and CO:CS2 ice samples at 7-50 K. Our results indicated that formation of OCS through the CS+O pathway was more favorable than through the CO+S pathway, as previously suggested by theoretical calculations. In addition, its relative contribution increased at higher temperatures. Therefore, this pathway could play a role in the ice formation of OCS, especially in warm regions where CO is expected to be preferentially in the gas phase. At the same time, we have explored the chemistry of CS2-bearing, CO2-, CO-, and also H2O-rich ices, that could be relevant to the sulfur interstellar chemistry. We observed formation of a variety of S-bearing products in addition to OCS, including SO2, C3S2, and S2. However, a significant fraction of sulfur was not detected at the end of the experiments, and could be locked in long, undetectable sulfur allotropes, one of the potential carriers of the missing sulfur in the dense ISM.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetry of SN 2023ixf reveals both circumstellar material and helium core to be aspherical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present multi-epoch optical spectropolarimetric and imaging polarimetric observations of the nearby Type II supernova (SN) 2023ixf discovered in M101 at a distance of 6.85 Mpc. The first imaging polarimetric observations were taken +2.33 days (60085.08 MJD) after the explosion, while the last imaging polarimetric data points (+73.19 and +76.19 days) were acquired after the fall from the light curve plateau. At +2.33 days there is strong evidence of circumstellar material (CSM) interaction in the spectra and the light curve. A significant level of polarization $P_r = 0.88\pm 0.06 \% $ seen during this phase indicates that this CSM is aspherical. We find that the polarization evolves with time toward the interstellar polarization level ($0.35\%$) during the photospheric phase, which suggests that the recombination photosphere is spherically symmetric. There is a jump in polarization ($P_r =0.65 \pm 0.08 \% $) at +73.19 days when the light curve falls from the plateau. This is a phase where polarimetric data is sensitive to non-spherical inner ejecta or a decrease in optical depth into the single scattering regime. We also present spectropolarimetric data that reveal line (de)polarization during most of the observed epochs. In addition, at +14.50 days we see an "inverse P Cygn" profile in the H and He line polarization, which clearly indicates the presence of asymmetrically distributed material overlying the photosphere. The overall temporal evolution of polarization is typical for Type II SNe, but the high level of polarization during the rising phase has only been observed in SN 2023ixf.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mainstream dynamo models predict that the sunspot cycle is stochastic. The official Solar Cycle Prediction Panel forecasts only the ongoing sunspot cycle because any forecast beyond one cycle is considered impossible. We analyse the sunspot data using the Discrete Chi-square Method (DCM), which can detect many periodic signals superimposed on an arbitrary trend. Our DCM model predictions are longer and more accurate than the official Solar Cycle Prediction Panel forecast. We detect the signals of planets, especially those of the Earth and Jupiter.If the Flux Transfer Events (FTE) of these planets cause the sunspots, there would be a relatively simple explanation for the sunspot cycle, the Hale's law and the differential rotation and many other phenomena observed in the Sun. Unfortunately, our study has become excessively long because the fighting against the mainstream windmills has taken its toll.</description>

      <title>Fully Kinetic Simulations of Proton-Beam-Driven Instabilities from Parker Solar Probe Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The expanding solar wind plasma ubiquitously exhibits anisotropic non-thermal particle velocity distributions. Typically, proton Velocity Distribution Functions (VDFs) show the presence of a core and a field-aligned beam. Novel observations made by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) in the innermost heliosphere have revealed new complex features in the proton VDFs, namely anisotropic beams that sometimes experience perpendicular diffusion. In this study, we use a 2.5D fully kinetic simulation to investigate the stability of proton VDFs with anisotropic beams observed by PSP. Our setup consists of a core and an anisotropic beam populations that drift with respect to each other. This configuration triggers a proton-beam instability from which nearly parallel fast magnetosonic modes develop. Our results demonstrate that before this instability reaches saturation, the waves resonantly interact with the beam protons, causing perpendicular heating at the expense of the parallel temperature.</description>

      <title>Tidal Spin-up of Subdwarf B Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars are stripped helium-burning stars that are often found in close binaries, where they experience strong tidal interactions. The dissipation of tidally excited gravity waves alters their rotational evolution throughout the sdB lifetime. While many sdB binaries have well-measured rotational and orbital frequencies, there have been few theoretical efforts to accurately calculate the tidal torque produced by gravity waves. In this work, we directly calculate the tidal excitation of internal gravity waves in realistic sdB stellar models and integrate the coupled spin-orbit evolution of sdB binaries. We find that for canonical sdB ($M_\mathrm{sdB}=0.47\,M_\odot$) binaries, the transitional orbital period below which they could reach tidal synchronization in the sdB lifetime is $\sim \! 0.2\;\mathrm{days}$, with weak dependence on the companion masses. For low-mass sdBs ($M_\mathrm{sdB}=0.37\,M_\odot$) formed from more massive progenitor stars, the transitional orbital period becomes $\sim \! 0.15\;\mathrm{days}$. These values are very similar to the tidal synchronization boundary ($\sim \! 0.2\;\mathrm{days}$) evident from observations. We discuss the dependence of tidal torques on stellar radii, and we make predictions for the rapidly rotating white dwarfs formed from synchronized sdB binaries.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray north-south anisotropy: rigidity spectrum and solar cycle variations observed by ground-based muon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The north-south (NS) anisotropy of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) is dominated by a diamagnetic drift flow of GCRs in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), allowing us to derive key parameters of cosmic-ray propagation, such as the density gradient and diffusion coefficient. We propose a new method to analyze the rigidity spectrum of GCR anisotropy and reveal a solar cycle variation of the NS anisotropy's spectrum using ground-based muon detectors in Nagoya, Japan, and Hobart, Australia. The physics-based correction method for the atmospheric temperature effect on muons is used to combine the different-site detectors free from local atmospheric effects. NS channel pairs in the multi-directional muon detectors are formed to enhance sensitivity to the NS anisotropy, and in this process, general graph matching in graph theory is introduced to survey optimized pairs. Moreover, Bayesian estimation with the Gaussian process allows us to unfold the rigidity spectrum without supposing any analytical function for the spectral shape. Thanks to these novel approaches, it has been discovered that the rigidity spectrum of the NS anisotropy is dynamically varying with solar activity every year. It is attributed to a rigidity-dependent variation of the radial density gradient of GCRs based on the nature of the diamagnetic drift in the IMF. The diffusion coefficient and mean-free-path length of GCRs as functions of the rigidity are also derived from the diffusion-convection flow balance. This analysis expands the estimation limit of the mean-free-path length into $\le200$ GV rigidity region from $&lt;10$ GV region achieved by solar energetic particle observations.</description>

Abstract: We report the detection of broad, flat-topped emission in the fine-structure lines of [Ne V], [Ne VI], and [O IV] in mid-infrared spectra of the O9 V star 10 Lacertae obtained with JWST/MIRI. Optically thin emission in these high ions traces a hot, low-density component of the wind. The observed line fluxes imply a mass-loss rate of 2-4 x 10^8 Msun/yr, which is an order of magnitude larger than previous estimates based on UV and optical diagnostics. The presence of this hot component reconciles measured values of the mass-loss rate with theoretical predictions, and appears to solve the "weak wind" problem for the particular case of 10 Lac.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from dense environments : Flavor mechanisms, theoretical approaches, observations, and new directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11814v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino masses and mixings produce vacuum oscillations, an established quantum mechanical phenomenon. In matter, the Mikheev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effect, due to neutrino interactions with the background particles, triggers resonant flavor modification. In dense environments, such as core-collapse supernovae or compact mergers, sizable neutrino-neutrino interactions, shock waves and turbulence impact the neutrino flavor content under a variety of phenomena. Theoretical approaches of neutrino propagation range from the mean-field approximation to the full quantum kinetic equations. Intriguing connections have been uncovered between weakly interacting dense neutrino gases and other many-body systems and domains, from condensed matter and nuclear physics to quantum computing. Besides the intrinsic theoretical interest, establishing how neutrinos change flavor contributes to answer the longstanding open questions of how massive stars explode and of the r-process sites. It is also important for future observations of core-collapse supernova neutrinos and of the diffuse supernova neutrino background that should be discovered in the foreseeable future.</description>

      <title>Quasithermal GeV neutrinos from neutron-loaded magnetized outflows in core-collapse supernovae: spectra and light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapidly rotating and strongly magnetized protoneutron stars (PNSs) created in core-collapse supernovae can drive relativistic magnetized winds. Ions and neutrons can be co-accelerated while they remain coupled through elastic collisions. We investigate the nucleosynthesis and subsequent nuclear disintegration, and find that relativistic neutrons can be generated in such magnetized winds. Upon eventual decoupling, resulting inelastic collisions with ejecta lead to pion production, resulting in $0.1-10\,{\rm GeV}$ neutrinos. Following this scenario presented in Murase, Dasgupta \&amp; Thompson, Phys. Rev. D, 89, 043012 (2014), we numerically calculate the spectra and light curves of quasithermal neutrino emission. In the event of a Galactic supernova, $\sim 10-1000$ neutrino events could be detected with Hyper-Kamiokande, KM3Net-ORCA and IceCube-Upgrade for PNSs with surface magnetic field $B_{\rm dip}\sim 10^{13-15}\,{\rm G}$ and initial spin period $P_i \sim 1-30\,{\rm ms}$. Successful detection will enable us to study supernovae as multienergy neutrino sources and may provide clues to the roles of PNSs in diverse classes of transients.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analysed young stellar clusters with spatial and kinematic coherence in the Orion star-forming complex. For this study, we selected a sample of pre-main sequence candidates using parallaxes, proper motions and positions on the colour-magnitude diagram. After applying a hierarchical clustering algorithm in the 5D parameter space provided by Gaia DR3, we divided the recovered clusters into two regimes: Big Structures and Small Structures, defined by the number of detected stars per cluster. In the first regime, we found 13 stellar groups distributed along the declination axis in the regions where there is a high density of stars. In the second regime, we recovered 34 clusters classified into two types: 14 as small groups completely independent from the larger structures, including four candidates of new clusters, and 12 classified as sub-structures embedded within five larger clusters. Additionally, radial velocity data from APOGEE-2 and GALAH DR3 was included to study the phase space in some regions of the Orion complex. From the Big Structure regime, we found evidence of a general expansion in the Orion OB1 association over a common centre, giving a clue about the dynamical effects the region is undergoing. Likewise, in the Small Structure regime, the projected kinematics shows the ballistic expansion in the $\lambda$ Orionis association and the detection of likely events of clusters' close encounters in the OB1 association.</description>
