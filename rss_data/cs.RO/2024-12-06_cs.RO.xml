      <title>A Teleoperation System with Impedance Control and Disturbance Observer for Robot-Assisted Rehabilitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical movement therapy is a crucial method of rehabilitation aimed at reinstating mobility among patients facing motor dysfunction due to neurological conditions or accidents. Such therapy is usually featured as patient-specific, repetitive, and labor-intensive. The conventional method, where therapists collaborate with patients to conduct repetitive physical training, proves strenuous due to these characteristics. The concept of robot-assisted rehabilitation, assisting therapists with robotic systems, has gained substantial popularity. However, building such systems presents challenges, such as diverse task demands, uncertainties in dynamic models, and safety issues. To address these concerns, in this paper, we proposed a bilateral teleoperation system for rehabilitation. The control scheme of the system is designed as an integrated framework of impedance control and disturbance observer where the former can ensure compliant human-robot interaction without the need for force sensors while the latter can compensate for dynamic uncertainties when only a roughly identified dynamic model is available. Furthermore, the scheme allows free switching between tracking tasks and physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). The presented system can execute a wide array of pre-defined trajectories with varying patterns, adaptable to diverse needs. Moreover, the system can capture therapists' demonstrations, replaying them as many times as necessary. The effectiveness of the teleoperation system is experimentally evaluated and demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Dense 3D Mapping Using Submaps Derived From Orthogonal Imaging Sonars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D situational awareness is critical for any autonomous system. However, when operating underwater, environmental conditions often dictate the use of acoustic sensors. These acoustic sensors are plagued by high noise and a lack of 3D information in sonar imagery, motivating the use of an orthogonal pair of imaging sonars to recover 3D perceptual data. Thus far, mapping systems in this area only use a subset of the available data at discrete timesteps and rely on object-level prior information in the environment to develop high-coverage 3D maps. Moreover, simple repeating objects must be present to build high-coverage maps. In this work, we propose a submap-based mapping system integrated with a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system to produce dense, 3D maps of complex unknown environments with varying densities of simple repeating objects. We compare this submapping approach to our previous works in this area, analyzing simple and highly complex environments, such as submerged aircraft. We analyze the tradeoffs between a submapping-based approach and our previous work leveraging simple repeating objects. We show where each method is well-motivated and where they fall short. Importantly, our proposed use of submapping achieves an advance in underwater situational awareness with wide aperture multi-beam imaging sonar, moving toward generalized large-scale dense 3D mapping capability for fully unknown complex environments.</description>

      <title>Safe Adaptive Cruise Control Under Perception Uncertainty: A Deep Ensemble and Conformal Tube Model Predictive Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving heavily relies on perception systems to interpret the environment for decision-making. To enhance robustness in these safety critical applications, this paper considers a Deep Ensemble of Deep Neural Network regressors integrated with Conformal Prediction to predict and quantify uncertainties. In the Adaptive Cruise Control setting, the proposed method performs state and uncertainty estimation from RGB images, informing the downstream controller of the DNN perception uncertainties. An adaptive cruise controller using Conformal Tube Model Predictive Control is designed to ensure probabilistic safety. Evaluations with a high-fidelity simulator demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in speed tracking and safe distance maintaining, including in Out-Of-Distribution scenarios.</description>

      <title>Towards an Autonomous Test Driver: High-Performance Driver Modeling via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Success in racing requires a unique combination of vehicle setup, understanding of the racetrack, and human expertise. Since building and testing many different vehicle configurations in the real world is prohibitively expensive, high-fidelity simulation is a critical part of racecar development. However, testing different vehicle configurations still requires expert human input in order to evaluate their performance on different racetracks. In this work, we present the first steps towards an autonomous test driver, trained using deep reinforcement learning, capable of evaluating changes in vehicle setup on racing performance while driving at the level of the best human drivers. In addition, the autonomous driver model can be tuned to exhibit more human-like behavioral patterns by incorporating imitation learning into the RL training process. This extension permits the possibility of driver-specific vehicle setup optimization.</description>

      <title>Learning Based MPC for Autonomous Driving Using a Low Dimensional Residual Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a learning based Model Predictive Control (MPC) using a low dimensional residual model is proposed for autonomous driving. One of the critical challenge in autonomous driving is the complexity of vehicle dynamics, which impedes the formulation of accurate vehicle model. Inaccurate vehicle model can significantly impact the performance of MPC controller. To address this issue, this paper decomposes the nominal vehicle model into invariable and variable elements. The accuracy of invariable component is ensured by calibration, while the deviations in the variable elements are learned by a low-dimensional residual model. The features of residual model are selected as the physical variables most correlated with nominal model errors. Physical constraints among these features are formulated to explicitly define the valid region within the feature space. The formulated model and constraints are incorporated into the MPC framework and validated through both simulation and real vehicle experiments. The results indicate that the proposed method significantly enhances the model accuracy and controller performance.</description>

      <title>MOANA: Multi-Radar Dataset for Maritime Odometry and Autonomous Navigation Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maritime environmental sensing requires overcoming challenges from complex conditions such as harsh weather, platform perturbations, large dynamic objects, and the requirement for long detection ranges. While cameras and LiDAR are commonly used in ground vehicle navigation, their applicability in maritime settings is limited by range constraints and hardware maintenance issues. Radar sensors, however, offer robust long-range detection capabilities and resilience to physical contamination from weather and saline conditions, making it a powerful sensor for maritime navigation. Among various radar types, X-band radar (e.g., marine radar) is widely employed for maritime vessel navigation, providing effective long-range detection essential for situational awareness and collision avoidance. Nevertheless, it exhibits limitations during berthing operations where close-range object detection is critical. To address this shortcoming, we incorporate W-band radar (e.g., Navtech imaging radar), which excels in detecting nearby objects with a higher update rate. We present a comprehensive maritime sensor dataset featuring multi-range detection capabilities. This dataset integrates short-range LiDAR data, medium-range W-band radar data, and long-range X-band radar data into a unified framework. Additionally, it includes object labels for oceanic object detection usage, derived from radar and stereo camera images. The dataset comprises seven sequences collected from diverse regions with varying levels of estimation difficulty, ranging from easy to challenging, and includes common locations suitable for global localization tasks. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing research in place recognition, odometry estimation, SLAM, object detection, and dynamic object elimination within maritime environments.

      <title>Learning Speed-Adaptive Walking Agent Using Imitation Learning with Physics-Informed Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual models of human gait, or digital twins, offer a promising solution for studying mobility without the need for labor-intensive data collection. However, challenges such as the sim-to-real gap and limited adaptability to diverse walking conditions persist. To address these, we developed and validated a framework to create a skeletal humanoid agent capable of adapting to varying walking speeds while maintaining biomechanically realistic motions. The framework combines a synthetic data generator, which produces biomechanically plausible gait kinematics from open-source biomechanics data, and a training system that uses adversarial imitation learning to train the agent's walking policy. We conducted comprehensive analyses comparing the agent's kinematics, synthetic data, and the original biomechanics dataset. The agent achieved a root mean square error of 5.24 +- 0.09 degrees at varying speeds compared to ground-truth kinematics data, demonstrating its adaptability. This work represents a significant step toward developing a digital twin of human locomotion, with potential applications in biomechanics research, exoskeleton design, and rehabilitation.</description>

      <title>Is FISHER All You Need in The Multi-AUV Underwater Target Tracking Task?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is significant to employ multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to execute the underwater target tracking task collaboratively. However, it's pretty challenging to meet various prerequisites utilizing traditional control methods. Therefore, we propose an effective two-stage learning from demonstrations training framework, FISHER, to highlight the adaptability of reinforcement learning (RL) methods in the multi-AUV underwater target tracking task, while addressing its limitations such as extensive requirements for environmental interactions and the challenges in designing reward functions. The first stage utilizes imitation learning (IL) to realize policy improvement and generate offline datasets. To be specific, we introduce multi-agent discriminator-actor-critic based on improvements of the generative adversarial IL algorithm and multi-agent IL optimization objective derived from the Nash equilibrium condition. Then in the second stage, we develop multi-agent independent generalized decision transformer, which analyzes the latent representation to match the future states of high-quality samples rather than reward function, attaining further enhanced policies capable of handling various scenarios. Besides, we propose a simulation to simulation demonstration generation procedure to facilitate the generation of expert demonstrations in underwater environments, which capitalizes on traditional control methods and can easily accomplish the domain transfer to obtain demonstrations. Extensive simulation experiments from multiple scenarios showcase that FISHER possesses strong stability, multi-task performance and capability of generalization.</description>

      <title>Design, Characterization, and Validation of a Variable Stiffness Prosthetic Elbow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intuitively, prostheses with user-controllable stiffness could mimic the intrinsic behavior of the human musculoskeletal system, promoting safe and natural interactions and task adaptability in real-world scenarios. However, prosthetic design often disregards compliance because of the additional complexity, weight, and needed control channels. This paper focuses on designing a Variable Stiffness Actuator (VSA) with weight, size, and performance compatible with prosthetic applications, addressing its implementation for the elbow joint. While a direct biomimetic approach suggests adopting an Agonist-Antagonist (AA) layout to replicate the biceps and triceps brachii with elastic actuation, this solution is not optimal to accommodate the varied morphologies of residual limbs. Instead, we employed the AA layout to craft an elbow prosthesis fully contained in the user's forearm, catering to individuals with distal transhumeral amputations. Additionally, we introduce a variant of this design where the two motors are split in the upper arm and forearm to distribute mass and volume more evenly along the bionic limb, enhancing comfort for patients with more proximal amputation levels. We characterize and validate our approach, demonstrating that both architectures meet the target requirements for an elbow prosthesis. The system attains the desired 120{\deg} range of motion, achieves the target stiffness range of [2, 60] Nm/rad, and can actively lift up to 3 kg. Our novel design reduces weight by up to 50% compared to existing VSAs for elbow prostheses while achieving performance comparable to the state of the art. Case studies suggest that passive and variable compliance could enable robust and safe interactions and task adaptability in the real world.</description>

      <title>A Model of the Sidewalk Salsa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When two pedestrians approach each other on the sidewalk head-on, they sometimes engage in an awkward interaction, both deviating to the same side (repeatedly) to avoid a collision. This phenomenon is known as the sidewalk salsa. Although well known, no existing model describes how this "dance" arises. Such a model must capture the nuances of individual interactions between pedestrians that lead to the sidewalk salsa. Therefore, it could be helpful in the development of mobile robots that frequently participate in such individual interactions, for example, by informing robots in their decision-making. Here, I present a model based on the communication-enabled interaction framework capable of reproducing the sidewalk salsa. The model assumes pedestrians have a deterministic plan for their future movements and a probabilistic belief about the movements of another pedestrian. Combined, the plan and belief result in a perceived risk that pedestrians try to keep below a personal threshold. In simulations of this model, the sidewalk salsa occurs in a symmetrical scenario. At the same time, it shows behavior comparable to observed real-world pedestrian behavior in scenarios with initial position offsets or risk threshold differences. Two other scenarios provide support for a hypothesis from previous literature stating that cultural norms, in the form of a biased belief about on which side others will pass (i.e. deviating to the left or right), contribute to the occurrence of the sidewalk salsa. Thereby, the proposed model provides insight into how the sidewalk salsa arises.</description>

      <title>Learning Dual-Arm Push and Grasp Synergy in Dense Clutter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic grasping in densely cluttered environments is challenging due to scarce collision-free grasp affordances. Non-prehensile actions can increase feasible grasps in cluttered environments, but most research focuses on single-arm rather than dual-arm manipulation. Policies from single-arm systems fail to fully leverage the advantages of dual-arm coordination. We propose a target-oriented hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that learns dual-arm push-grasp synergy for grasping objects to enhance dexterous manipulation in dense clutter. Our framework maps visual observations to actions via a pre-trained deep learning backbone and a novel CNN-based DRL model, trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to develop a dual-arm push-grasp strategy. The backbone enhances feature mapping in densely cluttered environments. A novel fuzzy-based reward function is introduced to accelerate efficient strategy learning. Our system is developed and trained in Isaac Gym and then tested in simulations and on a real robot. Experimental results show that our framework effectively maps visual data to dual push-grasp motions, enabling the dual-arm system to grasp target objects in complex environments. Compared to other methods, our approach generates 6-DoF grasp candidates and enables dual-arm push actions, mimicking human behavior. Results show that our method efficiently completes tasks in densely cluttered environments. https://sites.google.com/view/pg4da/home</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Safety Shield for Safe and Efficient Reinforcement Learning of Navigation Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to a variety of robotics applications, where it outperforms classical methods. However, the safety aspect of RL and the transfer to the real world remain an open challenge. A prominent field for tackling this challenge and ensuring the safety of the agents during training and execution is safe reinforcement learning. Safe RL can be achieved through constrained RL and safe exploration approaches. The former learns the safety constraints over the course of training to achieve a safe behavior by the end of training, at the cost of high number of collisions at earlier stages of the training. The latter offers robust safety by enforcing the safety constraints as hard constraints, which prevents collisions but hinders the exploration of the RL agent, resulting in lower rewards and poor performance. To overcome those drawbacks, we propose a novel safety shield, that combines the robustness of the optimization-based controllers with the long prediction capabilities of the RL agents, allowing the RL agent to adaptively tune the parameters of the controller. Our approach is able to improve the exploration of the RL agents for navigation tasks, while minimizing the number of collisions. Experiments in simulation show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in the reached goals-to-collisions ratio in different challenging environments. The goals-to-collisions ratio metrics emphasizes the importance of minimizing the number of collisions, while learning to accomplish the task. Our approach achieves a higher number of reached goals compared to the classic safety shields and fewer collisions compared to constrained RL approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in a real-world experiment.</description>

      <title>CALMM-Drive: Confidence-Aware Autonomous Driving with Large Multimodal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision-making and motion planning are pivotal in ensuring the safety and efficiency of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Existing methodologies typically adopt two paradigms: decision then planning or generation then scoring. However, the former often struggles with misalignment between decisions and planning, while the latter encounters significant challenges in integrating short-term operational utility with long-term tactical efficacy. To address these issues, we introduce CALMM-Drive, a novel Confidence-Aware Large Multimodal Model (LMM) empowered Autonomous Driving framework. Our approach employs Top-K confidence elicitation, which facilitates the generation of multiple candidate decisions along with their confidence levels. Furthermore, we propose a novel planning module that integrates a diffusion model for trajectory generation and a hierarchical refinement process to find the optimal path. This framework enables the selection of the best plan accounting for both low-level solution quality and high-level tactical confidence, which mitigates the risks of one-shot decisions and overcomes the limitations induced by short-sighted scoring mechanisms. Comprehensive evaluations in nuPlan closed-loop simulation environments demonstrate the effectiveness of CALMM-Drive in achieving reliable and flexible driving performance, showcasing a significant advancement in the integration of uncertainty in LMM-empowered AVs. The code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning from Wild Animal Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to learn legged robot locomotion skills by watching thousands of wild animal videos from the internet, such as those featured in nature documentaries. Indeed, such videos offer a rich and diverse collection of plausible motion examples, which could inform how robots should move. To achieve this, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Wild Animal Videos (RLWAV), a method to ground these motions into physical robots. We first train a video classifier on a large-scale animal video dataset to recognize actions from RGB clips of animals in their natural habitats. We then train a multi-skill policy to control a robot in a physics simulator, using the classification score of a third-person camera capturing videos of the robot's movements as a reward for reinforcement learning. Finally, we directly transfer the learned policy to a real quadruped Solo. Remarkably, despite the extreme gap in both domain and embodiment between animals in the wild and robots, our approach enables the policy to learn diverse skills such as walking, jumping, and keeping still, without relying on reference trajectories nor skill-specific rewards.</description>

      <title>Multi-cam Multi-map Visual Inertial Localization: System, Validation and Dataset</title>

Abstract: Map-based localization is crucial for the autonomous movement of robots as it provides real-time positional feedback. However, existing VINS and SLAM systems cannot be directly integrated into the robot's control loop. Although VINS offers high-frequency position estimates, it suffers from drift in long-term operation. And the drift-free trajectory output by SLAM is post-processed with loop correction, which is non-causal. In practical control, it is impossible to update the current pose with future information. Furthermore, existing SLAM evaluation systems measure accuracy after aligning the entire trajectory, which overlooks the transformation error between the odometry start frame and the ground truth frame. To address these issues, we propose a multi-cam multi-map visual inertial localization system, which provides real-time, causal and drift-free position feedback to the robot control loop. Additionally, we analyze the error composition of map-based localization systems and propose a set of evaluation metric suitable for measuring causal localization performance. To validate our system, we design a multi-camera IMU hardware setup and collect a long-term challenging campus dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the higher real-time localization accuracy of the proposed system. To foster community development, both the system and the dataset have been made open source https://github.com/zoeylove/Multi-cam-Multi-map-VILO/tree/main.</description>

      <title>Moto: Latent Motion Token as the Bridging Language for Robot Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Models pre-trained on extensive corpora have shown significant success in various natural language processing tasks with minimal fine-tuning. This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich "corpus", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging "language" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>NaVILA: Legged Robot Vision-Language-Action Model for Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes to solve the problem of Vision-and-Language Navigation with legged robots, which not only provides a flexible way for humans to command but also allows the robot to navigate through more challenging and cluttered scenes. However, it is non-trivial to translate human language instructions all the way to low-level leg joint actions. We propose NaVILA, a 2-level framework that unifies a Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) with locomotion skills. Instead of directly predicting low-level actions from VLA, NaVILA first generates mid-level actions with spatial information in the form of language, (e.g., "moving forward 75cm"), which serves as an input for a visual locomotion RL policy for execution. NaVILA substantially improves previous approaches on existing benchmarks. The same advantages are demonstrated in our newly developed benchmarks with IsaacLab, featuring more realistic scenes, low-level controls, and real-world robot experiments. We show more results at https://navila-bot.github.io/</description>

      <title>Code-as-Monitor: Constraint-aware Visual Programming for Reactive and Proactive Robotic Failure Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic detection and prevention of open-set failures are crucial in closed-loop robotic systems. Recent studies often struggle to simultaneously identify unexpected failures reactively after they occur and prevent foreseeable ones proactively. To this end, we propose Code-as-Monitor (CaM), a novel paradigm leveraging the vision-language model (VLM) for both open-set reactive and proactive failure detection. The core of our method is to formulate both tasks as a unified set of spatio-temporal constraint satisfaction problems and use VLM-generated code to evaluate them for real-time monitoring. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of monitoring, we further introduce constraint elements that abstract constraint-related entities or their parts into compact geometric elements. This approach offers greater generality, simplifies tracking, and facilitates constraint-aware visual programming by leveraging these elements as visual prompts. Experiments show that CaM achieves a 28.7% higher success rate and reduces execution time by 31.8% under severe disturbances compared to baselines across three simulators and a real-world setting. Moreover, CaM can be integrated with open-loop control policies to form closed-loop systems, enabling long-horizon tasks in cluttered scenes with dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>PriorMotion: Generative Class-Agnostic Motion Prediction with Raster-Vector Motion Field Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable perception of spatial and motion information is crucial for safe autonomous navigation. Traditional approaches typically fall into two categories: object-centric and class-agnostic methods. While object-centric methods often struggle with missed detections, leading to inaccuracies in motion prediction, many class-agnostic methods focus heavily on encoder design, often overlooking important priors like rigidity and temporal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance, particularly with sparse LiDAR data at distant region. To address these issues, we propose $\textbf{PriorMotion}$, a generative framework that extracts rasterized and vectorized scene representations to model spatio-temporal priors. Our model comprises a BEV encoder, an Raster-Vector prior Encoder, and a Spatio-Temporal prior Generator, improving both spatial and temporal consistency in motion prediction. Additionally, we introduce a standardized evaluation protocol for class-agnostic motion prediction. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that PriorMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance, with further validation on advanced FMCW LiDAR confirming its robustness.</description>

      <title>Thermal and RGB Images Work Better Together in Wind Turbine Damage Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inspection of wind turbine blades (WTBs) is crucial for ensuring their structural integrity and operational efficiency. Traditional inspection methods can be dangerous and inefficient, prompting the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that access hard-to-reach areas and capture high-resolution imagery. In this study, we address the challenge of enhancing defect detection on WTBs by integrating thermal and RGB images obtained from UAVs. We propose a multispectral image composition method that combines thermal and RGB imagery through spatial coordinate transformation, key point detection, binary descriptor creation, and weighted image overlay. Using a benchmark dataset of WTB images annotated for defects, we evaluated several state-of-the-art object detection models. Our results show that composite images significantly improve defect detection efficiency. Specifically, the YOLOv8 model's accuracy increased from 91% to 95%, precision from 89% to 94%, recall from 85% to 92%, and F1-score from 87% to 93%. The number of false positives decreased from 6 to 3, and missed defects reduced from 5 to 2. These findings demonstrate that integrating thermal and RGB imagery enhances defect detection on WTBs, contributing to improved maintenance and reliability.</description>

      <title>Towards Fast and Safety-Guaranteed Trajectory Planning and Tracking for Time-Varying Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When deploying autonomous systems in unknown and changing environments, it is critical that their motion planning and control algorithms are computationally efficient and can be reapplied online in real time, whilst providing theoretical safety guarantees in the presence of disturbances. The satisfaction of these objectives becomes more challenging when considering time-varying dynamics and disturbances, which arise in real-world contexts. We develop methods with the potential to address these issues by applying an offline-computed safety guaranteeing controller on a physical system, to track a virtual system that evolves through a trajectory that is replanned online, accounting for constraints updated online. The first method we propose is designed for general time-varying systems over a finite horizon. Our second method overcomes the finite horizon restriction for periodic systems. We simulate our algorithms on a case study of an autonomous underwater vehicle subject to wave disturbances.</description>

      <title>Supertoroid fitting of objects with holes for robotic grasping and scene generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the strategies to detect the pose and shape of unknown objects is their geometric modeling, consisting on fitting known geometric entities. Classical geometric modeling fits simple shapes such as spheres or cylinders, but often those don't cover the variety of shapes that can be encountered. For those situations, one solution is the use of superquadrics, which can adapt to a wider variety of shapes.
  One of the limitations of superquadrics is that they cannot model objects with holes, such as those with handles. This work aims to fit supersurfaces of degree four, in particular supertoroids, to objects with a single hole. Following the results of superquadrics, simple expressions for the major and minor radial distances are derived, which lead to the fitting of the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the supertoroid. The differential geometry of the surface is also studied as a function of these parameters. The result is a supergeometric modeling that can be used for symmetric objects with and without holes with a simple distance function for the fitting. The proposed algorithm expands considerably the amount of shapes that can be targeted for geometric modeling.</description>

      <title>Transient Multi-Agent Path Finding for Lifelong Navigation in Dense Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) deals with finding conflict-free paths for a set of agents from an initial configuration to a given target configuration. The Lifelong MAPF (LMAPF) problem is a well-studied online version of MAPF in which an agent receives a new target when it reaches its current target. The common approach for solving LMAPF is to treat it as a sequence of MAPF problems, periodically replanning from the agents' current configurations to their current targets. A significant drawback in this approach is that in MAPF the agents must reach a configuration in which all agents are at their targets simultaneously, which is needlessly restrictive for LMAPF. Techniques have been proposed to indirectly mitigate this drawback. We describe cases where these mitigation techniques fail. As an alternative, we propose to solve LMAPF problems by solving a sequence of modified MAPF problems, in which the objective is for each agent to eventually visit its target, but not necessarily for all agents to do so simultaneously. We refer to this MAPF variant as Transient MAPF (TMAPF) and propose several algorithms for solving it based on existing MAPF algorithms. A limited experimental evaluation identifies some cases where using a TMAPF algorithm instead of a MAPF algorithm with an LMAPF framework can improve the system throughput significantly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reliable deployment of deep reinforcement learning in real-world settings requires the ability to generalize across a variety of conditions, including both in-distribution scenarios seen during training as well as novel out-of-distribution scenarios. In this work, we present a framework for dynamics generalization in deep reinforcement learning that unifies these two distinct types of generalization within a single architecture. We introduce a robust adaptation module that provides a mechanism for identifying and reacting to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution environment dynamics, along with a joint training pipeline that combines the goals of in-distribution adaptation and out-of-distribution robustness. Our algorithm GRAM achieves strong generalization performance across in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios upon deployment, which we demonstrate on a variety of realistic simulated locomotion tasks with a quadruped robot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in 3D scenes based on textual descriptions, which is essential for applications like augmented reality and robotics. Traditional 3DVG approaches rely on annotated 3D datasets and predefined object categories, limiting scalability and adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SeeGround, a zero-shot 3DVG framework leveraging 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on large-scale 2D data. We propose to represent 3D scenes as a hybrid of query-aligned rendered images and spatially enriched text descriptions, bridging the gap between 3D data and 2D-VLMs input formats. We propose two modules: the Perspective Adaptation Module, which dynamically selects viewpoints for query-relevant image rendering, and the Fusion Alignment Module, which integrates 2D images with 3D spatial descriptions to enhance object localization. Extensive experiments on ScanRefer and Nr3D demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing zero-shot methods by large margins. Notably, we exceed weakly supervised methods and rival some fully supervised ones, outperforming previous SOTA by 7.7% on ScanRefer and 7.1% on Nr3D, showcasing its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Orchestrated Robust Controller for Precision Control of Heavy-duty Hydraulic Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vast industrial investment along with increased academic research on heavy-duty hydraulic manipulators has unavoidably paved the way for their automatization, necessitating the design of robust and high-precision controllers. In this study, an orchestrated robust controller is designed to address the mentioned issue for generic manipulators with an anthropomorphic arm and spherical wrist. To do so, the entire robotic system is decomposed into subsystems, and a robust controller is designed at each local subsystem by considering unknown model uncertainties, unknown disturbances, and compound input nonlinearities, thanks to virtual decomposition control (VDC). As such, radial basic function neural networks (RBFNNs) are incorporated into VDC to tackle unknown disturbances and uncertainties, resulting in novel decentralized RBFNNs. All robust local controllers designed at each local subsystem, then, are orchestrated to accomplish high-precision control. In the end, for the first time in the context of VDC, a semi-globally uniformly ultimate boundedness is achieved under the designed controller. The validity of the theoretical results is verified by performing extensive simulations and experiments on a 6-degrees-of-freedom industrial manipulator with a nominal lifting capacity of $600\, kg$ at $5$ meters reach. Comparing the simulation result to the state-of-the-art controller along with provided experimental results, demonstrates that proposed method established all promises and performed excellently.</description>

      <title>Are Doppler Velocity Measurements Useful for Spinning Radar Odometry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01537v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spinning, frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radars with 360 degree coverage have been gaining popularity for autonomous-vehicle navigation. However, unlike `fixed' automotive radar, commercially available spinning radar systems typically do not produce radial velocities due to the lack of repeated measurements in the same direction and the fundamental hardware setup. To make these radial velocities observable, we modified the firmware of a commercial spinning radar to use triangular frequency modulation. In this paper, we develop a novel way to use this modulation to extract radial Doppler velocity measurements from consecutive azimuths of a radar intensity scan, without any data association. We show that these noisy, error-prone measurements contain enough information to provide good ego-velocity estimates, and incorporate these estimates into different modern odometry pipelines. We extensively evaluate the pipelines on over 110 km of driving data in progressively more geometrically challenging autonomous-driving environments. We show that Doppler velocity measurements improve odometry in well-defined geometric conditions and enable it to continue functioning even in severely geometrically degenerate environments, such as long tunnels.</description>

      <title>Towards Practical Finite Sample Bounds for Motion Planning in TAMP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When using sampling-based motion planners, such as PRMs, in configuration spaces, it is difficult to determine how many samples are required for the PRM to find a solution consistently. This is relevant in Task and Motion Planning (TAMP), where many motion planning problems must be solved in sequence. We attempt to solve this problem by proving an upper bound on the number of samples that are sufficient, with high probability, to find a solution by drawing on prior work in deterministic sampling and sample complexity theory. We also introduce a numerical algorithm to compute a tighter number of samples based on the proof of the sample complexity theorem we apply to derive our bound. Our experiments show that our numerical bounding algorithm is tight within two orders of magnitude on planar planning problems and becomes looser as the problem's dimensionality increases. When deployed as a heuristic to schedule samples in a TAMP planner, we also observe planning time improvements in planar problems. While our experiments show much work remains to tighten our bounds, the ideas presented in this paper are a step towards a practical sample bound.</description>

      <title>Nl2Hltl2Plan: Scaling Up Natural Language Understanding for Multi-Robots Through Hierarchical Temporal Logic Task Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08188v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To enable non-experts to specify long-horizon, multi-robot collaborative tasks, language models are increasingly used to translate natural language commands into formal specifications. However, because translation can occur in multiple ways, such translations may lack accuracy or lead to inefficient multi-robot planning. Our key insight is that concise hierarchical specifications can simplify planning while remaining straightforward to derive from human instructions. We propose Nl2Hltl2Plan, a framework that translates natural language commands into hierarchical Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and solves the corresponding planning problem. The translation involves two steps leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). First, an LLM transforms instructions into a Hierarchical Task Tree, capturing logical and temporal relations. Next, a fine-tuned LLM converts sub-tasks into flat LTL formulas, which are aggregated into hierarchical specifications, with the lowest level corresponding to ordered robot actions. These specifications are then used with off-the-shelf planners. Our Nl2Hltl2Plan demonstrates the potential of LLMs in hierarchical reasoning for multi-robot task planning. Evaluations in simulation and real-world experiments with human participants show that Nl2Hltl2Plan outperforms existing methods, handling more complex instructions while achieving higher success rates and lower costs in task allocation and planning.

      <title>OMEGA: Efficient Occlusion-Aware Navigation for Air-Ground Robot in Dynamic Environments via State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Air-ground robots (AGRs) are widely used in surveillance and disaster response due to their exceptional mobility and versatility (i.e., flying and driving). Current AGR navigation systems perform well in static occlusion-prone environments (e.g., indoors) by using 3D semantic occupancy networks to predict occlusions for complete local mapping and then computing Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) for path planning. However, these systems face challenges in dynamic, severe occlusion scenes (e.g., crowds) due to limitations in perception networks' low prediction accuracy and path planners' high computation overhead. In this paper, we propose OMEGA, which contains OccMamba with an Efficient AGR-Planner to address the above-mentioned problems. OccMamba adopts a novel architecture that separates semantic and occupancy prediction into independent branches, incorporating two mamba blocks within these branches. These blocks efficiently extract semantic and geometric features in 3D environments with linear complexity, ensuring that the network can learn long-distance dependencies to improve prediction accuracy. Semantic and geometric features are combined within the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space to minimise computational overhead during feature fusion. The resulting semantic occupancy map is then seamlessly integrated into the local map, providing occlusion awareness of the dynamic environment. Our AGR-Planner utilizes this local map and employs kinodynamic A* search and gradient-based trajectory optimization to guarantee planning is ESDF-free and energy-efficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OccMamba outperforms the state-of-the-art 3D semantic occupancy network with 25.0% mIoU. End-to-end navigation experiments in dynamic scenes verify OMEGA's efficiency, achieving a 96% average planning success rate.

      <title>Multimodal LLM Guided Exploration and Active Mapping using Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an active mapping system that could plan for long-horizon exploration goals and short-term actions with a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation. Existing methods either did not take advantage of recent developments in multimodal Large Language Models (LLM) or did not consider challenges in localization uncertainty, which is critical in embodied agents. We propose employing multimodal LLMs for long-horizon planning in conjunction with detailed motion planning using our information-based algorithm. By leveraging high-quality view synthesis from our 3DGS representation, our method employs a multimodal LLM as a zero-shot planner for long-horizon exploration goals from the semantic perspective. We also introduce an uncertainty-aware path proposal and selection algorithm that balances the dual objectives of maximizing the information gain for the environment while minimizing the cost of localization errors. Experiments conducted on the Gibson and Habitat-Matterport 3D datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>ELEMENTAL: Interactive Learning from Demonstrations and Vision-Language Models for Reward Design in Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated compelling performance in robotic tasks, but its success often hinges on the design of complex, ad hoc reward functions. Researchers have explored how Large Language Models (LLMs) could enable non-expert users to specify reward functions more easily. However, LLMs struggle to balance the importance of different features, generalize poorly to out-of-distribution robotic tasks, and cannot represent the problem properly with only text-based descriptions. To address these challenges, we propose ELEMENTAL (intEractive LEarning froM dEmoNstraTion And Language), a novel framework that combines natural language guidance with visual user demonstrations to align robot behavior with user intentions better. By incorporating visual inputs, ELEMENTAL overcomes the limitations of text-only task specifications, while leveraging inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to balance feature weights and match the demonstrated behaviors optimally. ELEMENTAL also introduces an iterative feedback-loop through self-reflection to improve feature, reward, and policy learning. Our experiment results demonstrate that ELEMENTAL outperforms prior work by 42.3% on task success, and achieves 41.3% better generalization in out-of-distribution tasks, highlighting its robustness in LfD.</description>

      <title>RoboHanger: Learning Generalizable Robotic Hanger Insertion for Diverse Garments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the task of hanging clothes, learning how to insert a hanger into a garment is crucial but has been seldom explored in robotics. In this work, we address the problem of inserting a hanger into various unseen garments that are initially laid out flat on a table. This task is challenging due to its long-horizon nature, the high degrees of freedom of the garments, and the lack of data. To simplify the learning process, we first propose breaking the task into several stages. Then, we formulate each stage as a policy learning problem and propose low-dimensional action parameterization. To overcome the challenge of limited data, we build our own simulator and create 144 synthetic clothing assets to effectively collect high-quality training data. Our approach uses single-view depth images and object masks as input, which mitigates the Sim2Real appearance gap and achieves high generalization capabilities for new garments. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world validate our proposed method. By training on various garments in the simulator, our method achieves a 75\% success rate with 8 different unseen garments in the real world.</description>

      <title>Reachable Polyhedral Marching (RPM): An Exact Analysis Tool for Deep-Learned Control Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly used in robotics as policies, state transition models, state estimation models, or all of the above. With these components being learned from data, it is important to be able to analyze what behaviors were learned and how this affects closed-loop performance. In this paper we take steps toward this goal by developing methods for computing control invariant sets and regions of attraction (ROAs) of dynamical systems represented as neural networks. We focus our attention on feedforward neural networks with the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation, which are known to implement continuous piecewise-affine (PWA) functions. We describe the Reachable Polyhedral Marching (RPM) algorithm for enumerating the affine pieces of a neural network through an incremental connected walk. We then use this algorithm to compute exact forward and backward reachable sets, from which we provide methods for computing control invariant sets and ROAs. Our approach is unique in that we find these sets incrementally, without Lyapunov-based tools. In our examples we demonstrate the ability of our approach to find non-convex control invariant sets and ROAs on tasks with learned van der Pol oscillator and pendulum models. Further, we provide an accelerated algorithm for computing ROAs that leverages the incremental and connected enumeration of affine regions that RPM provides. We show this acceleration to lead to a 15x speedup in our examples. Finally, we apply our methods to find a set of states that are stabilized by an image-based controller for an aircraft runway control problem.</description>

      <title>Train a Real-world Local Path Planner in One Hour via Partially Decoupled Reinforcement Learning and Vectorized Diversity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has exhibited efficacy in resolving the Local Path Planning (LPP) problem. However, such application in the real world is immensely limited due to the deficient training efficiency and generalization capability of DRL. To alleviate these two issues, a solution named Color is proposed, which consists of an Actor-Sharer-Learner (ASL) training framework and a mobile robot-oriented simulator Sparrow. Specifically, the ASL intends to improve the training efficiency of DRL algorithms. It employs a Vectorized Data Collection (VDC) mode to expedite data acquisition, decouples the data collection from model optimization by multithreading, and partially connects the two procedures by harnessing a Time Feedback Mechanism (TFM) to evade data underuse or overuse. Meanwhile, the Sparrow simulator utilizes a 2D grid-based world, simplified kinematics, and conversion-free data flow to achieve a lightweight design. The lightness facilitates vectorized diversity, allowing diversified simulation setups across extensive copies of the vectorized environments, resulting in a notable enhancement in the generalization capability of the DRL algorithm being trained. Comprehensive experiments, comprising 57 DRL benchmark environments, 32 simulated and 36 real-world LPP scenarios, have been conducted to corroborate the superiority of our method in terms of efficiency and generalization.

      <title>Calib3D: Calibrating Model Preferences for Reliable 3D Scene Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safety-critical 3D scene understanding tasks necessitate not only accurate but also confident predictions from 3D perception models. This study introduces Calib3D, a pioneering effort to benchmark and scrutinize the reliability of 3D scene understanding models from an uncertainty estimation viewpoint. We comprehensively evaluate 28 state-of-the-art models across 10 diverse 3D datasets, uncovering insightful phenomena that cope with both the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in 3D scene understanding. We discover that despite achieving impressive levels of accuracy, existing models frequently fail to provide reliable uncertainty estimates -- a pitfall that critically undermines their applicability in safety-sensitive contexts. Through extensive analysis of key factors such as network capacity, LiDAR representations, rasterization resolutions, and 3D data augmentation techniques, we correlate these aspects directly with the model calibration efficacy. Furthermore, we introduce DeptS, a novel depth-aware scaling approach aimed at enhancing 3D model calibration. Extensive experiments across a wide range of configurations validate the superiority of our method. We hope this work could serve as a cornerstone for fostering reliable 3D scene understanding. Code and benchmark toolkit are publicly available.</description>

      <title>PDP: Physics-Based Character Animation via Diffusion Policy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating diverse and realistic human motion that can physically interact with an environment remains a challenging research area in character animation. Meanwhile, diffusion-based methods, as proposed by the robotics community, have demonstrated the ability to capture highly diverse and multi-modal skills. However, naively training a diffusion policy often results in unstable motions for high-frequency, under-actuated control tasks like bipedal locomotion due to rapidly accumulating compounding errors, pushing the agent away from optimal training trajectories. The key idea lies in using RL policies not just for providing optimal trajectories but for providing corrective actions in sub-optimal states, giving the policy a chance to correct for errors caused by environmental stimulus, model errors, or numerical errors in simulation. Our method, Physics-Based Character Animation via Diffusion Policy (PDP), combines reinforcement learning (RL) and behavior cloning (BC) to create a robust diffusion policy for physics-based character animation. We demonstrate PDP on perturbation recovery, universal motion tracking, and physics-based text-to-motion synthesis.</description>

      <title>RANSAC Back to SOTA: A Two-stage Consensus Filtering for Real-time 3D Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correspondence-based point cloud registration (PCR) plays a key role in robotics and computer vision. However, challenges like sensor noises, object occlusions, and descriptor limitations inevitably result in numerous outliers. RANSAC family is the most popular outlier removal solution. However, the requisite iterations escalate exponentially with the outlier ratio, rendering it far inferior to existing methods (SC2PCR [1], MAC [2], etc.) in terms of accuracy or speed. Thus, we propose a two-stage consensus filtering (TCF) that elevates RANSAC to state-of-the-art (SOTA) speed and accuracy. Firstly, one-point RANSAC obtains a consensus set based on length consistency. Subsequently, two-point RANSAC refines the set via angle consistency. Then, three-point RANSAC computes a coarse pose and removes outliers based on transformed correspondence's distances. Drawing on optimizations from one-point and two-point RANSAC, three-point RANSAC requires only a few iterations. Eventually, an iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) is applied to yield the optimal pose. Experiments on the large-scale KITTI and ETH datasets demonstrate our method achieves up to three-orders-of-magnitude speedup compared to MAC while maintaining registration accuracy and recall. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShiPC-AI/TCF.</description>

      <title>MetricGold: Leveraging Text-To-Image Latent Diffusion Models for Metric Depth Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recovering metric depth from a single image remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision, requiring both scene understanding and accurate scaling. While deep learning has advanced monocular depth estimation, current models often struggle with unfamiliar scenes and layouts, particularly in zero-shot scenarios and when predicting scale-ergodic metric depth. We present MetricGold, a novel approach that harnesses generative diffusion model's rich priors to improve metric depth estimation. Building upon recent advances in MariGold, DDVM and Depth Anything V2 respectively, our method combines latent diffusion, log-scaled metric depth representation, and synthetic data training. MetricGold achieves efficient training on a single RTX 3090 within two days using photo-realistic synthetic data from HyperSIM, VirtualKitti, and TartanAir. Our experiments demonstrate robust generalization across diverse datasets, producing sharper and higher quality metric depth estimates compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Kernel-Based Optimal Control: An Infinitesimal Generator Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for optimal control of nonlinear stochastic systems using infinitesimal generator learning within infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our learning framework leverages data samples of system dynamics and stage cost functions, with only control penalties and constraints provided. The proposed method directly learns the diffusion operator of a controlled Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation in an infinite-dimensional hypothesis space. This operator models the continuous-time evolution of the probability measure of the control system's state. We demonstrate that this approach seamlessly integrates with modern convex operator-theoretic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions, enabling a data-driven solution to the optimal control problem. Furthermore, our statistical learning framework includes nonparametric estimators for uncontrolled forward infinitesimal generators as a special case. Numerical experiments, ranging from synthetic differential equations to simulated robotic systems, showcase the advantages of our approach compared to both modern data-driven and classical nonlinear programming methods for optimal control.</description>
