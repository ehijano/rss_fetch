      <title>Non-linear equation of motion for higher curvature semiclassical gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the non-linear semiclassical equation of motion for a general diffeomorphism-invariant theory of gravity by leveraging the thermodynamic properties of closed causal horizons. Our work employs two complementary approaches. The first approach utilizes perturbative quantum gravity applied to a Rindler horizon. The result is then mapped to a stretched light cone, which can be understood as a union of Rindler planes. Here, we adopt the semiclassical physical process formulation, encapsulated by $\langle Q\rangle = T \delta S_{gen}$ where the heat-flux $\langle Q\rangle$ is related to the expectation value of stress-energy tensor $T_{ab}$ and $S_{gen}$ is the generalized entropy. The second approach introduces a "higher curvature" Raychaudhuri equation, where the vanishing of the quantum expansion \(\Theta\) pointwise as required by restricted quantum focusing establishes an equilibrium condition, \(\delta S_{\text{gen}} = 0\), at the null boundary of a causal diamond. While previous studies have only derived the linearized semiclassical equation of motion for higher curvature gravity, our work resolves this limitation by providing a fully non-linear formulation without invoking holography.</description>

      <title>Testing Local Lorentz Invariance with Laser Tracking of the LAGEOS II satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A breakdown of Lorentz Invariance is predicted by some theories as a result of quantum physics applied to gravity or for the presence of vector/tensor fields, beside the metric tensor of General Relativity, mediating the gravitational interaction. A violation of Lorentz Invariance would manifest itself, in the gravitational sector, mainly through a non-zero value of the post-Newtonian parameter $\alpha_1$, that is null in General Relativity.
  In this paper we describe a test of Local Lorentz Invariance considering the effect of a possible preferred frame, that of the cosmic microwave background, on the orbit of the LAGEOS II satellite tracked by the Satellite Laser Ranging technique. We constrain this parameter down to the level of $3\times10^{-5}$, improving a previous limit obtained through the Lunar Laser Ranging technique.

      <title>Gravitomagnetic tidal response of relativistic stars in partially screened scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In scalar-tensor theories beyond Horndeski, the Vainshtein screening mechanism is only partially effective inside astrophysical bodies. We investigate the potential to detect this partial breaking of Vainshtein screening through the tidal response of fluid bodies. Specifically, we calculate the gravitomagnetic tidal Love numbers and analyze how deviations from general relativity depend on parameters governing the breaking of Vainshtein screening in the weak-gravity regime. For fixed parameter values, the relative deviations increase with higher multipoles and larger compactness. However, we demonstrate that these parameters alone are insufficient to fully characterize the tidal response of relativistic bodies in scalar-tensor theories beyond Horndeski.</description>

      <title>Radiative properties of thin accretion disks around rotating short-hairy black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiative properties of the accretion disks around rotating short-hairy black holes are studied. The geodesic motion of massive particles in the equatorial planes of short-hairy black holes and impact of the rotation parameter $a$, short-hair parameter $Q$ and power parameter $k$ on the geodesic motion is obtained. Then, we consider thin accretion disks around the short-hairy black holes. The radiative flux densities, effective temperatures, differential and spectral luminosity of the disks are investigated for various specific parameters. The impact of parameters $a,Q,k$ on these properties is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Braneworld Neutron Stars: Constraining Brane Tension with Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the properties of neutron stars within the braneworld model, employing six distinct piece-wise polytropic equation of states. These equation of states satisfy observational constraints put by GW170817 event and pulsar observations (PSR J0740 and PSR J0030) within general relativity framework. Our primary goal is to assess whether these equation of states, in conjunction with the braneworld framework, can accommodate more massive neutron stars, as suggested by the GW190814 observation, while remaining consistent with established observational constraints. The brane tension parameter significantly affects the mass-radius and mass-tidal deformability relations, particularly for neutron stars with masses exceeding the canonical value. We establish strong constraints on the brane tension by comparing the canonical neutron star radius and tidal deformability with the results from the braneworld model, a stringent lower bound on the brane tension, $\lambda &gt; 2 \times 10^ {37} \, \text {dyne/cm} ^2 $. Our results demonstrate that the braneworld model allows for the existence of neutron stars with masses greater than those predicted by General Relativity, in agreement with the GW190814 observation, and highlight the significant role of brane tension in shaping the properties of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Black holes immersed in polytropic scalar field gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By implementing the concept of polytropic structures as a scalar field gas with a dark energy-like behavior, we obtain a static spherically symmetric black hole solution in the framework of general relativity. In this paper, we study the quasinormal modes, the greybody bound process, the shadow behaviors, and the sparsity of black holes with a surrounding polytropic scalar field gas. Using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approach, we evaluate the impact of a particular set of polytropic parameters $(\xi, A)$ with a fixed setting of the polytropic index $n$ on the oscillation frequency and damping rate of gravitational waves. The results show that the effect of the parameter $\xi$ is much less significant than that of the parameter $A$ on the gravitational waves oscillation frequency and damping rate. Furthermore, the analysis of the greybody factor bounds reveals special insight into the effect of certain parameters where the multipole moments $l$ and the polytropic index $n$ have similar effects, in contrast to the pair of polytropic parameters ($\xi,A$). On the other hand, exploring the sparsity of Hawking radiation is another task that provides a better understanding of the behaviour of the black hole solution. In this respect, the results show that the black hole behaves like blackbody radiation for a sufficiently large entropy. And for $\xi=A=0$, the relevant sparsity acts exactly like the Schwarzschild sparsity. These results provide an insight into the dynamics of black holes with a surrounding polytropic scalar field gas from the analysis of their quasinormal modes, greybody factors, shadow behaviors, energy emission rate and sparsity process. Constraints on the associated BH parameters, derived from the Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87* and Sgr A*, indicate that this black hole model stands as a compelling candidate for representing astrophysical black holes.</description>

      <title>Dynamical and Cosmological Aspects of Teleparallel and Extended Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates modified teleparallel gravity models with a scalar field and teleparallel boundary terms, focusing on their cosmological implications for late-time cosmic acceleration. Teleparallel gravity, is an alternative to General Relativity, explains gravitation through torsion. The study presents the teleparallel analog of the Horndeski theory and its dynamical system approach, analyzing the newly developed $f(T,\phi)$ gravity model with two potential functions. It examines the phase space, conditions for different cosmological epochs, and the transition from early to late-time cosmic evolution. The inclusion of boundary terms, such as the teleparallel boundary term $B$ and the Gauss-Bonnet term $T_G$, enhances gravitational interactions. The modified teleparallel gravity models, such as $f(T, B)$, $f(T, T_G)$, and $f(T, B, T_G, B_G)$, are explored in terms of their stability and cosmological scenarios, successfully describing the accelerated expansion and late-time attractors. The thesis assesses the impact of a non-canonical scalar field coupled to the boundary term $B$ on the Universe's evolution, comparing findings from Hubble data and Supernovae Ia data. Overall, the analysis suggests that modified teleparallel gravity models effectively explain early to late-time cosmic acceleration, revealing the strong dynamical foundation and offering a versatile framework for addressing challenges in cosmic evolution.</description>

      <title>Probing Spin-2 Ultralight Dark Matter with Space-based Gravitational Wave Detectors in Millihertz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-2 ultralight dark matter (ULDM) is a viable dark matter candidate and it can be constrained using gravitational wave (GW) observations. In this paper, we investigate the detectability of spin-2 ULDM by space-based GW interferometers. By considering a direct coupling between spin-2 ULDM and ordinary matter, we derive the corresponding response functions and sensitivity curves for various time-delay interferometry channels and calculate the optimal sensitivity curves for future millihertz GW detectors. Our results demonstrate that the space-based detectors can place stringent constraints on the coupling constant of spin-2 ULDM, reaching $\alpha \sim 10^{-10}$ around a mass of $m \sim 10^{-17} \rm eV$, surpassing current limits from ground-based detectors and pulsar timing arrays. Thus, the space-based GW detectors can serve as powerful tools not only for detecting GWs but also for probing fundamental properties of ultralight dark matter.</description>

      <title>Scalar Field Kantowski--Sachs Solutions in Teleparallel $F(T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate time-dependent Kantowski--Sachs spherically symmetric teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity with a scalar field source. We begin by setting the exact field equations to be solved and solve conservation laws for possible scalar field potential, $V\left(\phi\right)$, solutions. Then, we find new non-trivial teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions by using power-law and exponential ansatz for each potential case arising from conservation laws, such as linear, quadratic, or logarithmic, to name a few. We find a general formula allowing us to compute all possible new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions applicable for any scalar field potential and ansatz. Then, we apply this formula and find a large number of exact and approximate new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions for several types of cases. Some new $F(T)$ solution classes may be relevant for future cosmological applications, especially concerning dark matter, dark energy quintessence, phantom energy leading to the Big Rip event, and quintom models of physical processes.</description>

      <title>Retrograde Precession of Relativistic Orbits and the Quest for Charged Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The S-stars around the center of the milky way galaxy provide us with detailed information about the nature of the supermassive compact object Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). In this work, we derive the fully relativistic orbit equations for the case of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) and Kerr-Newman spacetimes. We solve these orbit equations numerically to analyze the periastron shift of relativistic orbits. We show that retrograde precession (or negative precession) of timelike bound orbits is possible in the case of naked singularity arising from these spacetimes. We have then compared our results with the non-charged Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes. This theoretical analysis of relativistic orbits would be helpful in either confirming or ruling out such charged black holes and naked singularities through the future trajectories of S-stars and will also help us constrain the geometry of Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>Exploring the universal $\bar{\mathcal{I}}-\mathcal{C}$ relations for relativistic stars in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of neutron stars within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity by incorporating rotational effects through a slowly rotating metric, extending previous work. We derive the modified TOV equations and calculate the angular velocity profiles and moments of inertia for linear, quadratic, logarithmic, and exponential $f(Q)$ models. Our results show that deviations in the moment of inertia are more pronounced than those in the maximum mass, providing a strong constraint for alternative gravity theories. We also find a universal relation between the dimensionless moment of inertia and compactness, which shows distinct deviations from GR in $f(Q)$ models. Additionally, we analyze hybrid and quark star EoS, demonstrating consistency with the behavior observed in the calculation of the $\bar{I}-C$ relation for PSR J0737-3039A, which could be explored further and is interesting for future studies. Our findings suggest that $f(Q)$ gravity offers the possibility of being tested in the strong-field regime by examining the properties of compact objects and constraining the $f(Q)$ parameters through universal relations, such as the $I-C$ relation, in potential future observations.</description>

      <title>Third-order spectrum of gravitational waves sourced by an excited scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate for the first time the third-order spectrum of gravitational waves sourced by the amplified scalar field perturbations during inflation using the in-in formalism, and discuss the conditions for the third-order spectrum to be smaller than the second-order one. Assuming an exponential growth of the sub-horizon modes of the scalar field perturbations, we find that the third-order spectrum increases faster than the second-order one as the amplification of the field perturbations increases, and thus the third-order spectrum dominates for detectable gravitational waves, which indicates that the perturbation theory breakdowns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact plane gravitational radiation fields are presented within the framework of general relativity and their properties are described. The physics of nonlinear elliptically polarized plane gravitational waves is developed in close analogy with electromagnetic waves. The motion of free test particles in the dynamic gravitational fields of elliptically polarized plane waves is investigated. In particular, we demonstrate the cosmic jet property of these spacetimes, namely, most timelike geodesics tend to line up in the direction of wave propagation and produce a cosmic jet whose speed asymptotically approaches the speed of light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for relating the transition rate of an accelerated Unruh-deWitt detector to the rate of the same detector when stationary in Minkowski space. Furthermore, we show that when using the detector as a model for decay, its transition rate can be related directly to the decay rate obtained from QFT. Combined this provides a straightforward method for calculating the decay rate of accelerated particles to first order in the coupling constants.</description>

      <title>Robust and fast parameter estimation for gravitational waves from binary neutron star merger remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a robust and efficient methodology for parameter estimation of gravitational waves generated during the post-merger phase of binary neutron star mergers. Our approach leverages an analytic waveform model combined with empirical relations to predict prior ranges for the post-merger frequencies based on measurements of the chirp mass and effective tidal deformability in the inspiral phase. This enables robust inference of the main features of the post-merger spectrum, avoiding possible multi-modality induced by wide priors. Using waveforms derived from numerical relativity, we systematically validate our model across a broad spectrum of neutron star equations of state and mass configurations, demonstrating high fitting factors. Our method can be applied in future detections of gravitational waves from the post-merger phase with third-generation gravitational wave observatories. Furthermore, by integrating the Preconditioned Monte Carlo sampling method within the pocoMC framework, we achieve substantial computational acceleration compared to conventional Bayesian techniques.</description>

      <title>A Realistic Projection for Constraining Neutron Star Equation of State with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Detector Network in the A+ Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network in the upcoming A+ era with upgrades of both Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo will enable more frequent and precise observations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, improving constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EOS). In this study, we applied reduced order quadrature techniques for full parameter estimation of 3,000 simulated gravitational wave signals from BNS mergers at A+ sensitivity following three EOS models: HQC18, SLY230A, and MPA1. We found that tidal deformability tends to be overestimated at higher mass and underestimated at lower mass. We postprocessed the parameter estimation results to present our EOS recovery accuracies, identify biases within EOS constraints and their causes, and quantify the needed corrections.</description>

      <title>Sky localization of gravitational waves from eccentric binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital eccentricity in a compact binary inspiral is yet to be observed. We demonstrate that the orbital eccentricity in compact binary mergers can be used to improve their sky localization using gravitational wave observations. Existing algorithms that conduct the localizations are not optimized for eccentric sources. We use a semi-Bayesian technique to carry out localizations of simulated sources recovered using a matched-filter search. Through these simulations, we find that if a non-negligible eccentricity is obtained during the detection, an eccentricity-optimized algorithm can significantly improve the localization areas compared to the existing methods. The potential impact on the early-warning localization is investigated. We lay out the foundation for an eccentric early-warning system using the matched-filter search. We find cases of striking improvements while accounting for eccentricity toward potential eccentric neutron star binaries in the forthcoming observing scenarios of ground-based detectors. Improved localizations can be useful in effectually utilizing the capabilities of the follow-up facilities.</description>

      <title>Black Holes Rule Out Heavy Tachyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present direct observational constraints on tachyons; particles with group velocity greater than $c$ in vacuum in a Lorentz invariant theory. Since tachyons may have no direct couplings to Standard Model particles, the most robust and model independent constraints come from gravitational effects, especially black holes. We compute the Hawking radiation of tachyons from black holes, finding it to be significantly enhanced in the presence of heavy tachyons. For a black hole of mass $M$ and tachyons of mass $m$ with $g$ degrees of freedom, the black hole lifetime is found to be $t_{bh} \approx 192 \pi \hbar M/(g c^2 m^2)$ (or doubled for fermions). This implies that the observation of black holes of a few solar masses, with lifetime of several billion years, rules out tachyons of mass $m &gt; 3 \times 10^9$ GeV. This means there cannot exist any tachyons associated with unification scales or quantum gravity. So while there already exists theoretical reasons to be skeptical of tachyons, our work provides a complementary direct observational constraint.</description>

      <title>Initial data for a black string and a Kaluza-Klein bubble: Space-dependent compactification radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the first step to explore the nonlinear dynamics of an extra dimension in the Kaluza-Klein (KK) spacetime with black objects through numerical relativity, we generate time-symmetric initial data of a black string and/or a KK bubble with space-dependent compactification radius. The initial data developed in this paper are classified into three types. First, we present analytic initial data with SO(3) symmetry whose three-dimensional section is spherically symmetric. These initial data include a black string without a KK bubble, a black string trapping a KK bubble, and a naked KK bubble. Second, we present analytic initial data for multiple black strings with varying compactification radius, which is a natural generalization of the Brill-Lindquist initial data for four-dimensional general relativity. Finally, we develop a numerical method for generating the initial data with a black string and a KK bubble located at different positions, which would be useful in simulating what happens when an expanding KK bubble meets black objects in dynamical context.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave signatures of mirror (a)symmetry in binary black hole mergers: measurability and correlation to gravitational-wave recoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precessing binary black-hole mergers can produce a net flux of circularly-polarized gravitational waves. This imbalance between left- and right-handed circularly polarized waves, quantified via the Stokes pseudo-scalar $V_{\rm GW}$, originated from mirror asymmetries in the binary. We scan the parameter space of black-hole mergers to investigate correlations between $V_{\rm GW}$ and chiral magnitudes constructed out of the intrinsic parameters of the binary. To this end, we use both numerical-relativity simulations for (quasi-circular) and eccentric precessing mergers from both the SXS and RIT catalogues, as well as the state-of-the-art surrogate model for quasi-circular precessing mergers NRSur7dq4. We find that, despite being computed by manifestly different formulas, $V_{\rm GW}$ is linearly correlated to the helicity of the final black hole, defined as the projection of its recoil velocity onto its spin. Next, we test our ability to perform accurate measurements of $V_{\rm GW}$ in gravitational-wave observations through the injection and recovery of numerically simulated signals. We show that $V_{\rm GW}$ can be estimated unbiasedly using the surrogate waveform model NRSur7dq4 even for signal-to-noise ratios of nearly 50, way beyond current gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Exact path integrals on half-line in quantum cosmology with a fluid clock and aspects of operator ordering ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform $\textit{exact}$ half-line path integral quantization of flat, homogeneous cosmological models containing a perfect fluid acting as an internal clock, in a $D+1$ dimensional minisuperspace setup. We also discuss certain classes of operator ordering ambiguity inherent in such quantization procedures and argue that a particular ordering prescription in the quantum theory can preserve two symmetries, namely arbitrary lapse rescalings and general covariance, which are already present at the classical level. As a result of this imposition, a large class of quantum Hamiltonians differing by operator ordering produces the same inner products between quantum states. This imposition of the two symmetries of the classical minisuperspace models leads to a unique prescription for writing the quantum Hamiltonian for minisuperspace dimension $D\geq 2$. Interestingly, in the case of $D=1$, the lapse rescaling symmetry is lost in the quantum theory, leading to an essentially ambiguous description of the canonical theory. We provide general proof of this in the context of both canonical quantization and path integrals. We supply concrete examples to validate our findings further.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Sgr A$^*$ and M87$^*$ shadows by using the Kerr-Taub-NUT metrics in the presence of a scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent unveiling of the images of Sgr A* and M87* has significantly advanced our understanding of gravitational physics. In this study, we derive a class of Kerr-Taub-NUT metrics in the presence of a scalar field (KTNS). Treating these metrics as models for supermassive objects, we constrain the parameters using shadow size estimates done by observations of M87* and Sgr A* from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Comparing the obtained results with M87* data, we show an upper limit on the NUT charge $n$ such that the constraint on the shadow deviation from circularity ($ \Delta C $) will be fulfilled for $ n&lt;0.5 $, and this allowed range changes with a variation in other parameters. Additionally, our findings reveal that fast-rotating KTNS metrics are better candidates for supermassive M87* than slowly rotating ones. We continue our study by estimating parameters using Keck and VLTI observations of Sgr A* and find that the constraint on the fraction deviation $ \delta $ is maintained within a certain range of the NUT charge such that the Keck bound is satisfied for $ n&lt;0.41 $. In contrast, the VLTI bound can be fulfilled for $ n&gt;0.34 $. Finally, we investigate weak gravitational lensing using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and illustrate that all model parameters increase the deflection angle, causing light rays to deviate more significantly near fast-rotating KTNS objects.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Gravitational Waves on a Geometric Condensate background of $(R + \alpha R^{2})$ Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a new paradigm for cosmology: a time dependent scalar condensate background originated from the quadratic $(R + \alpha R^2)$ Starobinski model, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $\alpha$ the coupling constant. In weak gravity limit the system decouples into a conventional graviton and a higher derivative scalar. It was shown earlier through works from our group, \cite{ssg,sg,us}, that the latter can sustain an oscillatory lowest energy configuration or a {\it{Geometric Condensate}} as it consists entirely of metric degrees of freedom. In the present work, we study Gravitational Wave propagation in this condensate background. We show that the explicit time dependent nature of the condensate can generate curvature and radiation-like contributions in the scale factor evolution in FLRW cosmology. Subsequently the condensate leaves its signature on the Gravitational Wave profile as it propagates in the condensate modified FLRW spacetime. The wave profile is calculated analytically in terms of Whittaker functions. The main novelty of the Geometric Condensate scheme is that no external (condensate) matter from outside has been considered.</description>

      <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Gravitational Wave Searches above 10 kHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first direct measurement of gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations has opened up new avenues to explore our Universe. This white paper outlines the challenges and gains expected in gravitational-wave searches at frequencies above the LIGO/Virgo band. The scarcity of possible astrophysical sources in most of this frequency range provides a unique opportunity to discover physics beyond the Standard Model operating both in the early and late Universe, and we highlight some of the most promising of these sources. We review several detector concepts that have been proposed to take up this challenge, and compare their expected sensitivity with the signal strength predicted in various models. This report is the summary of a series of workshops on the topic of high-frequency gravitational wave detection, held in 2019 (ICTP, Trieste, Italy), 2021 (online) and 2023 (CERN, Geneva, Switzerland).</description>

Abstract: Recently, Cardoso and Nat\'ario [6] constructed an exact solution of Einstein-scalar field equations that describes a scalar counterpart of the Schwarzschild-Melvin Universe. In fact, this solution belongs to a more general class of solutions described by Herdeiro in [7]. In this work we show how to further generalize these solutions in presence of rotation and various charges. More specifically, we describe the general charged rotating black holes with NUT charge and present some of their properties.</description>

      <title>Hereditary Effects and New Optical Properties of Nonlinear Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate new optical effects of nonlinear gravitational waves that arise from hereditary effects. Firstly, we show that the amplitude of continuous plane waves has a hereditary effect that grows with distance. This can make the amplitude of nonlinear gravitational waves decay more slowly with distance. This will also lead to observable nonlinear effects in future observations. Secondly, hereditary effects also imply that nonlinear perturbations are nonlocally dependent on linear ones, and this property leads to some special optical effects which allow nonlinear gravitational waves to contain more information. It is even possible to extract information on the distance and direction of the wave source as well as the polarization from the waveform of nonlinear gravitational waves.</description>

Subsequently, we enhance the charged metrics by incorporating the NUT parameter through Ehlers transformations, yielding a novel class of charged-Taub-NUT metrics that represent exact solutions to Einstein's equations. Finally, we investigate some of astrophysical aspects of the charged-Taub-NUT metrics, focusing on phenomena such as gravitational lensing and quasi-normal modes (QNMs).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trace-free Einstein gravity is a prominent alternative to general relativity, which has two versions: one in which the energy-momentum conservation is assumed a priori and another in which it is not. In the first version, the cosmological constant arises as an integration constant. We report two diffeomorphism-invariant actions for trace-free Einstein gravity in which the energy-momentum conservation emerges directly from the equations of motion. The first action is based on the metric, while the second action is based on the tetrad and connection where the conservation of the energy-momentum holds if torsion vanishes. To achieve this, auxiliary fields but otherwise dynamical are introduced in the corresponding actions, which have the form a constrained bigravity theory. These results constitute a significant advance in our understanding of trace-free Einstein gravity.</description>

      <title>Trace-free Einstein gravity as two interacting constrained $BF$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theory of gravity alternative to general relativity is trace-free Einstein gravity, which has the remarkable property that the cosmological constant emerges as an integration constant. In this paper, we report two fully diffeomorphism-invariant actions for trace-free Einstein gravity. They describe the theory as two $BF$ theories supplemented with some constraints. The first action comprises two copies of the constrained $BF$ theory for the Husain-Kucha\v{r} model plus an interaction term involving the fields that impose the constraints on the $B$ fields. The second action employs two copies of the chiral Plebanski action for general relativity plus an additional constraint. Both actions use complex variables, and naturally include one of the reality conditions imposed in the Plebanski formulation of general relativity. The new actions have the advantage of not involving any nondynamical fields or unimodular condition, and their only gravitational sector is trace-free Einstein gravity.</description>

      <title>Modified gravitational wave propagations in linearized gravity with Lorentz and diffeomorphism violations and their gravitational wave constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard model extension (SME) is an effective field theory framework that can be used to study the possible violations of Lorentz symmetry and diffeomorphism invariance in the gravitational interaction. In this paper, we explore both the Lorentz- and diffeomorphism-violating effects on the propagations of gravitational waves in the SME's linearized gravity. It is shown that the violations of Lorentz symmetry and diffeomorphism invariance modify the conventional linear dispersion relation of gravitational waves, leading to anisotropy, birefringence, and dispersion effects in the propagation of gravitational waves. With these modified dispersion relations, we then calculate the dephasing effects due to the Lorentz and diffeomorphism violations in the waveforms of gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of compact binaries. With the distorted waveforms, we perform full Bayesian inference with the help of the open source software \texttt{BILBY} on the gravitational wave events of the compact binary mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalogs GWTC-3. We consider the effects from the operators with the lowest mass dimension $d=2$ and $d=3$ due to the Lorentz and diffeomorphism violations in the linearized gravity. No signature of Lorentz and diffeomorphism violations arsing from the SME's linearized gravity are found for most GW events, which allows us to give a $90\%$ confidence interval for each Lorentz- and diffeomorphism-violating coefficient.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Star Parameters Through $f$-Mode Gravitational Wave Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical models of self-interacting dark matter offer a promising solution to several unresolved issues within the collisionless cold dark matter framework. For asymmetric dark matter, these self-interactions may encourage gravitational collapse, potentially leading to the creation of compact objects primarily composed of dark matter. By considering both fermionic and bosonic equations of state, we analyze the equilibrium structure of non-rotating dark stars, examining their bulk properties and comparing them with baryonic neutron stars. We show that the frequency and damping rate of $f$-mode oscillations of dark compact stars can be expressed in terms of universal functions of stellar mass, radius and moment of inertia. Finally, by employing the universality in the $f$-mode, we propose a scheme to infer accurate values of the physical parameters of dark compact stars from their $f$-mode gravitational wave signal.</description>

      <title>The role of finite value of strange quark mass $(m_{s}\neq0)$ and baryon number density $(n)$ on the stability and maximum mass of strange stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study describes the impact of non-zero value of strange quark mass $(m_{s})$ and number density of baryons $(n)$ on the structure, stability and maximum mass of strange stars. We derive an exact relativistic solution of the Einstein field equation using the Tolman-IV metric potential and modified MIT bag model EoS, $p_{r}=\frac{1}{3}(\rho-4B')$, where $B'$ is a function of bag constant $B$, $m_{s}$ and baryon number density $(n)$. Following CERN's findings, transition of phase from hadronic matter to Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) may occur at high densities in presence of favourable conditions. The standard MIT bag model, with a constant $B$, fails to explain such transition properly. Introducing a finite $m_{s}$ and Wood-Saxon parametrisation for $B$, dependent on baryon number density $(n)$, provides a more realistic EoS to address such phase transition. Both $m_{s}$ and $n$ constrain the EoS, making it softer as $m_{s}$ increases. Solutions to the TOV equations reveal that for massless strange quarks, maximum mass is 2.01 $M_{\odot}$ and corresponding radius is 10.96 Km when $n=0.66~fm^{-3}$. These values decrease to 1.99 $M_{\odot}$ and 1.96 $M_{\odot}$, with corresponding radii of 10.88 Km and 10.69 Km for $m_{s}=50$ and $100~MeV$ respectively having same $n$ value. It is interesting to note that a corelation exists between $n$ and $m_{s}$. The hadronic to quark matter transition occurs at higher values of $n$, when $m_{s}$ increases such as $n\geq0.484,~0.489$ and $0.51~fm^{-3}$ for $m_{s}=50$ and $100~MeV$ respectively. Beyond these values, the energy per baryon $(\mathcal{E_{B}})$ drops below $930.4~MeV$, indicating a complete transition to quark matter. For physical analysis, we have considered $n~(=0.578~fm^{-3})$ which lies in the stable region with $B(n)=70~MeV/fm^{3}$. The model provides a viable description of strange stars, satisfying all necessary physical requirements.</description>

      <title>Black holes surrounded by dark matter spike: spacetime metrics and gravitational wave ringdown waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black holes at the centers of galaxies may be surrounded by dark matter spike, which could leave detectable imprints on the gravitational wave signals they emit. In this work, combining the mass model of M87 and the black hole solutions derived from the TOV equations, we focus on the gravitational wave ringdown waveforms of the black holes under the axial gravitational perturbation using the continued fraction method, that is quasinormal modes, and compare them with the Schwarzschild black hole. Furthermore, the impact of the different dark matter parameters on the quasinormal frequencies of the black holes was also investigated. In particular, we found that the impact of dark matter spike on the quasinormal modes of the black holes can reach up to the order of $10^{-4}$. These results may provide some help in further exploring the impact of dark matter spike on the black holes and their related gravitational wave phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work examines whether evolving wormhole solution is possible or not in $f(R,T)$ modified gravity theory. In the background of inhomogeneous FLRW type wormhole configuration the field equations are investigated for different choices of scale factors and shape functions. For the power law and exponential choice of the scale factor from cosmological context and decoupled power law of $f(R,T)$ in each variable, wormhole configuration has been examined for two viable choices of shape function. Energy conditions are examined graphically for a range of values of the parameters involved. Finally, the possibility of emergent scenario at early cosmic evolution has been examined.</description>

      <title>Mukkamala-Pere\~niguez master function for even-parity perturbations of the Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mukkamala and Pere\~niguez recently discovered a new master function for even-parity metric perturbations of the Schwarzschild spacetime. Remarkably, this function satisfies the Regge-Wheeler equation (instead of the Zerilli equation), which was previously understood to govern the odd-parity sector of the perturbation only. In this paper I follow up on their work. First, I identify a source term for their Regge-Wheeler equation, constructed from the perturbing energy-momentum tensor. Second, I relate the new master function to the radiation fields at future null infinity and the event horizon. Third, I reconstruct the metric perturbation from the new master function, in the Regge-Wheeler gauge. The main conclusion of this work is that the greater simplicity of the Regge-Wheeler equation (relative to the Zerilli equation) is offset by a greater complexity of obtaining the radiation fields and reconstructing the metric.</description>

      <title>Realization of tilted Dirac-like microwave cone in superconducting circuit lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dirac-like band crossings are paradigms in condensed matter systems to emulate high-energy physics phenomena. They are associated with two aspects: gap and tilting. The ability to design sign-changing gap gives rise to band topology, whereas the tilting of band crossings which is a gateway for large gravity-like effects remains uncharted. In this work, we introduce an experimental platform to realize tilted Dirac-like microwave cone in large-scale superconducting circuit lattices. The direction and magnitude of the tilt can be controlled by engineering the axially preferred second neighbor coupling. We demonstrate three lattices with 731-site LC resonator featuring tilt values of up to 59% of relative difference in the opposite-direction group velocities. This is obtained by reconstructing the density of states (DOS) of measured microwave resonance frequencies. Harnessing the tilt of Dirac-like band crossings lays the foundation for weaving the fabric of an emergent solid-state spacetime.</description>

      <title>Dressed Subsystems in Classical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of consistently defining subsystems in gravitational theories. It is argued that a subsystem is a spacetime subregion in which the observables form a closed Poisson algebra. In a generally covariant theory, the location of the subregion must be determined in relation to other degrees of freedom. It is proposed that these degrees of freedom should live within the region, so that an observer can determine its edge by only measuring fields inside of it. This turns out to be equivalent to the property that observables in the subregion generate field-dependent gauge transformations on the causal complement. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that this is \textit{exactly} what is necessary for the observables to form a Poisson algebra and thus to constitute a consistent subsystem. Observables in spacelike separated "dressed subsystems" are shown to commute. Several examples are given in the context of General Relativity. Along the way, new perspectives on the covariant phase space formalism are introduced that clarify well-known issues, such as the factorization of subregions in gauge theories and the unambiguous definition of Noether charges associated with one-sided boosts. Finally, prospects for extending these results to a perturbative quantum setting are discussed.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Reliability in Machine Learning for Gravitational Wave Parameter Estimation with Attention-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a technique to enhance the reliability of gravitational wave parameter estimation results produced by machine learning. We develop two independent machine learning models based on the Vision Transformer to estimate effective spin and chirp mass from spectrograms of gravitational wave signals from binary black hole mergers. To enhance the reliability of these models, we utilize attention maps to visualize the areas our models focus on when making predictions. This approach enables demonstrating that both models perform parameter estimation based on physically meaningful information. Furthermore, by leveraging these attention maps, we demonstrate a method to quantify the impact of glitches on parameter estimation. We show that as the models focus more on glitches, the parameter estimation results become more strongly biased. This suggests that attention maps could potentially be used to distinguish between cases where the results produced by the machine learning model are reliable and cases where they are not.</description>

      <title>Cosmological search for sterile neutrinos after DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of whether the massive sterile neutrinos exist remains a crucial unresolved issue in both particle physics and cosmology. We explore the cosmological constraints on the massive sterile neutrinos using the latest observational data, including the baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI, the cosmic microwave background data from Planck satellite and ACT, and the 5-year Type Ia supernova data and the 3-year weak-lensing data from DES. We search for the massive sterile neutrinos within the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM models. Our analysis shows that when considering massive sterile neutrinos within the $w_0w_a\rm CDM$ model, the combined datasets allow us to infer a non-zero sterile neutrino mass at approximately $2\sigma$ confidence level. Specifically, in the $w_0w_a$CDM+Sterile model, the effective mass of sterile neutrinos and the effective number of relativistic species are constrained to be $m_{\nu,\ \mathrm{sterile}}^{\mathrm{eff}} = 0.50^{+0.33}_{-0.27} \, \mathrm{eV}$ and $N_\mathrm{eff} = 3.076^{+0.011}_{-0.017}$, respectively. However, the $\Lambda$CDM+Sterile and $w$CDM+Sterile models could not provide evidence supporting the existence of massive sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Super-critical primordial black hole formation via delayed first-order electroweak phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The delay of the first-order electroweak phase transitions (EWPT) may lead to the emergence of baby universes inside wormhole structures due to the large vacuum energy density in false vacuum domains. Observers outside the false vacuum domains observe them as primordial black holes (PBHs), categorized as super-critical PBHs. We specifically investigate the dynamics of PBH formation due to delayed first-order EWPTs by solving the equations of bubble wall dynamics. We numerically confirm that such super-critical PBHs can be formed by the delayed first-order EWPT assuming spherically symmetric false vacuum domains with the thin-wall approximation for its boundary. Our numerical results show that a PBH formation criterion utilizing characteristic timescales is more appropriate than the conventional criterion based on density fluctuations. Employing our numerical results, we update the parameter regions of new physics models which can be explored by current and future constraints on the PBH abundance.</description>

Although such descriptions or variables are known as "ontological" or "hidden", they are not hidden at all, but are dual classical states (in the sense of the general classical-quantum duality of Nature). The application of the Minimal Group Representation immediately classicalizes the system, Mp(2) emerging as the group of the classical-quantum duality symmetry. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Not Quite Killing It: Black Hole Evaporation, Global Energy, and De-Idealization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A family of arguments for black hole evaporation relies on conservation laws, defined through symmetries represented by Killing vector fields which exist globally or asymptotically. However, these symmetries often rely on the idealizations of stationarity and asymptotic flatness, respectively. In non-stationary or non-asymptotically-flat spacetimes where realistic black holes evaporate, the requisite Killing fields typically do not exist. Can we 'de-idealize' these idealizations, and subsequently the associated arguments for black hole evaporation? Here, I critically examine the strategy of using 'approximately Killing' fields to de-idealize black hole spacetimes and approximately extend conservation laws to non-idealized cases. I argue that this approach encounters significant challenges, undermining the use of these idealizations to justify the evaporation of realistic -- rather than idealized -- black holes, and raising questions about the justified use of such idealizations.</description>

      <title>Higher-order effects in the dynamics of hierarchical triple systems. III. Astrophysical implications of second-order and dotriacontapole terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the long-term evolution of selected hierarchical triple systems in Newtonian gravity. We employ analytic equations derived in Paper II for the evolution of orbit-averaged orbital elements for both inner and outer orbits, which include two classes of contributions. One class consists of linear-order contributions, including quadrupole, octupole, hexadecapole and dotriacontapole orders, the latter scaling as $\epsilon^6$, where $\epsilon = a/A$, the ratio of the semimajor axes of the inner and outer orbits. The second class consists of contributions at {\em second} order in the fundamental perturbation parameter; they contribute at orders $\epsilon^{9/2}$, $\epsilon^{5}$, $\epsilon^{11/2}$ and $\epsilon^{6}$. For well studied triples such as star-planet systems perturbed by a low-mass third body (``hot Jupiters''), second-order and dotriacontapole (SOD) effects induce only small corrections. For stellar-mass binaries orbiting supermassive black holes, SOD corrections can suppress orbital flips that are generated by purely first-order effects. Planets orbiting binary star systems are susceptible to significant variations in the planetary semimajor axis, an effect that does not occur at first perturbative order. SOD effects in triple black hole systems can induce migrations of the eccentricity to significantly larger values than predicted by first-order perturbations, with implications for the gravitational-wave induced inspiral of the inner binary. We also show that in most cases, evolutions using our SOD equations are in better agreement with those from direct integration of the N-body equations of motion than those from first-order perturbations through hexadecapole order.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Primordial Curvature Perturbations via Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many early universe scenarios predict an enhancement of scalar perturbations at scales currently unconstrained by cosmological probes. These perturbations source gravitational waves (GWs) at second order in perturbation theory, leading to a scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background. The LISA detector, sensitive to mHz GWs, will be able to constrain curvature perturbations in a new window corresponding to scales $k \in [10^{10}, 10^{14}] \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, difficult to probe otherwise. In this work, we forecast the capabilities of LISA to constrain the source of SIGWs using different approaches: i) agnostic, where the spectrum of curvature perturbations is binned in frequency space; ii) template-based, modeling the curvature power spectrum based on motivated classes of models; iii) ab initio, starting from first-principles model of inflation featuring an ultra-slow roll phase. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. We also discuss the impact on the SIGW spectrum of non-standard thermal histories affecting the kernels of SIGW emission and non-Gaussianity in the statistics of the curvature perturbations. Finally, we propose simple tests to assess whether the signal is compatible with the SIGW hypothesis. The pipeline used is built into the SIGWAY code.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological gravitational waveforms for core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are a target for current generation gravitational wave detectors with an expected rate of 1-3 per century. The development of data analysis methods used for their detection relies deeply on the availability of waveform templates. However, realistic numerical simulations producing such waveforms are computationally expensive (millions of CPU hours and $10^2-10^3$~GB of memory), and only a few tens of them are available nowadays in the literature. We have developed a novel parametrized phenomenological waveform generator for CCSNe, ccphen v4, that reproduces the morphology of numerical simulation waveforms with low computational cost ($\sim 10$~ms CPU time and a few MB of memory use). For the first time, the phenomenological waveforms include polarization and the effect of several oscillation modes in the proto-neutron star. This is sufficient to describe the case of non-rotating progenitor cores, representing the vast majority of possible events. The waveforms include a stochastic component and are calibrated using numerical simulation data. The code is publicly available. Their main application is the training of neural networks used in detection pipelines, but other applications in this context are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Replica Wormholes, Modular Entropy, and Capacity of Entanglement in JT Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By employing the replica trick we study the impact of the replica parameter $n$ on the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement in the End of the World (EoW) model and the island model, respectively. For the EoW model, we present $n$-dependent evolution curves of the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement under both microcanonical and canonical ensembles. In particular, in the canonical ensemble, all quantities decrease as $n$ increases at late times. For the island model, we develop the replica geometry for finite $n$ and re-evaluate the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement in a two-sided eternal Jackiw-Teitelboim black hole coupled with a thermal bath. In the case of a single island configuration, the modular entropy and capacity of entanglement closely resemble the thermal entropy and the heat capacity, respectively, yielding results analogous to those obtained in the canonical ensemble for the EoW model. The analysis of the results from these two models strongly indicates that in geometries with a greater number of $n$ copies, more connected geometries effectively purify thermal Hawking radiation. In addition, we compare these findings with statistical mechanics and provide an interpretation for the replica parameter $n$. Finally, we generalize the island formula to accommodate the finite $n$ case under this interpretation.</description>

      <title>Tunable coherence laser interferometry: demonstrating 40dB of straylight suppression and compatibility with resonant optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major limitation of laser interferometers using continuous wave lasers are parasitic light fields, such as ghost beams, scattered or stray light, which can cause non-linear noise. This is especially relevant for laser interferometric ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Increasing their sensitivity, particularly at frequencies below 10 Hz, is threatened by the influence of parasitic photons. These can up-convert low-frequency disturbances into phase and amplitude noise inside the relevant measurement band. By artificially tuning the coherence of the lasers, using pseudo-random-noise (PRN) phase modulations, this influence of parasitic fields can be suppressed. As it relies on these fields traveling different paths, it does not sacrifice the coherence for the intentional interference. We demonstrate the feasibility of this technique experimentally, achieving noise suppression levels of 40 dB in a Michelson interferometer with an artificial coherence length below 30 cm. We probe how the suppression depends on the delay mismatch and length of the PRN sequence. We also prove that optical resonators can be operated in the presence of PRN modulation by measuring the behavior of a linear cavity with and without such a modulation. By matching the resonators round-trip length and the PRN sequence repetition length, the classic response is recovered.</description>

      <title>Modular evolutions and causality in two-dimensional conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFT) in Minkowski spacetime, we study the spacetime distance between two events along two distinct modular trajectories. When the spatial line is bipartite by a single interval, we consider both the ground state and the state at finite different temperatures for the left and right moving excitations. For the free massless Dirac field in the ground state, the bipartition of the line given by the union of two disjoint intervals is also investigated. The modular flows corresponding to connected subsystems preserve relativistic causality. Locality along the modular flows of some fields is explored by evaluating their (anti-)commutators. In particular, the bilocal nature of the modular Hamiltonian of two disjoint intervals for the massless Dirac field provide multiple trajectories leading to Dirac delta contributions in the (anti-)commutators even when the initial points belong to different intervals, thus being spacelike separated.</description>

      <title>Black holes in thermal bath live shorter: implications for primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hawking radiation from a non-extremal black hole is known to be approximately Planckian. The thermal spectrum receives multiple corrections including greybody factors and due to kinematical restrictions on the infrared and ultraviolet frequencies. We show that another significant correction to the spectrum arises if the black hole is assumed to live in a thermal bath and the emitted radiation gets thermalised at the bath temperature. This modification reshapes the thermal spectrum, and leads to appreciable deviation from standard results including modification in the decay rate of black holes. We argue that this altered decay rate has significance for cosmology and, in a realistic setting, show that it alters the life time of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe. In particular, the very light PBHs formed right after the end of inflation decay faster which may have interesting phenomenological implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical dynamics of particles with (non-)abelian charges and spin moving on curved manifolds is established in the Poisson-Hamilton framework. Equations of motion are derived for the minimal quadratic Hamiltonian and some extensions involving spin-dependent interactions. It is shown that these equations of motion coincide with the consistency conditions for current and energy-momentum conservation. The classical equations cannot be derived from an action principle without extending the model. One way to overcome this problem is the introduction of anticommuting Grassmann co-ordinates. A systematic derivation of constants of motion based on symmetries of the background fields is presented.</description>

      <title>Boundary Curvature Scalars on Conformally Compact Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a sequence of conformally invariant scalar curvature quantities, defined along the conformal infinity of a conformally compact (CC) manifold, that measure the failure of a CC metric to have constant negative scalar curvature in the interior, i.e. its failure to solve the singular Yamabe problem. Indeed, these "CC boundary curvature scalars" compute canonical expansion coefficients for singular Yamabe metrics. Residues of their poles yield obstructions to smooth solutions to the singular Yamabe problem and thus, in particular, give an alternate derivation of generalized Willmore invariants. Moreover, in a given dimension, the critical CC boundary scalar characterizes the image of a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for the singular Yamabe problem. We give explicit formulae for the first five CC boundary curvature scalars required for a global study of four dimensional singular Yamabe metrics, as well as asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Signatures of electromagnetic and sound radiation produced by gravitational waves in core-collapse supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:1907.08312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the scenario that gravitational waves, generated in core-collapse of a pre-supernova star, can produce both electromagnetic radiation and sound radiation as gravitational waves propagate outward from the collapsing core. While the energy of this co-produced electromagnetic and sound radiation is orders of magnitude smaller than the initiating gravitational radiation, the power may be sufficient to re-ignite fusion outside the collapsing core. The non-equilibrium re-ignition of fusion, in roughly the same time frame as the strongest neutrino emissions, would change the configuration of the pre-supernova star and subsequently the ejecta and the evolution of the stellar expansion of the supernova remnant. Although the co-produced electromagnetic or sound radiation could not contribute directly to the supernova explosion, the associated non-equilibrium re-ignition of fusion would alter the state outside the core leaving an observable signature in the ejecta of the supernova remnant. The aim of this paper is to argue that including this hypothesized co-produced radiation in computational models of core collapse supernovae would contribute to the evolution of the stellar expansion and consequently should be observable in the supernovae remnant, providing a confirmation of the conversion processes for gravitational radiation to electromagnetic and sound radiation.</description>

      <title>Evolution of primordial black holes in an adiabatic FLRW universe with gravitational particle creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09794v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of primordial black holes (PBHs) in an adiabatic FLRW universe with dissipation due to bulk viscosity which is considered to be in the form of gravitational particle creation. Assuming that the process of evaporation is quite suppressed during the radiation era, we obtain an analytic solution for the evolution of PBH mass by accretion during this era, subject to an initial condition. We also obtain an upper bound on the accretion efficiency $\epsilon$ for $a \sim a_r$, where $a_r$ is the point of transition from the early de Sitter era to the radiation era. Furthermore, we obtain numerical solutions for the mass of a hypothetical PBH with initial mass 100 g assumed to be formed at an epoch when the value of the Hubble parameter was, say, 1 km/s/Mpc. We consider three values of the accretion efficiency, $\epsilon=0.23,0.5$, and $0.89$ for our study. The analysis reveals that the mass of the PBH increases rapidly due to the accretion of radiation in the early stages of its evolution. The accretion continues but its rate decreases gradually with the evolution of the Universe. Finally, Hawking radiation comes into play and the rate of evaporation surpasses the accretion rate so that the PBH mass starts to decrease. As the Universe grows, evaporation becomes the dominant phenomenon, and the mass of the PBH decreases at a faster rate. As argued by Debnath and Paul, the evaporated mass of the PBHs might contribute towards the dark energy budget of the late Universe.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Deformed Heisenberg Algebra from Discrete Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Even though the deformation of Heisenberg algebra by a minimal length has become a main tool in quantum gravity phenomenology, it has never been rigorously obtained and is derived using heuristic reasoning. Thus, for the first time, we go beyond the heuristic derivation of deformed Heisenberg algebra, and explicitly derive it using a model of discrete spacetime, which will be motivated by quantum gravity. We first investigate the effects of leading order Planckian lattice corrections, and demonstrate that they exactly match those suggested by the heuristic arguments used in quantum gravity phenomenology. However, as will rigorously obtain deformations from higher order Planckian lattice corrections. Unlike the leading order corrections, these higher order corrections will be model dependent. We will choose a specific model, which will break the rotational symmetry, as it is important to produce such effects as CMB anisotropies are thought to be related quantum gravitational effects. We will propose based on the mathematical similarity of the Planckian lattice used here with graphene, that graphene can be used as an analogue system to study quantum gravity. Finally, we investigate the deformation of the covariant form of the Heisenberg algebra using a four dimensional Euclidean lattice.</description>

      <title>Machian Gravity: A mathematical formulation for Mach's Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The general theory of relativity (GR) was proposed with an aim of incorporating Mach's principle mathematically. Despite early hopes, it became evident that GR did not follow Mach's principle. Over time, multiple researchers attempted to develop gravity theories aligned with Machian idea. Although these theories successfully explained various aspects of Mach's principle, each of these theories possessed its own strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we discuss some of these theories and then try to combine these theories into a single framework that can fully embrace Mach's principle. This new theory, termed Machian Gravity (MG) is a metric-based theory, and can be derived from the action principle, ensuring compliance with all conservation laws.
  The theory converges to GR at solar system scales, but at larger scales, it diverges from GR and aligns with various modified gravity models proposed to explain dark sectors of the universe. We have tested our theory against multiple observational data. It explains the galactic rotation curve without requiring additional dark matter (DM). The theory also resolves the discrepancy between dynamic mass and photometric mass in galaxy clusters without resorting to DM, but it introduces two additional parameters. It can also explain the expansion history of the universe without requiring dark components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity has long been elusive. Only recently have empirical predictions of various possible theories of quantum gravity been put to test, where a clear signal of quantum properties of gravity is still missing. The dawn of multi-messenger high-energy astrophysics has been tremendously beneficial, as it allows us to study particles with much higher energies and travelling much longer distances than possible in terrestrial experiments, but more progress is needed on several fronts.
  A thorough appraisal of current strategies and experimental frameworks, regarding quantum gravity phenomenology, is provided here. Our aim is twofold: a description of tentative multimessenger explorations, plus a focus on future detection experiments.
  As the outlook of the network of researchers that formed through the COST Action CA18108 ``Quantum gravity phenomenology in the multi-messenger approach (QG-MM)'', in this work we give an overview of the desiderata that future theoretical frameworks, observational facilities, and data-sharing policies should satisfy in order to advance the cause of quantum gravity phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes and Universality of the Penrose Limit of Black Hole Photon Rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the physics of photon rings in a wide range of axisymmetric black holes admitting a separable Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the geodesics. Utilizing the Killing-Yano tensor, we derive the Penrose limit of the black holes, which describes the physics near the photon ring. The obtained plane wave geometry is directly linked to the frequency matrix of the massless wave equation, as well as the instabilities and Lyapunov exponents of the null geodesics. Consequently, the Lyapunov exponents and frequencies of the photon geodesics, along with the quasinormal modes, can be all extracted from a Hamiltonian in the Penrose limit plane wave metric. Additionally, we explore potential bounds on the Lyapunov exponent, the orbital and precession frequencies, in connection with the corresponding inverted harmonic oscillators and we discuss the possibility of photon rings serving as holographic horizons in a holographic duality framework for astrophysical black holes.

      <title>Quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes are crucial in understanding the ringdown phase after a merger. While for Kerr black holes these modes have been known for a long time, their calculation has remained a challenge in alternative theories of gravity. We obtain the spectrum of quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton theory without resorting to perturbation theory in the coupling constant. Our approach is based on a spectral decomposition of the linear perturbations of the metric and the scalar field. The quasinormal modes agree excellently with the perturbatively known slow rotation and weak coupling limits. For large coupling, though, the spectrum changes significantly.</description>

      <title>Positive Mass in General Relativity Without Energy Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A long-standing problem in physics is why observed masses are always positive. While energy conditions in quantum field theory can partly answer this problem, in this paper we find evidence that classical general relativity abhors negative masses, without the need for quantum theory or energy conditions. This is done by considering many different models of negative-mass "stars" and showing they are dynamically unstable. A fortiori, we show that any barotropic negative-mass star must be dynamically unstable.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Dipole Moment in Braneworld Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational effects on the relativistic Dirac theory of a system such as a Hydrogen atom in the braneworld scenario. A gravitational dipole moment like contribution, arises in the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian of the system through an exact Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. This term violates the equivalence principle for the weak interaction that is restored in the average over the spins. Furthermore, it feels the effects of the extra dimensions, so that in a Universe with two additional spatial dimensions its energy contribution is amplified by an order of $\sim 10^{16}\ \text{eV}$ concerning to the energy of this term for ordinary space. The compactification radius for a Universe with two extra dimensions is within the experimental limits, where deviations from the inverse square law are being tested. This suggests that the energy value for the gravitational dipole term in this scenario may lead us to search for traces of extra dimensions in atomic spectroscopy, as well as experimental constraints for these dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Stability of Anisotropic Compact Stars Influenced by Dark Matter under Teleparallel Gravity: An Extended Gravitational Deformation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our investigation, we pioneer the development of geometrically deformed strange stars within the framework of teleparallel gravity theory through gravitational decoupling via the complete geometric deformation (CGD) technique. The significant finding is the precise solution for deformed strange star (SS) models achieved through the vanishing complexity factor scenario. Further, we introduce the concept of space-time deformation caused by dark matter (DM) content in DM haloes, leading to perturbations in the metric potentials $g_{tt}$ and $g_{rr}$ components. Mathematically, this DM-induced deformation is achieved through the CGD method, where the decoupling parameter $\alpha$ governs the extent of DM influence. To validate our findings, we compare our model predictions with observational constraints, including GW190814 (with a mass range of $2.5-2.67 M_{\odot}$) and neutron stars (NSTRs) such as EXO 1785-248 [mass=$1.3_{-0.2}^{+0.2}~M_{\odot}$], 4U 1608-52 [mass=$1.74_{-0.14}^{+0.14}~M_{\odot}$], and PSR J0952-0607 [mass=$2.35_{-0.17}^{+0.17}~M_{\odot}$].
  Our investigation delves into the stability of the model by considering causality conditions, Herrera's Cracking Method, the adiabatic index, and the Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov criterion. We demonstrate that the developed model mimics a wide range of recently observed pulsars. To emphasize its compatibility, we highlight the predicted mass and radius in tabular form by varying both the parameters $\alpha$ and $\zeta_1$. Notably, our findings are consistent with the observation of gravitational waves from the first binary merger event. Furthermore, we compare our results with those obtained for a slow-rotating configuration. In addition to this, we discuss the moment of inertia using the Bejger-Haensel approach in this formulation.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Moment Quantum Fluctuations and Quantum Equivalence Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The second-order moment quantum fluctuations or uncertainties are mass-dependent, and the incompatibility between the quantum uncertainty principle and the equivalence principle is at the second-order moment (variation) level, but not the first-order moment (mean) level. To reconcile the two fundamental principles, we find that the second-order moment quantum fluctuations are actually distinguished into two parts: a dynamic part and a geometric part. The dynamic part is indeed mass-dependent and governed by a non-zero Hamiltonian in a non-general-covariant inertial frame, and the geometric part is mass-independent and comes from coarse-graining and/or geometric effects. The dynamic part is coordinate dependent, it can be canceled away by a coordinate transformation, and hence it plays no role in general covariant theories whose Hamiltonian automatically vanishes. However, the geometric part is valid for general coordinate, and it can not be eliminated by a coordinate transformation. On the contrary, the geometric part of second-order moment fluctuation of quantum spacetime leads to coordinate transformation anomaly, which induces an effective Einstein's gravity theory. The geometric part is mass-independent and universal, so it is only this part measures the universal second-order moment quantum fluctuation of the spacetime, while the dynamic part plays no role in the general covariant description. The observation generalizes the classical equivalence principle to the quantum level. And according to the principle, a general covariant theory with only geometric part quantum fluctuation, i.e. a non-linear sigma model, is proposed as a theory of a material quantum reference frame system. The effects of the universal second-order moment quantum fluctuations in the material quantum reference system and its implications to an effective gravity theory are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A physically modelled selection function for compact binary mergers in the LIGO-Virgo O3 run and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the observation of nearly 100 compact binary coalescence (CBC) events up to the end of the Advanced gravitational-wave (GW) detectors' third observing run (O3), there remain fundamental open questions regarding their astrophysical formation mechanisms and environments. Population analysis should yield insights into these questions, but requires careful control of uncertainties and biases. GW observations have a strong selection bias: this is due first to the dependence of the signal amplitude on the source's (intrinsic and extrinsic) parameters, and second to the complicated nature of detector noise and of current detection methods. In this work, we introduce a new physically-motivated model of the sensitivity of GW searches for CBC events, aimed at enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of population reconstructions. In contrast to current methods which rely on re-weighting simulated signals (injections) via importance sampling, we model the probability of detection of binary black hole (BBH) mergers as a smooth, analytic function of source masses, orbit-aligned spins, and distance, fitted to accurately match injection results. The estimate can thus be used for population models whose signal distribution over parameter space differs significantly from the injection distribution. Our method has already been used in population studies such as reconstructing the BBH merger rate dependence on redshift.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Gravitational Wave Equations in Spherical Symmetry from Curvature Wave Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole perturbation theory on spherically symmetric backgrounds has been instrumental in establishing various aspects about the gravitational dynamics close to black holes, and continues to be an interesting avenue to confront current challenges in gravitational physics. In this paper, we present an approach to perturbation theory in spherical symmetry that addresses simultaneously some conceivably inconvenient aspects of the traditional methods. In particular, focusing on Schwarzschild's background we are able to derive a decoupled wave equation, for a single complex variable, by simply computing one component of the curvature wave equation satisfied by a complex self-dual version of the Riemann tensor. The real and imaginary parts of the variable consist only of even and odd pieces of the metric fluctuation, respectively, and both satisfy the Regge-Wheeler equation. Besides providing a systematic derivation of decoupled equations, an immediate corollary of our results is the isospectrality between even and odd sectors. We conclude by discussing potential extensions of our formalism to include matter and higher orders in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Binary Neutron Star Merger Search Pipeline Powered by Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Gravitational waves are now routinely detected from compact binary mergers, with binary neutron star mergers being of note for multi-messenger astronomy as they have been observed to produce electromagnetic counterparts. Novel search pipelines for these mergers could increase the combined search sensitivity, and could improve the ability to detect real gravitational wave signals in the presence of glitches and non-stationary detector noise. Deep learning has found success in other areas of gravitational wave data analysis, but a sensitive deep learning-based search for binary neutron star mergers has proven elusive due to their long signal length. In this work, we present a deep learning pipeline for detecting binary neutron star mergers. By training a convolutional neural network to detect binary neutron star mergers in the signal-to-noise ratio time series, we concentrate signal power into a shorter and more consistent timescale than strain-based methods, while also being able to train our network to be robust against glitches. We compare our pipeline's sensitivity to the three offline detection pipelines using injections in real gravitational wave data, and find that our pipeline has a comparable sensitivity to the current pipelines below the 1 per 2 months detection threshold. Furthermore, we find that our pipeline can increase the total number of binary neutron star detections by 12% at a false alarm rate of 1 per 2 months. The pipeline is also able to successfully detect the two binary neutron star mergers detected so far by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, GW170817 and GW190425, despite the loud glitch present in GW170817.</description>

Abstract: Oscillations of black hole spacetimes exhibit divergent behavior toward the bifurcation sphere and spatial infinity. This divergence can be understood as a consequence of the geometry in these spacetime regions. In contrast, black-hole oscillations are regular when evaluated toward the event horizon and null infinity. Hyperboloidal surfaces naturally connect these regions, providing a geometric regularization of time-harmonic oscillations called quasinormal modes (QNMs). This review traces the historical development of the hyperboloidal approach to QNMs. We discuss the physical motivation for the hyperboloidal approach and highlight current developments in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, magnetic reconnection has attracted considerable attention as a novel energy extraction mechanism, relying on the rapid reconnection of magnetic field lines within the ergosphere. We have investigated the properties of the energy extraction via magnetic reconnection in a Konoplya-Zhidenko rotating non-Kerr black hole spacetime with an extra deformation parameter. Our results show that the positive deformation parameter expands the possible region of energy extraction and improves the maximum power, maximum efficiency, and the maximum ratio of energy extraction between magnetic reconnection and the Blandford-Znajek process. This means that in the Konoplya-Zhidenko rotating non-Kerr black hole spacetime one can extract more energy via magnetic reconnection than in the Kerr black hole case. These effects of the deformation parameter may provide valuable clues for future astronomical observations of black holes and verification of gravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04392v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The condensed matter analogs are useful for consideration of the phenomena related to the quantum vacuum. This is because in condensed matter we know physics both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet limits, while in particle physics and gravity the physics at trans-Planckian scale is unknown. One of the corner stones of the connections between the non-relativistic condensed matter and the modern relativistic theories is the two-fluid hydrodynamics of superfluid helium. The dynamics and thermodynamics of the de Sitter state of the expansion of the Universe bear some features of the multi-fluid system. There are actually three components: the quantum vacuum, the gravitational component and relativistic matter. The expanding de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter component and the gravitational component. The latter behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter and represents the dark matter. In equilibrium and in the absence of the conventional matter the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is similar to the superfluid and normal components in superfluids, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. If one assumes that in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter, one obtains that both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. We also consider the other problems through the prism of condensed matter physics, including the black holes and Planck constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by different approaches to quantum gravity, one could consider that Lorentz invariance is not an exact symmetry of nature at all energy scales. Following this spirit, modified dispersion relations have been used to encapsulate quantum gravity phenomenology. In the present work, we propose a class of Lorentz invariance violating phenomenological dispersion relations, which could be different for each particle species, to study the generalized vacuum Cherenkov radiation process. We identify the kinematic regions where the process is allowed and then compute the energy loss rate due to the emission of vacuum electromagnetic and gravitational Cherenkov radiation. Furthermore, we estimate constraints for the Lorentz invariance breaking parameters of protons and gravitons taking into account the existence (or absence) of vacuum gravitational Cherenkov radiation using ultra high energy cosmic ray detections.</description>

Abstract: Using thermodynamics-gravity conjecture, we present the formal derivation of the modified Friedmann equations inspired by the Barrow entropy, $S\sim A ^{1+\delta/2}$, where $0\leq\delta\leq 1$ is the Barrow exponent and $A$ is the horizon area. We then constrain the exponent $\delta$ by using Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) observational data. In order to impose the upper bound on the Barrow exponent $\delta$, we set the observational bound on $\left| \frac{\delta T_f} {T_f }\right|$. We find out that the Barrow parameter $\delta$ should be around $ \delta \simeq 0.01$ in order not to spoil the BBN era. Next we derive the bound on the Barrow exponent $\delta$ in a different approach in which we analyze the effects of Barrow cosmology on the primordial abundances of light elements i.e. Helium $_{}^{4}\textit{He}$, Deuterium $D$ and Lithium $_{}^{7}\textit{Li}$. We observe that the deviation from standard Bekenstein-Hawking expression is small as expected. Additionally we present the relation between cosmic time $t$ and temperature $T$ in the context of modified Barrow cosmology. We confirm that the temperature of the early universe increases as the Barrow exponent $\delta$ (fractal structure of the horizon) increases, too.</description>

      <title>Cosmological solutions in teleparallel $F(T,B)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we find several teleparallel $F(T,B)$ solutions for a Robertson--Walker (TRW) cosmological spacetime. We first set and solve the $F(T,B)$-type field equations for a linear perfect fluid. Using similar techniques, we then find new $F(T,B)$ solutions for non-linear perfect fluids with a weak quadratic correction term to the linear equation of state (EoS). Finally, we solve for new classes of $F(T,B)$ solutions for a scalar field source by assuming a power-law scalar field and then an exponential scalar field in terms of the time coordinate. For flat cosmological cases ($k=0$ cases), we find new exact and approximate $F(T,B)$ solutions. For non-flat cases ($k=\pm 1$ cases), we only find new teleparallel $F(T,B)$ solutions for some specific and well-defined cosmological expansion subcases. We conclude by briefly discussing the impact of these new teleparallel solutions on cosmological processes such as dark energy (DE) quintessence and phantom energy models.</description>

      <title>The Confluent Heun functions in Black Hole Perturbation Theory: a spacetime interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work provides a spacetime interpretation of the confluent Heun functions within black hole perturbation theory (BHPT) and explores their relationship to the hyperboloidal framework. In BHPT, the confluent Heun functions are solutions to the radial Teukolsky equation, but they are traditionally studied without an explicit reference to the underlying spacetime geometry. Here, we show that the distinct behaviour of these functions near their singular points reflects the structure of key surfaces in black hole spacetimes. By interpreting homotopic transformations of the confluent Heun functions as changes in the spacetime foliation, we connect these solutions to different regions of the black hole's global structure, such as the past and future event horizons, past and future null infinity, spatial infinity, and even past and future timelike infinity. We also discuss the relationship between the confluent Heun functions and the hyperboloidal formulation of the Teukolsky equation. Although neither confluent Heun form of the radial Teukolsky equation can be interpreted as hyperboloidal slices, this approach offers new insights into wave propagation and scattering from a global black hole spacetime perspective.</description>

      <title>Interacting quark matter and $f(Q)$ gravity: A new paradigm in exploring the properties of quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics corrections and the colour superconductivity indicate that strongly interacting matter can manifest unique physical behaviours under extreme conditions. Motivated by this notion, we investigate the interior structure and properties of quark stars composed of interacting quark matter, which provides a comprehensive avenue to explore the strong interaction effects, within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity. A unified equation of state is formulated to describe various phases of quark matter, including up-down quark matter $(2SC)$, strange quark matter $(2SC+s)$, and the Colour-Flavor Locked $(CFL)$ phase. By employing a systematic reparametrisation and rescaling, the number of degrees of freedom in the equation of state is significantly reduced. Utilising the Buchdahl-I metric ansatz and a linear $f(Q)$ functional form, $f(Q)=\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1}Q$, we derive the exact solutions of the Einstein field equations in presence of the unified interacting quark matter equation of state. For the $2SC$ phase, we examine the properties of quark stars composed of up-down quark matter. For the $(2SC+s)$and $CFL$ phases, we incorporate the effects of a finite strange quark mass $(m_{s}\neq0)$. The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations are numerically solved to determine the maximum mass-radius relations for each phase. Our results indicate that the model satisfies key physical criteria, including causality, energy conditions, and stability requirements, ensuring the viability of the configurations. Furthermore, the predicted radii for certain compact star candidates align well with observational data. The study highlights that quark stars composed of interacting quark matter within the $f(Q)$ gravity framework provide a robust and physically consistent stellar model across all considered phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alexei Alexandrovich Starobinsky was one of the greatest cosmologists of all times, who made fundamental contributions to gravitational theory and cosmology based on geometrical ideas in physics, in the spirit of Einstein. One of his big achievements is the famous Starobinsky model of cosmological inflation in the early universe, proposed in 1979-1980. In this memorial paper, the Starobinsky inflation model is systematically reviewed from the modern perspective. Its deformation to include production of primordial black holes is proposed, and possible quantum corrections in the context of superstring theory and the Swampland Program are discussed. Starobinsky inflation also leads to the universal reheating mechanism for particle production after inflation.</description>

      <title>Shadow of the Scalar Hairy Black Hole with Inverted Higgs Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the imaging of a hairy black hole (HBH) in the Einstein-Klein-Gordon theory, where Einstein gravity is minimally coupled to a scalar potential $V(\phi)=-\Lambda \phi^4 + \mu \phi^2$ with $\Lambda$ and $\mu$ are constants. As a consequence, a nontrivial scalar field at the event horizon $\phi_H$ allows the HBH to evade the no-hair theorem, bifurcate from the Schwarzschild black hole by acquiring some new properties, which can affect the shadow of the HBH received by a distant observer. The framework of ray-tracing is adopted to investigate the optical appearance of the HBH, thus the trajectories of light rays around the HBH can be classified into three emissions: direct, lensed and photon ring. Employing three models of optically and geometrically thin accretion disk, we compare the differences between the Schwarzschild black hole and HBH with same horizon radius in a specific model, and find that the size of the shadow and accretion disk increases as $\phi_H$ increases, but the brightness of the rings remain nearly unaffected, this implies our HBH can potentially mimic the Schwarzschild black hole if we vary the horizon radius of the HBH. Finally, we also constraint the parameter $\Lambda$ from the observations of supermassive black holes in the galactic center of M87 and Sgr A$^{*}$, which could offer new insights for imaging of black holes and astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated LISA parameter estimation with full time domain response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct the first full Bayesian inference analysis for LISA parameter estimation incorporating the effects of subdominant harmonics and spin-precession through a full time domain response. The substantial computational demands of using time domain waveforms for LISA are significantly mitigated by implementing a novel Python version of the IMRPhenomT family of waveform models and the LISA response with GPU acceleration. This time domain response alleviates the theoretical necessity of developing specific transfer functions to approximate the LISA response in the Fourier domain for each specific type of system and allows for the use of unequal arms configurations and realistic LISA orbits. Our analysis includes a series of zero-noise injections for a Massive Black Hole Binary with aligned and precessing spins. We investigate the impact of including subdominant harmonics, compare equal and unequal arm configurations, and analyze different Time-Delay-Interferometry (TDI) configurations. We utilize full and uniform priors, with a lower frequency cutoff of 0.1mHz, and a signal duration of approximately two months, sampled every 5 seconds. The sampler is initialized based on Fisher estimates. Our results demonstrate LISA capability to measure the two spin magnitudes and the primary spin tilt angle, alongside sky localization, with percent-level precision, while component masses are determined with sub-percent accuracy.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Tomography: Unveiling Black Hole Ringdown via Gravitational Wave Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the post-merger regime of a binary black hole merger, the gravitational wave signal consists of a superposition of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of the remnant black hole. It has been observed empirically, primarily through numerical simulations and heuristic arguments, that the infalling radiation at the horizon is also composed of a superposition of QNMs. In this paper, we provide an analytic explanation for this observation in the perturbative regime. Our analysis is based on a characteristic initial value formulation where data is prescribed on the horizon (modeled as a perturbed isolated horizon), and on a transversal null-hypersurface which registers the outgoing radiation. This allows us to reformulate the traditional QNM problem in a fully 4-dimensional setting. Using a mode-decomposition, we demonstrate that the radiation modes crossing $\mathcal{H}$ are highly correlated with the outgoing modes crossing $\mathcal{I}$, and provide explicit expressions linking $\widetilde{\Psi}_0$ at the horizon with $\widetilde{\Psi}_4$ at null infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Even though one could already constrain different models in cosmology and Beyond Standard Model physics using CMB data, these models remained unconstrained at shorter wavelength scales, and knowledge of new physics at higher energy scales relied on theoretical assumptions and extrapolations to these scales. Recently, however, we have experienced the advent of gravitational-wave and multi-messenger astronomy, including the outstanding detections by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration over the past decade and the latest searches for Hellings-Downs correlations in pulsar timing data. Ongoing and future gravitational wave collaborations explore different frequency ranges of the gravitational wave spectrum. In these lecture notes, we focus on how we can probe cosmology and Beyond Standard Model physics with primordial gravitational waves. For this purpose, we review the formalism of gravitational waves in General Relativity, introduce stochastic gravitational waves, and derive the Hellings-Downs correlation for pulsar timing array searches. We comment on detection efforts and present some of the most important cosmological sources that could produce a background. Ultimately, one could compare model-dependent gravitational wave density spectra using gravitational wave data from ground-based, space-borne, and pulsar timing array searches. These lecture notes were inspired by the course "Gravitational Waves from the Early Universe" given at the 27th W.E. Heraeus "Saalburg" Summer School 2021 by Valerie Domcke.</description>

      <title>On AdS black holes in two-dimensional dilaton gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00218v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two novel analytic AdS black hole solutions in a two-dimensional dilaton gravity theory with two scalar fields non-minimally coupled to gravity. Our solutions contain two arbitrary integration constants in the blackening factor $f(r)$, allowing for an extremal configuration. Solution I reproduces a previously reported AdS black hole when one of the integration constants in $f(r)$ vanishes. For our black hole configurations, the scalar curvature is constant and negative, corresponding to the $AdS_2$ spacetime. In order to elucidate their black hole nature, we explore the causal structure of these solutions with the aid of suitable Kruskal-like coordinates and Penrose diagrams. By employing the Hamilton-Jacobi method, we construct a boundary counter-term that renders a renormalized action with a vanishing variation. We use this finite action for the partition function in the semi-classical approximation. We establish a consistent Thermodynamics, verified by the first law, for our black hole solutions, including the extremal case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of dipole cosmology framework put forward in \cite{Krishnan:2022qbv}, a beyond FLRW setting that has a preferred direction in the metric which may be associated with a cosmological tilt, a cosmic dipole. In this setup the shear and the tilt can be positive or negative given the dipole direction. We thoroughly analyze evolution of the universe in this setting, particularly focusing on the behaviour near the Big Bang (BB). We first analyze a single fluid model with a generic constant equation of state $w$. While details of the behavior near the BB depends on $w$ and the other initial conditions, we find that when the shear is negative we have a shear dominated BB singularity, whereas for a positive shear we have a much milder singularity, the whimper singularity \cite{Ellis:1974ug}, at which the tilt blows up while curvature invariants remain finite. We then consider dipole $\Lambda$CDM model which besides the shear has two tilt parameters, one for radiation and one for the pressureless matter. For positive (negative) shear we again find whimper (curvature) singularity near the BB. Moreover, when the tilt parameters have opposite signs, the shear can change sign from negative to positive in the course of evolution of the Universe. We show that the relative tilt of the radiation and the matter generically remains sizable at late times.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we derive the singular condition for black holes and demonstrate the potential resolution of the black hole singularity in general relativity using non-perturbative $\alpha^{\prime}$ corrections of string theory. This work is motivated by the Belinskii, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz (BKL) proposal, which suggests that the structure of the black hole interior in vacuum Einstein's equations can be transformed into the Kasner universe near the singularity. This transformation allows for the description of the black hole interior using the $O\left(d,d\right)$ invariant anisotropic Hohm-Zwiebach action, which includes all orders of $\alpha^{\prime}$ corrections.</description>

      <title>Celestial $w_{1+\infty}$ charges and the subleading structure of asymptotically-flat spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the subleading structure of asymptotically-flat spacetimes and its relationship to the $w_{1+\infty}$ loop algebra of higher spin charges. We do so using both the Bondi-Sachs and the Newman-Penrose formalism, via a dictionary built from a preferred choice of tetrad. This enables us to access properties of the so-called higher Bondi aspects, such as their evolution equations, their transformation laws under asymptotic symmetries, and their relationship to the Newman-Penrose and the higher spin charges. By studying the recursive Einstein evolution equations defining these higher spin charges, we derive the general form of their transformation behavior under BMSW symmetries. This leads to an immediate proof that the spin 0,1 and spin $s$ brackets reproduce upon linearization the structure expected from the $w_{1+\infty}$ algebra. We then define renormalized higher spin charges which are conserved in the radiative vacuum at quadratic order, and show that they satisfy for all spins the $w_{1+\infty}$ algebra at linear order in the radiative data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of extended black hole thermodynamics, where the cosmological constant acts as the thermodynamic pressure and its conjugate as the thermodynamic volume, we analyze the phase structure and thermodynamic geometry of the three-dimensional quantum-corrected BTZ (qBTZ) black hole. Our results uncover two-phase transitions in the $T-S$ plane across all pressures except at a critical value. Numerical analysis reveals continuous critical phenomena along the coexistence curve, with critical exponents of 2 and 3 for the heat capacity at constant pressure and the NTG curvature, respectively. Importantly, these values notably deviate from the well-known critical exponents observed in mean-field Van der Waals (VdW) fluids, where the NTG curvature and heat capacity demonstrate discontinuous criticality. To our knowledge, our investigation is the first exploration of critical behavior in black holes incorporating consistent semiclassical backreaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extended dark matter objects (EDOs) are popular dark matter candidates that interact gravitationally with the Standard Model. These gravitational interactions can be used to constrain their allowed parameter space. However, EDOs can have different formation mechanisms, sizes, and shapes, requiring a case-by-case analysis when studying their impact on different areas of cosmology. We thus present a repository of all available bounds for these objects, with a code that allows plotting user-defined combinations of all up-to-date bounds for a given shape and different radii. We propose a standard for the EDOs' mass profiles so that different sets of bounds are consistent with each other, and provide instructions on using the code and contributing to the repository.</description>

      <title>CFT Phase Transition Analysis of Charged, Rotating Black Holes in $D=4$: A Holographic Thermodynamics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the holographic thermodynamics of 4-D Kerr-Newman AdS black holes, focusing on the conformal thermal states that are dual to these black holes. We explore the thermodynamic behavior within specific ensembles characterized by fixed sets of variables: $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},\mathcal{V},C)$, $(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,\mathcal{V},C)$, $(\varphi,\Omega,\mathcal{V},C)$, $(\varphi,\mathcal{J},\mathcal{V},C)$, $(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,p,C)$, and $(\varphi,\Omega,p,C)$. Here, $\varphi$, $\mathcal{Q}$, $\Omega$, $\mathcal{J}$, $p$, $\mathcal{V}$, and $C$ represent the electric potential, electric charge, angular velocity, angular momentum, CFT pressure, CFT volume, and central charge, respectively. The inclusion of both charge and momentum significantly enriches the regime of phase transitions, leading to a variety of phenomena including first-order Van der Waals-type phase transitions, (de)confinement phase transitions, Davies-type phase transitions, and second-order superfluid $\lambda$-type phase transitions. Notably, the introduction of the CFT pressure variable allows us to identify phase transitions and critical behavior in the $(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,p,C)$ and $(\varphi,\Omega,p,C)$ ensembles, which had not been previously observed. This study underscores the complexity and richness of phase transitions in these systems due to the inclusion of both charge and angular momentum.</description>

      <title>A particle's perspective on screening mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Screening mechanisms are a natural method for suppressing long-range forces in scalar-tensor theories as they link the local background density to their strength. Focusing on Brans-Dicke theories, those including a non-minimal coupling between a scalar degree of freedom and the Ricci scalar, we study the origin of these screening mechanisms from a field theory perspective, considering the influence of the Standard Model on the mechanisms. Additionally, we further consider the role of scale symmetries on screening, demonstrating that only certain sectors, those obtaining their mass via the Higgs mechanism, contribute to screening the fifth forces. This has significant implications for baryons, which obtain most of their mass from the gluon's binding energy. Given that the Planck mass is related to the vacuum expectation value of the non-minimally coupled field, we find an extensive region of the parameter space where screening mechanisms create a spatially dependent gravitational constant. We say that the field over-screens when this effect is more significant than the fifth forces suppressed by screening mechanisms, as we illustrate for the chameleon and symmetron models.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (GTOV) equation with Bayesian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we constrain the values of the parameters of the Generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (GTOV) equation through Bayesian inference. We use the mass and radius data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) for PSR J0740$+$6620 and PSR J0030$+$0451, as well as the mass, radius, and dimensionless tidal deformability from the gravitational wave (GW) events GW190814 and GW170817. We use two distinct parameterizations of the extended non-linear Walecka model (eNLW) with and without hyperons. The GTOV employed for the study contains additional free parameters with different physical motivations. Two possible scenarios are considered in our analysis: conservative and speculative. In the first case, we take into account the most reliable neutron star (NS) data from NICER and the GW170817 event. In the second case, we consider the possibility that the compact object with a mass of $2.54 M_{\odot}$ in the GW190814 event is an NS. Our findings show significant improvements in the physical quantities analyzed, leading to better agreement with the observational data compared to the results obtained using the TOV equation.</description>

      <title>String Scattering and Evolution of Ryu-Takayanagi Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12495v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, our aim is to illustrate that the process of open string scattering corresponds to the evolution of the entanglement wedge, where the scattering distance is identified as the entanglement wedge cross section. Moreover, open-closed string scattering, specifically the disk-disk interaction, works for the evolution of the reflected entanglement wedge, with the circumference of the waist cross section equating to the reflected entropy. It therefore provides evidence for the deep connections between the string worldsheet and the Ryu-Takayanagi surface. This connection is not only a coincidence rooted in hyperbolic geometry; it also reflects an additional correspondence between two distinct theories: mutual information and the geometric BV master equation.</description>

      <title>Inflation with the Chern-Simons term in the Palatini formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Chern--Simons term coupled to the inflaton in the Palatini formulation of general relativity. In contrast to the metric formulation, here the Chern--Simons term affects also the background evolution. We approximately solve for the connection, insert it back into the action, and reduce the order of the equations to obtain an effective theory in the gradient approximation. We consider three cases: when the connection is unconstrained, and when non-metricity or torsion is put to zero. In the first two cases, the inflaton kinetic term is modified with a term proportional to the square of the potential. For polynomial potentials dominated by the highest power of the field, the Chern--Simons term solves the problem that higher order corrections spoil the flatness of the potential. For Higgs inflation, the tensor-to-scalar ratio can be as large as the current observational bound, and the non-minimal coupling to the Ricci scalar can be as small as in the metric case. The Palatini contribution cures the known instability of the tensor modes due to the Chern--Simons term in the metric formulation.</description>

      <title>First part of Clausius heat theorem in terms of Noether's theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After Helmholtz, the mechanical foundation of thermodynamics included the First Law $d E = \delta Q + \delta W$, and the first part of the Clausius heat theorem $\delta Q^\text{rev}/T = dS$. The resulting invariance of the entropy $S$ for quasistatic changes in thermally isolated systems invites a connection with Noether's theorem (only established later). In this quest, we continue an idea, first brought up by Wald in black hole thermodynamics and by Sasa $\textit{et al.}$ in various contexts. We follow both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks, and emphasize the role of Killing equations for deriving a First Law for thermodynamically consistent trajectories, to end up with an expression of ``heat over temperature'' as an exact differential of a Noether charge.</description>

      <title>Thermal effects on warm chromoinflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a model of a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson inflaton field coupled to a non-Abelian $SU(2)$ gauge field. This model naturally leads to a warm inflation scenario, where the inflationary dynamics is dominated by thermal dissipation. In this work, we consider a scenario where the inflaton, an axion-like field, is coupled to the $SU(2)$ gauge field, similar to chromoinflation models. Both the inflaton and the gauge field with a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value are coupled to a thermal radiation bath. We demonstrate that the presence of the thermal bath during warm chromoinflation induces a thermal plasma mass for the background gauge field. This thermal mass can significantly disrupt the dynamics of the background gauge field, thereby driving it to its trivial null solution.</description>

Abstract: We present some addition theorems for spin-weighted spherical harmonics, generalizing previous results for scalar (spin-zero) spherical harmonics. These addition theorems involve sums over the azimuthal quantum number of products of two spin-weighted spherical harmonics at different points on the two-sphere, either (or both) of which are differentiated with respect to one of their arguments.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Binary Neutron Stars: Does Mass-Redshift Correlation Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational wave detectors are expected to detect millions of compact binary mergers across cosmological distances. The features of the mass distribution of these mergers, combined with gravitational wave distance measurements, will enable precise cosmological inferences, even without the need for electromagnetic counterparts. However, achieving accurate results requires modeling the mass spectrum, particularly considering possible redshift evolution. Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are thought to be less influenced by changes in metallicity compared to binary black holes (BBH) or neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. This stability in their mass spectrum over cosmic time reduces the chances of introducing biases in cosmological parameters caused by redshift evolution. In this study, we use the population synthesis code COMPAS to generate astrophysically motivated catalogs of BNS mergers and explore whether assuming a non-evolving BNS mass distribution with redshift could introduce biases in cosmological parameter inference. Our findings show that despite significant variations in the BNS mass distribution across binary physics assumptions and initial conditions in COMPAS, the joint mass-redshift population can be expressed as the product of the mass distribution marginalized over redshift and the redshift distribution marginalized over masses. This enables a 2% unbiased constraint on the Hubble constant - sufficient to address the Hubble tension. Additionally, we show that in the fiducial COMPAS setup, the bias from a non-evolving BNS mass model is less than 0.5% for the Hubble parameter measured at redshift 0.4. These results establish BNS mergers as strong candidates for spectral siren cosmology in the era of next-generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on previous works, in this article we systematically analyze the implications of the explicit normal modes of a probe scalar sector in a BTZ background with a Dirichlet wall, in an asymptotically AdS-background. This is a Fuzzball-inspired geometric model, at least in an effective sense. We demonstrate explicitly that in the limit when the Dirichlet wall approaches the event horizon, the normal modes condense fast to yield an effective branch cut along the real line in the complex frequency plane. In turn, in this approximation, quasi-normal modes associated to the BTZ black hole emerge and the corresponding two-point function is described by a thermal correlator, associated with the Hawking temperature in the general case and with the right-moving temperature in the extremal limit. We further show, analytically, that the presence of a non-vanishing angular momentum non-perturbatively enhances this condensation. The consequences are manifold: {\it e.g.}~there is an emergent {\it strong thermalization} due to these modes, adding further support to a quantum chaotic nature associated to the spectral form factor. We explicitly demonstrate, by considering a classical collapsing geometry, that the one-loop scalar determinant naturally inherits a Dirichlet boundary condition, as the shell approaches the scale of the event horizon. This provides a plausible dynamical mechanism in the dual CFT through a global quench, that can create an emergent Dirichlet boundary close to the horizon-scale. We offer comments on how this simple model can describe salient features of Fuzzball-geometries, as well as of extremely compact objects. This also provides an explicit realization of how an effective thermal physics emerges from a non-thermal microscopic description, within a semi-classical account of gravity, augmented with an appropriate boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fefferman-Graham gauge and boundary Weyl structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12513v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of AdS/CFT correspondence, the Fefferman--Graham (FG) gauge offers a useful way to express asymptotically anti-de Sitter spaces, allowing a clear identification of their boundary structure. A known feature of this approach is that choosing a particular conformal representative for the boundary metric breaks explicitly the boundary scaling symmetry. Recent developments have shown that it is possible to generalize the FG gauge to restore boundary Weyl invariance by adopting the Weyl--Fefferman--Graham gauge. In this paper, we focus on three-dimensional gravity and study the emergence of a boundary Weyl structure when considering the most general AdS boundary conditions introduced by Grumiller and Riegler. We extend the holographic renormalization scheme to incorporate Weyl covariant quantities, identifying new subleading divergences appearing at the boundary. To address these, we introduce a new codimension-two counterterm, or corner term, that ensures the finiteness of the gravitational action. From here, we construct the quantum-generating functional, the holographic stress tensor, and compute the corresponding Weyl anomaly, showing that the latter is now expressed in a full Weyl covariant way. Finally, we discuss explicit applications to holographic integrable models and accelerating black holes. For the latter, we show that the new corner term plays a crucial role in the computation of the Euclidean on-shell action.</description>

      <title>Conformal geometry as a gauge theory of gravity: covariant equations of motion &amp; conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Weyl conformal geometry as a general gauge theory of the Weyl group (of Poincar\'e and dilatations symmetries) in a manifestly Weyl gauge covariant formalism in which this geometry is (automatically) metric and physically relevant. This gives a realistic (quadratic) gauge theory of gravity, with Einstein-Hilbert gravity and a (positive) cosmological constant recovered in its spontaneously broken phase. For the most general action we compute the manifestly Weyl gauge covariant equations of motion and present the conservation laws for the energy-momentum tensor and Weyl gauge current. These laws are valid both in Weyl conformal geometry (with respect to the Weyl gauge covariant derivative) but also in the Riemannian geometry equivalent picture (with respect to its associated covariant derivative). This interesting result is a consequence of (gauged) diffeomorphism invariance of the former versus usual diffeomorphism invariance of the latter. These results are first derived for $d=4$ dimensions and are then extended to conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions while automatically maintaining manifest Weyl gauge invariance/covariance. The results are useful in physical applications with this symmetry.</description>
