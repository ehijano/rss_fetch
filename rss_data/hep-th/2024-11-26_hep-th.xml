      <title>Bootstrapping the 3d Ising Stress Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute observables of the critical 3d Ising model to high precision by applying the numerical conformal bootstrap to mixed correlators of the leading scalar operators $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$, and the stress tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$. We obtain new precise determinations of scaling dimensions $(\Delta_\sigma, \Delta_\epsilon) = (0.518148806(24), 1.41262528(29))$ as well as OPE coefficients involving $\sigma$, $\epsilon$, and $T_{\mu\nu}$. We also describe several improvements made along the way to algorithms and software tools for the numerical bootstrap.</description>

      <title>No manifest T-duality at order $\alpha'^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When reduced from $10$ to $10-d$ dimensions tree-level string theory exhibits an $O(d,d)$ symmetry. This symmetry, which is closely related to T-duality, appears only after certain field redefinitions. We find a simple form for a subset of these redefinitions at order $\alpha'^3$ and show that they cannot be lifted to ten dimensions. This is inconsistent with ``manifestly T-duality invariant'' approaches such as generalized geometry (in the uncompactified setting). Such formulations therefore seem not to be the correct language to describe string theory.</description>

      <title>Metallic transports from accelerating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We probe four dimensional accelerating black holes with D-brane and build up the notion of metallic holography for spacetime with negative cosmological constant. We explore various thermodynamic entities associated with the boundary QFT at low temperatures and finite chemical potential. The DC conductivity in the boundary QFT is enhanced due to the effects of black hole acceleration in the bulk counterpart. We further compute resistivity in different temperature regime, which reveals a new quantum liquid phase with dynamic critical exponent $ z=3 $.</description>

      <title>Condensation of Magnetic Fluxes and Landscape of QCD Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I discuss new non-perturbative solutions of the sourceless Yang-Mills equation representing the superposition of oppositely oriented chromomagnetic flux tubes (vortices) similar in their form to a lattice of superposed Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen chromomagnetic vortices. These solutions represent highly degenerate classical vacua of the Yang Mills theory that are separated by potential barriers and are forming a complicated potential landscape of the QCD vacuum. It is suggested that the solutions describe a lattice of dense chromomagnetic vortices representing a dual analog of the Cooper pairs condensate in a superconductor.</description>

      <title>Fluxification and scalarization of the conifold black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study thermal states of the strongly coupled Klebanov-Witten ${\cal N}=1$ superconformal gauge theory with R-symmetry chemical potential. The theory has two distinct dimension $\Delta=3$ chiral primary operators that develop a condensate at the same critical value of the chemical potential. One instability is associated with the spontaneous fluxification (the appearance of the 3-form flux) of the holographic dual black hole, while the other one is associated with the spontaneous scalarization (the activation of the deformation mode of the conifold). Different phases dominate in grand canonical and microcanonical ensembles.</description>

      <title>Sine-dilaton gravity vs double-scaled SYK: exploring one-loop quantum corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide non-trivial checks of the recently proposed duality between double-scaled SYK and a 2d dilaton gravity model with sine potential, studying the path integral at one-loop level. Specifically, we compute the logarithmic correction to the free energy of sine-dilaton gravity and, up to potential ordering ambiguities, we find a match with the corresponding quantity in double-scaled SYK. The computation relies on the description of sine-dilaton gravity in terms of a version of the q-Schwarzian theory, the quantum deformation of the standard Schwarzian model dual to JT gravity. A crucial aspect of the calculation is selecting the correct Hartle-Hawking vacuum for the gravitational theory, which implies a specific choice of boundary conditions for the one-loop determinant, computed using a generalization of the Gel'fand-Yaglom's theorem. We also evaluate the gravitational one-loop correction to the boundary to boundary propagator of a non-minimally coupled matter field in the bulk theory, showing a perfect agreement with the corresponding quantum correction of matter correlators in double-scaled SYK.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Brane Configurations, Tropical Coamoeba and 4d N=1 Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generative AI model to obtain Type IIB brane configurations that realize toric phases of a family of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories. These 4d N=1 quiver gauge theories are worldvolume theories of a D3-brane probing a toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold. The Type IIB brane configurations that realize this family of 4d N=1 theories are known as brane tilings and are given by the tropical coamoeba projection of the mirror curve associated with the toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold. The shape of the mirror curve and its coamoeba projection, as well as the corresponding Type IIB brane configuration and the toric phase of the 4d N=1 theory, all depend on the complex structure moduli parameterizing the mirror curve. We train a generative AI model, a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), that takes a choice of complex structure moduli as input and generates the corresponding tropical coamoeba. This enables us not only to obtain a high-resolution representation of the entire phase space for a family of brane tilings corresponding to the same toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold, but also to continuously track the movements of the mirror curve and individual branes in the corresponding Type IIB brane configurations during phase transitions associated with Seiberg duality.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning emergent spacetime from linear response in future tabletop quantum gravity experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel interpretable Neural Network (NN) model designed to perform precision bulk reconstruction under the AdS/CFT correspondence. According to the correspondence, a specific condensed matter system on a ring is holographically equivalent to a gravitational system on a bulk disk, through which tabletop quantum gravity experiments may be possible as reported in arXiv:2211.13863. The purpose of this paper is to reconstruct a higher-dimensional gravity metric from the condensed matter system data via machine learning using the NN. Our machine reads spatially and temporarily inhomogeneous linear response data of the condensed matter system, and incorporates a novel layer that implements the Runge-Kutta method to achieve better numerical control. We confirm that our machine can let a higher-dimensional gravity metric be automatically emergent as its interpretable weights, using a linear response of the condensed matter system as data, through supervised machine learning. The developed method could serve as a foundation for generic bulk reconstruction, i.e., a practical solution to the AdS/CFT correspondence, and would be implemented in future tabletop quantum gravity experiments.</description>

      <title>Yangian Form-alism for Planar Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we reconsider the formulation of Yangian symmetry for planar N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, and we investigate to what extent this symmetry lifts to the beta/gamma-deformation of the model. We first apply cohomology of variational forms towards a thorough derivation of the invariance statement for the undeformed action from covariance of the equations of motion under the Yangian algebra. We then apply a twist deformation to these statements paying particular attention to cyclicity aspects. We find that the equations of motion remain covariant while invariance of the action only holds for the Yangian subalgebra that is uncharged under the twist.</description>

Abstract: We study a spatial-temporal structure of quantum fluctuations in the stress-energy tensor of zero-point modes for a scalar field in order to formulate a covariant model. The model describes an invariant vacuum contribution to the cosmological constant in the non-stationary coherent state in a finite volume. Bare and effective mean values of vacuum energy density are compared.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these lecture notes for the Les Houches School on Quantum Geometry I give an introductory overview of non-perturbative aspects of topological string theory. After a short summary of the perturbative aspects, I first consider the non-perturbative sectors of the theory as unveiled by the theory of resurgence. I give a self-contained derivation of recent results on non-perturbative amplitudes, and I explain the conjecture relating the resurgent structure of the topological string to BPS invariants. In the second part of the lectures I introduce the topological string/spectral theory (TS/ST) correspondence, which provides a non-perturbative definition of topological string theory on toric Calabi-Yau manifolds in terms of the spectral theory of quantum mirror curves</description>

      <title>Derivation of the GKP-Witten relation by symmetry without Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the GKP-Witten relation in terms of correlation functions by symmetry without referring to a Lagrangian or the large $N$ expansion. By constructing bulk operators from boundary operators in conformal field theory (CFT) by the conformal smearing, we first determine bulk-boundary 2-pt functions for an arbitrary spin using both conformal and bulk symmetries, then evaluate their small $z$ behaviors, where $z$ is the $(d+1)$-th coordinate in the bulk. Next, we explicitly determine small $z$ behaviors of bulk-boundary-boundary 3-pt functions also by the symmetries, while small $z$ behaviors of correlation functions among one bulk and $n$ boundary operators with $n\ge 3$ are fixed by the operator product expansion (OPE). Combining all results, we construct the GKP-Witten relation in terms of these correlation functions at all orders in an external source $J$. We compare our non-Lagrangian approach with the standard approach employing the bulk action. Our results indicate that the GKP-Witten relation holds not only for holographic CFTs but also for generic CFTs as long as certain conditions are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in the Schr\"odinger Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Krylov complexity in the context of Schr\"odinger field theory in the grand canonic ensemble for the bosonic and fermionic cases. Specifically, we find that the Lanczos coefficients $\{a_{n}\}$ and $\{b_{n}\}$ satisfy the linear relations with respect to $n$. It is find that $\{b_n\}$ is independent of the chemical potentials while $\{a_n\}$ depends on the chemical potentials. The resulting Krylov complexities for both bosonic and fermionic cases behave similarly, which is due to the similar profiles of the square of the absolute values of the auto-correlation functions. In the late time, the Krylov complexity exhibits exponential growth with the asymptotic scaling significantly smaller than the twice of the slope of $\{b_n\}$, which is different from that in the relativistic field theory. We argue that this is because the Lanczos coefficients $\{a_n\}$ also contributes to the Krylov complexity.</description>

      <title>Wiggly dilaton: a landscape of spontaneously broken scale invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dilaton emerges as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) associated with the spontaneous breaking of scale invariance in a nearly conformal field theory (CFT). We show the existence of a wiggly dilaton potential that contains multiple vacuum solutions in a five-dimensional (5D) holographic formulation. The wiggly feature originates from boundary potentials of a 5D axion-like scalar field, whose naturally small bulk mass parameter corresponds to a marginally-relevant deformation of the dual CFT. Depending on the energy density of a boundary $3$-brane, our model can be used to generate a light dilaton or provide a relaxion potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theories for diffusion including the lowest non-hydrodynamic degree of freedom from holographic Gubser-Rocha systems. At low temperature the dynamical non-hydrodynamic mode could be either an IR mode or a slow mode, which is related to IR quantum critical excitations or encodes the information of all energy scales. This additional dynamical vector mode could be viewed as an ultraviolet sector of the diffusive hydrodynamic theory. We construct two different effective actions for each case and discuss their physical properties. In particular we show that the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger symmetry is preserved.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New dilaton Weyl multiplets are constructed in four and five space-time dimensions for $N=4$ and $N=2$ conformal supergravity respectively. They are constructed from a mixture of the old dilaton weyl multiplets with an on-shell vector multiplet. The old dilaton Weyl multiplets have a $USp(4)$ R-symmetry group whereas the new multiplets have $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ R-symmetry, which is a subgroup of $USp(4)$. In six dimensions, for the first time we construct a dilaton Weyl multiplet for $(2,0)$ conformal supergravity from a mixture of the standard Weyl multiplet and a tensor multiplet. The R-symmetry group for the dilaton Weyl multiplet in six dimensions is also $SU(2)\times SU(2)$.</description>

      <title>A basic triad in Macdonald theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the context of wavefunctions of integrable many-body systems, rational multivariable Baker-Akhiezer (BA) functions were introduced by O. Chalykh, M. Feigin and A. Veselov and, in the case of the trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider system, can be associated with a reduction of the Macdonald symmetric polynomials at $t=q^{-m}$ with integer partition labels substituted by arbitrary complex numbers. A parallel attempt to describe wavefunctions of the bispectral trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider problem was made by M. Noumi and J. Shiraishi who proposed a power series that reduces to the Macdonald polynomials at particular values of parameters. It turns out that this power series also reduces to the BA functions at $t=q^{-m}$, as we demonstrate in this letter. This makes the Macdonald polynomials, the BA functions and the Noumi-Shiraishi (NS) series a closely tied {\it triad} of objects, which have very different definitions, but are straightforwardly related with each other. In particular, theory of the BA functions provides a nice system of simple linear equations, while the NS functions provide a nice way to represent the multivariable BA function explicitly with arbitrary number of variables.</description>

      <title>Surprises in the Ordinary: $O(N)$ Invariant Surface Defect in the $\epsilon$-expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an $O(N)$ invariant surface defect in the Wilson-Fisher conformal field theory (CFT) in $d=4-\epsilon$ dimensions. This defect is defined by mass deformation on a two-dimensional surface that generates localized disorder and is conjectured to factorize into a pair of ordinary boundary conditions in $d=3$. We determine defect CFT data associated with the lightest $O(N)$ singlet and vector operators up to the third order in the $\epsilon$-expansion, find agreements with results from numerical methods and provide support for the factorization proposal in $d=3$. Along the way, we observe surprising non-renormalization properties for surface anomalous dimensions and operator-product-expansion coefficients in the $\epsilon$-expansion. We also analyze the full conformal anomalies for the surface defect.</description>

      <title>The entanglement membrane in 2d CFT: reflected entropy, RG flow, and information velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time evolution of entanglement entropy in generic chaotic many-body systems has an effective description in terms of a minimal membrane, characterised by a tension function. For 2d CFTs, a degenerate tension function reproduces several results regarding the dynamics of the entropy; this stands in contrast to higher dimensions where the tension is non-degenerate. In this paper we use holography to show that, in order to correctly capture the reflected entropy in 2d CFT, one needs to add an additional degree of freedom to the membrane description. Furthermore, we show that the conventional non-degenerate membrane tension function emerges upon introducing a relevant deformation of the CFT, dual to a planar BTZ black hole with scalar hair and with an interior Kasner universe. Finally, we also study the membrane description for reflected entropy and information velocity arXiv:1908.06993 in higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solitons in relativistic field theories are not necessarily topologically charged. In particular, non-topological solitons -- known as Q-balls -- arise naturally in nonlinear field theories endowed with attractive interactions and internal symmetries. Even without stabilizing internal symmetries, quasi-solitons known as oscillons, which are long-lived, can also exist. Both Q-balls and oscillons have significant applications in cosmology and particle physics. This review is an updated account of the intriguing properties and dynamics of these non-topological solitons and quasi-solitons, as well as their important roles in early-universe scenarios and particle physics models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An effective action for NS5-branes coupled to supergravity is used to derive the full 10d form of horizon-free BPS solutions of fivebranes carrying momentum waves, including both transverse scalar and internal gauge excitations of the branes. When internal modes are highly excited, we find solutions that plausibly mediate the transition between the Coulomb phase of NS5-branes and the black hole phase. We also compute the two-point functions of fivebrane density fluctuations and of gravitons absorbed by the branes. Finally, we begin an exploration of near-BPS perturbations of the fivebrane ensemble, and propose the use of the brane+bulk effective action as a tool to explore the black hole phase, even in the AdS decoupling limit.</description>

      <title>Quantum de Sitter Entropy and Sphere Partition Functions: A-Hypergeometric Approach to Higher Loop Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to find quantum corrections to the de Sitter entropy, a new approach to higher loop Feynman integral computations on the sphere is presented. Arbitrary scalar Feynman integrals on a spherical background are brought into the generalized Euler integral (A-hypergeometric series/GKZ system) form by expressing the massive scalar propagator as a quotient of a bivariate radial Mellin transform of the massless scalar propagator in one higher dimensional Euclidean flat space. This formulation is expanded to include massive and massless vector fields by construction of similar embedding space propagators. Vector Feynman integrals are shown to be sums over generalized Euler integrals formed of underlying scalar Feynman integrals. Granting existence of general spin embedding space propagators, the same is shown to be true for general spin Feynman integrals.</description>

      <title>A Vestige of FZZ Duality in Higher Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1+1 dimensions, the equations of motion of the Horowitz-Polchinski (HP) effective string have a re-writing in terms of a first order system. This is attributed to FZZ duality. In this note, we observe that a similar re-writing exists in higher dimensions, so that the degree of the dilaton-winding subsystem reduces to first order. The 1+1 first order equations emerge as a natural limit of the higher dimensional HP system in the cap region of the cigar. As a result, there is a critical value of the winding amplitude that matches with the 1+1 coset SCFT prediction. At this critical point, the cigar has a puncture at the Euclidean horizon and the $higher$ $dimensional$ black hole entropy is correctly reproduced by the winding condensate.</description>

      <title>Boundary terms in string field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We supplement the string field theory action with boundary terms to make its variational principle well-posed. Central to our considerations is the violation of the stress-energy tensor conservation in non-compact CFTs due to the boundary terms. This manifests as the failure of the cyclicity of the BRST operator, which encodes the target space integration by parts identities at the level of the worldsheet. Using this failure, we argue that the free closed string field theory action admits a well-posed variational principle upon including an additional boundary contribution. We explicitly work out the resulting action up to the massless level and show that it is related to the expansion of the low-energy effective string action endowed with the Gibbons-Hawking-York term on a flat background. We also discuss the structure of the boundary terms in the interacting theory.</description>

Abstract: Lie algebras formed via semi-direct sums of the Witt algebra $\text{Der}(\mathbb{C}[t,t^{-1}])$ and its modules have become increasingly prominent in both physics and mathematics in recent years. In this paper, we complete the study of (Leibniz) central extensions, derivations and automorphisms of the Lie algebras formed from the semi-direct sum of the Witt algebra and its indecomposable intermediate series modules (that is, graded modules with one-dimensional graded components). Our techniques exploit the internal grading of the Witt algebra, which can be applied to a wider class of graded Lie algebras.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the behavior of quantum particles in weak gravitational fields. We examine scalar and spinor particles, showing that these quantum particles in weak gravitational fields follow geodesic trajectories, aligning with classical expectations. Further, we explore the impact of gravitational fields on Yukawa interaction $\lambda \bar{\Psi} \Phi \Psi$, revealing that Feynman diagrams are modified due to the curvature, affecting propagators and interaction dynamics. The presence of spatially-dependent factors in propagators underscores the localized nature of gravitational effects on particle interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze essential properties about gravitational quantum field theory (GQFT) grounded on spin gauge symmetry by taking the general theory of quantum electrodynamics as example. A constraint equation for the field strength of gravigaiuge field is obtained to be as gravitization equation in spin-related gravigauge spacetime, which indicates how the gravitational effect emerges from non-commutative relation of gravigauge derivative operator. By representing the action in Minkowski spacetime, we show that translational invariance leads to zero energy momentum tensor in GQFT when applying for equations of motion for all basic fields including gravigauge field, which extends conservation law of energy momentum tensor in quantum field theory to cancellation law of energy momentum tensor in GQFT. An equivalence between general gravitational equation and zero energy momentum tensor is naturally resulted in GQFT.</description>

      <title>Simple Scaling Laws for Energy Correlators in Nuclear Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collider experiments involving nuclei provide a direct means of studying exotic states of nuclear matter. Recent measurements of energy correlators in both proton-nucleus (p-A) and nucleus-nucleus (A-A) collisions reveal sizable modifications, attributable to nuclear effects, compared to proton-proton (p-p) collisions. Energy correlators, and their associated light-ray operator product expansion (OPE), allow scaling behaviors of the measured spectrum to be directly mapped to properties of the underlying quantum field theory. Here, we demonstrate for the first time how this mapping occurs in nuclear collisions, and highlight how the light-ray OPE characterizes leading nuclear effects. We show that the leading modification to the energy correlator distribution is characterized by an enhancement of the expectation value of twist-4 light-ray operators, resulting in a scaling for the ratio of the two-point correlator in nuclear matter to that in vacuum of $\sim 1+a\theta^2$ up to quantum corrections. We verify that this leading twist-4 correction accurately describes recent A-A and p-A data, and is thus sufficient to capture the scaling behavior within the angular range measured for jet radii used in nuclear experiments. Our light-ray OPE based approach lays the groundwork for a rigorous characterization of nuclear modification to energy correlator observables.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall response of an abelian chiral spin liquid at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal Hall transport has emerged as a valuable tool for probing the fractionalized excitations in chiral quantum spin liquids. Observing quantized thermal Hall response, expected at temperatures below the spectral gap, has been challenging and controversial. The finite temperature behavior, especially in the quantum critical regime above the spectral gap, can provide useful signatures of the underlying topological order. In this context, we study the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a kagome lattice that is believed to be a U$(1)$ Dirac spin liquid over a wide intermediate energy range. Scalar spin chirality perturbations turn this into a gapped abelian chiral spin liquid (CSL) with semionic topological order. Using a recently developed large-$N$ technique [Guo et al., Phys. Rev. B 101, 195126 (2020)], we obtain explicit expressions for the thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ at finite temperatures taking into account both matter and gauge fluctuations. At low temperatures below the spectral gap, the quantized thermal Hall response agrees with that expected from conformal field theory and gravitational anomaly arguments. Our main finding is that in a large temperature window spanning the spectral gap and the Curie temperature scales where quantum critical fluctuations dominate, $\kappa_{xy}/T$ obeys a power-law with logarithmic corrections. Our analysis also provides a route to understanding the thermal Hall response at temperatures in the quantum critical regime of other spin liquid phases.</description>

      <title>The Seiberg-Witten Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully calculable UV complete toy model of a Peccei-Quinn (PQ) axion coupled to magnetic monopoles as well as electric charges. The theory has manifest electric-magnetic duality built in. We find that the axion-photon coupling contains the usual anomaly term, plus periodic corrections which can also become large if the monopole is light, without violating the discrete axion shift symmetry. These additional periodic terms can be identified as the non-perturbative corrections due to the monopoles (and other BPS states), but can also be interpreted as a sum over instanton corrections. The key aspect helping reconcile axion coupling quantization with electric-magnetic duality is the fact that the axion itself undergoes a non-linear transformation under electric-magnetic duality. The theory analyzed here is just the original $N=2$ supersymmetric $SU(2)$ Seiberg-Witten theory, which contains a PQ axion due to an anomalous spontaneously broken global $R$-symmetry, as well as massless fermionic monopoles and dyons at special points in the moduli space. Hence the entire machinery of the Seiberg-Witten solution can be applied to reliably calculate the photon-axion coupling in different duality frames. We show explicitly that the physically observable axion-photon amplitude is duality invariant, as it had to be.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The photo-electric effect was a historic milestone in the development of quantum theory, revealing the first evidence of discrete energy of the electromagnetic field through hallmark signatures such as the threshold frequency, intensity-independent energy transfer, and the near instantaneous ejection of photo-electrons. In this work, we revisit the photo-electric effect through the lens of semi-classical, quantum, and neo-classical models to explore their implications on energy conservation and discrete photon exchange. We extend this analysis to include the gravito-phononic effect through modelling energy transfer between coupled harmonic oscillators, rather than traditional atom-field interactions. Our approach demonstrates that two coupled harmonic oscillators, under a beam-splitter interaction, can exhibit hallmark signatures analogous to the photo-electric effect, including resonance conditions and quantised energy absorption. We discuss the implications of this model for the recently proposed gravito-phononic detections of single gravitons. This further clarifies that a gravitational version of the photo-electric effect, modelled as discrete energy transfer between harmonic oscillators can provide the first evidence of the graviton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we discuss an analogy between the BCS theory and the seesaw model of neutrinos. We believe that the analogy indicates some fundamental aspects of Majorana neutrinos. A paper on the issue has been recently presented, and we would like to describe the background of the paper together with our personal views on the problem. In essence, the conventional construction of a Majorana neutrino from a chiral fermion is too simplified, and we argue that one would actually have to go through a Bogoliubov-type canonical transformation to generate two Majorana fermions from an effective single Dirac fermion in the seesaw model.</description>

      <title>Classifying Logical Gates in Quantum Codes via Cohomology Operations and Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically construct and classify fault-tolerant logical gates implemented by constant-depth circuits for quantum codes using cohomology operations and symmetry. These logical gates are obtained from unitary operators given by symmetry-protected topological responses, which correspond to generators of group cohomology and can be expressed explicitly on the lattice using cohomology operations including cup product, Steenrod squares and new combinations of higher cup products called higher Pontryagin powers. Our study covers most types of the cohomology operations in the literature. This hence gives rise to several new classes of diagonal and non-diagonal logical gates in increasing Clifford hierarchies beyond the usual color code paradigm corresponding to an $n$-fold cup product, including the logical $R_k$ and multi-controlled $C^m R_k$ gates for codes defined in projective spaces. Implementing these gates could make it more efficient to compile specific types of quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm. We further extend the construction to quantum codes with boundaries, which generalizes the folding approach in color codes. We also present a formalism for addressable and parallelizable logical gates in LDPC codes via higher-form symmetries and apply it to construct addressable logical Clifford gates in expander-based codes including the asymptotically good LDPC codes and hypergraph-product codes. As a byproduct, we find new topological responses of finite higher-form symmetries using higher Pontryagin powers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a new general solution for the gravitational field equations in quantum fluctuation modified gravity, which reduces to different classes of black holes surrounded by fluids, by taking some specific values of the parameter of the equation of state. We discuss the strong energy condition in a general way and also for some special cases of different fluids. In addition, the Hawking temperature associated to the horizons of solutions and constraints on the parameter characterizing the fluctuation of metric are taken into account in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Analytic models for gravitational collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two analytical models of gravitational collapse toward the Schwarzschild black hole, starting from the interior of the revisited Schwarzschild solution recently reported in [Phys. Rev. D 109, 104032 (2024)]. Both models satisfy some energy conditions at all times as long as the collapse is slower than some limit. While a singularity of the Schwarzschild black hole at the origin ($R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}R^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}\sim r^{-6}$) forms immediately after the start of the collapse in one model, such a singularity never appear at finite time during the collapse (except $t\to\infty$) in the other model. The scheme used shows great potential for studying in detail the appearance of singularities in general relativity.</description>

      <title>Effective Theory Building and Manifold Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manifold learning and effective model building are generally viewed as fundamentally different types of procedure. After all, in one we build a simplified model of the data, in the other, we construct a simplified model of the another model. Nonetheless, I argue that certain kinds of high-dimensional effective model building, and effective field theory construction in quantum field theory, can be viewed as special cases of manifold learning. I argue that this helps to shed light on all of these techniques. First, it suggests that the effective model building procedure depends upon a certain kind of algorithmic compressibility requirement. All three approaches assume that real-world systems exhibit certain redundancies, due to regularities. The use of these regularities to build simplified models is essential for scientific progress in many different domains.</description>

      <title>Towards a parameter-free determination of critical exponents and chiral phase transition temperature in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to quantify the universal properties of the chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD, we make use of an improved, renormalized order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking which is obtained as a suitable difference of the $2$-flavor light quark chiral condensate and its corresponding light quark susceptibility. Having no additive ultraviolet as well as multiplicative logarithmic divergences, we use ratios of this order parameter constructed from its values for two different light quark masses. We show that this facilitates determining in a parameter-independent manner, the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ and the associated critical exponent $\delta$ which, for sufficiently small values of the light quark masses, controls the quark mass dependence of the order parameter at $T_c$. We present first results of these calculations from our numerical analysis performed with staggered fermions on $N_\tau=8$ lattices.</description>

Abstract: The linear solution for quadrupolar perturbations around de Sitter spacetime was recently constructed. In this paper, we provide the flux-balance laws for each background symmetry (dilatations, rotations, spatial translations and cosmological boosts) in terms of source moments at quadrupolar order. We write the dilatation flux-balance law in two distinct ways, which allows to contrast two distinct proposals for the negative definite energy flux. The standard Poincar\'e flux balance laws at future null infinity are recovered in the flat limit of the $SO(1,4)$ flux-balance laws.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the scalar and tensor modes of the gravitational perturbation in the presence of a scalar field which describes inflation. We investigate the back-reaction of the perturbations to the background by studying the effective energy-momentum tensor (2EMT) which is the second order constructed by the quadratic terms of the linear perturbations. 2EMT is gauge dependent due to the scalar mode. We obtain 2EMT in the slow-roll stage of inflation, and get its cosmological expressions in three (longitudinal, spatially flat, and comoving) gauge conditions. We find that the pure scalar-mode part in 2EMT is stronger in the short-wavelength limit, while the parts involved with the tensor mode (the pure tensor-mode part and the scalar-tensor coupled part) are stronger in the long-wavelength limit.</description>

      <title>Twisted vertex algebra modules for irregular connections: A case study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A vertex algebra with an action of a group $G$ comes with a notion of $g$-twisted modules, forming a $G$-crossed braided tensor category. For a Lie group $G$, one might instead wish for a notion of $(\mathrm{d}+A)$-twisted modules for any $\mathfrak{g}$-connection on the formal punctured disc. For connections with a regular singularity, this reduces to $g$-twisted modules, where $g$ is the monodromy around the puncture. The case of an irregular singularity is much richer and involved, and we are not aware that it has appeared in vertex algebra language. The present article is intended to spark such a treatment, by providing a list of expectations and an explicit worked-through example with interesting applications.
  Concretely, we consider the vertex super algebra of symplectic fermions, or equivalently the triplet vertex algebra $\mathcal{W}_p(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ for $p=2$, and study its twisted module with respect to irregular $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-connections. We first determine the category of representations, depending on the formal type of the connection. Then we prove that a Sugawara type construction gives a Virasoro action and we prove that as Virasoro modules our representations are direct sums of Whittaker modules.
  Conformal field theory with irregular singularities resp. wild ramification appear in the context of geometric Langlands correspondence, and in particular in work by Witten [Wit08]. It has also been studied for example in the context of Gaudin models [FFTL10] and in the context of AGT correspondence [GT12]. Our original motivation comes from semiclassical limits of the generalized quantum Langlands kernel, which fibres over the space of connections [FL24], similar to the affine Lie algebra at critical level. Our present article now describes, in the smallest case, the</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a brief note on a recently flagged issue \cite{CHK} regarding the precise characterization of quadrupolar truncation of the linearized gravitational waves in de Sitter space-time. An apparent inconsistency was noted while transforming the linearized solution truncated to quadrupolar contribution to the Bondi-Sachs form. A consistent truncation was identified as one where the transformation of the truncated solution does not generate logarithmic terms inadmissible in the Bondi-Sachs asymptotic form.
  I point out the role of the gauge conditions and the solution of the homogeneous equation in obviating the apparent inconsistency issue.</description>

Abstract: Langlands duality is one of the most influential topics in mathematical research. It has many different appearances and influential subtopics. Yet there is a topic that until now seems unrelated to the Langlands program. That is the topic of invariant differential operators. That is strange since both items are deeply rooted in Harish-Chandra's representation theory of semisimple Lie groups. In this paper we start building the bridge between the two programs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exact analytical solution to the nonlinear relativistic Boltzmann equation for a massless gas with a non-isotropic cross section is given in a homogeneous spacetime. By employing a trial solution, we construct a set of nonlinear coupled equations for scalar moments and solve this set exactly. Our analytical solution with nontrivial scattering angle dependence contained can be mapped onto the BKW solution of a homogeneous nonrelativistic gas of Maxwell molecules. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a feasible region determined by physical requirements. The analytical solution with parameters within the feasible region admits a stable fixed point corresponding to the equilibrium solution of the Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the aim of testing massive gravity in the context of black hole physics, we investigate the gravitational radiation emitted by a massive particle plunging into a Schwarzschild black hole from slightly below the innermost stable circular orbit. To do so, we first construct the quasinormal and quasibound resonance spectra of the spin-2 massive field for odd and even parity. Then, we compute the waveforms produced by the plunging particle and study their spectral content. This allows us to highlight and interpret important phenomena in the plunge regime, including (i) the excitation of quasibound states, with particular emphasis on the amplification and slow decay of the post-ringdown phase of the even-parity dipolar mode due to harmonic resonance; (ii) during the adiabatic phase, the waveform emitted by the plunging particle is very well described by the waveform emitted by the particle living on the ISCO, and (iii) the regularized waveforms and their unregularized counterparts constructed from the quasinormal mode spectrum are in excellent agreement.</description>

Abstract: Generalising the chiral boundary conditions of $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$ gravity for AdS$_4$ gravity, we derive chiral locally AdS$_4$ solutions in the Newman-Unti gauge consistent with a variational principle whose asymptotic symmetry algebra we show, to be an infinite-dimensional chiral extension of $\mathfrak{so}(2,3)$. This symmetry algebra coincides with the chiral $\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra in the flat space limit. We posit this symmetry algebra as the chiral version of recently discovered $\Lambda$-$\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra. We postulate line integral charges from the bulk AdS$_4$ gravity corresponding to this chiral symmetry algebra and show that the charges obey the semi-classical limit of a $\mathcal{W}$-algebra that includes a level $\kappa$ Kac-Moody $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$ current algebra. Furthermore, using the standard tools of $2d$ CFT, we derive the quantum version of this $\mathcal{W}$-algebra which may be denoted by $\mathcal{W}(2;(3/2)^2,1^3)$.</description>

Abstract: We extend the formula for correlation functions of free scalar field theories and Dirac field theories in terms of quantum $A_{\infty}$ algebras presented in arXiv:2305.11634 to general scalar-Dirac systems. We obtain the result that the same formula as in the previous paper holds in this case. We show that correlation functions from our formula satisfy the Schwinger-Dyson equations. We therefore confirm that correlation functions from our formula express correlation functions from the ordinary approach of quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>All near-horizon symmetries of the Schwarzschild black hole in linearised gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymptotic symmetries are known to constrain the infrared behaviour of scattering processes in asymptotically flat spacetimes. By the same token, one expects symmetries of the black hole horizon to constrain near-horizon gravitational scattering. In this paper, we take a step towards establishing this connection. We find all near-horizon symmetries that can be potentially relevant to gravitational scattering near the horizon of the Schwarzschild black hole. We study large diffeomorphisms of linearised perturbations of the Schwarzschild black hole in a partial wave basis and in a gauge that allows for gravitational radiation crossing the event horizon. This setup is ideally suited for studying processes involving near-horizon gravitons like scattering and black hole evaporation. We find the most general near-horizon symmetries that are consistent with finite perturbations at the horizon. Since we do not impose any further boundary conditions, these symmetries represent the biggest set of symmetries in this setting. We find the associated covariant charges to be finite and non-zero showing that these symmetries are physical. Interestingly, for a large black hole, the dominant symmetries are just two copies of $ u(1)$.</description>

      <title>Operator-state correspondence in simple current extended conformal field theories: Toward a general understanding of chiral conformal field theories and topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the operator-state correspondence in the Majorana conformal field theory (CFT) with emphasis on its semion representation. Whereas the semion representation (or $Z_{2}$ extension of the chiral Ising CFT) gives a concise ``abelian" (or invertible) representation in the level of fusion rule and quantum states, there exists subtlety when considering the chiral multipoint correlation function. In this sense, the operator-state correspondence in the semion sector of the fermionic theory inevitably contains difficulty coming from its anomalous conformal dimension $1/16$ as a $Z_{2}$ symmetry operator. By analyzing the asymptotic behaviors of the existing correlation functions, we propose a nontrivial correspondence between the chiral conformal blocks and bulk correlation functions containing both order and disorder fields. One can generalize this understanding to $Z_{N}$ models or fractional supersymmetric models (in which there exist long-standing open problems). We expect this may improve our understanding of the simple current extension of CFT which can appear commonly in the studies of topologically ordered systems.</description>

Abstract: Temperature constraints are highly desirable in the experimental setup when seeking the synthesis of new carbon structures. Fluctuations of the Dirac field result in temperature-dependent corrections to the Helfrich-Canham formulation, which governs the classical elasticity of the graphene membrane at equilibrium. Here, we examine the emergent shapes allowed by the effective model up to quadratic order in Ricci curvature and discuss the constraints required to observe them. We determine the mechanical stability conditions and provide a phase diagram characterized by the appearance of a critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ that distinguishes between carbon nanotube and fullerene phases. The observation of minimal and developable surfaces is anticipated in the high- and low-temperature regimes, respectively. Additionally, a Beltrami trumpet surface is forecasted when the membrane is subjected to an external source balancing out internal Helfrich stresses.</description>

Abstract: The $4$-dimensional semi-holomorphic Chern-Simons theory of Costello and Yamazaki provides a gauge-theoretic origin for the Lax connection of $2$-dimensional integrable field theories. The purpose of this paper is to extend this framework to the setting of $3$-dimensional integrable field theories by considering a $5$-dimensional semi-holomorphic higher Chern-Simons theory for a higher connection $(A,B)$ on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{C}P^1$. The input data for this theory are the choice of a meromorphic $1$-form $\omega$ on $\mathbb{C}P^1$ and a strict Lie $2$-group with cyclic structure on its underlying Lie $2$-algebra. Integrable field theories on $\mathbb{R}^3$ are constructed by imposing suitable boundary conditions on the connection $(A,B)$ at the $3$-dimensional defects located at the poles of $\omega$ and choosing certain admissible meromorphic solutions of the bulk equations of motion. The latter provides a natural notion of higher Lax connection for $3$-dimensional integrable field theories, including a $2$-form component $B$ which can be integrated over Cauchy surfaces to produce conserved charges. As a first application of this approach, we show how to construct a generalization of Ward's $(2+1)$-dimensional integrable chiral model from a suitable choice of data in the $5$-dimensional theory.</description>

Abstract: We construct Narain conformal field theories (CFTs) from quantum subsystem codes, a more comprehensive class of quantum error-correcting codes than quantum stabilizer codes, for qudit systems of prime dimensions. The resulting code CFTs exhibit a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, enabling us to perform the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging to derive their orbifolded and fermionized theories when the symmetry is non-anomalous. We classify a subset of these subsystem code CFTs using weighted oriented graphs and enumerate those with small central charges. Consequently, we identify several bosonic code CFTs self-dual under the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold, new supersymmetric code CFTs, and a few fermionic code CFTs with spontaneously broken supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic topology of topological black hole in $F(R)$-ModMax gravity's rainbow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to include the effect of high energy and topological parameters on black holes in $F(R)$ gravity, we consider two corrections to this gravity: energy-dependent spacetime with different topological constants, and a nonlinear electrodynamics field. In other words, we combine $F(R)$ gravity's rainbow with ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics theory to see the effects of high energy and topological parameters on the physics of black holes. For this purpose, we first extract topological black hole solutions in $F(R)$% -ModMax gravity's rainbow. Then, by considering black holes as thermodynamic systems, we obtain thermodynamic quantities and check the first law of thermodynamics. The effect of the topological parameter on the Hawking temperature and the total mass of black holes is obvious. We also discuss the thermodynamic topology of topological black holes in $F(R)$-ModMax gravity's rainbow using the off-shell free energy method. In this formalism, black holes are assumed to be equivalent to defects in their thermodynamic spaces. For our analysis, we consider two different types of thermodynamic ensembles. These are: fixed $q$ ensemble and fixed $\phi$ ensemble. We take into account all the different types of curvature hypersurfaces that can be constructed in these black holes. The local and global topology of these black holes are studied by computing the topological charges at the defects in their thermodynamic spaces. Finally, in accordance with their topological charges, we classify the black holes into three topological classes with total winding numbers corresponding to $-1, 0$, and $1$. We observe that the topological classes of these black holes are dependent on the value of the rainbow function, the sign of the scalar curvature, and the choice of ensembles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to investigate how the drag force is affected by translational symmetry breaking (TSB), we utilize a holographic model in which the background metric remains translational symmetric while a graviton mass or other fields in the theory break this symmetry. We calculate analytically the drag force, considering an asymptotic $AdS_5$ in which parameter {\alpha} arises from TSB. This parameter can be intuitively understood as a measure of TSB strength and we anticipate that non-zero values of it will affect the drag force. In this asymptotic AdS5 background, we will demonstrate that a decrease in {\alpha} results in a reduction of the drag force. Moreover, we study the diffusion constant, which falls with increasing {\alpha}. It will eventually be shown that at lower values of {\alpha} or {\mu} (chemical potential), the transverse diffusion coefficient is larger than the longitudinal one, and the speed of the heavy quark has minimal impact on the ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tree-level string effective action reduced from $D$ to $D-d$ dimensions possesses a continuous $O(d,d)$ symmetry, closely related to T-duality. A necessary condition for a higher derivative correction to preserve this symmetry is that certain $O(d,d)$ violating terms which appear in the dimensional reduction have to cancel out. We use this idea to complete the quartic Riemann correction with all terms involving five NS-NS sector fields. The resulting Lagrangian is considerably simpler than expressions that have previously appeared in the literature.</description>

Abstract: An analogue of the Chern-Pontryagin density for $SO(D)$ gauged $O(D+1)$ Skyrme systems, referred to as Skyrme--Chern-Pontryagin (SCP) densities is known for dimensions $D=2,3,4$. Since these are defined only through a prescription, it is necessary to extend the realisation to higher $D$, which is carried out here for $D=5$. The construction of SCP densities in $D=2,3,4,5$ is presented here in a unified pattern with the aim of pointing out to the possible extrapolation to all dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to explore the thermodynamic topology of topological charged dilatonic black holes. To achieve this, our study will begin by examining the characteristics of topological charged black holes in dilaton gravity. Specifically, we will concentrate on the impact of the topological constant on the event horizon of these black holes. Subsequently, we will analyze these black holes, considering their thermodynamic and conserved quantities, in order to assess the validity of the first law of thermodynamics. We explore the thermodynamic topology of these black holes by treating them as thermodynamic defects. For our study, we examine two types of thermodynamic ensembles: the fixed $q$ ensemble and the fixed $\phi$ ensemble. To study the impact of the topological constant ($% k$) on thermodynamic topology, we consider all possible types of curvature hypersurfaces that can form in these black holes. By calculating the topological charges at the defects within their thermodynamic spaces, we analyze both the local and global topology of these black holes. We also investigate how the parameters of dilaton gravity affect the thermodynamic topology of black holes and highlight the differences compared to charged black holes in the General Relativity.</description>

      <title>BTZ Black Hole In The Non-Extensive Generalizations of Gibbs Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics and thermodynamic geometry of the (2+1) dimensional charged rotating Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli(CR-BTZ) black hole within the framework of non-extensive generalizations of Gibbs entropy. We write down the Bekenstein-Hawking(BH) entropy of the black hole in terms of the non-extensive entropies namely: Kaniadakis entropy, Renyi entropy, Sharma-Mittal entropy, Tsallis-Cirto and Barrow entropy. We investigate their impact on the thermodynamic phase structure and geometry of the CR-BTZ black hole in four different ensembles namely: the fixed $(J,Q)$ ensemble, fixed $(\Omega,\Phi)$ ensemble, fixed $(J,\Phi)$ ensemble and the fixed $(\Omega,Q)$ ensemble where $ J, Q, \Omega$ and $ \Phi$ represent the angular momentum, electric charge, angular velocity and electric potential of the CR-BTZ black hole respectively. We investigate the Ruppeiner and geometrothermodynamic(GTD) geometries of the black hole for all the non-extensive entropy cases. We find that there are Davies type phase transitions in the CR-BTZ black hole for the Kaniadakis entropy case for all the above mentioned thermodynamic ensembles. These Davies type phase transitions were not seen in the BH entropy case. We also find that the Ruppeiner and the GTD scalar for the Kaniadakis entropy show curvature singularities corresponding to these Davies type phase transitions in the CR-BTZ black hole.</description>

      <title>Global Bases for Nonplanar Loop Integrands, Generalized Unitarity, and the Double Copy to All Loop Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a constructive method for defining a global loop-integrand basis for scattering amplitudes, encompassing both planar and nonplanar contributions. Our approach utilizes a graph-based framework to establish a well-defined, non-redundant basis of integrands. This basis, constructed from a chosen set of non-redundant graphs together with a selection of irreducible scalar products, provides clear insights into various physical properties of scattering amplitudes and proves useful in multiple contexts, such as on-shell Ward identities and manifesting gauge-choice independence. A key advantage of our integrand basis is its ability to streamline the generalized unitarity method. Specifically, we can directly read off the coefficients of basis elements without resorting to ansatze or solving linear equations. This novel approach allows us to lift generalized unitarity cuts -- expressed as products of tree amplitudes -- to loop-level integrands, facilitating the use of the tree-level double copy to generate complete gravitational integrands at any loop order. This method circumvents the difficulties in identifying complete higher-loop-order gauge-theory integrands that adhere to the color-kinematics duality. Additionally, our cut-based organization is well-suited for expansion in hard or soft limits, aiding in the exploration of ultraviolet or classical limits of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We embed Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes into $\mathcal{N} = 8$ gauged supergravity and study quadratic fluctuations around the black hole backgrounds of all fields in the larger theory. The equations of motion of the perturbations are partially diagonalized by the group theory of broken symmetry. Nearly all fields in theory have non-minimal couplings, so their equations of motion are not merely massive Klein-Gordon equations with minimal coupling to background gauge fields, and their analogues for fields with spin. In the special case of extremal black holes we identify specific modes of instability, some of which touch supersymmetric locus. For example, we identify scalar fields in supergravity that condense in the near horizon region and transition the black hole into a superconducting phase. We also identify supergravity modes that are susceptible to superradiant instability</description>

      <title>Generalized Tube Algebras, Symmetry-Resolved Partition Functions, and Twisted Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of generalized tube algebras which describe how finite, non-invertible global symmetries of bosonic 1+1d QFTs act on operators which sit at the intersection point of a collection of boundaries and interfaces. We develop a 2+1d symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) picture of boundaries and interfaces which, among other things, allows us to deduce the representation theory of these algebras. In particular, we initiate the study of a character theory, echoing that of finite groups, and demonstrate how many representation-theoretic quantities can be expressed as partition functions of the SymTFT on various backgrounds, which in turn can be evaluated explicitly in terms of generalized half-linking numbers. We use this technology to explain how the torus and annulus partition functions of a 1+1d QFT can be refined with information about its symmetries. We are led to a vast generalization of Ishibashi states in CFT: to any multiplet of conformal boundary conditions which transform into each other under the action of a symmetry, we associate a collection of generalized Ishibashi states, in terms of which the twisted sector boundary states of the theory and all of its orbifolds can be obtained as linear combinations. We derive a generalized Verlinde formula involving the characters of the boundary tube algebra which ensures that our formulas for the twisted sector boundary states respect open-closed duality. Our approach does not rely on rationality or the existence of an extended chiral algebra; however, in the special case of a diagonal RCFT with chiral algebra $V$ and modular tensor category $\mathscr{C}$, our formalism produces explicit closed-form expressions - in terms of the $F$-symbols and $R$-matrices of $\mathscr{C}$, and the characters of $V$ - for the twisted Cardy states, and the torus and annulus partition functions decorated by Verlinde lines.</description>

Abstract: We consider a higher derivative scalar field theory in the presence of a boundary and a classically marginal interaction. We first investigate the free limit where the scalar obeys the square of the Klein-Gordon equation. In precisely $d=6$ dimensions, modules generated by $d-2$ and $d-4$ dimensional primaries merge to form a staggered module. We compute the conformal block associated with this module and show that it is a generalized eigenvector of the Casimir operator. Next we include the effect of a classically marginal interaction that involves four scalar fields and two derivatives. The theory has an infrared fixed point in $d=6-{\epsilon}$ dimensions. We compute boundary operator anomalous dimensions and boundary OPE coefficients at leading order in the ${\epsilon}$ expansion for the allowed conformal boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: We build up the notion of metallic holography for $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs in four dimensions, in the presence of a finite $U(1)$ chemical potential. We compute two point correlation functions and study their properties in the regime of low frequency and low momentum. The color sector reveals gapless excitations, one of which propagates with a finite phase velocity while the other mode attenuates through scattering. The flavour sector, on the other hand, reveals spectrum that contains quasiparticle excitations which propagate with a definite phase velocity together with modes that propagate with a finite group velocity which quantum attenuates quite similar in spirit as that of Landau's zero sound modes. We also compute associated AC conductivities, which exhibit different characteristics for different (color and flavour) sectors of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are two ways to quantize free (gaussian) theory in strong background fields. In one of them, which we refer to as the Heisenberg approach, the mode functions are defined once and for entire space-time. In this approach there is no any apparent presence of an initial Cauchy surface. Another method, which we refer to as the Schrodinger approach, assumes the presence of the initial Cauchy surface on which one defines a spatial basis of modes and only then considers the evolution of the creation and annihilation operators in time with the use of the (free) Hamiltonian. The first method usually used to respect the symmetries of the problem (e.g. isometry of the de Sitter space-time), while in the second method the isometry is apparently broken by the presence of the initial Cauchy surface. In this paper we compare the two methods of quantization and find conditions under which they give the same result.</description>

      <title>Bound States and Particle Production by Breather-Type Background Field Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction of fermion fields with oscillating domain walls, inspired by breather-type solutions of the sine-Gordon equation, a nonlinear system of fundamental importance. Our study focuses on the fermionic bound states and particle production induced by a time-dependent scalar background field. The fermions couple to two domain walls undergoing harmonic motion, and we explore the resulting dynamics of the fermionic wave functions. We demonstrate that while fermions initially form bound states around the domain walls, the energy provided by the oscillatory motion of the scalar field induces an outward flux of fermions and antifermions, leading to particle production and eventual flux propagation toward spatial infinity. Through numerical simulations, we observe that the fermion density exhibits quasiperiodic behavior, with partial recurrences of the bound state configurations after each oscillation period. However, the fermion wave functions do not remain localized, and over time, the density decreases as more particles escape the vicinity of the domain walls. Our results highlight that the sine-Gordon-like breather background, when coupled non-supersymmetrically to fermions, does not preserve integrability or stability, with the oscillations driving a continuous energy transfer into the fermionic modes. This study sheds light on the challenges of maintaining steady-state fermion solutions in time-dependent topological backgrounds and offers insights into particle production mechanisms in nonlinear dynamical systems with oscillating solitons.</description>

      <title>Strings and membranes from $\mathcal{A}$-theory five brane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\mathcal{A}$-theory takes U-duality symmetry as a guiding principle, with the SL(5) U-duality symmetry being described as the world-volume theory of a 5-brane. Furthermore, by unifying the 6-dimensional world-volume Lorentz symmetry with the SL(5) spacetime symmetry, it extends to SL(6) U-duality symmetry. The SL(5) spacetime vielbein fields and the 5-brane world-volume vielbein fields are mixed under the SL(6) U-duality transformation. We demonstrate that consistent sectionings of the SL(6) $\mathcal{A}$5-brane world-volume Lagrangian yield Lagrangians of the ${\cal T}$-string with O(D,D) T-duality symmetry, the conventional string, the $\mathcal{M}$5-brane with GL(4) duality symmetry, and the non-perturbative M2-brane in supergravity theory. The GL(4) covariant Lagrangian of the $\mathcal{M}$5-brane derived in this manner is a new, perturbatively quantizable theory.</description>

      <title>Spin One Matter Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown how spin one vector matter fields can be coupled to a Yang-Mills theory. Such matter fields are defined as belonging to a representation $R$ of this Yang-Mills gauge algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. It is also required that these fields together with the original gauge fields be the gauge fields of an embedding total gauge algebra $\mathfrak{g}_{\rm tot}$. The existence of a physically consistent Yang-Mills action for the total algebra is finally required. These conditions are rather restrictive, as shown in some examples: non-trivial solutions may or may not exist depending on the choice of the original algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and of the representation $R$. The case of the initial algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ = $\mathfrak{u}(1)\oplus\mathfrak{su}(2)$ is treated in more detail.</description>

      <title>A Note on Kinematic Flow and Differential Equations for Two-Site One-Loop Graph in FRW Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the canonical differential equations governing the two-site one-loop wavefunction coefficient in conformally-coupled scalar theory within a general FRW cosmology. By employing relative twisted cohomology and integration by parts, we systematically derive these equations, providing a solid foundation for further analysis. Notably, we extend the kinematic flow framework to the loop level for the first time, efficiently deriving the differential equations through a graphical approach using family trees generated by tubing graphs, which are associated with the singularities of the system. In addition, we provide a preliminary discussion on higher-loop cases, laying the groundwork for future exploration of more complex scenarios. This methodology offers valuable insights into the dynamical behavior of the differential system for the loop-level cosmological wavefunction coefficient.</description>

      <title>Classical eikonal from Magnus expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a classical scattering problem, the classical eikonal is defined as the generator of the canonical transformation that maps in-states to out-states. It can be regarded as the classical limit of the log of the quantum S-matrix. In a classical analog of the Born approximation in quantum mechanics, the classical eikonal admits an expansion in oriented tree graphs, where oriented edges denote retarded/advanced worldline propagators. The Magnus expansion, which takes the log of a time-ordered exponential integral, offers an efficient method to compute the coefficients of the tree graphs to all orders. We exploit a Hopf algebra structure behind the Magnus expansion to develop a fast algorithm which can compute the tree coefficients up to the 12th order (over half a million trees) in less than an hour. In a relativistic setting, our methods can be applied to the post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion for gravitational binaries. We demonstrate the methods by computing the 3PM eikonal and find agreement with previous results based on amplitude methods.</description>

      <title>UV Effects and Short-Lived Hawking Radiation: Alternative Resolution of Information Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This chapter suggests an alternative solution to the black-hole information paradox by proposing that Hawking radiation ceases around the scrambling time due to trans-Planckian effects inherent in string theory. We consider two toy models in the literature that incorporate stringy effects. The first model utilizes the generalized uncertainty principle, which introduces a minimal length. The second model is inspired by string field theory, where interactions are exponentially suppressed in the UV limit. Both models indicate an early termination of Hawking radiation around the scrambling time, resulting in negligible evaporated energy and a predominantly classical black hole.</description>

Abstract: We explore a wider theoretical framework that has quantum field theory built-in, taking the fact that quantum mechanics is reconstructed from quantum field theory as a hint. We formulate a quantum theory with an embedded structure by introducing functional operators, and we find that it could describe the level II multiverse. Topics related to a beginning of the universe such as inflation, the third quantization and the landscape are discussed in our formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher curvature f(R) gravity theories are often plagued with Ostragadsky instability. In this work we show that such instability manifests itself in the corresponding dual scalar tensor theory in the scalar sector Lagrangian. We explicitly demonstrate the correspondence between the instabilities that appear in an $f(R)$ model and its corresponding scalar tensor theory. Considering various forms of f(R) gravity this feature is illustrated for different choices of the parameters of the theory.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical quantization of M5 brane probes wrapped on $\textrm{AdS}_3\times S^3$ and defect anomalies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two supersymmetric M5 brane probe solutions in $\textrm{AdS}_7 \times S^4$ and one in $\textrm{AdS}_4 \times S^7$ that all have the $\textrm{AdS}_3 \times S^3$ world-volume geometry. The values of the classical action of the first two M5 probes (with $S^3$ in $\textrm{AdS}_7$ or in $S^4$) are related to the leading $N^2$ parts in the anomaly b-coefficient in the (2,0) theory corresponding to a spherical surface defect in symmetric or antisymmetric $SU(N)$ representations. We present a detailed computation of the corresponding one-loop M5 brane partition functions finding that they vanish (in a particular regularization). This implies the vanishing of the order $N^0$ part in the b-anomaly coefficients, in agreement with earlier predictions for their exact values. It remains, however, a puzzle of how to reproduce the non-vanishing order $N$ terms in these coefficients within the semiclassical M5-brane probe setup.</description>

For the near horizon boundary conditions we comment solutions from several projectors from Chern-Simons to the metric formulation. These solutions are generalized BTZ solutions for our theories. We also study the classification according to $so(3,2)$ one parameter subgroups for obtained solutions.</description>

      <title>Ordinary modules for vertex algebras of $\mathfrak{osp}_{1|2n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.08188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the affine vertex superalgebra $V^k(\mathfrak{osp}_{1|2n})$ at generic level $k$ embeds in the equivariant $\mathcal W$-algebra of $\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$ times $4n$ free fermions. This has two corollaries: (1) it provides a new proof that for generic $k$, the coset $\text{Com}(V^k(\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}), V^k(\mathfrak{osp}_{1|2n}))$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal W^\ell(\mathfrak{sp}_{2n})$ for $\ell = -(n+1) + \frac{k+n+1}{2k+2n+1}$, and (2) we obtain the decomposition of ordinary $V^k(\mathfrak{osp}_{1|2n})$-modules into $V^k(\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}) \otimes \mathcal W^\ell(\mathfrak{sp}_{2n})$-modules. Next, if $k$ is an admissible level and $\ell$ is a non-degenerate admissible level for $\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$, we show that the simple algebra $L_k(\mathfrak{osp}_{1|2n})$ is an extension of the simple subalgebra $L_k(\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}) \otimes {\mathcal W}_{\ell}(\mathfrak{sp}_{2n})$. Using the theory of vertex superalgebra extensions, we prove that the category of ordinary $L_k(\mathfrak{osp}_{1|2n})$-modules is a semisimple, rigid vertex tensor supercategory with only finitely many inequivalent simple objects. It is equivalent to a certain subcategory of $\mathcal W_\ell(\mathfrak{sp}_{2n})$-modules. A similar result also holds for the category of Ramond twisted modules. Due to a recent theorem of Robert McRae, we get as a corollary that categories of ordinary $L_k(\mathfrak{sp}_{2n})$-modules are rigid.</description>

      <title>The first variation of the matter energy-momentum tensor with respect to the metric, and its implications on modified gravity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first order variation of the matter energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu \nu}$ with respect to the metric tensor $g^{\alpha \beta}$ plays an important role in modified gravity theories with geometry-matter coupling, and in particular in the $f(R,T)$ modified gravity theory. We obtain the expression of the variation $\delta T_{\mu \nu}/\delta g^{\alpha \beta}$ for the baryonic matter described by an equation given in a parametric form, with the basic thermodynamic variables represented by the particle number density, and by the specific entropy, respectively. The first variation of the matter energy-momentum tensor turns out to be independent on the matter Lagrangian, and can be expressed in terms of the pressure, the energy-momentum tensor itself, and the matter fluid four-velocity. We apply the obtained results for the case of the $f(R,T)$ gravity theory, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar, and $T$ is the trace of the matter energy-momentum tensor, which thus becomes a unique theory, also independent on the choice of the matter Lagrangian. A simple cosmological model, in which the Hilbert-Einstein Lagrangian is generalized through the addition of a term proportional to $T^n$ is considered in detail, and it is shown that it gives a very good description of the observational values of the Hubble parameter up to a redshift of $z\approx 2.5$.</description>

      <title>Isolated zero mode in a quantum computer from a duality twist</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02387v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating the interplay of dualities, generalized symmetries, and topological defects beyond theoretical models is an important challenge in condensed matter physics and quantum materials. A simple model exhibiting this physics is the transverse-field Ising model, which can host atopological defect that performs the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. When acting on one point in space, this duality defect imposes the duality twisted boundary condition and binds a single zero mode. This zero mode is unusual as it lacks a localized partner in the same $Z_2$ sector and has an infinite lifetime, even in finite systems. Using Floquet driving of a closed Ising chain with a duality defect, we generate this zero mode in a digital quantum computer. We detect the mode by measuring its associated persistent autocorrelation function using an efficient sampling protocol and a compound strategy for error mitigation. We also show that the zero mode resides at the domain wall between two regions related by a Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. Finally, we highlight the robustness of the isolated zero mode to integrability- and symmetry-breaking perturbations. Our findings provide a method for exploring exotic topological defects, associated with noninvertible generalized symmetries, in digitized quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Generalized symmetries in singularity-free nonlinear $\sigma$ models and their disordered phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear $\sigma$-model in ${(d+1)}$-dimensional spacetime with connected target space $K$ and show that, at energy scales below singular field configurations (such as vortices), it has an emergent non-invertible higher symmetry. The symmetry defects of the emergent symmetry are described by the $d$-representations of a discrete $d$-group $\mathbb{G}^{(d)}$ (i.e. the emergent symmetry is the dual of the invertible $d$-group $\mathbb{G}^{(d)}$ symmetry). The $d$-group $\mathbb{G}^{(d)}$ is determined such that its classifying space $B\mathbb{G}^{(d)}$ is given by the $d$-th Postnikov stage of $K$. In $(2+1)$D and for finite $\mathbb{G}^{(2)}$, this symmetry is always holo-equivalent to an invertible ${0}$-form (ordinary) symmetry with potential 't Hooft anomaly. The singularity-free disordered phase of the nonlinear $\sigma$-model spontaneously breaks this symmetry, and when $\mathbb{G}^{(d)}$ is finite, it is described by the deconfined phase of $\mathbb{G}^{(d)}$ higher gauge theory. We consider examples of such disordered phases. We focus on a singularity-free $S^2$ nonlinear $\sigma$-model in ${(3+1)}$D and show that it has an emergent non-invertible higher symmetry. As a result, its disordered phase is described by axion electrodynamics and has two gapless modes corresponding to a photon and a massless axion. Notably, this non-perturbative result is different from the results obtained using the $S^N$ and $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ nonlinear $\sigma$-models in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Updated Big Bang Nucleosynthesis Bounds on Long-lived Particles from Dark Sectors</title>

Abstract: As electromagnetic showers may alter the abundance of Helium, Lithium, and Deuterium, we can place severe constraints on the lifetime and amount of electromagnetic energy injected by long-lived particles. Considering up-to-date measurements of the light element abundances that point to $Y_p=0.245\pm 0.003$, $({\rm D/H})= (2.527\pm 0.03)\times 10^{-5}$, and the baryon-to-photon ratio obtained from the Cosmic Microwave Background data, $\eta=6.104 \times 10^{-10}$, we derive upper limits on the fraction of electromagnetic energy produced by long-lived particles. Our findings apply to decaying dark matter models, long-lived gravitinos, and other non-thermal processes that occurred in the early universe between $10^2-10^{10}$ seconds.</description>

      <title>Fermionic UV models for neutral triple gauge boson vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searches for anomalous neutral triple gauge boson couplings (NTGCs) provide important tests for the gauge structure of the standard model. In SMEFT ("standard model effective field theory") NTGCs appear only at the level of dimension-8 operators. While the phenomenology of these operators has been discussed extensively in the literature, renormalizable UV models that can generate these operators are scarce. In this work, we study a variety of extensions of the SM with heavy fermions and calculate their matching to d = 8 NTGC operators. We point out that the complete matching of UV models requires four different CP-conserving d = 8 operators and that the single CPC d = 8 operator, most commonly used by the experimental collaborations, does not describe all possible NTGC form factors. Despite stringent experimental constraints on NTGCs, limits on the scale of UV models are relatively weak, because their contributions are doubly suppressed (being d = 8 and 1-loop). We suggest a series of benchmark UV scenarios suitable for interpreting searches for NTGCs in the upcoming LHC runs, obtain their current limits and provide estimates for the expected sensitivity of the high-luminosity LHC.</description>

      <title>Aligned Yet Large Dipoles: a SMEFT Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a non-universal flavor scenario at the level of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, according to which the matrix of Wilson coefficients $c_{uW}$ of an up-type electroweak quark dipole operator is aligned with the up-type Yukawa coupling. Such an alignment usually follows from the assumption of Minimal Flavor Violation (MFV), away from which we step by allowing the entries of $c_{uW}$ to be sizable along the first quark generations. A particular example, which we refer to as ``inverse hierarchy MFV", features Wilson coefficients inversely proportional to quark masses, and arises from BSM models respecting MFV and containing heavy fields that replicate the mass hierarchy of SM quarks. We then analyze the phenomenology driven by $c_{uW}$ at colliders and at lower-energy flavor experiments. We show that precision measurements of the process $pp\rightarrow W h\rightarrow \gamma\gamma\ell\nu$ at FCC-$hh$ could set an upper bound on $|c_{uW}|\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})(\Lambda/{\rm TeV})^{2}$, with $\Lambda$ the cutoff of the effective field theory. This bound is an order of magnitude stronger than the existing LHC bounds. Moreover, we estimate that $W h\rightarrow b\bar b \ell\nu$ at HL-LHC could also give competitive bounds. In the low-energy regime, we consider bounds arising from rare kaon decays, which turn out to be loose, $|c_{uW}^{11}|&lt;\mathcal{O}(1)(\Lambda/{\rm TeV})^{2}$. We finally demonstrate that our flavor and operator assumptions can be derived from a weakly-coupled UV model, which we choose to simultaneously illustrate the UV origin of inverse hierarchy MFV.</description>

      <title>Most general Type-D Black Hole and the Accelerating Reissner-Nordstrom-NUT-(A)dS solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Plebanski-Demianski metric is commonly thought to describe the most general Type D black hole in general relativity (possibly coupled with Maxwell electromagnetism), but in the form we know at the moment, it fails to include the elusive accelerating spacetimes with gravitomagnetic mass without angular momentum. We propose a very general type D metric, stemming from a binary black hole system, which represents a novel branch of the type D spacetimes: accelerating Kerr-Newman-NUT black hole with cosmological constant. It has straightforward limits to all the known type D black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell theory and in particular to the accelerating Reissner-Nordstrom-NUT solution, yet unknown in the literature.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario in a type II minimally modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The idea of a rapid sign-switching cosmological constant (mirror AdS-dS transition) in the late universe at $z\sim1.7$, known as the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, has significantly improved the fit to observational data and provides a promising scenario for alleviating major cosmological tensions, such as the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. However, in the absence of a fully predictive model, implementing this fit required conjecturing that the dynamics of the linear perturbations are governed by general relativity. Recent work embedding the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model with the Lagrangian of a type II minimally modified gravity known as VCDM has propelled $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM to a fully predictive model, removing the uncertainty related to the aforementioned assumption; we call this new model $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM. In this work, we demonstrate that not only does $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM fit the data better than the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, but the new model, $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM, performs even better in alleviating cosmological tensions while also providing a better fit to the data, including CMB, BAO, SNe Ia, and cosmic shear measurements. Our findings highlight the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM framework, particularly the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM model, as a compelling alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, especially by successfully alleviating the $H_0$ tension. Additionally, these models predict higher values for $\sigma_8$, indicating enhanced structuring, albeit with lower present-day matter density parameter values and consequently reduced $S_8$ values, alleviating the $S_8$ tension as well. This demonstrates that the data are well fit by a combination of background and linear perturbations, both having dynamics differing from those of $\Lambda$CDM. This paves the way for further exploration of new ways for embedding the sign-switching cosmological constant into other models.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes are crucial in understanding the ringdown phase after a merger. While for Kerr black holes these modes have been known for a long time, their calculation has remained a challenge in alternative theories of gravity. We obtain the spectrum of quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton theory without resorting to perturbation theory in the coupling constant. Our approach is based on a spectral decomposition of the linear perturbations of the metric and the scalar field. The quasinormal modes agree excellently with the perturbatively known slow rotation and weak coupling limits. For large coupling, though, the spectrum changes significantly.</description>

      <title>Fundamental physical constants, operation of physical phenomena and entropy increase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03773v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approaching the problem of understanding fundamental physical constants (FPCs) started with discussing the role these constants play in high-energy nuclear physics and astrophysics. Condensed matter physics was relatively unexplored in this regard. More recently, it was realised that FPCs set lower or upper bounds on key condensed matter properties. Here, we discuss a much wider role played by FPCs in condensed matter physics: at given environmental conditions, FPCs set the observability and operation of entire physical effects and phenomena. We discuss structural and superconducting phase transitions and transitions between different states of matter, with implications for life processes. We also discuss metastable states, transitions between them, chemical reactions and their products. A byproduct of this discussion is that the order of magnitude of the transition temperature can be calculated from FPCs only. We show that the new states emerging as a result of various transitions increase the phase space and entropy. Were FPCs to take different values, these transitions would become inoperative at our environmental conditions and the new states due to these transitions would not emerge. This suggests that the current values of FPCs, by enabling various transitions and reactions which give rise to new states, promote entropy increase. Based on this entropy increase and the associated increase of statistical probability, we conjecture that entropy increase is a selection principle for FPCs considered to be variable in earlier discussions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16283v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of high-energy events can take place in the seconds leading up to a binary neutron-star merger. Mechanisms involving tidal resonances, electrodynamic interactions, or shocks in mass-loaded wakes have been proposed as instigators of these precursors. With a view of gravitational-wave and multimessenger astrophysics more broadly, premerger observations and theory are reviewed emphasising how gamma-ray precursors and dynamical tides can constrain the neutron-star equation of state, thermodynamic microphysics, and evolutionary pathways. Connections to post-merger phenomena, notably gamma-ray bursts, are discussed together with how magnetic fields, spin and misalignment, crustal elasticity, and stratification gradients impact observables.</description>

      <title>Magnetogenesis from axion-SU(2) inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a novel proposal for inflationary magnetogenesis by identifying the non-Abelian sector of Spectator Chromo Natural Inflation (SCNI) with the $\rm{SU(2)}_{\rm L}$ sector of the Standard Model. This mechanism relies on the recently discovered attractor of SCNI in the strong backreaction regime, where the gauge fields do not decay on super-horizon scales and their backreaction leads to a stable new trajectory for the rolling axion field. The large super-horizon gauge fields are partly transformed after the electroweak phase transition into electromagnetic fields. The strength and correlation length of the resulting helical magnetic fields depend on the inflationary Hubble scale and the details of the SCNI sector. For suitable parameter choices we show that the strength of the resulting magnetic fields having correlation lengths around $1\, {\rm {Mpc}}$ are consistent with the required intergalactic magnetic fields for explaining the spectra of high energy $\gamma$ rays from distant blazars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photons impinging on strong electromagnetic fields can change both momentum and helicity state, due to quantum vacuum polarisation. We investigate these effects in the collision of photons with impulsive PP-waves, which describe e.g. the fields of ultra-boosted charge distributions. We connect our results to vacuum birefringence and quantum reflection in both QED and SUSY QED. We also compare with helicity flip in plane wave backgrounds, exploring how and when known tree-level relations, relating amplitudes in PP-waves and in plane waves, extend to one-loop corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime with weakly nonminimally coupled monopole charge. We analytically and numerically investigate light ray propagation around such a black hole by employing the common Lagrangian formalism. Our analysis encompasses both radial and angular geodesics, for which we present analytical solutions in terms of incomplete Lauricella hypergeometric functions. Additionally, we explore the impact of the coupling constant on geodesic motion. Based on observations from the Event Horizon Telescope, we constrain the black hole parameters, resulting in a coupling constant range of $-0.5\lesssim \alpha\lesssim 0.5$. Throughout our analysis, we simulate all possible trajectories and, where necessary, perform numerical inversion of the included integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a scalar counterpart of the Schwarzschild-Melvin Universe was reported [arXiv:2410.02851]. We show this solution is a special case of a Schwarzschild black hole/mass in a scalar multipolar Universe, that can be constructed algebraically combining known vacuum solutions. This builds on the generalized Weyl construction for scalar-vacuum, that admits two, fully decoupled, independent harmonic functions: one for the gravitational sector and another for the scalar sector. Harmonic solutions with growing multipoles lead to naked singularities (at spatial infinity), including for the scalar counterpart of the Schwarzschild-Melvin; harmonic solutions with decaying (scalar) multipoles are asymptotically flat, but have a singular horizon, in accordance with no-scalar-hair theorems. The scalar-vacuum model can be mapped to a five dimensional pure gravity construction via Kaluza-Klein oxidization and, in this way, to the corresponding $D=5$ generalized Weyl construction.</description>

      <title>Probing the QCD Critical End Point with Finite-Size Scaling of Net-Baryon Cumulant Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) critical end point (CEP) is a central focus in heavy-ion physics, as it provides insights into the phase structure of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions. Finite-size scaling (FSS) analysis is applied to explore the critical behavior of cumulant ratios \( C_2/C_1 \), \( C_3/C_2 \), \( C_4/C_2 \), \( C_3/C_1 \), and \( C_4/C_1 \), measured in Au+Au collisions across the Beam Energy Scan (BES) range of 7.7 to 200 GeV. The inferred CEP from the FSS analysis is located at \(\sqrt{s}_{\text{CEP}} \approx 33.0 \, \text{GeV}\), corresponding to \( \mu_{B,\text{CEP}} \approx 130 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( T_{\text{CEP}} \approx 158.5 \, \text{MeV}\), as derived from the freeze-out curve. The scaling functions for these cumulant ratios reveal non-monotonic patterns, where critical fluctuations manifest as distinct scaling behaviors. Specifically, the FSS analysis demonstrates upward divergence of \( C_2/C_1 \) and \( C_4/C_1 \), and downward divergence of \( C_3/C_2 \) and \( C_4/C_2 \), consistent with theoretical expectations for critical dynamics near the CEP. These findings validate the robustness of these cumulant ratios as effective probes for critical phenomena, offering structured evidence for the inferred CEP in QCD matter.</description>

Abstract: Relations between the graviton mass and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ have led to some interesting implications. We show that in any approach which leads to a direct correlation between the graviton mass and $\Lambda$, either through direct substitution of gravitational coupling in dispersion relations or through the linearization of Einstein equations with massive spin-2 fields, the Compton wavelength of the graviton lies in the superhorizon scale. As a result any gravitational approaches where the graviton mass is related directly to the cosmological constant are of no observational significance.</description>
