      <title>On the computation of moments in the Super-Transition-Arrays model for radiative opacity calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Super-Transition-Array statistical method for the computation of radiative opacity of hot dense matter, the moments of the absorption or emission features involve partition functions with reduced degeneracies, occurring through the calculation of averages of products of subshell populations. In the present work, we discuss several aspects of the computation of such peculiar partition functions, insisting on the precautions that must be taken in order to avoid numerical difficulties. In a previous work, we derived a formula for supershell partition functions, which takes the form of a functional of the distribution of energies within the supershell and allows for fast and accurate computations, truncating the number of terms in the expansion. The latter involves coefficients for which we obtained a recursion relation and an explicit formula. We show that such an expansion can be combined with the recurrence relation for shifted partition functions. We also propose, neglecting the effect of fine structure as a first step, a positive-definite formula for the Super-Transition-Array moments of any order, providing an insight into the asymmetry and sharpness of the latter. The corresponding formulas are free of alternating sums. Several ways to speed up the calculations are also presented.</description>

      <title>Coherent XUV super continuum emission from atomic bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent supercontinuum radiation in the extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) range is indispensable for synthesizing attosecond light pulses and for exploring transient atomic structures. Here, we report the striking observations of coherent XUV supercontinuum (XSC) extended from below to far above the ionization threshold, which exhibits completely different temporal and spatial properties comparing to the conventional rescattering induced high harmonic generation (HHG). We demonstrate that the strong-field created coherence among bound orbitals strongly distort the atomic transition energies during the pulse, leading to coherent emission spanning tens of electron-volts, in contrast to the line emission via free-induction decay occurring after the pulse. The supposed non-radiating bound dark states contribute as well by emitting dressed energy through dark-to-bright emission mechanism. All the processes modulated at sub-cycle time scale jointly form this new-type coherent XSC. This work achieves the strong-field attosecond control of the exotic atomic radiation dynamics and provides the means of simultaneous generation of separated attosecond sources, i.e., XSC and HHG, with potential advancing attosecond interferometry.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Enhanced Superradiance of a Ryderg-Atom Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the superradiant phase transition of an array of Rydberg atoms in a dissipative microwave cavity. Under the interplay of the cavity field and the long-range Rydberg interaction, the steady state of the system exhibits an interaction-enhanced superradiance, with vanishing critical atom-cavity coupling rates at a discrete set of interaction strengths. We find that, while the phenomenon can be analytically understood in the case of constant all-to-all interaction, the enhanced superradiance persists under the spatially dependent dipolar interaction, but shifted in the critical interaction strengths. The diverging susceptibility at these critical points is captured by emergent quantum Rabi models, each of which comprises a pair of collective atomic states with different numbers of atomic excitations. These collective states become degenerate at the critical interaction strengths, resulting in a superradiant phase for an arbitrarily small atom-cavity coupling.</description>

      <title>Time-Resolved Rubidium-Assisted Electron Capture by Barium (II) Cation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-local energy transfer between bound electronic states close to the ionisation threshold is employed for efficient state preparation in dilute atom systems from technological foundations to quantum computing. The generalisation to electronic transitions into and out of the continuum is lacking quantum simulations necessary to motivate such potential experiments. Here, we present the first development of a electron-dynamical model simulating fully three-dimensional atomic systems for this purpose. We investigate the viability of this model for the prototypical case of recombination of ultracold barium(II) by environment-assisted electron capture thanks to a rubidium atom in its vicinity. Both atomic sites are modelled as effective one-electron systems using the Multi Configuration Time Dependent Hartree (MCTDH) algorithm and can transfer energy by dipole-dipole interaction. We find that the simulations are robust enough to realise assisted capture over a dilute interatomic distance which we are able to quantify by comparing to simulations without interatomic energy exchange. For our current parameters not yet optimised for reaction likelihood, an environment-ionising assisted capture has a probability of $1.9\times10^{-5}~\%$ over the first $15~\mathrm{fs}$ of the simulation. The environment-exciting assisted-capture path to $[\text{Ba}^{+*}\text{Rb}^{*}]$ appears as a stable long-lived intermediate state with a probability of $8.2\times10^{-4}~\%$ for at least $20~\mathrm{fs}$ after the capture has been completed. This model shows potential to predict optimised parameters as well as to accommodate the conditions present in experimental systems as closely as possible. We put the presented setup forward as a suitable first step to experimentally realise environment-assisted electron capture with current existing technologies.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limits on anomalous energy flows in correlated quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical thermodynamics energy always flows from the hotter system to the colder one. However, if these systems are initially correlated, the energy flow can reverse, making the cold system colder and the hot system hotter. This intriguing phenomenon is called ``anomalous energy flow'' and shows the importance of initial correlations in determining physical properties of thermodynamic systems. Here we investigate the fundamental limits of this effect. Specifically, we find the optimal amount of energy that can be transferred between quantum systems under closed and reversible dynamics, which then allows us to characterize the anomalous energy flow. We then explore a more general scenario where the energy flow is mediated by an ancillary quantum system that acts as a catalyst. We show that this approach allows for exploiting previously inaccessible types of correlations, ultimately resulting in an energy transfer that surpasses our fundamental bound. To demonstrate these findings, we use a well-studied quantum optics setup involving two atoms coupled to an optical cavity.</description>
