      <title>The Casimir Effect in Non-Abelian Gauge Theories on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present non-perturbative results of the Casimir potential in non-abelian gauge theories in (2+1)D and (3+1)D for SU(2) and SU(3) in the confined and deconfined phases. For the first time, geometries beyond parallel plates in (3+1)D SU($N_c)$ are explored, and we show that the Casimir effect for the symmetrical and asymmetrical tube and box is attractive. The result for the tube is contrary to the weakly coupled, massless non-interacting scalar field theory result where a repulsive Casimir force, described by a negative slope of the potential, is measured in this geometry. We propose various techniques that can be used to account for the energy contributions from creating the boundaries in the geometry of a tube and box where the size of the faces forming the walls of the geometries changes with separation distance. We show that increasing the temperature from a confined to a deconfined phase does not alter the measured potential and we motivate for this observation by showing that the masses of the particles in the Casimir interactions are lower than the lowest glueball mass, $M_{0^{++}}$ in the pure gauge ground state, thus suggesting that the region inside the geometries is a boundary-induced deconfined phase. Through the measured expectation value of the Polyakov loop, we propose that the Casimir effect for the asymmetrical tube in the large separation distance limit $R\to \infty$ should be equivalent to that of the parallel plate geometry at smallest separation distance, while the asymmetrical box in the same limit should be equivalent to the symmetrical tube at the smallest separation distance.</description>

      <title>Pole-Expansion of Two-Hadron Imaginary-Time Correlation Function -a new method of analysis for unstable states in lattice QCD-</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the pole expansion of the two-hadron imaginary-time correlation function. We first explain the general idea that the imaginary-time correlation function is expressed as a sum of the pole terms, the Mittag-Leffler expansion, in terms of the uniformization variable, which makes the S-matrix single-valued. We then derive explicit expressions of the pole expansion for the single-channel ($\rho$ meson) and two-channel ($\Lambda(1405)$) examples and demonstrate that the pole expansion actually holds employing phenomenological models, the vector-dominance model for the $\rho$ meson and the chiral unitary model for $\Lambda(1405)$. From this observation we propose the pole expansion as a method to extract information of unstable states such as masses and widths from the two-hadron imaginary-time correlation functions obtained by lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Multi-nucleon matrix elements on the lattice with the Feynman-Hellmann theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the first calculation of the lowest moment of the forward Compton structure function $\mathcal{F}_2$ for a multi-nucleon deuteron-like state using Feynman-Hellmann lattice QCD techniques. Using this result as a prototypical example, we chart a course for the systematic study of multi-nucleon structure by building on techniques developed to optimise the computation of the factorially increasing number of Wick contraction terms required to calculate multi-nucleon matrix elements via lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>O(5) multicriticality in the 3D two flavor SU(2) lattice gauge Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the multicritical behavior of the three dimensional lattice system in which a SU(2) gauge field is coupled to two flavors of scalar fields transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. In this system a multicritical point is present, where the global symmetry O(2)$\oplus$O(3) gets enlarged to O(5). Such a symmetry enlargement is hindered for generic systems by the instability of the O(5) multicritical point, but the SU(2) gauge symmetry prevents the appearance of the term triggering the instability. All the numerical results obtained in this lattice gauge model fully support the expectations coming from the O(2)$\oplus$O(3) multicritical Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\phi^4$ theory, and we discuss possible implications of these results for some models of deconfined quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum simulations of scattering in quantum field theories using W states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy particle collisions can convert energy into matter through the inelastic production of new particles. Quantum computers are an ideal platform for simulating the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the collision and the formation of the subsequent many-particle state. In this work, evidence for inelastic particle production is observed in one-dimensional Ising field theory using IBM's quantum computers. The scattering experiment is performed on 100 qubits of ibm_marrakesh and uses up to 6,412 two-qubit gates to access the post-collision dynamics. Integral to these simulations is a new quantum algorithm for preparing the initial state (wavepackets) of a quantum field theory scattering simulation. This method efficiently prepares wavepackets by extending recent protocols for creating W states with mid-circuit measurement and feedforward. The required circuit depth is independent of wavepacket size and spatial dimension, representing a superexponential improvement over previous methods. Our wavepacket preparation algorithm can be applied to a wide range of lattice models and is demonstrated in one-dimensional Ising field theory, scalar field theory, the Schwinger model, and two-dimensional Ising field theory.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic form factors of $\Omega^-$ with the meson cloud in the spacelike and timelike regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present comprehensive calculations of the electromagnetic form factors, including the charge, magnetic-dipole, electric-quadrupole and magnetic-octupole form factors, of the $\Omega^-$ in the spacelike region using the quark-diquark approach, incorporating the effect of the meson cloud. The obtained magnetic moment is in agreement with the experimental measurement and the electromagnetic radii are comparable with other model calculations. It is found that the meson cloud effect remains almost unchanged as the energy becomes high and this feature implies that the meson cloud should be considered in all the energy region. Moreover, the asymptotic relations allow us to extend the electromagnetic form factors from the spacelike region to the timelike region, and then the effective form factor is almost identical with the data from CLEO and BESIII. Finally, polarization properties of the final state $\Omega^-$ in the $e^+ e^- \rightarrow \Omega^- \bar{\Omega}^+$ process with the unpolarized initial states are also investigated.</description>

      <title>Minimal Autocorrelation in Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations using Exact Fourier Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is a ubiquitous method in computational physics with applications ranging from condensed matter to lattice QCD and beyond. However, HMC simulations often suffer from long autocorrelation times, severely reducing their efficiency. In this work two of the main sources of autocorrelations are identified and eliminated. The first source is the sampling of the canonical momenta from a sub-optimal normal distribution, the second is a badly chosen trajectory length. Analytic solutions to both problems are presented and implemented in the exact Fourier acceleration (EFA) method. It completely removes autocorrelations for near-harmonic potentials and consistently yields (close-to-) optimal results for numerical simulations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and the Ising models as well as in lattice gauge theory, in some cases reducing the autocorrelation by multiple orders of magnitude. EFA is advantageous for and easily applicable to any HMC simulation of an action that includes a quadratic part.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by L\"{u}scher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Critical Behaviour in the Single Flavor Thirring Model in 2+1$d$ with Wilson Kernel Domain Wall Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results of a lattice field theory simulation of the 2+1$d$ Thirring model with $N=1$ fermion flavors, using domain wall fermions. The model exhibits a U(2) symmetry-breaking phase transition with the potential to define a UV-stable renormalisation group fixed point. The novelty is the replacement of the Shamir kernel used in all previous work with the Wilson kernel, improving the action particularly with respect to the $L_s\to\infty$ limit needed to recover U(2), now under much better control. Auxiliary field ensembles generated on $16^3\times24$ with varying self-interaction strength $g^2$ and bare mass $m$ are used to measure the bilinear condensate order parameter $\langle\bar\psi i\gamma_3\psi\rangle$ with domain wall separations as large as $L_s=120$. The resulting $L_s\to\infty$ extrapolation is used to fit an empirical equation of state modelling spontaneous symmetry breaking as $m\to0$. The fit is remarkably stable and compelling, with the fitted critical exponents $\beta_m\simeq2.4$, $\delta\simeq1.3$ differing markedly from previous estimates. The associated susceptibility exhibits a mass hierarchy in line with physical expectations, again unlike previous estimates. Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE) solutions of the Thirring model exploiting a hidden local symmetry in the action are reviewed, and analytic predictions presented for the exponents. In contrast to all previous lattice studies, the universal characteristics of the critical point revealed qualitatively resemble the SDE predictions.</description>
