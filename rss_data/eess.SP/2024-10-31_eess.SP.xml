      <title>Power Modeling in mm-Wave and Terahertz CMOS Transmitters for Wireless Network-on-Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless Network-on-Chip (WNoC) systems, which interconnect chips using wireless links, face significant challenges in area and power consumption. To tackle these constraints, behavioral models (BMs) are crucial for assessing system performance under various conditions and optimizing parameters like data throughput and power consumption. Building transceivers (TRXs) physically is costly and time-consuming, making modeling a more practical approach. This paper develops a power consumption model for the sub-blocks of a WNoC transmitter (TX) at the chip level. By integrating these BMs with MATLAB, we aim to create a power model for TXs in WNoC architectures, optimized for CMOS technology operating at millimeter-wave and terahertz frequencies.</description>

      <title>Parameterized TDOA: Instantaneous TDOA Estimation and Localization for Mobile Targets in a Time-Division Broadcast Positioning System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization of mobile targets is a fundamental problem across various domains. One-way ranging-based downlink localization has gained significant attention due to its ability to support an unlimited number of targets and enable autonomous navigation by performing localization at the target side. Time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)-based methods are particularly advantageous as they obviate the need for target-anchor synchronization, unlike time-of-arrival (TOA)-based approaches. However, existing TDOA estimation methods inherently rely on the quasi-static assumption (QSA), which assumes that targets remain stationary during the measurement period, thereby limiting their applicability in dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a novel instantaneous TDOA estimation method for dynamic environments, termed Parameterized TDOA (P-TDOA). We first characterize the nonlinear, time-varying TDOA measurements using polynomial models and construct a system of linear equations for the model parameters through dedicated transformations, employing a novel successive time difference strategy (STDS). Subsequently, we solve the parameters with a weighted least squares (WLS) solution, thereby obtaining instantaneous TDOA estimates. Furthermore, we develop a mobile target localization approach that leverages instantaneous TDOA estimates from multiple anchor pairs at the same instant. Theoretical analysis shows that our proposed method can approach the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of instantaneous TDOA estimation and localization in concurrent TOA scenarios, despite actual TOA measurements being obtained sequentially. Extensive numerical simulations validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting its superiority over state-of-the-art approaches across various scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Peaceman-Rachford Splitting Approach with Deep Equilibrium Network for Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is pivotal for wireless systems, yet its high-dimensional, stochastic channel poses significant challenges for accurate estimation, highlighting the critical need for robust estimation techniques. In this paper, we introduce a novel channel estimation method for the MIMO system. The main idea is to construct a fixed-point equation for channel estimation, which can be implemented into the deep equilibrium (DEQ) model with a fixed network. Specifically, the Peaceman-Rachford (PR) splitting method is applied to the dual form of the regularized minimization problem to construct fixed-point equation with non-expansive property. Then, the fixed-point equation is implemented into the DEQ model with a fixed layer, leveraging its advantage of the low training complexity. Moreover, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, demonstrating the convergence and optimality of our approach. Additionally, simulations of hybrid far- and near-field channels demonstrate that our approach yields favorable results, indicating its ability to advance channel estimation in MIMO system.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learned Equalization in Cell-Free Massive MIMO via State-Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequence models have demonstrated the ability to perform tasks like channel equalization and symbol detection by automatically adapting to current channel conditions. This is done without requiring any explicit optimization and by leveraging not only short pilot sequences but also contextual information such as long-term channel statistics. The operating principle underlying automatic adaptation is in-context learning (ICL), an emerging property of sequence models. Prior art adopted transformer-based sequence models, which, however, have a computational complexity scaling quadratically with the context length due to batch processing. Recently, state-space models (SSMs) have emerged as a more efficient alternative, affording a linear inference complexity in the context size. This work explores the potential of SSMs for ICL-based equalization in cell-free massive MIMO systems. Results show that selective SSMs achieve comparable performance to transformer-based models while requiring approximately eight times fewer parameters and five times fewer floating-point operations.</description>

      <title>Fusion of Information in Multiple Particle Filtering in the Presence of Unknown Static Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important and often overlooked aspect of particle filtering methods is the estimation of unknown static parameters. A simple approach for addressing this problem is to augment the unknown static parameters as auxiliary states that are jointly estimated with the time-varying parameters of interest. This can be impractical, especially when the system of interest is high-dimensional. Multiple particle filtering (MPF) methods were introduced to try to overcome the curse of dimensionality by using a divide and conquer approach, where the vector of unknowns is partitioned into a set of subvectors, each estimated by a separate particle filter. Each particle filter weighs its own particles by using predictions and estimates communicated from the other filters. Currently, there is no principled way to implement MPF methods where the particle filters share unknown parameters or states. In this work, we propose a fusion strategy to allow for the sharing of unknown static parameters in the MPF setting. Specifically, we study the systems which are separable in states and observations. It is proved that optimal Bayesian fusion can be obtained for state-space models with non-interacting states and observations. Simulations are performed to show that MPF with fusion strategy can provide more accurate estimates within fewer time steps comparing to existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Network Games Induced Prior for Graph Topology Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning the graph topology of a complex network is challenging due to limited data availability and imprecise data models. A common remedy in existing works is to incorporate priors such as sparsity or modularity which highlight on the structural property of graph topology. We depart from these approaches to develop priors that are directly inspired by complex network dynamics. Focusing on social networks with actions modeled by equilibriums of linear quadratic games, we postulate that the social network topologies are optimized with respect to a social welfare function. Utilizing this prior knowledge, we propose a network games induced regularizer to assist graph learning. We then formulate the graph topology learning problem as a bilevel program. We develop a two-timescale gradient algorithm to tackle the latter. We draw theoretical insights on the optimal graph structure of the bilevel program and show that they agree with the topology in several man-made networks. Empirically, we demonstrate the proposed formulation gives rise to reliable estimate of graph topology.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Learning of Two-Stage Beamformers in Passive IRS-Assisted Systems with Inexact Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an efficient data-driven and model-free unsupervised learning algorithm for achieving fully passive intelligent reflective surface (IRS)-assisted optimal short/long-term beamforming in wireless communication networks. The proposed algorithm is based on a zeroth-order stochastic gradient ascent methodology, suitable for tackling two-stage stochastic nonconvex optimization problems with continuous uncertainty and unknown (or "black-box") terms present in the objective function, via the utilization of inexact evaluation oracles. We showcase that the algorithm can operate under realistic and general assumptions, and establish its convergence rate close to some stationary point of the associated two-stage (i.e., short/long-term) problem, particularly in cases where the second-stage (i.e., short-term) beamforming problem (e.g., transmit precoding) is solved inexactly using an arbitrary (inexact) oracle. The proposed algorithm is applicable on a wide variety of IRS-assisted optimal beamforming settings, while also being able to operate without (cascaded) channel model assumptions or knowledge of channel statistics, and over arbitrary IRS physical configurations; thus, no active sensing capability at the IRS(s) is needed. Our algorithm is numerically demonstrated to be very effective in a range of experiments pertaining to a well-studied MISO downlink model, including scenarios demanding physical IRS tuning (e.g., directly through varactor capacitances), even in large-scale regimes.</description>

      <title>Digital logic from high-efficiency superconducting diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in the realizations of superconducting diodes have pushed the diode coefficient $\eta$ towards its theoretical maximum of $\eta=1$. In this work, we describe the construction of logic gates NOT, AND, OR, NAND and NOR using superconducting diodes with $\eta\approx1$ by exploiting their dynamically tunable polarity. We then argue that fundamental theorems suppress $\eta$ in intrinsic superconductors, rendering them likely unsuitable for the proposed devices, and point out that several previous proposals and platforms, remarkably, bypassed this suppression unwittingly. We discuss the realization of the digital logic in one such platform -- Josephson triodes that yielded $\eta\approx1$ -- and argue that phases with spontaneous spatial or magnetic order can overcome some of its drawbacks. Thus, this work provides guiding principles for future platforms and develops the building blocks for superconductors-based digital electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some recent methods, like the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), propose to decompose a signal accordingly to its contained information. Even though its adaptability seems useful for many applications, the main issue with this approach is its lack of theory. This paper presents a new approach to build adaptive wavelets. The main idea is to extract the different modes of a signal by designing an appropriate wavelet filter bank. This construction leads us to a new wavelet transform, called the empirical wavelet transform. Many experiments are presented showing the usefulness of this method compared to the classic EMD.</description>

      <title>Towards Generative Ray Path Sampling for Faster Point-to-Point Ray Tracing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio propagation modeling is essential in telecommunication research, as radio channels result from complex interactions with environmental objects. Recently, Machine Learning has been attracting attention as a potential alternative to computationally demanding tools, like Ray Tracing, which can model these interactions in detail. However, existing Machine Learning approaches often attempt to learn directly specific channel characteristics, such as the coverage map, making them highly specific to the frequency and material properties and unable to fully capture the underlying propagation mechanisms. Hence, Ray Tracing, particularly the Point-to-Point variant, remains popular to accurately identify all possible paths between transmitter and receiver nodes. Still, path identification is computationally intensive because the number of paths to be tested grows exponentially while only a small fraction is valid. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning-aided Ray Tracing approach to efficiently sample potential ray paths, significantly reducing the computational load while maintaining high accuracy. Our model dynamically learns to prioritize potentially valid paths among all possible paths and scales linearly with scene complexity. Unlike recent alternatives, our approach is invariant with translation, scaling, or rotation of the geometry, and avoids dependency on specific environment characteristics.</description>

      <title>Improving snore detection under limited dataset through harmonic/percussive source separation and convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Snoring, an acoustic biomarker commonly observed in individuals with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS), holds significant potential for diagnosing and monitoring this recognized clinical disorder. Irrespective of snoring types, most snoring instances exhibit identifiable harmonic patterns manifested through distinctive energy distributions over time. In this work, we propose a novel method to differentiate monaural snoring from non-snoring sounds by analyzing the harmonic content of the input sound using harmonic/percussive sound source separation (HPSS). The resulting feature, based on the harmonic spectrogram from HPSS, is employed as input data for conventional neural network architectures, aiming to enhance snoring detection performance even under a limited data learning framework. To evaluate the performance of our proposal, we studied two different scenarios: 1) using a large dataset of snoring and interfering sounds, and 2) using a reduced training set composed of around 1% of the data material. In the former scenario, the proposed HPSS-based feature provides competitive results compared to other input features from the literature. However, the key advantage of the proposed method lies in the superior performance of the harmonic spectrogram derived from HPSS in a limited data learning context. In this particular scenario, using the proposed harmonic feature significantly enhances the performance of all the studied architectures in comparison to the classical input features documented in the existing literature. This finding clearly demonstrates that incorporating harmonic content enables more reliable learning of the essential time-frequency characteristics that are prevalent in most snoring sounds, even in scenarios where the amount of training data is limited.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks Uncover Geometric Neural Representations in Reinforcement-Based Motor Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) can capture the geometric properties of neural representations in EEG data. Here we utilise those to study how reinforcement-based motor learning affects neural activity patterns during motor planning, leveraging the inherent graph structure of EEG channels to capture the spatial relationships in brain activity. By exploiting task-specific symmetries, we define different pretraining strategies that not only improve model performance across all participant groups but also validate the robustness of the geometric representations. Explainability analysis based on the graph structures reveals consistent group-specific neural signatures that persist across pretraining conditions, suggesting stable geometric structures in the neural representations associated with motor learning and feedback processing. These geometric patterns exhibit partial invariance to certain task space transformations, indicating symmetries that enable generalisation across conditions while maintaining specificity to individual learning strategies. This work demonstrates how GNNs can uncover the effects of previous outcomes on motor planning, in a complex real-world task, providing insights into the geometric principles governing neural representations. Our experimental design bridges the gap between controlled experiments and ecologically valid scenarios, offering new insights into the organisation of neural representations during naturalistic motor learning, which may open avenues for exploring fundamental principles governing brain activity in complex tasks.</description>

      <title>Generative AI-Powered Plugin for Robust Federated Learning in Heterogeneous IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning enables edge devices to collaboratively train a global model while maintaining data privacy by keeping data localized. However, the Non-IID nature of data distribution across devices often hinders model convergence and reduces performance. In this paper, we propose a novel plugin for federated optimization techniques that approximates Non-IID data distributions to IID through generative AI-enhanced data augmentation and balanced sampling strategy. Key idea is to synthesize additional data for underrepresented classes on each edge device, leveraging generative AI to create a more balanced dataset across the FL network. Additionally, a balanced sampling approach at the central server selectively includes only the most IID-like devices, accelerating convergence while maximizing the global model's performance. Experimental results validate that our approach significantly improves convergence speed and robustness against data imbalance, establishing a flexible, privacy-preserving FL plugin that is applicable even in data-scarce environments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the generalizability of diffusion models by looking into the hidden properties of the learned score functions, which are essentially a series of deep denoisers trained on various noise levels. We observe that as diffusion models transition from memorization to generalization, their corresponding nonlinear diffusion denoisers exhibit increasing linearity. This discovery leads us to investigate the linear counterparts of the nonlinear diffusion models, which are a series of linear models trained to match the function mappings of the nonlinear diffusion denoisers. Surprisingly, these linear denoisers are approximately the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterized by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset. This finding implies that diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing and utilizing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training dataset for data generation. We empirically demonstrate that this inductive bias is a unique property of diffusion models in the generalization regime, which becomes increasingly evident when the model's capacity is relatively small compared to the training dataset size. In the case that the model is highly overparameterized, this inductive bias emerges during the initial training phases before the model fully memorizes its training data. Our study provides crucial insights into understanding the notable strong generalization phenomenon recently observed in real-world diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Cough-E: A multimodal, privacy-preserving cough detection algorithm for the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous cough monitors can greatly aid doctors in home monitoring and treatment of respiratory diseases. Although many algorithms have been proposed, they still face limitations in data privacy and short-term monitoring. Edge-AI offers a promising solution by processing privacy-sensitive data near the source, but challenges arise in deploying resource-intensive algorithms on constrained devices. From a suitable selection of audio and kinematic signals, our methodology aims at the optimal selection of features via Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV), which exploits the explainability of the selected XGB model. Additionally, it analyzes the use of Mel spectrogram features, instead of the more common MFCC. Moreover, a set of hyperparameters for a multimodal implementation of the classifier is explored. Finally, it evaluates the performance based on clinically relevant event-based metrics. We apply our methodology to develop Cough-E, an energy-efficient, multimodal and edge AI cough detection algorithm. It exploits audio and kinematic data in two distinct classifiers, jointly cooperating for a balanced energy and performance trade-off. We demonstrate that our algorithm can be executed in real-time on an ARM Cortex M33 microcontroller. Cough-E achieves a 70.56\% energy saving when compared to the audio-only approach, at the cost of a 1.26\% relative performance drop, resulting in a 0.78 F1-score. Both Cough-E and the edge-aware model optimization methodology are publicly available as open-source code. This approach demonstrates the benefits of the proposed hardware-aware methodology to enable privacy-preserving cough monitors on the edge, paving the way to efficient cough monitoring.</description>

      <title>DECT-2020 NR Link Distance Performance in Varying Environments: Models and Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications 2020 New Radio (DECT-2020 NR) has garnered recognition as an alternative for cellular 5G technology in the internet of things industry. This paper presents a study centered around the analysis of the link distance performance in varying environments for DECT-2020 NR. The study extensively examines and analyzes received signal strength indicator and resulting path loss values in comparison with theoretical models, as well as packet success rates (SR) and signal-to-noise ratio against varying distances. The measurements show that with an SR of over 90%, an antenna height of 1.5 m, indoor link distances with a single device-to-device connection with 0 dBm transmission (TX) power can reach over 60 m in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) areas and up to 190 m in LOS areas with smaller -8 dBm TX power. Similarly, for outdoor use cases, link distances of over 600 m can be reached with +19 dBm TX power.</description>

      <title>HoloChrome: Polychromatic Illumination for Speckle Reduction in Holographic Near-Eye Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic displays hold the promise of providing authentic depth cues, resulting in enhanced immersive visual experiences for near-eye applications. However, current holographic displays are hindered by speckle noise, which limits accurate reproduction of color and texture in displayed images. We present HoloChrome, a polychromatic holographic display framework designed to mitigate these limitations. HoloChrome utilizes an ultrafast, wavelength-adjustable laser and a dual-Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) architecture, enabling the multiplexing of a large set of discrete wavelengths across the visible spectrum. By leveraging spatial separation in our dual-SLM setup, we independently manipulate speckle patterns across multiple wavelengths. This novel approach effectively reduces speckle noise through incoherent averaging achieved by wavelength multiplexing. Our method is complementary to existing speckle reduction techniques, offering a new pathway to address this challenge. Furthermore, the use of polychromatic illumination broadens the achievable color gamut compared to traditional three-color primary holographic displays.
  Our simulations and tabletop experiments validate that HoloChrome significantly reduces speckle noise and expands the color gamut. These advancements enhance the performance of holographic near-eye displays, moving us closer to practical, immersive next-generation visual experiences.</description>

      <title>On the Accuracy of Phase Extraction from a Known-Frequency Noisy Sinusoidal Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03935v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate phase extraction from sinusoidal signals is a crucial task in various signal processing applications. While prior research predominantly addresses the case of asynchronous sampling with unknown signal frequency, this study focuses on the more specific situation where synchronous sampling is possible, and the signal's frequency is known. In this framework, a comprehensive analysis of phase estimation accuracy in the presence of both additive and phase noises is presented. A closed-form expression for the asymptotic Probability Density Function (PDF) of the resulting phase estimator is validated by simulations depicting Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) trends in different noise scenarios. This estimator is asymptotically efficient, converging rapidly to its Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). Three distinct RMSE behaviours were identified based on SNR, sample count (N), and noise level: (i) saturation towards a random guess at low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), (ii) linear decrease with the square roots of N and SNR at moderate noise levels, and (iii) saturation at high SNR towards a noise floor dependent on the phase noise level. By quantifying the impact of sample count, additive noise, and phase noise on phase estimation accuracy, this work provides valuable insights for designing systems requiring precise phase extraction, such as phase-based fluorescence assays or system identification.</description>

      <title>Wireless Communications in Doubly Selective Channels with Domain Adaptivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless communications are significantly impacted by the propagation environment, particularly in doubly selective channels with variations in both time and frequency domains. Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a promising solution; however, its high equalization complexity, if performed in the delay-Doppler domain, limits its universal application. This article explores domain-adaptive system design, with an emphasis on adaptive equalization, while also discussing modulation and pilot placement strategies. It investigates the dynamic selection of best-fit domains based on channel conditions to enhance performance across diverse environments. We examine channel domain connections, signal designs, and equalization techniques with domain adaptivity, and highlight future research opportunities.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal RIS: Passive Maximum Ratio Transmission and Interference Nulling Enabler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RIS) generalizes and goes beyond conventional diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (D-RIS) by interconnecting elements to generate beyond diagonal scattering matrices, which significantly strengthen the wireless channels. In this work, we use BD-RIS for passive multiuser beamforming in multiuser multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) systems. Specifically, we design the scattering matrix of BD-RIS to either maximize the sum received signal power at the users following maximum ratio transmission (MRT), or to nullify the interference at the users following zero forcing (ZF). Furthermore, we investigate uniform/optimized power allocation and ZF precoding at the base station (BS). Numerical results show that BD-RIS improves the interference nulling capability and sum rate with fewer reflecting elements (REs) compared to D-RIS. In addition, at moderate to high signal to noise ratios (SNRs), passive interference nulling reduces the complexity at the BS by relaxing the need for precoding or water-filling power allocation design. Furthermore, the passive MRT with ZF precoding achieves a tight sum rate performance to the joint design considering MU-MISO scenarios with many REs while maintaining low computational complexity and simplifying the channel estimation.</description>

      <title>Unauthorized UAV Countermeasure for Low-Altitude Economy: Joint Communications and Jamming based on MIMO Cellular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To ensure the thriving development of low-altitude economy, countering unauthorized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is an essential task. The existing widely deployed base stations hold great potential for joint communication and jamming. In light of this, this paper investigates the joint design of beamforming to simultaneously support communication with legitimate users and countermeasure against unauthorized UAVs based on dual-functional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cellular systems. We first formulate a joint communication and jamming (JCJ) problem, relaxing it through semi-definite relaxation (SDR) to obtain a tractable semi-definite programming (SDP) problem, with SDR providing an essential step toward simplifying the complex JCJ design. Although the solution to the relaxed SDP problem cannot directly solve the original problem, it offers valuable insights for further refinement. Therefore, we design a novel constraint specifically tailored to the structure of the SDP problem, ensuring that the solution adheres to the rank-1 constraint of the original problem. Finally, we validate effectiveness of the proposed JCJ scheme through extensive simulations. Simulation codes are provided to reproduce the results in this paper: https://github.com/LiZhuoRan0. The results confirm that the proposed JCJ scheme can operate effectively when the total number of legitimate users and unauthorized UAVs exceeds the number of antennas.</description>

      <title>Green Operations of SWIPT Networks: The Role of End-User Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) devices often come with batteries of limited capacity that are not easily replaceable or rechargeable, and that constrain significantly the sensing, computing, and communication tasks that they can perform. The Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) paradigm addresses this issue by delivering power wirelessly to energy-harvesting IoT devices with the same signal used for information transfer. For their peculiarity, these networks require specific energy-efficient planning and management approaches. However, to date, it is not clear what are the most effective strategies for managing a SWIPT network for energy efficiency. In this paper, we address this issue by developing an analytical model based on stochastic geometry, accounting for the statistics of user-perceived performance and base station scheduling. We formulate an optimization problem for deriving the energy optimal configuration as a function of the main system parameters, and we propose a genetic algorithm approach to solve it. Our results enable a first-order evaluation of the most effective strategies for energy-efficient provisioning of power and communications in a SWIPT network. We show that the service capacity brought about by users brings energy-efficient dynamic network provisioning strategies that radically differ from those of networks with no wireless power transfer.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Activity Recognition After Stroke: Generative Adversarial Networks for Kinematic Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generalizability of machine learning (ML) models for wearable monitoring in stroke rehabilitation is often constrained by the limited scale and heterogeneity of available data. Data augmentation addresses this challenge by adding computationally derived data to real data to enrich the variability represented in the training set. Traditional augmentation methods, such as rotation, permutation, and time-warping, have shown some benefits in improving classifier performance, but often fail to produce realistic training examples. This study employs Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to create synthetic kinematic data from a publicly available dataset, closely mimicking the experimentally measured reaching movements of stroke survivors. This approach not only captures the complex temporal dynamics and common movement patterns after stroke, but also significantly enhances the training dataset. By training deep learning models on both synthetic and experimental data, we enhanced task classification accuracy: models incorporating synthetic data attained an overall accuracy of 80.0%, significantly higher than the 66.1% seen in models trained solely with real data. These improvements allow for more precise task classification, offering clinicians the potential to monitor patient progress more accurately and tailor rehabilitation interventions more effectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While significant advancements have been made in music generation and differentiable sound synthesis within machine learning and computer audition, the simulation of instrument vibration guided by physical laws has been underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel model for simulating the spatio-temporal motion of nonlinear strings, integrating modal synthesis and spectral modeling within a neural network framework. Our model leverages physical properties and fundamental frequencies as inputs, outputting string states across time and space that solve the partial differential equation characterizing the nonlinear string. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves superior accuracy in string motion simulation compared to existing baseline architectures. The code and demo are available online.</description>

      <title>Enhancing IoT Communication and Localization via Smarter Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convergence of sensing and communication functionalities is poised to become a pivotal feature of the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. This vision represents a paradigm shift in wireless network design, moving beyond mere communication to a holistic integration of sensing and communication capabilities, thereby further narrowing the gap between the physical and digital worlds. While Internet of Things (IoT) devices are integral to future wireless networks, their current capabilities in sensing and communication are constrained by their power and resource limitations. On one hand, their restricted power budget limits their transmission power, leading to reduced communication range and data rates. On the other hand, their limited hardware and processing abilities hinder the adoption of sophisticated sensing technologies, such as direction finding and localization. In this work, we introduce Wi-Pro, a system which seamlessly integrates today's WiFi protocol with smart antenna design to enhance the communication and sensing capabilities of existing IoT devices. This plug-and-play system can be easily installed by replacing the IoT device's antenna. Wi-Pro seamlessly integrates smart antenna hardware with current WiFi protocols, utilizing their inherent features to not only enhance communication but also to enable precise localization on low-cost IoT devices. Our evaluation results demonstrate that Wi-Pro achieves up to 150\% data rate improvement, up to five times range improvement, accurate direction finding, and localization on single-chain IoT devices.</description>
