      <title>On the Efficiency of ERM in Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a collection of feature maps indexed by a set $\mathcal{T}$, we study the performance of empirical risk minimization (ERM) on regression problems with square loss over the union of the linear classes induced by these feature maps. This setup aims at capturing the simplest instance of feature learning, where the model is expected to jointly learn from the data an appropriate feature map and a linear predictor. We start by studying the asymptotic quantiles of the excess risk of sequences of empirical risk minimizers. Remarkably, we show that when the set $\mathcal{T}$ is not too large and when there is a unique optimal feature map, these quantiles coincide, up to a factor of two, with those of the excess risk of the oracle procedure, which knows a priori this optimal feature map and deterministically outputs an empirical risk minimizer from the associated optimal linear class. We complement this asymptotic result with a non-asymptotic analysis that quantifies the decaying effect of the global complexity of the set $\mathcal{T}$ on the excess risk of ERM, and relates it to the size of the sublevel sets of the suboptimality of the feature maps. As an application of our results, we obtain new guarantees on the performance of the best subset selection procedure in sparse linear regression under general assumptions.</description>

      <title>Prediction-Guided Active Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here is the revised abstract, ensuring all characters are ASCII-compatible:
  In this work, we introduce a new framework for active experimentation, the Prediction-Guided Active Experiment (PGAE), which leverages predictions from an existing machine learning model to guide sampling and experimentation. Specifically, at each time step, an experimental unit is sampled according to a designated sampling distribution, and the actual outcome is observed based on an experimental probability. Otherwise, only a prediction for the outcome is available. We begin by analyzing the non-adaptive case, where full information on the joint distribution of the predictor and the actual outcome is assumed. For this scenario, we derive an optimal experimentation strategy by minimizing the semi-parametric efficiency bound for the class of regular estimators. We then introduce an estimator that meets this efficiency bound, achieving asymptotic optimality. Next, we move to the adaptive case, where the predictor is continuously updated with newly sampled data. We show that the adaptive version of the estimator remains efficient and attains the same semi-parametric bound under certain regularity assumptions. Finally, we validate PGAE's performance through simulations and a semi-synthetic experiment using data from the US Census Bureau. The results underscore the PGAE framework's effectiveness and superiority compared to other existing methods.</description>

      <title>The Statistical Accuracy of Neural Posterior and Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural posterior estimation (NPE) and neural likelihood estimation (NLE) are machine learning approaches that provide accurate posterior, and likelihood, approximations in complex modeling scenarios, and in situations where conducting amortized inference is a necessity. While such methods have shown significant promise across a range of diverse scientific applications, the statistical accuracy of these methods is so far unexplored. In this manuscript, we give, for the first time, an in-depth exploration on the statistical behavior of NPE and NLE. We prove that these methods have similar theoretical guarantees to common statistical methods like approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and Bayesian synthetic likelihood (BSL). While NPE and NLE methods are just as accurate as ABC and BSL, we prove that this accuracy can often be achieved at a vastly reduced computational cost, and will therefore deliver more attractive approximations than ABC and BSL in certain problems. We verify our results theoretically and in several examples from the literature.</description>

      <title>Exact Risk Curves of signSGD in High-Dimensions: Quantifying Preconditioning and Noise-Compression Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, signSGD has garnered interest as both a practical optimizer as well as a simple model to understand adaptive optimizers like Adam. Though there is a general consensus that signSGD acts to precondition optimization and reshapes noise, quantitatively understanding these effects in theoretically solvable settings remains difficult. We present an analysis of signSGD in a high dimensional limit, and derive a limiting SDE and ODE to describe the risk. Using this framework we quantify four effects of signSGD: effective learning rate, noise compression, diagonal preconditioning, and gradient noise reshaping. Our analysis is consistent with experimental observations but moves beyond that by quantifying the dependence of these effects on the data and noise distributions. We conclude with a conjecture on how these results might be extended to Adam.</description>

      <title>Tangential Randomization in Linear Bandits (TRAiL): Guaranteed Inference and Regret Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze TRAiL (Tangential Randomization in Linear Bandits), a computationally efficient regret-optimal forced exploration algorithm for linear bandits on action sets that are sublevel sets of strongly convex functions. TRAiL estimates the governing parameter of the linear bandit problem through a standard regularized least squares and perturbs the reward-maximizing action corresponding to said point estimate along the tangent plane of the convex compact action set before projecting back to it. Exploiting concentration results for matrix martingales, we prove that TRAiL ensures a $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ growth in the inference quality, measured via the minimum eigenvalue of the design (regressor) matrix with high-probability over a $T$-length period. We build on this result to obtain an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} \log(T))$ upper bound on cumulative regret with probability at least $ 1 - 1/T$ over $T$ periods, and compare TRAiL to other popular algorithms for linear bandits. Then, we characterize an $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ minimax lower bound for any algorithm on the expected regret that covers a wide variety of action/parameter sets and noise processes. Our analysis not only expands the realm of lower-bounds in linear bandits significantly, but as a byproduct, yields a trade-off between regret and inference quality. Specifically, we prove that any algorithm with an $\mathcal{O}(T^\alpha)$ expected regret growth must have an $\Omega(T^{1-\alpha})$ asymptotic growth in expected inference quality. Our experiments on the $L^p$ unit ball as action sets reveal how this relation can be violated, but only in the short-run, before returning to respect the bound asymptotically. In effect, regret-minimizing algorithms must have just the right rate of inference -- too fast or too slow inference will incur sub-optimal regret growth.</description>

      <title>Sensor-fusion based Prognostics Framework for Complex Engineering Systems Exhibiting Multiple Failure Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex engineering systems are often subject to multiple failure modes. Developing a remaining useful life (RUL) prediction model that does not consider the failure mode causing degradation is likely to result in inaccurate predictions. However, distinguishing between causes of failure without manually inspecting the system is nontrivial. This challenge is increased when the causes of historically observed failures are unknown. Sensors, which are useful for monitoring the state-of-health of systems, can also be used for distinguishing between multiple failure modes as the presence of multiple failure modes results in discriminatory behavior of the sensor signals. When systems are equipped with multiple sensors, some sensors may exhibit behavior correlated with degradation, while other sensors do not. Furthermore, which sensors exhibit this behavior may differ for each failure mode. In this paper, we present a simultaneous clustering and sensor selection approach for unlabeled training datasets of systems exhibiting multiple failure modes. The cluster assignments and the selected sensors are then utilized in real-time to first diagnose the active failure mode and then to predict the system RUL. We validate the complete pipeline of the methodology using a simulated dataset of systems exhibiting two failure modes and on a turbofan degradation dataset from NASA.</description>

      <title>Stream-Based Active Learning for Process Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical process monitoring (SPM) methods are essential tools in quality management to check the stability of industrial processes, i.e., to dynamically classify the process state as in control (IC), under normal operating conditions, or out of control (OC), otherwise. Traditional SPM methods are based on unsupervised approaches, which are popular because in most industrial applications the true OC states of the process are not explicitly known. This hampered the development of supervised methods that could instead take advantage of process data containing labels on the true process state, although they still need improvement in dealing with class imbalance, as OC states are rare in high-quality processes, and the dynamic recognition of unseen classes, e.g., the number of possible OC states. This article presents a novel stream-based active learning strategy for SPM that enhances partially hidden Markov models to deal with data streams. The ultimate goal is to optimize labeling resources constrained by a limited budget and dynamically update the possible OC states. The proposed method performance in classifying the true state of the process is assessed through a simulation and a case study on the SPM of a resistance spot welding process in the automotive industry, which motivated this research.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of High-Dimensional Regression Coefficients by Comparison with Linearized Compressing Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear regression is often deemed inherently interpretable; however, challenges arise for high-dimensional data. We focus on further understanding how linear regression approximates nonlinear responses from high-dimensional functional data, motivated by predicting cycle life for lithium-ion batteries. We develop a linearization method to derive feature coefficients, which we compare with the closest regression coefficients of the path of regression solutions. We showcase the methods on battery data case studies where a single nonlinear compressing feature, $g\colon \mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}$, is used to construct a synthetic response, $\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}$. This unifying view of linear regression and compressing features for high-dimensional functional data helps to understand (1) how regression coefficients are shaped in the highly regularized domain and how they relate to linearized feature coefficients and (2) how the shape of regression coefficients changes as a function of regularization to approximate nonlinear responses by exploiting local structures.</description>

      <title>BALI: Learning Neural Networks via Bayesian Layerwise Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for learning Bayesian neural networks, treating them as a stack of multivariate Bayesian linear regression models. The main idea is to infer the layerwise posterior exactly if we know the target outputs of each layer. We define these pseudo-targets as the layer outputs from the forward pass, updated by the backpropagated gradients of the objective function. The resulting layerwise posterior is a matrix-normal distribution with a Kronecker-factorized covariance matrix, which can be efficiently inverted. Our method extends to the stochastic mini-batch setting using an exponential moving average over natural-parameter terms, thus gradually forgetting older data. The method converges in few iterations and performs as well as or better than leading Bayesian neural network methods on various regression, classification, and out-of-distribution detection benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Uncertainty Quantification via Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach for fine-grained uncertainty quantification (UQ) using a collision matrix. For a classification problem involving $K$ classes, the $K\times K$ collision matrix $S$ measures the inherent (aleatoric) difficulty in distinguishing between each pair of classes. In contrast to existing UQ methods, the collision matrix gives a much more detailed picture of the difficulty of classification. We discuss several possible downstream applications of the collision matrix, establish its fundamental mathematical properties, as well as show its relationship with existing UQ methods, including the Bayes error rate. We also address the new problem of estimating the collision matrix using one-hot labeled data. We propose a series of innovative techniques to estimate $S$. First, we learn a contrastive binary classifier which takes two inputs and determines if they belong to the same class. We then show that this contrastive classifier (which is PAC learnable) can be used to reliably estimate the Gramian matrix of $S$, defined as $G=S^TS$. Finally, we show that under very mild assumptions, $G$ can be used to uniquely recover $S$, a new result on stochastic matrices which could be of independent interest. Experimental results are also presented to validate our methods on several datasets.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Uncertainty Quantification for Distributed Energy Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) has introduced significant spatio-temporal uncertainties in power grid management, necessitating accurate multilevel forecasting methods. However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.</description>

      <title>Dimension Reduction via Sum-of-Squares and Improved Clustering Algorithms for Non-Spherical Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach for clustering non-spherical (i.e., arbitrary component covariances) Gaussian mixture models via a subroutine, based on the sum-of-squares method, that finds a low-dimensional separation-preserving projection of the input data. Our method gives a non-spherical analog of the classical dimension reduction, based on singular value decomposition, that forms a key component of the celebrated spherical clustering algorithm of Vempala and Wang [VW04] (in addition to several other applications).
  As applications, we obtain an algorithm to (1) cluster an arbitrary total-variation separated mixture of $k$ centered (i.e., zero-mean) Gaussians with $n\geq \operatorname{poly}(d) f(w_{\min}^{-1})$ samples and $\operatorname{poly}(n)$ time, and (2) cluster an arbitrary total-variation separated mixture of $k$ Gaussians with identical but arbitrary unknown covariance with $n \geq d^{O(\log w_{\min}^{-1})} f(w_{\min}^{-1})$ samples and $n^{O(\log w_{\min}^{-1})}$ time. Here, $w_{\min}$ is the minimum mixing weight of the input mixture, and $f$ does not depend on the dimension $d$. Our algorithms naturally extend to tolerating a dimension-independent fraction of arbitrary outliers. Before this work, the techniques in the state-of-the-art non-spherical clustering algorithms needed $d^{O(k)} f(w_{\min}^{-1})$ time and samples for clustering such mixtures.
  Our results may come as a surprise in the context of the $d^{\Omega(k)}$ statistical query lower bound [DKS17] for clustering non-spherical Gaussian mixtures. While this result is usually thought to rule out $d^{o(k)}$ cost algorithms for the problem, our results show that the lower bounds can in fact be circumvented for a remarkably general class of Gaussian mixtures.</description>

      <title>Transformer Neural Processes -- Kernel Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic processes model various natural phenomena from disease transmission to stock prices, but simulating and quantifying their uncertainty can be computationally challenging. For example, modeling a Gaussian Process with standard statistical methods incurs an $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ penalty, and even using state-of-the-art Neural Processes (NPs) incurs an $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ penalty due to the attention mechanism. We introduce the Transformer Neural Process - Kernel Regression (TNP-KR), a new architecture that incorporates a novel transformer block we call a Kernel Regression Block (KRBlock), which reduces the computational complexity of attention in transformer-based Neural Processes (TNPs) from $\mathcal{O}((n_C+n_T)^2)$ to $O(n_C^2+n_Cn_T)$ by eliminating masked computations, where $n_C$ is the number of context, and $n_T$ is the number of test points, respectively, and a fast attention variant that further reduces all attention calculations to $\mathcal{O}(n_C)$ in space and time complexity. In benchmarks spanning such tasks as meta-regression, Bayesian optimization, and image completion, we demonstrate that the full variant matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods while training faster and scaling two orders of magnitude higher in number of test points, and the fast variant nearly matches that performance while scaling to millions of both test and context points on consumer hardware.</description>

      <title>Multivariate and Online Transfer Learning with Uncertainty Quantification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Untreated periodontitis causes inflammation within the supporting tissue of the teeth and can ultimately lead to tooth loss. Modeling periodontal outcomes is beneficial as they are difficult and time consuming to measure, but disparities in representation between demographic groups must be considered. There may not be enough participants to build group specific models and it can be ineffective, and even dangerous, to apply a model to participants in an underrepresented group if demographic differences were not considered during training. We propose an extension to RECaST Bayesian transfer learning framework. Our method jointly models multivariate outcomes, exhibiting significant improvement over the previous univariate RECaST method. Further, we introduce an online approach to model sequential data sets. Negative transfer is mitigated to ensure that the information shared from the other demographic groups does not negatively impact the modeling of the underrepresented participants. The Bayesian framework naturally provides uncertainty quantification on predictions. Especially important in medical applications, our method does not share data between domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both predictive performance and uncertainty quantification on simulated data and on a database of dental records from the HealthPartners Institute.</description>

      <title>Smart Predict-then-Optimize Method with Dependent Data: Risk Bounds and Calibration of Autoregression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The predict-then-optimize (PTO) framework is indispensable for addressing practical stochastic decision-making tasks. It consists of two crucial steps: initially predicting unknown parameters of an optimization model and subsequently solving the problem based on these predictions. Elmachtoub and Grigas [1] introduced the Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO) loss for the framework, which gauges the decision error arising from predicted parameters, and a convex surrogate, the SPO+ loss, which incorporates the underlying structure of the optimization model. The consistency of these different loss functions is guaranteed under the assumption of i.i.d. training data. Nevertheless, various types of data are often dependent, such as power load fluctuations over time. This dependent nature can lead to diminished model performance in testing or real-world applications. Motivated to make intelligent predictions for time series data, we present an autoregressive SPO method directly targeting the optimization problem at the decision stage in this paper, where the conditions of consistency are no longer met. Therefore, we first analyze the generalization bounds of the SPO loss within our autoregressive model. Subsequently, the uniform calibration results in Liu and Grigas [2] are extended in the proposed model. Finally, we conduct experiments to empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the SPO+ surrogate compared to the absolute loss and the least squares loss, especially when the cost vectors are determined by stationary dynamical systems and demonstrate the relationship between normalized regret and mixing coefficients.</description>

      <title>Auto-Evaluation with Few Labels through Post-hoc Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continually evaluating large generative models provides a unique challenge. Often, human annotations are necessary to evaluate high-level properties of these models (e.g. in text or images). However, collecting human annotations of samples can be resource intensive, and using other machine learning systems to provide the annotations, or automatic evaluation, can introduce systematic errors into the evaluation. The Prediction Powered Inference (PPI) framework provides a way of leveraging both the statistical power of automatic evaluation and a small pool of labelled data to produce a low-variance, unbiased estimate of the quantity being evaluated for. However, most work on PPI considers a relatively sizable set of labelled samples, which is not always practical to obtain. To this end, we present two new PPI-based techniques that leverage robust regressors to produce even lower variance estimators in the few-label regime.</description>

      <title>Learning multivariate Gaussians with imperfect advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of distribution learning within the framework of learning-augmented algorithms. In this setting, we explore the scenario where a probability distribution is provided as potentially inaccurate advice on the true, unknown distribution. Our objective is to develop learning algorithms whose sample complexity decreases as the quality of the advice improves, thereby surpassing standard learning lower bounds when the advice is sufficiently accurate.
  Specifically, we demonstrate that this outcome is achievable for the problem of learning a multivariate Gaussian distribution $N(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})$ in the PAC learning setting. Classically, in the advice-free setting, $\tilde{\Theta}(d^2/\varepsilon^2)$ samples are sufficient and worst case necessary to learn $d$-dimensional Gaussians up to TV distance $\varepsilon$ with constant probability. When we are additionally given a parameter $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}$ as advice, we show that $\tilde{O}(d^{2-\beta}/\varepsilon^2)$ samples suffices whenever $\| \tilde{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}^{-1/2} \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \tilde{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}^{-1/2} - \boldsymbol{I_d} \|_1 \leq \varepsilon d^{1-\beta}$ (where $\|\cdot\|_1$ denotes the entrywise $\ell_1$ norm) for any $\beta &gt; 0$, yielding a polynomial improvement over the advice-free setting.</description>

Abstract: We explore the behaviour emerging from learning agents repeatedly interacting strategically for a wide range of learning dynamics that includes projected gradient, replicator and log-barrier dynamics. Going beyond the better-understood classes of potential games and zero-sum games, we consider the setting of a general repeated game with finite recall, for different forms of monitoring. We obtain a Folk Theorem-like result and characterise the set of payoff vectors that can be obtained by these dynamics, discovering a wide range of possibilities for the emergence of algorithmic collusion.</description>

      <title>LazyDINO: Fast, scalable, and efficiently amortized Bayesian inversion via structure-exploiting and surrogate-driven measure transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present LazyDINO, a transport map variational inference method for fast, scalable, and efficiently amortized solutions of high-dimensional nonlinear Bayesian inverse problems with expensive parameter-to-observable (PtO) maps. Our method consists of an offline phase in which we construct a derivative-informed neural surrogate of the PtO map using joint samples of the PtO map and its Jacobian. During the online phase, when given observational data, we seek rapid posterior approximation using surrogate-driven training of a lazy map [Brennan et al., NeurIPS, (2020)], i.e., a structure-exploiting transport map with low-dimensional nonlinearity. The trained lazy map then produces approximate posterior samples or density evaluations. Our surrogate construction is optimized for amortized Bayesian inversion using lazy map variational inference. We show that (i) the derivative-based reduced basis architecture [O'Leary-Roseberry et al., Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng., 388 (2022)] minimizes the upper bound on the expected error in surrogate posterior approximation, and (ii) the derivative-informed training formulation [O'Leary-Roseberry et al., J. Comput. Phys., 496 (2024)] minimizes the expected error due to surrogate-driven transport map optimization. Our numerical results demonstrate that LazyDINO is highly efficient in cost amortization for Bayesian inversion. We observe one to two orders of magnitude reduction of offline cost for accurate posterior approximation, compared to simulation-based amortized inference via conditional transport and conventional surrogate-driven transport. In particular, LazyDINO outperforms Laplace approximation consistently using fewer than 1000 offline samples, while other amortized inference methods struggle and sometimes fail at 16,000 offline samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work develops a Bayesian non-parametric approach to signal separation where the signals may vary according to latent variables. Our key contribution is to augment Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) for the case where each data point comprises the weighted sum of a known number of pure component signals, observed across several input locations. Our framework allows arbitrary non-linear variations in the signals while being able to incorporate useful priors for the linear weights, such as summing-to-one. Our contributions are particularly relevant to spectroscopy, where changing conditions may cause the underlying pure component signals to vary from sample to sample. To demonstrate the applicability to both spectroscopy and other domains, we consider several applications: a near-infrared spectroscopy dataset with varying temperatures, a simulated dataset for identifying flow configuration through a pipe, and a dataset for determining the type of rock from its reflectance.</description>

      <title>Dense ReLU Neural Networks for Temporal-spatial Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on fully connected deep neural networks utilizing the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function for nonparametric estimation. We derive non-asymptotic bounds that lead to convergence rates, addressing both temporal and spatial dependence in the observed measurements. By accounting for dependencies across time and space, our models better reflect the complexities of real-world data, enhancing both predictive performance and theoretical robustness. We also tackle the curse of dimensionality by modeling the data on a manifold, exploring the intrinsic dimensionality of high-dimensional data. We broaden existing theoretical findings of temporal-spatial analysis by applying them to neural networks in more general contexts and demonstrate that our proof techniques are effective for models with short-range dependence. Our empirical simulations across various synthetic response functions underscore the superior performance of our method, outperforming established approaches in the existing literature. These findings provide valuable insights into the strong capabilities of dense neural networks for temporal-spatial modeling across a broad range of function classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the dominant role of deep models in machine learning, limitations persist, including overconfident predictions, susceptibility to adversarial attacks, and underestimation of variability in predictions. The Bayesian paradigm provides a natural framework to overcome such issues and has become the gold standard for uncertainty estimation with deep models, also providing improved accuracy and a framework for tuning critical hyperparameters. However, exact Bayesian inference is challenging, typically involving variational algorithms that impose strong independence and distributional assumptions. Moreover, existing methods are sensitive to the architectural choice of the network. We address these issues by constructing a relaxed version of the standard feed-forward rectified neural network, and employing Polya-Gamma data augmentation tricks to render a conditionally linear and Gaussian model. Additionally, we use sparsity-promoting priors on the weights of the neural network for data-driven architectural design. To approximate the posterior, we derive a variational inference algorithm that avoids distributional assumptions and independence across layers and is a faster alternative to the usual Markov Chain Monte Carlo schemes.</description>

      <title>Debiased Regression for Root-N-Consistent Conditional Mean Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a debiasing method for regression estimators, including high-dimensional and nonparametric regression estimators. For example, nonparametric regression methods allow for the estimation of regression functions in a data-driven manner with minimal assumptions; however, these methods typically fail to achieve $\sqrt{n}$-consistency in their convergence rates, and many, including those in machine learning, lack guarantees that their estimators asymptotically follow a normal distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a debiasing technique for nonparametric estimators by adding a bias-correction term to the original estimators, extending the conventional one-step estimator used in semiparametric analysis. Specifically, for each data point, we estimate the conditional expected residual of the original nonparametric estimator, which can, for instance, be computed using kernel (Nadaraya-Watson) regression, and incorporate it as a bias-reduction term. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed estimator achieves $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality under a mild convergence rate condition for both the original nonparametric estimator and the conditional expected residual estimator. Notably, this approach remains model-free as long as the original estimator and the conditional expected residual estimator satisfy the convergence rate condition. The proposed method offers several advantages, including improved estimation accuracy and simplified construction of confidence intervals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Pareto set identification (PSI) problem in multi-objective multi-armed bandits (MO-MAB) with contaminated reward observations. At each arm pull, with some fixed probability, the true reward samples are replaced with the samples from an arbitrary contamination distribution chosen by an adversary. We consider ({\alpha}, {\delta})-PAC PSI and propose a sample median-based multi-objective adaptive elimination algorithm that returns an ({\alpha}, {\delta})- PAC Pareto set upon termination with a sample complexity bound that depends on the contamination probability. As the contamination probability decreases, we recover the wellknown sample complexity results in MO-MAB. We compare the proposed algorithm with a mean-based method from MO-MAB literature, as well as an extended version that uses median estimators, on several PSI problems under adversarial corruptions, including review bombing and diabetes management. Our numerical results support our theoretical findings and demonstrate that robust algorithm design is crucial for accurate PSI under contaminated reward observations.</description>

      <title>Sufficient Invariant Learning for Distribution Shift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning robust models under distribution shifts between training and test datasets is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. While learning invariant features across environments is a popular approach, it often assumes that these features are fully observed in both training and test sets-a condition frequently violated in practice. When models rely on invariant features absent in the test set, their robustness in new environments can deteriorate. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel learning principle called the Sufficient Invariant Learning (SIL) framework, which focuses on learning a sufficient subset of invariant features rather than relying on a single feature. After demonstrating the limitation of existing invariant learning methods, we propose a new algorithm, Adaptive Sharpness-aware Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (ASGDRO), to learn diverse invariant features by seeking common flat minima across the environments. We theoretically demonstrate that finding a common flat minima enables robust predictions based on diverse invariant features. Empirical evaluations on multiple datasets, including our new benchmark, confirm ASGDRO's robustness against distribution shifts, highlighting the limitations of existing methods.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Data-Driven Multi-Stage Deep Learning Framework for Enhanced Nuclear Reactor Power Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate and efficient modeling of nuclear reactor transients is crucial for ensuring safe and optimal reactor operation. Traditional physics-based models, while valuable, can be computationally intensive and may not fully capture the complexities of real-world reactor behavior. This paper introduces a novel multi-stage deep learning framework that addresses these limitations, offering a faster and more robust solution for predicting the final steady-state power of reactor transients. By leveraging a combination of feed-forward neural networks with both classification and regression stages, and training on a unique dataset that integrates real-world measurements of reactor power and controls state from the Missouri University of Science and Technology Reactor (MSTR) with noise-enhanced simulated data, our approach achieves remarkable accuracy (96% classification, 2.3% MAPE). The incorporation of simulated data with noise significantly improves the model's generalization capabilities, mitigating the risk of overfitting. This innovative solution not only enables rapid and precise prediction of reactor behavior but also has the potential to revolutionize nuclear reactor operations, facilitating enhanced safety protocols, optimized performance, and streamlined decision-making processes.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we show existence of minimizers in the loss landscape for residual artificial neural networks (ANNs) with multi-dimensional input layer and one hidden layer with ReLU activation. Our work contrasts earlier results in [D. Gallon, A. Jentzen, and F. Lindner, preprint, arXiv:2211.15641, 2022] and [P. Petersen, M. Raslan, and F. Voigtlaender, Found. Comput. Math., 21 (2021), pp. 375-444] which showed that in many situations minimizers do not exist for common smooth activation functions even in the case where the target functions are polynomials. The proof of the existence property makes use of a closure of the search space containing all functions generated by ANNs and additional discontinuous generalized responses. As we will show, the additional generalized responses in this larger space are suboptimal so that the minimum is attained in the original function class.</description>

      <title>PAPAL: A Provable PArticle-based Primal-Dual ALgorithm for Mixed Nash Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the non-convex non-concave objective function in two-player zero-sum continuous games. The existence of pure Nash equilibrium requires stringent conditions, posing a major challenge for this problem. To circumvent this difficulty, we examine the problem of identifying a mixed Nash equilibrium, where strategies are randomized and characterized by probability distributions over continuous domains. To this end, we propose PArticle-based Primal-dual ALgorithm (PAPAL) tailored for a weakly entropy-regularized min-max optimization over probability distributions. This algorithm employs the stochastic movements of particles to represent the updates of random strategies for the $\epsilon$-mixed Nash equilibrium. We offer a comprehensive convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its effectiveness. In contrast to prior research that attempted to update particle importance without movements, PAPAL is the first implementable particle-based algorithm accompanied by non-asymptotic quantitative convergence results, running time, and sample complexity guarantees. Our framework contributes novel insights into the particle-based algorithms for continuous min-max optimization in the general non-convex non-concave setting.</description>

      <title>Contextual Combinatorial Bandits with Probabilistically Triggered Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study contextual combinatorial bandits with probabilistically triggered arms (C$^2$MAB-T) under a variety of smoothness conditions that capture a wide range of applications, such as contextual cascading bandits and contextual influence maximization bandits. Under the triggering probability modulated (TPM) condition, we devise the C$^2$-UCB-T algorithm and propose a novel analysis that achieves an $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{KT})$ regret bound, removing a potentially exponentially large factor $O(1/p_{\min})$, where $d$ is the dimension of contexts, $p_{\min}$ is the minimum positive probability that any arm can be triggered, and batch-size $K$ is the maximum number of arms that can be triggered per round. Under the variance modulated (VM) or triggering probability and variance modulated (TPVM) conditions, we propose a new variance-adaptive algorithm VAC$^2$-UCB and derive a regret bound $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$, which is independent of the batch-size $K$. As a valuable by-product, our analysis technique and variance-adaptive algorithm can be applied to the CMAB-T and C$^2$MAB setting, improving existing results there as well. We also include experiments that demonstrate the improved performance of our algorithms compared with benchmark algorithms on synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Multistep Consistency Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are relatively easy to train but require many steps to generate samples. Consistency models are far more difficult to train, but generate samples in a single step.
  In this paper we propose Multistep Consistency Models: A unification between Consistency Models (Song et al., 2023) and TRACT (Berthelot et al., 2023) that can interpolate between a consistency model and a diffusion model: a trade-off between sampling speed and sampling quality. Specifically, a 1-step consistency model is a conventional consistency model whereas a $\infty$-step consistency model is a diffusion model.
  Multistep Consistency Models work really well in practice. By increasing the sample budget from a single step to 2-8 steps, we can train models more easily that generate higher quality samples, while retaining much of the sampling speed benefits. Notable results are 1.4 FID on Imagenet 64 in 8 step and 2.1 FID on Imagenet128 in 8 steps with consistency distillation, using simple losses without adversarial training. We also show that our method scales to a text-to-image diffusion model, generating samples that are close to the quality of the original model.</description>

      <title>Robust Learning for Optimal Dynamic Treatment Regimes with Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Public policies and medical interventions often involve dynamics in their treatment assignments, where individuals receive a series of interventions over multiple stages. We study the statistical learning of optimal dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) that guide the optimal treatment assignment for each individual at each stage based on the individual's evolving history. We propose a doubly robust, classification-based approach to learning the optimal DTR using observational data under the assumption of sequential ignorability. This approach learns the optimal DTR through backward induction. At each step, it constructs an augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) estimator of the policy value function and maximizes it to learn the optimal policy for the corresponding stage. We show that the resulting DTR can achieve an optimal convergence rate of $n^{-1/2}$ for welfare regret under mild convergence conditions on estimators of the nuisance components.</description>

      <title>Learning general Gaussian mixtures with efficient score matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning mixtures of $k$ Gaussians in $d$ dimensions. We make no separation assumptions on the underlying mixture components: we only require that the covariance matrices have bounded condition number and that the means and covariances lie in a ball of bounded radius. We give an algorithm that draws $d^{\mathrm{poly}(k/\varepsilon)}$ samples from the target mixture, runs in sample-polynomial time, and constructs a sampler whose output distribution is $\varepsilon$-far from the unknown mixture in total variation. Prior works for this problem either (i) required exponential runtime in the dimension $d$, (ii) placed strong assumptions on the instance (e.g., spherical covariances or clusterability), or (iii) had doubly exponential dependence on the number of components $k$.
  Our approach departs from commonly used techniques for this problem like the method of moments. Instead, we leverage a recently developed reduction, based on diffusion models, from distribution learning to a supervised learning task called score matching. We give an algorithm for the latter by proving a structural result showing that the score function of a Gaussian mixture can be approximated by a piecewise-polynomial function, and there is an efficient algorithm for finding it. To our knowledge, this is the first example of diffusion models achieving a state-of-the-art theoretical guarantee for an unsupervised learning task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of an optimal mapping between Hilbert spaces $IN$ of $\left|\psi\right\rangle$ and $OUT$ of $\left|\phi\right\rangle$ based on a set of wavefunction measurements (within a phase) $\psi_l \to \phi_l$, $l=1\dots M$, is formulated as an optimization problem maximizing the total fidelity $\sum_{l=1}^{M} \omega^{(l)} \left|\langle\phi_l|\mathcal{U}|\psi_l\rangle\right|^2$ subject to probability preservation constraints on $\mathcal{U}$ (partial unitarity). The constructed operator $\mathcal{U}$ can be considered as an $IN$ to $OUT$ quantum channel; it is a partially unitary rectangular matrix (an isometry) of dimension $\dim(OUT) \times \dim(IN)$ transforming operators as $A^{OUT}=\mathcal{U} A^{IN} \mathcal{U}^{\dagger}$. An iterative algorithm for finding the global maximum of this optimization problem is developed, and its application to a number of problems is demonstrated. A software product implementing the algorithm is available from the authors.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic and Non-Asymptotic Convergence of AdaGrad for Non-Convex Optimization via Novel Stopping Time-based Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive optimizers have emerged as powerful tools in deep learning, dynamically adjusting the learning rate based on iterative gradients. These adaptive methods have significantly succeeded in various deep learning tasks, outperforming stochastic gradient descent (SGD). However, despite AdaGrad's status as a cornerstone of adaptive optimization, its theoretical analysis has not adequately addressed key aspects such as asymptotic convergence and non-asymptotic convergence rates in non-convex optimization scenarios. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of AdaGrad, filling the existing gaps in the literature. We introduce an innovative stopping time technique from probabilistic theory, which allows us to establish the stability of AdaGrad under mild conditions for the first time. We further derive the asymptotically almost sure and mean-square convergence for AdaGrad. In addition, we demonstrate the near-optimal non-asymptotic convergence rate measured by the average-squared gradients in expectation, which is stronger than the existing high-probability results. The techniques developed in this work are potentially independent of interest for future research on other adaptive stochastic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Gradient Normalization Provably Benefits Nonconvex SGD under Heavy-Tailed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the roles of gradient normalization and clipping in ensuring the convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) under heavy-tailed noise. While existing approaches consider gradient clipping indispensable for SGD convergence, we theoretically demonstrate that gradient normalization alone without clipping is sufficient to ensure convergence. Furthermore, we establish that combining gradient normalization with clipping offers significantly improved convergence rates compared to using either technique in isolation, notably as gradient noise diminishes. With these results, our work provides the first theoretical evidence demonstrating the benefits of gradient normalization in SGD under heavy-tailed noise. Finally, we introduce an accelerated SGD variant incorporating gradient normalization and clipping, further enhancing convergence rates under heavy-tailed noise.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based probabilistic forecasting of solar irradiance in Chile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By the end of 2023, renewable sources cover 63.4% of the total electric power demand of Chile, and in line with the global trend, photovoltaic (PV) power shows the most dynamic increase. Although Chile's Atacama Desert is considered the sunniest place on Earth, PV power production, even in this area, can be highly volatile. Successful integration of PV energy into the country's power grid requires accurate short-term PV power forecasts, which can be obtained from predictions of solar irradiance and related weather quantities. Nowadays, in weather forecasting, the state-of-the-art approach is the use of ensemble forecasts based on multiple runs of numerical weather prediction models. However, ensemble forecasts still tend to be uncalibrated or biased, thus requiring some form of post-processing. The present work investigates probabilistic forecasts of solar irradiance for Regions III and IV in Chile. For this reason, 8-member short-term ensemble forecasts of solar irradiance for calendar year 2021 are generated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, which are then calibrated using the benchmark ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) method based on a censored Gaussian law, and its machine learning-based distributional regression network (DRN) counterpart. Furthermore, we also propose a neural network-based post-processing method resulting in improved 8-member ensemble predictions. All forecasts are evaluated against station observations for 30 locations, and the skill of post-processed predictions is compared to the raw WRF ensemble. Our case study confirms that all studied post-processing methods substantially improve both the calibration of probabilistic- and the accuracy of point forecasts. Among the methods tested, the corrected ensemble exhibits the best overall performance. Additionally, the DRN model generally outperforms the corresponding EMOS approach.</description>
