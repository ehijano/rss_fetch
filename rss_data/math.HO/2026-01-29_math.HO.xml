      <title>Foundations of Trigonometry: Conceptual and Logical, Being an Essay Towards a Conceptual Foundations of Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:1610.07867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noticing that all of the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries treatments of trigonometry surveyed in this article are conceptually or logically defective, it is required to seek a conceptually sound and logically correct foundations of the subject. To this end, several questions have to be discussed: Is mathematics arbitrary? What does it have to do with nature? Reality? Applications? What is measure? Direct measure? Indirect measure? What are ratios? Eudoxean ratios? What is their relationship to measure? What are the real numbers? What is their relationship to ratios? To measure? What are the geometric trigonometric functions? The analytic trigonometric functions? What is the relationship between them? What is the measure of an angle? what is its relationship to trigonometry?......? After dealing with these philosophical and technical questions, a treatment of both geometric and analytic trigonometry which would be conceptually sound and logically correct foundations of the subject is proposed. This treatment distinguishes between geometric trigonometric functions (the elements of whose domain are angles) and analytic trigonometric functions (the elements of whose domain are real numbers), the bridge from the former to the latter is the measure of angles. The geometric trigonometric functions are defined to be the Eudoxean ratios between appropriate straight line-segments, and the measure of an angle is defined to be its Eudoxean ratio to the radian, which is to be defined beforehand. Also, the Eudoxean ratios were defined beforehand, and it was advocated that it is conceptually sound to consider them as the positive elements of the field of the real numbers.</description>

      <title>An Elementary Proof of a Remarkable Relation Between the Squircle and Lemniscate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19864v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that there is a somewhat mysterious relation between the area of the quartic Fermat curve $x^4+y^4=1$, aka squircle, and the arc length of the lemniscate $(x^2+y^2)^2=x^2-y^2$. The standardproof of this fact uses relations between elliptic integrals and the gamma function. In this article we generalize this result to relate areas of sectors of the squircle to arc lengths of segments of the lemniscate. We provide a geometric interpretation of this relation and an elementary proof of the relation, which only uses basic integral calculus. We also discuss an alternate version of this kind of relation, which is implicit in a calculation of Siegel.</description>

      <title>Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract:   Probabilities is the English translation of the book Probabilit\'es Tome 1 and Tome 2. The mathematic content is authored by Prof. Jean-Yves Ouvrard. The English version has been done by his eldest son Dr. Xavier Ouvrard. In this first version, only the first part is released. Part 1 contains 7 chapters and corresponds to bachelor level. The first part introduces the fundamentals of probability theory, including event algebras, random variables, independence, conditional probabilities, moments of discrete and continuous random variables, generating functions, and limit theorems.
  Disclaimer: The second part is given as such and still needs full review. Corrected versions will be made available as soon as they are available during the coming months of 2026, stay tune!</description>
