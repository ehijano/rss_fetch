      <title>Finite-dimensional reductions and finite-gap type solutions of multicomponent integrable PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main object of the paper is a recently discovered family of multicomponent integrable systems of partial differential equations, whose particular cases include many well-known equations such as the Korteweg--de Vries, coupled KdV, Harry Dym, coupled Harry Dym, Camassa--Holm, multicomponent Camassa--Holm, Dullin--Gottwald--Holm, and Kaup--Boussinesq equations.
  We suggest a methodology for constructing a series of solutions for all systems in the family. The crux of the approach lies in reducing this system to a dispersionless integrable system which is a special case of linearly degenerate quasilinear systems actively explored since the 1990s and recently studied in the framework of Nijenhuis geometry. These infinite-dimensional integrable systems are closely connected to certain explicit finite-dimensional integrable systems. We provide a link between solutions of our multicomponent PDE systems and solutions of this finite-dimensional system, and use it to construct animations of multi-component analogous of soliton and cnoidal solutions.</description>

      <title>Free cumulants and freeness for unitarily invariant random tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the question of the asymptotic description of random tensors that are local unitary invariant, that is, invariant by conjugation by tensor products of (independent) unitary matrices. We consider both the case of an invariant random tensor with $D$ inputs and $D$ outputs, called mixed, and the case where there is a factorization between the inputs and outputs, called pure, and which includes the random tensor models that have been extensively studied in the physics literature (we provide a short review of these results).
  The finite size and asymptotic moments are defined in terms of the correlations of certain invariant polynomials called trace-invariants, encoded by $D$-uplets of permutations, up to relabelling equivalence. Using the unitary invariance, we define a notion of finite free cumulants associated to the expectations of these trace-invariants, through invertible finite size moment-cumulants formulas.
  In order to characterize the asymptotic distributions at first order, two important classes of random tensors are considered: pure random tensors that scale like a pure complex Gaussian, and mixed random tensors that scale like a Wishart tensor. In both cases, we derive a notion of free cumulants associated to the first order trace-invariants, through closed moment-cumulant formulas, which involve $D$ independent summations over non-crossing permutations. While the formulas involve the same combinatorics, the asymptotic distributions differ by the class of invariants that define the distribution at first order. Both in the pure and in the mixed case, the first order free-cumulants of a sum of two independent random tensors are shown to be additive. A preliminary discussion of the higher orders is provided. Finally, tensor freeness is then defined (at first order) as the vanishing of mixed free cumulants associated to first order trace-invariants.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous tunneling time within the theory of time-of-arrival operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown in \href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.170402}{\textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.}, \textbf{108} 170402 (2012)}, that quantum tunneling is instantaneous using a time-of-arrival (TOA) operator constructed by Weyl quantization of the classical TOA. However, there are infinitely many possible quantum images of the classical TOA, leaving it unclear if one is uniquely preferred over the others. This raises the question on whether instantaneous tunneling time is simply an artifact of the chosen ordering rule. Here, we demonstrate that tunneling time vanishes for all possible quantum images of the classical arrival time, irrespective of the ordering rule between the position and momentum observables. The result still holds for TOA-operators that are constructed independent of canonical quantization, while still imposing the correct algebra defined by the time-energy canonical commutation relation.</description>

Abstract: We compute the exact value of the quantum chromatic numbers of Hadamard graphs of order $n=2^N$ for $N$ a multiple of $4$ using the upper bound derived by Avis, Hasegawa, Kikuchi, and Sasaki, as well as an application of the Hoffman-like lower bound of Clive and Wocjan that was generalized by Ganesan for quantum graphs.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen atom as a nonlinear oscillator under circularly polarized light: epicyclical electron orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we use Clifford algebra $Cl_{2,0}$ to find the 2D orbit of Hydrogen electron under a Coulomb force and a perturbing circularly polarized electric field of light at angular frequency~$\omega$, which is turned on at time $t = 0$ via a unit step switch. Using a coordinate system co-rotating with the electron's unperturbed circular orbit at angular frequency $\omega_0$, we derive the complex nonlinear differential equation for the perturbation which is similar to but different from the Lorentz oscillator equation: (1) the acceleration terms are similar, (2) the damping term coefficient is not real but imaginary due to Coriolis force, (3) the term similar to spring force is not positive but negative, (3) there is a complex conjugate of the perturbation term which has no Lorentz analog but which makes the equation nonlinear, and (4) the angular frequency of the forcing term is not $\omega$ but $\omega - \omega_0$. By imposing that the position and velocity of the electron are continuous at time $t = 0$, we show that the orbit of the electron is a sum of five exponential Fourier terms with frequencies 0, $\omega_0$, $2\omega_0$, $(2\omega_0 - \omega)$, and $\omega$, which correspond to the eccentric, deferent, and three epicycles in Copernican astronomy. We show that at the three resonant light frequencies $0$, $\omega_0$, and $2\omega_0$, the electron's orbit is divergent, but approximates a Keplerian ellipse. At other light frequencies, the orbits are nondivergent with periods that are integer multiples of $\pi/\omega_0$ depending on the frequency ratio $\omega/\omega_0$. And as $\omega/\omega_0\rightarrow \pm\infty$, the orbit approaches the electron's unperturbed circular orbit.</description>

      <title>Refined Gromov-Witten invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the enumerative geometry of stable maps to Calabi-Yau 5-folds $Z$ with a group action preserving the Calabi-Yau form. In the central case $Z=X \times \mathbb{C}^2$, where $X$ is a Calabi-Yau 3-fold with a group action scaling the holomorphic volume form non-trivially, we conjecture that the disconnected equivariant Gromov-Witten generating series of $Z$ returns the Nekrasov-Okounkov equivariant K-theoretic PT partition function of $X$ and, under suitable rigidity conditions, its refined BPS index. We show that in the unrefined limit the conjecture reproduces known statements about the higher genus Gromov-Witten theory of $X$; we prove it for $X$ the resolved conifold; and we establish a refined cycle-level local/relative correspondence for local del Pezzo surfaces, implying the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of the conjecture when $X$ is the local projective plane. We further establish B-model physics predictions of Huang-Klemm for refined higher genus mirror symmetry for local $\mathbb{P}^2$. In particular, we prove that our refined Gromov-Witten generating series obey extended holomorphic anomaly equations, are quasi-modular functions of $\Gamma_1(3)$, have leading asymptotics at the conifold point given by the logarithm of the Barnes double-Gamma function, and satisfy a version of the higher genus Crepant Resolution Correspondence with the refined orbifold Gromov-Witten theory of $[\mathbb{C}^3/\mu_3]$. This refines results, and partially proves conjectures, of Lho-Pandharipande, Coates-Iritani, and Bousseau-Fan-Guo-Wu.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Sobolev norms for Kolmogorov operators with scaling-critical drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the ordinary or fractional Laplacian plus a homogeneous, scaling-critical drift term. This operator is non-symmetric but homogeneous, and generates scales of $L^p$-Sobolev spaces which we compare with the ordinary homogeneous Sobolev spaces. Unlike in previous studies concerning Hardy operators, i.e., ordinary or fractional Laplacians plus scaling-critical scalar perturbations, handling the drift term requires an additional, possibly technical, restriction on the range of comparable Sobolev spaces, which is related to the unavailability of gradient bounds for the associated semigroup.</description>

Abstract: In \textit{SIGMA} \textbf{17} (2021), 091, 12 p.p.\ we have presented an integrable system with a negative time variable number for the Davey-Stewartson hierarchy. Here we develop this approach to construct an integrable equation with a lower time variable number. In addition, we show that the system reduced by this time is a new integrable equation in the dimension $1+1$.</description>

      <title>Rigidity condition for gluing two bar-joint rigid graphs embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How does one determine if a collection of bars joined by freely rotating hinges cannot be deformed without changing the length of any of the bars? In other words, how does one determine if a bar-joint graph is rigid? This question has been definitively answered using combinatorial rigidity theory in two dimensions via the Geiringer-Laman Theorem. However, it has not yet been answered using combinatorial rigidity theory in higher dimensions, given known counterexamples to the trivial dimensional extension of the Geiringer-Laman Theorem. To work towards a combinatorial approach in dimensions beyond two, we present a theorem for gluing two rigid bar-joint graphs together that remain rigid. When there are no overlapping vertices between the two graphs, the theorem reduces to Tay's theorem used to identify rigidity in body-bar graphs. When there are overlapping vertices, we rely on the notion of pinned rigid graphs to identify and constrain rigid motions. This theorem provides a basis for an algorithm for recursively constructing rigid clusters that can be readily adapted for computational purposes. By leveraging Henneberg-type operations to grow a rigid (or minimally rigid) graph and treating simplices-where every vertex connects to every other vertex-as fundamental units, our approach offers a scalable solution with computational complexity comparable to traditional methods. Thus, we provide a combinatorial blueprint for algorithms in multi-dimensional rigidity theory as applied to bar-joint graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding eigenvalue distributions for a number of sparse random matrix ensembles can be reduced to solving nonlinear integral equations of the Hammerstein type. While a systematic mathematical theory of such equations exists, it has not been previously applied to sparse matrix problems. We close this gap in the literature by showing how one can employ numerical solutions of Hammerstein equations to accurately recover the spectra of adjacency matrices and Laplacians of random graphs. While our treatment focuses on random graphs for concreteness, the methodology has broad applications to more general sparse random matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is understanding the stretching mechanism of stochastic models of turbulence acting on a simple model of polymer. We consider a turbulent model that is white noise in time and activates frequencies in a shell $N\leq |k|\leq 2N$ and investigate the scaling limit as $N\rightarrow \infty$, under suitable intensity assumption, such that the stretching term has a finite limit covariance. The polymer density equation, initially an SPDE, converges weakly to a limit deterministic equation with a new term. Stationary solutions can be computed and show power law decay in the polymer length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a strong form of the hot spots conjecture for a class of domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$ which are a natural generalization of the lip domains of Atar and Burdzy [J. Amer. Math. Soc. 17 (2004), 243-265] in dimension two, as well as for a class of symmetric domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$ generalizing the domains studied by Jerison and Nadirashvili [J. Amer. Math. Soc. 13 (2000), 741-772]. Our method of proof is based on studying a vector-valued Laplace operator whose spectrum contains the spectrum of the Neumann Laplacian. This proof is essentially variational and does not require tools from stochastic analysis, nor does it use deformation arguments. In particular, it contains a new proof of the main result of Jerison and Nadirashvili.</description>

Abstract: M{\o}ller maps are identifications between the observables of a perturbatively interacting physical system and the observables of its underlying free (i.e. non-interacting) system. This work studies and characterizes obstructions to the existence of such identifications. The main results are existence and importantly also non-existence theorems, which in particular imply that M{\o}ller maps do not exist for non-Abelian Chern-Simons and Yang-Mills theories on globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Nonholonomic momentum map reduction and a Chaplygin-type foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a set-up for momentum map reduction of nonholonomic systems with symmetries, extending previous constructions in [3,25], based on the existence of certain conserved quantities and making essential use of the nonholonomic momentum bundle map of [10]. We show that the reductions of the momentum level sets carry an almost symplectic form codifying the reduced dynamics. These reduced manifolds are the leaves of the foliation associated with an almost Poisson bracket obtained by a (dynamically compatible) gauge transformation of the nonholonomic bracket. We show that each leaf is a "Chaplygin-type leaf", in the sense that it is isomorphic to a cotangent bundle with the canonical symplectic form plus a "magnetic term".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the overlaps of the ground states for the open spin chains after a change of one of the boundary magnetic fields. It can be considered as the first step toward the study of the boundary quench problem: behaviour of an open spin chain after an abrupt change of one boundary magnetic field.</description>

      <title>A lower semicontinuous time separation function for $C^0$ spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The time separation function (or Lorentzian distance function) is a fundamental object used in Lorentzian geometry. For smooth spacetimes it is known to be lower semicontinuous, and in fact, continuous for globally hyperbolic spacetimes. Moreover, an axiom for Lorentzian length spaces - a synthetic approach to Lorentzian geometry - is the existence of a lower semicontinuous time separation function. Nevertheless, the usual time separation function is $\textit{not}$ necessarily lower semicontinuous for $C^0$ spacetimes due to bubbling phenomena. In this paper, we introduce a class of curves called "nearly timelike" and show that the time separation function for $C^0$ spacetimes is lower semicontinuous when defined with respect to nearly timelike curves. Moreover, this time separation function agrees with the usual one when the metric is smooth. Lastly, sufficient conditions are found guaranteeing the existence of a nearly timelike maximizer between two points in a $C^0$ spacetime.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic lattices and two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic lattices are a new type of synthetic quantum matter emulated in circuit quantum electrodynamics and electric-circuit networks, where particles coherently hop on a discrete tessellation of two-dimensional negatively curved space. While real-space methods and a reciprocal-space hyperbolic band theory have been recently proposed to analyze the energy spectra of those systems, discrepancies between the two sets of approaches remain. In this work, we reconcile those approaches by first establishing an equivalence between hyperbolic band theory and $U(N)$ topological Yang-Mills theory on higher-genus Riemann surfaces. We then show that moments of the density of states of hyperbolic tight-binding models correspond to expectation values of Wilson loops in the quantum gauge theory and become exact in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Fiber bundle structure in Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi formulation of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12927v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim to provide a rigorous geometric framework for the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi formulation of General Relativity. As the starting point of this formulation consists in recasting General Relativity as an SU(2) gauge theory, it naturally lends itself to interpretation within the theory of principal bundles. The foundation of our framework is the spin structure, which connects the principal SU(2)-bundle construction with the Riemannian framework. The existence of the spin structure enlightens the geometric properties of the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi-Sen connection and the topological characteristics of the manifold. Within this framework, we are able to express the constraints of the physical theory in a coordinate-free way, using vector-valued forms that acquire a clear geometric interpretation.
  Using these geometric concepts, we analyze the phase space of the theory and discuss the implementation of symmetries through the automorphism group of the principal SU(2)-bundle. In particular, we demonstrate that the description of the kinematical constraints as vector-valued forms provides a natural implementation as momentum maps for the automorphism group action.</description>

      <title>On the spectrum of open strings in the Hard-Wall model of AdS/QCD: the role of $S^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of a classical open string representing a meson in the hard-wall geometry and consider the $S^5$ compact space. The existence of a confining region leads to a discrete set of string configurations parameterized by the number $n$ of complete turnarounds $S^5$ great circles. Unlike the conformal case, the string in the bulk can explore $S^5$ even in the case of equal boundary conditions on its endpoints. The string solutions are parameterized by an internal dimensionless conserved charge $l_n$. The $q\bar{q}$ potential is linear for large separations, and the string tension is sensitive to $l_n$.</description>

      <title>Constrained Hamiltonian dynamics for electrons in magnetic field and additional forces besides the Lorentz force acting on electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the forces acting on electrons in magnetic field including the constraints and a condition arising from quantum mechanics. The force is calculated as the electron mass, $m_e$, multiplied by the total time-derivative of the velocity field evaluated using the quantum mechanical many-electron wave function. The velocity field includes a term of the Berry connection from the many-body wave function; thereby, quantum mechanical effects are included. It is shown that additional important forces besides the Lorentz force exist; they include the gradient of the electron velocity field kinetic energy, the gradient of the chemical potential, and the `force' for producing topologically protected loop currents. These additional forces are shown to be important in superconductivity, electric current in metallic wires, and charging of capacitors.</description>

      <title>On Laplace equation solution in orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal coordinate systems enable expressing the boundary conditions of differential equations in accord with the physical boundaries of the problem. It can significantly simplify calculations. The orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal (SOS) coordinate system can be particularly useful for a physical processes description inside or in the vicinity of the bodies or particles with the geometry of an oblate spheroid. The interior solution of the Laplace equation in the SOS coordinates was recently found; however, the exterior solution was missing. The exterior solution of the azimuthally symmetric Laplace equation in the SOS coordinates is derived. In the steps leading to this solution, important formulas of the SOS algebra are found. Various forms of the Laplace operator in the SOS coordinates in azimuthally symmetric case are shown. General transformation between two different SOS coordinate systems is derived. It is determined that the SOS harmonics are physically the same as the solid harmonics. Further, a formula expressing any generalized Legendre polynomial as a finite sum of monomials is found. The reported relations have potential application in geophysics, astrophysics, electrostatics and solid state physics (e.g. ferroic inclusions).</description>

      <title>The Common Solution Space of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the solution space for the field equations of Einstein's General Relativity for various static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. We consider the vacuum case, represented by the Schwarzschild black hole; the de Sitter-Schwarzschild geometry, which includes a cosmological constant; the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m geometry, which accounts for the presence of charge. Additionally we consider the homogenenous and anisotropic locally rotational Bianchi II spacetime in the vacuum. Our analysis reveals that the field equations for these scenarios share a common three-dimensional group of point transformations, with the generators being the elements of the $D\otimes_{s}T_{2}$ Lie algebra, known as the semidirect product of dilations and translations in the plane. Due to this algebraic property the field equations for the aforementioned gravitational models can be expressed in the equivalent form of the null geodesic equations for conformally flat geometries. Consequently, the solution space for the field equations is common, and it is the solution space for the free particle in a flat space. This appoach open new directions on the construction of analytic solutions in gravitational physics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>A gradient flow model for ground state calculations in Wigner formalism based on density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a gradient flow model is proposed for conducting ground state calculations in Wigner formalism of many-body system in the framework of density functional theory. More specifically, an energy functional for the ground state in Wigner formalism is proposed to provide a new perspective for ground state calculations of the Wigner function. Employing density functional theory, a gradient flow model is designed based on the energy functional to obtain the ground state Wigner function representing the whole many-body system. Subsequently, an efficient algorithm is developed using the operator splitting method and the Fourier spectral collocation method, whose numerical complexity of single iteration is $O(n_{\rm DoF}\log n_{\rm DoF})$. Numerical experiments demonstrate the anticipated accuracy, encompassing the one-dimensional system with up to $2^{21}$ particles and the three-dimensional system with defect, showcasing the potential of our approach to large-scale simulations and computations of systems with defect.</description>
