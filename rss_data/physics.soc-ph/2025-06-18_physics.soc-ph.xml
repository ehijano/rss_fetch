      <title>Beyond Universality: Cultural Diversity in Music and Its Implications for Sound Design and Sonification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Audio Mostly (AM) conference has long been a platform for exploring the intersection of sound, technology, and culture. Despite growing interest in sonic cultures, discussions on the role of cultural diversity in sound design and sonification remain limited. This paper investigates the implicit biases and gaps within the discourse on music and sound aesthetics, challenging the notion of music as a 'universal language'. Through a historical and cross-cultural analysis of musicology and ethnomusicology, the profound influence of cultural context on auditory perception and aesthetic appraisal is highlighted. By drawing parallels between historical music practices and contemporary sound design, the paper advocates for a more inclusive approach that recognizes the diversity of sonic traditions. Using music as a case study, we underscore broader implications for sound design and sonification, emphasizing the need to integrate cultural perspectives into auditory design practices. A reevaluation of existing frameworks in sound design and sonification is proposed, emphasizing the necessity of culturally informed practices that resonate with global audiences. Ultimately, embracing cultural diversity in sound design is suggested to lead to richer, more meaningful auditory experiences and to foster greater inclusivity within the field.</description>

      <title>A Kinematic Constraint on Pedestrian Walking: Power-law Scaling between Critical Angular Velocity and Speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a statistical analysis of speed and angular velocity obtained from pedestrian experiments across nine distinct datasets. Experimental scenarios included crossing motion, unidirectional/bidirectional flows, bidirectional/four-directional crossing flows, pedestrian-vehicle interactions, unidirectional flow in a circular corridor, and circle antipode configurations. We applied filtering methods to reduce noise and analyzed the data at different sampling frequencies. The results reveal a universal power-law scaling between critical angular velocity and speed, with a scaling exponent of approximately -0.8. This relationship defines a bounded region in the speed-angular velocity phase space, suggesting a kinematic constraint on pedestrian motion.</description>

      <title>Detecting Narrative Shifts through Persistent Structures: A Topological Analysis of Media Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse? This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during crises, protests, and information shocks.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the gender divide: Authorship and acknowledgment in scientific publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The issue of gender bias in scientific publications has been the subject of ongoing debate. One aspect of this debate concerns whether women receive equal credit for their contributions compared to men. Conventional wisdom suggests that women are more likely to be acknowledged than listed as co-authors, a role that carries greater prestige. Here, we analyze data from hundreds of thousands of scientists across nine disciplines and a broad range of publications. Our results confirm persistent gender disparities: women are more frequently acknowledged than credited as co-authors, especially in roles involving investigation and analysis. To account for status and disciplinary effects, we examined collaboration pairs composed of highly cited (high-status) and less cited (low-status) scientists. In such collaborations, the highly cited scientist is more likely to be listed as a co-author, regardless of gender. Notably, highly cited women in these pairs are even more likely to be listed as co-authors than their male counterparts. These findings suggest that power dynamics and perceived success heavily influence how credit is distributed in scientific publishing. The results underscore the role of status in shaping authorship and call for a more nuanced understanding of how gender, power, and recognition interact. This research offers valuable insights for scientists, editors, and funding agencies committed to advancing equity in science.</description>

      <title>Duplication-divergence growing graph models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, it has been emphasized that the evolving structure of networks may be shaped by interaction principles that yield sparse graphs with a vertex degree distribution exhibiting an algebraic tail, and other structural traits that are not featured in traditional random graphs. In this respect, through a mean-field approach, this review tackles the statistical physics of graph models based on the interaction principle of duplication-divergence. Additional sophistications extending the duplication-divergence model are also reviewed as well as generalizations of other known models. Possible research gaps and related prior results are then discussed.</description>

      <title>Discrepancies in Pedestrian Crossing of Static vs. Dynamic Crowds: An Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate disparities in pedestrian crossing behaviors within static and dynamic crowds through experimental analysis. First, qualitative trajectory observations revealed significant behavioral differences in static and dynamic contexts. To quantitatively assess these discrepancies, we introduced a density metric termed the swarm factor. In static contexts, limited variations in speed and swarm factor were observed, which may contribute to the formation of cross-channels, a phenomenon of pedestrian self-organization (tactical level). In contrast, speed and swarm factor exhibited inverse synchronization in dynamic contexts, indicating density-dependent behavioral adaptation (operational level). Finally, orthogonal velocity analysis demonstrated a fundamental pattern in crossing motions: as global density increased, both instantaneous velocity and crossing velocity decreased, while transverse velocity remained stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An anecdotally common complaint regarding induction into the Gold Humanism Honor Society is the bias toward close friends during the initial nomination process. In this work, we numerically simulate the nomination process under different assumptions, demonstrate that collusion can be detected, and propose a simple strategy to correct for bias in the nomination process.</description>

      <title>Voter model can accurately predict individual opinions in online populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models of opinion dynamics describe how opinions are shaped in various environments. While these models are able to replicate general opinion distributions observed in real-world scenarios, their capacity to align with data at the user level remains mostly untested. We evaluate the capacity of the multi-state voter model with zealots to capture individual opinions in a fine-grained Twitter dataset collected during the 2017 French Presidential elections. Our findings reveal a strong correspondence between individual opinion distributions in the equilibrium state of the model and ground-truth political leanings of the users. Additionally, we demonstrate that discord probabilities accurately identify pairs of like-minded users. These results emphasize the validity of the voter model in complex settings, and advocate for further empirical evaluations of opinion dynamics models at the user level.</description>

      <title>Exploring blazars through sonification. Visual and auditory insights into multifrequency variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using open astronomical multifrequency databases, we constructed light curves and developed a comprehensive visualisation and sonification analysis for the blazars Mrk~501, Mrk~1501, Mrk~421, BL~Lacerta, AO~0235+164, 3C~66A, OJ~049, OJ~287, and PKS~J2134-0153. This study employed Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and Parameter Mapping Sonification (PMSon) techniques to generate waveforms, spectrograms, and sonifications. These representations demonstrate that data visualisation and sonification are powerful tools for analysing astronomical objects like blazars, providing insights into their multifrequency variability. This work highlights how sonification and visualisation can aid in identifying potential patterns, power variations, regularities, and gaps in the data. This multimodal approach also underscores the importance of inclusivity in scientific communication, offering accessible methods for exploring the complex behaviour of blazars.</description>
