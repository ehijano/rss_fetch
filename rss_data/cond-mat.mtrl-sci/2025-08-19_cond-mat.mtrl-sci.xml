      <title>Electro-thermal Co-design of High-power Vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky Diodes with High-permittivity Dielectric Field-plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents electrothermal co-design of vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) to enhance both heat dissipation and high field management in high-power applications. Here, we demonstrate device-level thermal management tailored for two vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBD structures that employed different edge termination techniques, such as field-plate and deep etch with sidewall field-plate, where the field-plate was formed with high-permittivity dielectric (BaTiO3). The localized thermal hot spots were detected at the Schottky contact edges near BaTiO3 dielectric based field-plate. However, a substantial reduction of the thermal hotspots was observed by forming the field-plate with BaTiO3 and thermally-conductive AlN insulator, where the AlN can effectively decrease Joule heating at interface and the high permittivity of BaTiO3 contributes to high field reduction. The deep etch and sidewall field-plate SBD structure further reduced accumulated heat and electric field near the critical anode edge by removing lateral depletion regions. We also analyzed thermal transport at dielectric/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 interfaces using Landauer approach that revealed significantly higher thermal boundary conductance (TBC) enabled by AlN compared to BaTiO3, attesting to the superior heat dissipation ability by BaTiO3/AlN field-plate than the BaTiO3-only configuration. Experimental investigation with vertical metal/AlN/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 diodes also extracted a high breakdown field (~11 MV/cm) of AlN, significantly exceeding the material breakdown field of \b{eta}-Ga2O3. This indicates that AlN can be an excellent choice for field-plate dielectric in vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs to provide both enhanced high field sustainability and improved heat dissipation in high-power applications.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Structural Characterization of Charged Polymers Involved in Moisture-Driven Direct Air Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels has led to urgent calls for effective carbon capture methods, with direct air capture (DAC) emerging as a promising solution. This study focuses on the structural characterization of commercially available alkaline anion-exchange membrane (AEM) polymers, Fumasep FAA-3 and IRA 900, for use in low-energy, moisture-driven DAC applications. A combination of X-ray diffraction, small and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to explore the structural features of these materials. X-ray scattering analysis revealed molecular ordering and large-scale structural organization in both materials, while humidity-induced changes highlighted the impact of moisture on structural properties. AFM surface analysis further indicated the presence of clustering, porosity, and swelling, which were corroborated by FIB-SEM and TEM imaging. These structural insights offer a deeper understanding of the behavior of AEM-DAC materials during CO2 capture and release, emphasizing the role of moisture in these processes. This work lays the foundation for the development of more energy-efficient DAC polymers, paving the way for improved CO2 capture technologies.</description>

      <title>Control of magnetic transition, metal-semiconductor transition, and magnetic anisotropy in noncentrosymmetric monolayer Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Se$_3$Te$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in two-dimensional materials have greatly expanded the family of ferromagnetic materials. The well-known 2D ferromagnets, such as CrI$_3$, Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, and Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ monolayers, are characterized by centrosymmetric crystal structures. In contrast, ferromagnetic ordering in 2D noncentrosymmetric materials remains an underexplored area. Here we report a Janus ferromagnet, Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Se$_3$Te$_3$ with inversion symmetry breaking, through first-principles calculations. This monolayer can undergo a ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic transformation and a metal-semiconductor transition under different strains. Additionally, the strength of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) can be modulated by electric field or strain. In particular, the magnetization easy axis can be altered from in-plane to out-of-plane under strain. We find that Te$_3$ atoms play a key role in determining the MAE, where contributions are primarily from $p_z / p_y$ and $p_x / p_y$ orbitals. This study of Janus ferromagnetic materials has provided a promising platform for the research on the control of magnetism by strain or electric field.</description>

      <title>Stable crack propagation in dislocation-engineered oxide visualized by double cleavage drilled compression test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding crack tip - dislocation interaction is critical for improving the fracture resistance of semi-brittle materials like room-temperature plastically deformable ceramics. Here, we use a modified double cleavage drilled compression (DCDC) specimen geometry, which facilitates stable crack propagation, to achieve in situ observation of crack tip - dislocation interaction. MgO specimens, furnished with dislocation-rich barriers, were employed to study how dislocations influence crack propagation. Crack progression was clearly observed to decelerate within dislocation-rich regions, slowing to 15% of its velocity as compared to the pristine crystal. Upon exiting these regions, cracks reaccelerated until reaching the next dislocation-rich barrier. Coupled phase field and crystal plasticity modeling replicates the experimental observations and provides mechanistic insight into crack tip - dislocation interactions. The aligned experiment and simulation results underscore the robustness of the technique and its potential to inform the design of more fracture-resistant ceramics via dislocations.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Amorphous Alloy Discovery: Data-Driven Property Prediction via General-Purpose Machine Learning Interatomic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While traditional trial-and-error methods for designing amorphous alloys are costly and inefficient, machine learning approaches based solely on composition lack critical atomic structural information. Machine learning interatomic potentials, trained on data from first-principles calculations, offer a powerful alternative by efficiently approximating the complex three-dimensional potential energy surface with near-DFT accuracy. In this work, we develop a general-purpose machine learning interatomic potential for amorphous alloys by using a dataset comprising 20400 configurations across representative binary and ternary amorphous alloys systems. The model demonstrates excellent predictive performance on an independent test set, with a mean absolute error of 5.06 meV/atom for energy and 128.51 meV/\r{A} for forces. Through extensive validation, the model is shown to reliably capture the trends in macroscopic property variations such as density, Young's modulus and glass transition temperature across both the original training systems and the compositionally modified systems derived from them. It can be directly applied to composition-property mapping of amorphous alloys. Furthermore, the developed interatomic potential enables access to the atomic structures of amorphous alloys, allowing for microscopic analysis and interpretation of experimental results, particularly those deviating from empirical trends.This work breaks the long-standing computational bottleneck in amorphous alloys research by developing the first general-purpose machine learning interatomic potential for amorphous alloy systems. The resulting framework provides a robust foundation for data-driven design and high-throughput composition screening in a field previously constrained by traditional simulation limitations.</description>

      <title>Domain Wall-mediated Interfacial Ferroelectric Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial ferroelectricity offers a promising platform for ultrafast, low-power memory devices. While previous studies have attributed polarization switching to full-layer sliding, the symmetry constraints pose fundamental limitations. By integrating first-principles calculations, machine learning methods, and experimental validations, we show that domain walls within in-plane polarization break C3 symmetry, enabling polarization switching under out-of-plane electric fields. Local polarization vectors deviate to response to the field, leading to local reconstruction, and ultimately drives the migration of domain walls. This mechanism bears clear resemblance to that in traditional ferroelectrics. Notably, different domain wall types result in distinct switching behaviors, which play a crucial role in determining the reversibility of polarization switching. We then propose strategies beyond ideal conditions to achieve non-volatile ferroelectric switching, successfully realized by our experiments. These insights clarify the microscopic switching mechanism in hexagonal interfacial ferroelectrics, providing a basis for future nanoelectronics applications.</description>

      <title>Microscopic model of the operation of the Single-chalcogenide X-point Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ovonic threshold switching is the key process for several applications of chalcogenide alloys including phase change memories and selector elements in cross-points arrays. Very recently, it has been shown that the threshold switching voltage VT depends on the polarity of the applied field. This feature has been already exploited in the realization of the Single Chalcogenide X-point Memory (SXM) in which a single film of a chalcogenide alloy can serve as both a memory and selector unit. In this work, we provide a microscopic understanding of the polarity-dependent VT by leveraging electrical and physical measurements, numerical simulations based on technology computer aided design (TCAD) and electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). We developed a Graded Band Gap (GBG) model in which an inhomogeneous distribution of localized electronic states in the gap is established by the opposite effect of a strong electric field at the cathode and a high density of electrons in the conduction band at the anode. The model is suitable to reproduce several features of the programming window, including its dependence on temperature, thickness and composition of the chalcogenide alloy. The microscopic understanding that we gained on the SXM operation lays the foundation for important improvements in the memory design and in the selection of better performing alloys for applications in enabling memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of magnetic exchange parameters and magnon dispersions in NiO and MnO from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-wave excitations are fundamental to understanding the behavior of magnetic materials and hold promise for future information and communication technologies. Yet, modeling these accurately in transition-metal compounds remains challenging, starting from the self-interaction errors affecting localized and partially filled $d$-orbitals in density-functional theory (DFT) with (semi-)local functionals. In this work, we compare three advanced first-principles approaches for computing magnetic exchange parameters and magnon dispersions in NiO and MnO, all based on a common DFT+$U$ ground state with ab initio Hubbard $U$ values obtained from density-functional perturbation theory. Two methods extract exchange parameters directly: one via total-energy differences using the four-state mapping ($\Delta E$), and the other via the magnetic force theorem (MFT) using infinitesimal spin rotations. Magnon dispersions are then obtained from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian through linear spin-wave theory (LSWT). The third approach, time-dependent density-functional perturbation theory with $U$ (TDDFPT+$U$), yields magnon dispersions directly from the dynamical spin susceptibility, with exchange parameters fitted a posteriori, for comparison, via LSWT. Our results show that TDDFPT+$U$ and the Heisenberg model based on $\Delta E$-derived parameters align well with experimental neutron scattering data, whereas the MFT-based approach shows larger discrepancies, possibly due to some inherent approximations and limitations of the particular implementation used. This study benchmarks the accuracy of state-of-the-art first-principles techniques for spin-wave modeling and contributes to advancing reliable computational tools for the study and design of magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Critical Importance of Grain Boundaries to the Conductivity of Polycrystalline Molecular Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft-solid molecular crystals consist of crystalline grains and fluid grain boundaries (GB) that enhance the grain binding and transport of Li+ ions between the grains. The total ionic conductivity consists of ion migration in both the grains and GBs. To unravel these contributions in adiponitrile (Adpn)-LiPF6 molecular crystals, the GB volume fraction was varied by changing the size of the crystals and the adiponitrile/LiPF6 molar ratio. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations indicate that ion motion was sub-diffusive in the grains and well-diffusive in the GBs, with GBs characterized as disordered nano-confined regions of higher charge carrier concentration (1M) than in saturated LiPF6-Adpn solutions (0.04M), and ions predominantly solvated by -CN groups with few contact ion pairs. The diffusivity in the GBs is at least an order of magnitude higher than in the crystalline grains. The emergent picture is the grains as a reservoir of ions that migrate to the fast-conducting GBs.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Nonequilibrium Enhancement of Electron-Phonon Interaction in 2H-MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding nonequilibrium electron-phonon interactions at the microscopic level and on ultrafast timescales is a central goal of modern condensed matter physics. Combining time- and angle-resolved extreme ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy with constrained density functional perturbation theory, we demonstrate that photoexcited carrier density can serve as a tuning knob to enhance electron-phonon interactions in nonequilibrium conditions. Specifically, nonequilibrium band structure mapping and valley-resolved ultrafast population dynamics in semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide 2H-MoTe$_2$ reveal band-gap renormalizations and reduced population lifetimes as photoexcited carrier densities increase. Through theoretical analysis of photoinduced electron and phonon energy and linewidth renormalizations, we attribute these transient features to nonequilibrium modifications of electron-phonon coupling matrix elements. The present study advances our understanding of microscopic coupling mechanisms enabling control over relaxation pathways in driven solids.</description>

      <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Enhanced by Synergetic Interactions among Photon Phonon and Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is limited by inefficient CO2 activation and poor solar spectrum utilization. Here, we discovered and revealed the vibration coupling mechanism among photons, phonons, and molecules, which remarkably enhances photocatalytic catalysis of CO2 into fuels. We designed the nitrogen-doped Cu2O-based catalyst loaded onto the quartz optical substrate. The N-doping Cu2O converts linearly geometry of adsorbed CO2 molecules, which efficiently lowers the activation barrier and facilitates CO2 dissociation. Once the Cu-based catalyst is combined with a micro-pillar quartz film, the system induces vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between the asymmetric CO2 stretching mode and surface phonon polariton resonances. These resonances arise from the photothermal conversion of incident solar photons on the micro-pillars. The resonant coupling phenomena were further verified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy using Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS), which directly confirmed the interactions between molecular vibrations and photonic-phononic modes. The synergetic functions originated from this hybrid architecture achieve a CO yield of 167.7 umol h-1 g-1 under pure water conditions, which is the highest reported yield for Cu2O-based photocatalysts with 46% enhancement over non-VSC systems. This work uncovers a novel photo-thermal mechanism. It further provides a new strategy to control bond activation in photocatalytic CO2 conversion through light-vibration-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions driven by solute concentration, temperature, and pressure in uranium-6wt % niobium alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An angular-dependent potential for the U-Nb system is developed based on an existing ADP for U and a new EAM potential for Nb through fitting flexible cross-interaction functions and alloy parameters to experimental and first-principles data, enabling accurate prediction of phase transitions (alpha to gamma driven by solute concentration; alpha-prime to gamma under temperature in U-6Nb alloy), elastic properties, defect energetics, and mixed enthalpy. The potential reliably reproduces melting points of U-Nb solid solutions and captures lattice parameter expansion of gamma U-6Nb. Notably, it correctly predicts Hugoniot relations and equations of state up to about 90 GPa and resolves the alpha-prime to gamma transition under static high pressure. Combined with atomic simulations, we reveal a twinning-coupled alpha-prime to gamma transition of U-6Nb under high pressures: {112}gamma twins form via nanosecond-scale twinning precursors generated during the transient adiabatic compressions. The static phase transition pressure is predicted to be 54.5 GPa, comparable to 67.2 GPa by first-principles calculations. Besides, our result suggests that U-6Nb single-crystal would experience a nonlinear elastic relaxation before yielding plastically at 3.1 GPa (shear stress: 0.9 GPa). The results in this work help resolve long-standing discrepancies in understanding the abnormal shear stress relaxation mechanisms under high-pressure shock loading.</description>

      <title>Chiral quantum magnets with optically and catalytically active spin ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral quantum magnets with spin-states separated by a large energy gap are technologically attractive but difficult to realize. Geometrically frustrated topological states with nanoscale chirality may offer a chemical pathway to such materials. However, room temperature spin misalignment, weakness of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, and high energy requirements for lattice distortions set high physicochemical barriers for their realization. Here, we show that layered iron oxyhydroxides (LIOX) address these challenges due to chirality transfer from surface ligands into spin-states of dimerized FeO6 octahedra with zig-zag stacking. The intercalation of chiral amino acids induces angular displacements in the antiferromagnetic spin pairs with a helical coupling of magnetic moments along the screw axis of the zig-zag chains, or helical spin-ladders. Unlike other chiral magnets, the spin states in LIOX are chemically and optically accessible, they display strong optical resonances with helicity-matching photons and enable spin-selective charge transport. The static rather than dynamic polarization of spin ladders in LIOX makes them particularly suitable for catalysis. Room-temperature spin pairing, field-tunability, environmental robustness, and synthetic simplicity make LIOX and its intercalates a uniquely practical family of quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Structural contribution to light-induced gap suppression in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12363v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An excitonic insulator is a material that hosts an exotic ground state, where an energy gap opens due to spontaneous condensation of bound electron-hole pairs. Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is a promising candidate for this type of material, but the coexistence of a structural phase transition with the gap opening has led to a long-standing debate regarding the origin of the insulating gap. Here we employ MeV ultrafast electron diffraction to obtain quantitative insights into the atomic displacements in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ following photoexcitation, which has been overlooked in previous time-resolved spectroscopy studies. In conjunction with first-principles calculations using the measured atomic displacements, we find that the structural change can largely account for the photoinduced reduction in the energy gap without considering excitonic effects. Our work illustrates the importance of a quantitative reconstruction of individual atomic pathways during nonequilibrium phase transitions, paving the way for a mechanistic understanding of a diverse array of phase transitions in correlated materials where lattice dynamics can play a pivotal role.</description>

      <title>CoRuTiGe: A Possible Spin Gapless Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report experimental and theoretical investigations on the quaternary Heusler alloy CoRuTiGe, synthesized using the arc melting technique. Crystal structure analysis reveals a tetragonal structure at room temperature. Magnetization measurements as a function of temperature and magnetic field indicate ferromagnetic nature with a saturation magnetization of 0.681 mB/f.u. at 5 K. The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity shows a nearly linear decrease in the high-temperature range, indicating the spin gapless semiconductor like behavior of the material. This SGS nature is further supported by the temperature-independent carrier concentration and mobility. Hall effect analysis reveals that the anomalous Hall effect in CoRuTiGe arises from both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Additionally, a well-defined symmetric negative magnetoresistance is observed at low temperatures. These findings suggest that CoRuTiGe holds significant promise for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Prediction of Magnetic Proximity Effect in van der Waals Heterostructures: From Atoms to Moir\'e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning framework that efficiently predicts large-scale proximity-induced magnetism in van der Waals heterostructures, overcoming the high computational cost of density functional theory (DFT). We apply it to graphene/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, which exhibits a previously unrecognized dichotomy. Unlike the spin polarization at the Fermi level, which follows the pseudospin, the proximity-induced magnetic moments vary across carbon atoms, defying analytical modeling. To address this, we develop a Random Forest model trained on DFT data and employ Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions descriptors to map the local ($\sim 2\,$nm$^2$) atomic-scale geometry to the carbon magnetic moments. Besides demonstrating locality, the model reveals rich magnetic moir\'e textures. Crucially, this method can be broadly applied to orbital and spin proximity effects that are highly sensitive to local atomic environments and are beyond analytical description.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabaticity under compression in metastable carbon monoxide-nitroxide mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) both undergo profound structural and chemical transformations when compressed. While their individual high-P/T phase diagrams have been mapped in considerable detail, comparatively little attention has been paid to the mixtures in which the two species can couple through oxygen transfer, charge redistribution, and nonadiabatic dissociation pathways. Here we use comprehensive ab initio adiabatic/nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, essentially a diabatic trajectory stitching approach, that chart the evolution of CO-N2O mixtures from van-der-Waals fluids to extended amorphous network solids over the range 0-160 GPa and 300-1500 K. We emphasize on (i) the sequence of gas to molecular crystal to polymerized amorphous solid reactive transitions that arise from an interplay between thermal and compression effects in metastable C-N-O mixtures, (ii) the role of N2O unimolecular dissociation in lowering the onset pressure for CO polymerization, and (iii) the emergence of nonadiabatic pathways, via thermal unimolecular dissociation of N2O, accompanied by spin-transition in oxygen atoms that can make C-N-O systems deviate from Born-Oppenheimer dynamics. This dominates the chemistry once the mixture enters the regime of bond-breaking temperatures (T&gt;900 K).</description>

      <title>Operando Electron Microscopy of Nanoscale Electronic Devices on Non-Conductive Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving operating conditions comparable to ``bulk'' electronic devices, such as thin film capacitors, during \textit{operando} electron microscopy remains challenging, particularly when devices are grown on non-conductive substrates. Limited precision of focused ion beam milling for sample preparation often necessitates the use of conductive substrates or artificially thick layers that differ from actual device architectures. These modifications can alter native strain, electrostatic boundary conditions, and ultimately device response. Here, we present a generic and versatile workflow for \textit{operando} biasing of thin-film capacitors in the (scanning) transmission electron microscope, including sample fabrication and device operation. By introducing a patterned insulating barrier adjacent to the bulk-characterized capacitors, our approach enables sample preparation without altering the original film structure. As a case study, we apply the method to a piezoelectric thin-film capacitor grown on an insulating substrate, and demonstrate that it preserves the boundary-condition-sensitive domain switching at the atomic scale under applied electric fields. Overall, the process can help to establish a foundation for systematic \textit{operando} studies of complex thin-film systems under representative bulk testing geometries.</description>

      <title>Robust Topological Conduction in Bi2 Bi2Se3 Superlattices at Ambient Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically protected surface states have garnered significant attention due to their robustness against perturbations and potential applications in optoelectronics. Bi2 Bi2Se3 is a topological semimetal composed of a 2D bismuthene sheet and a Bi2Se3 quintuple layer, forming an intrinsic superlattice. This study investigates the electronic structure and edge states of Bi2 Bi2Se3 [001] oriented films under ambient conditions through conducting atomic force microscopy (C-AFM). Point I-V spectroscopy and current imaging are used to characterize the surface and local transport properties of bismuthene and Bi2Se3 terminated layers. Our measurements reveal force dependent shifts in conduction mechanisms in both bismuthene and Bi2Se3, transitioning from direct tunneling (DT) at low forces and low biases, to Fowler Nordheim tunneling (FNT) at low forces and high biases, and eventually to a more ohmic like behavior at the highest forces. Under DT conditions on the bismuthene termination, we observed the Dirac cone in the dI/dV spectroscopy. Edge states are observed along the perimeter of the (001) terraces for both terminations, and are observed to have higher conductivity than the local terrace. Force-dependent imaging revealed an increase in the width of the edge state as force increased, until the conductive edge state appeared to cover the entire terrace. Furthermore, terrace heights display a force dependent distortion from the high tip forces, which indicates that the transition to the ohmic-like contact regime on either termination results from a complex interplay between strain and tip induced effects. All measurements were performed under ambient conditions, which demonstrates the robustness of the topological and edge states to ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Understanding high photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 high-pressure columbite phase by experiments and first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The clean production of hydrogen as a zero-emission fuel can be done using photocatalysis, with TiO2 being one of the most promising photocatalysts. However, the activity of TiO2 anatase and rutile phases is still limited. In this study, an oxygen-deficient high-pressure phase of TiO2, columbite, is stabilized by a high-pressure torsion method. The phase is utilized as an active photocatalyst for hydrogen production, and the mechanism of its high activity is examined using density functional theory (DFT). The activity of columbite appears to be experimentally higher than that of the anatase phase. DFT calculations revealed that columbite does not have a narrow electronic bandgap, but its optical bandgap and light absorbance are improved by oxygen vacancies more significantly compared to anatase. Moreover, the water adsorption energy is higher and the surface activation energy for water splitting on the (101) atomic plane of columbite is lower than that for the active planes of anatase. In conclusion, although columbite is not a low-bandgap semiconductor, its large light absorbance and high surface catalytic activity make it a promising candidate for photocatalytic reactions.</description>

      <title>Hubbard energy dependence of electronic structures in rare-earth monoxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To realize the significant potential of optical materials such as strongly electron-correlated open-shell rare-earth monoxides, understanding the electron-localization Hubbard parameters ($U$) is of central importance. The Hubbard energy is believed to be material specific and constant. However, it has recently been pointed out that even subtle structural changes can induce changes in $U$ parameters. For LuO, we theoretically evaluated $U$ energy dependence of the differential transmission and reflectivity spectra to assess the impact of $U$ energy on the optical properties. In addition to the conventional derivative-like contribution, we observed the influence of the Drude tail owing to $U$-induced plasma energy modulation. Given the typical detection sensitivity of differential spectroscopy ($\sim 1 \times 10^{-4}$), even a few meV modulations in $U$ are sufficient for a detectable spectral response.</description>

      <title>Structural, optical, and dielectric properties of Cr-doped ZnO films via DC magnetron sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cr-doped ZnO films were fabricated by a new but feasible method, that is, annealing Cr-Zn layers deposited via DC magnetron sputtering in air. Microstructures of the films were investigated using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy, intrinsic point defects were identified via photoluminescence spectroscopy, and optical and dielectric properties were analyzed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer and dielectric spectrometer, respectively. It was found that the average grain sizes decrease (56.34 - 39.50 nm), the band gap increases (from 3.18 to 3.23 eV), and the transmittance (at 600 nm) decreases (from 91% to 83%) with increasing Cr. Two activation energies of conduction increase after doping Cr, indicating enhanced temperature stability. At optimal Cr levels, ZnO films exhibit high transmittance and conductivity, exhibiting potential for transparent electrode development. This method can be extended to other doped ZnO films, such as Al-doped ZnO transparent electrodes, to achieve simultaneous improvements in transmittance, conductivity, and stability for flexible and wearable applications.</description>

      <title>Effects of Defects on Thermal Transport across Solid/Solid Heterogeneous Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the fabrication of heterogeneous structures inside chips, impurities and defects are inevitably introduced. However, the mechanism by which defects affect interfacial heat transport remains unclear. In this work, a microscale thermal transport model is developed by combining first-principles calculations with Monte Carlo simulations, explicitly accounting for the effects of defects. The effects of defect concentration and location on thermal transport characteristics are investigated for four heterointerfaces: Si/SiC, GaN/SiC, Si/Diamond, and GaN/Diamond. Temperature distribution, spectral thermal conductance, average phonon scattering numbers, and interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) are compared under different conditions. The results show that, for Si/SiC, Si/Diamond, and GaN/Diamond interfaces, introducing defects weakens heat transport. Higher defect concentration leads to lower ITC. Furthermore, when defects are in SiC or Diamond, which have broader phonon spectral distributions, their impact on ITC is weaker. For the GaN/SiC interface, defects in GaN reduce ITC, while defects in SiC enhance ITC. At a defect concentration of 0.05, ITC decreases by 54.1% when defects are present in GaN, but increases by 57.2% when defects are present in SiC. This behavior arises from defect-induced phonon energy redistribution near the interface. The redistribution increases the population of low-frequency phonons, which are more capable of crossing the interface, thus enhancing heat transfer. This study enriches the fundamental understanding of thermal transport across semiconductor heterointerfaces and guides the design and fabrication of high-ITC heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Chiral Altermagnetic Second-Order Topological Phases and Sign-Reversible Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral materials are rare in nature, yet they play a fundamental role in modern physics due to their unconventional topological properties and transport responses. While chiral charge and structural orders have been extensively studied, chiral magnetic order -- particularly in altermagnets (AMs) -- remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the experimentally well-characterized three-dimensional metal-organic framework K[Co(HCOO)$_3$] represents the first realization of a chiral second-order topological insulator with altermagnetic order. This system hosts $\emph{g}$-wave spin-split bands, controllable second-order topological states, and chirality-locked anomalous transport properties. Its second-order topological phase manifests as alternating spin-up and spin-down hinge modes along the boundaries of hexagonal nanotubes. Remarkably, these spin-polarized hinge states can be switched through lattice chiral inversion. Simultaneously, the anomalous Hall effect and magneto-optical effects exhibit reversed signs in left/right-handed enantiomers, substantiating a universal chirality-controlled response across both electronic and optical channels. Our results establish chiral AMs as a promising platform for non-volatile topological spintronics, opening new avenues for manipulating quantum transport via lattice chirality.</description>

      <title>Entropy-driven phase transition in a non-collinear antiferromagnet due to higher-order exchange interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The triple-Q state arises due to the superposition of three symmetry equivalent spin spirals stabilized by higher-order exchange interactions. It has been predicted more than 20 years ago but was only recently discovered in a Mn monolayer on the Re(0001) surface. To date little is known about the thermodynamic properties of this intriguing non-coplanar spin state. Here, we reveal a low-temperature phase transition between the triple-Q and the row-wise antiferromagnetic state in this system via Monte Carlo simulations based on an atomistic spin model parametrized by density functional theory. By modeling the free energy landscape in terms of thermal excitations we derive an analytical expression of the partition function, which allows us to prove that the phase transition is driven by entropy. The predicted phase transition is not unique to Mn/Re(0001) but appears for a wide range of magnetic interaction parameters and is expected to occur also for other multi-Q states.</description>

      <title>Neutralizing Optical Defects in GeSn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reports of photoluminescence from GeSn grown on Ge substrates by molecular beam epitaxy have been limited. We find that one limiting factor to observing photoluminescence is due to localized defect states marked by photoluminescence at 2400 nm and originating from the Ge substrate and buffer layer. In this study, we report on an optical study utilizing doped Ge(001) substrates to effectively suppress defect-related photoluminescence in GeSn layers by filling localized defect trap states. For this experiment, a GeSn layer with Sn content up to 10.5% was grown on a doped Ge(001) substrate. Analysis of the physics of the photoluminescence spectrum collected from the GeSn thin film shows an emission at the expected wavelength of 2300 nm for 10.5% Sn content and the absence of the typically observed defect related signal at 2400 nm. This understanding is further confirmed using short pulse optical excitation of the GeSn grown on undoped Ge substrates.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Order in Pulsed Laser Deposited (Fe,Ni)5GeTe2 Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the successful growth of highly textured thin films of (Fe,Ni)5GeTe2 two-dimensional ferromagnet on c-plane sapphire using pulsed laser deposition. Structural characterization via X-ray diffraction confirms preferential orientation along the (000l) direction, indicative of a high crystallographic texture. These films of van der Waals (vdW) type interplanar bonding exhibit robust ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature reaching = 495 K. Electrical transport measurements reveal a clear anomalous Hall effect, with an anomalous Hall conductivity and Hall angle (%) of = 20 ohm-1cm-1 and = 0.90, respectively. Furthermore, the magnetoresistance displays a pronounced dependence on film thickness, highlighting the tunability of spin-dependent transport in these vdW ferromagnetic thin films.</description>

      <title>Lessons from Chalcopyrites for Scaling Thin Film Perovskite Photovoltaic Technology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for photovoltaic (PV) technologies that are lightweight, flexible, and seamlessly integrated into diverse applications has propelled interest in thin-film solar cells. Among these, Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGS) and metal halide perovskites have garnered significant attention in the past and present, respectively. While CIGS reached commercial readiness after decades of refinement, their large-scale deployment was hindered by manufacturing complexity, scale-up challenges, and a lack of coordination between materials, device design, and production systems. Perovskite solar cells, despite setting record efficiencies at an unprecedented pace, now face similar challenges on their path to commercialization: ensuring long-term stability, translating laboratory performance to scalable architectures, and aligning with industrial realities. In this perspective, we revisit the CIGS experience not as a benchmark, but as a blueprint, highlighting how its successes and failures can inform a more deliberate and durable trajectory for perovskite PV. Bridging this historical perspective with the current frontier, we propose that the future of perovskites depends not only on continued innovation, but on learning from past thin-film PV experience to avoid its repetition.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Corrosion Resistance of Aluminum Alloys Through AI and ML Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Corrosion poses a significant challenge to the performance of aluminum alloys, particularly in marine environments. This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict and optimize corrosion resistance, utilizing a comprehensive open-source dataset compiled from various sources. The dataset encompasses corrosion rate data and environmental conditions, preprocessed to standardize units and formats. We explored two different approaches, a direct approach, where the material's composition and environmental conditions were used as inputs to predict corrosion rates; and an inverse approach, where corrosion rate served as the input to identify suitable material compositions as output. We employed and compared three distinct ML methodologies for forward predictions: Random Forest regression, optimized via grid search; a feed-forward neural network, utilizing ReLU activation and Adam optimization; and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), implemented with GPyTorch and employing various kernel functions. The Random Forest and neural network models provided predictive capabilities based on elemental compositions and environmental conditions. Notably, Gaussian Process Regression demonstrated superior performance, particularly with hybrid kernel functions. Log-transformed GPR further refined predictions. This study highlights the efficacy of ML, particularly GPR, in predicting corrosion rates and material properties.</description>

      <title>Deformation Driven Suction Cups: A Mechanics-Based Approach to Wearable Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wearable electronics are emerging as essential tools for health monitoring, haptic feedback, and human-computer interactions. While stable contact at the device-body interface is critical for these applications, it remains challenging due to the skin's softness, roughness, and mechanical variability. Existing methods, such as grounding structures or adhesive tapes, often suffer from contact loss, limited repeatability, and restrictions on the types of electronics they can support. Suction-based adhesives offer a promising alternative by generating negative pressure without requiring tight bands or chemical adhesives. However, most existing cup designs rely on rigid-surface assumptions and overlook mechanical interactions between suction cups and skin. Inspired by traditional cupping therapies, we present a suction-based adhesive system that attaches through elastic deformation and recovery. Using analytical modeling, numerical simulations, and experiments, we present a mechanics-based framework showing how suction performance depends on cup geometry, substrate compliance, and interfacial adhesion. We show that cup geometry should be tailored to substrate stiffness. Wide, flat suction cups perform well on rigid surfaces but fail on soft ones like skin due to substrate intrusion into the chamber. Narrow and tall domes better preserve recoverable volume and generate stronger suction. To improve sealing on rough, dry skin, we introduce a soft, tacky interfacial layer informed by a contact mechanics model. Using our design principles for skin suction adhesives, we demonstrate secure attachment of rigid and flexible components including motion sensors, haptic actuators, and electrophysiological electrodes across diverse anatomical regions. These findings provide a fundamental basis for designing the next generation of skin-friendly adhesives for wearable electronics.</description>

      <title>Evidence for ultra-water-rich ammonia hydrates stabilized in icy exoplanetary mantles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of the water-ammonia system at high pressure-high temperature conditions is important for modeling the internal dynamics of exoplanet icy mantles. Conventionally, mixtures of ammonia hemihydrate AHH (2:1 ammonia-water molar ratio) and H2O ice VII have been regarded as the ultimate solid phase assembly in the system. Here we report evidence for chemical reactions between AHH and ice VII above 750 K and 16 GPa that stabilize water-rich ammonia hydrates, including a novel ultra-water rich hydrate NH3.6H2O (1:6 ratio) coexisting with ammonia dihydrate ADH (1:2 ratio) and excess ice VII. This assembly is stable up to at least 30 GPa and 1600 K and can be quenched to room temperature. Our results demonstrate that water-rich ammonia hydrates are favored in the icy mantle of 1-2 MEarth exoplanets regardless of the ammonia content of the hydrate crystallized during accretion and/or evolution as long as excess H2O ice is available. The buoyancy contrast between water-rich hydrates and ice VII may lead to chemical stratification in exoplanet icy mantles, hence affecting their thermal evolution.</description>

      <title>Persistence is All You Need -- A Topological Lens on Microstructural Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microstructure critically governs the properties of materials used in energy and chemical engineering technologies, from catalysts and filters to thermal insulators and sensors. Therefore, accurate design is based on quantitative descriptors of microstructural features. Here we show that eight key descriptors can be extracted by a single workflow that fuses computational topology with assembly-learning-based regression. First, 1312 synthetic three-dimensional microstructures were generated and evaluated using established algorithms, and a labeled data set of ground-truth parameters was built. Converting every structure into a persistence image allowed us to train a deep neural network that predicts the eight descriptors. In an independent test set, the model achieved on average R^2 ~ 0.84 and Pearson r ~ 0.92, demonstrating both precision and generality. The approach provides a unified and scalable tool for rapid characterization of functional porous materials.</description>

      <title>Load-Balanced Diffusion Monte Carlo Method with Lattice Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is a stochastic approach for solving the many-body Schr\"odinger equation without resorting to one-body approximations. QMC algorithms are readily parallelizable via ensembles of $N_w$ walkers, making them well suited to large-scale high-performance computing. Among the QMC techniques, Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is widely regarded as the most reliable, since it provides the projection onto the ground state of a given Hamiltonian under the fixed-node approximation. One practical realization of DMC is the Lattice Regularized Diffusion Monte Carlo (LRDMC) method, which discretizes the Hamiltonian within the Green's Function Monte Carlo framework. DMC methods - including LRDMC - employ the so-called branching technique to stabilize walker weights and populations. At the branching step, walkers must be synchronized globally; any imbalance in per-walker workload can leave CPU or GPU cores idle, thereby degrading overall hardware utilization. The conventional LRDMC algorithm intrinsically suffers from such load imbalance, which grows as $\log(N_w)$, rendering it less efficient on modern parallel architectures. In this work, we present an LRDMC algorithm that inherently addresses the load imbalance issue and achieves significantly improved weak-scaling parallel efficiency. Using the binding energy calculation of a water-methane complex as a test case, we demonstrated that the conventional and load-balanced LRDMC algorithms yield consistent results. Furthermore, by utilizing the Leonardo supercomputer equipped with NVIDIA A100 GPUs, we demonstrated that the load-balanced LRDMC algorithm can maintain extremely high parallel efficiency ($\sim$98\%) up to 512 GPUs (corresponding to $N_{\rm w}= 51200$), together with a speedup of $\times~1.24$ if directly compared with the conventional LRDMC algorithm with the same number of walkers.</description>

      <title>Bridging Molecular Simulation and Process Modeling for Predictive Multicomponent Adsorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of multicomponent adsorption equilibria across pressures, temperatures, and compositions remain a central challenge for designing energy-efficient adsorption-based separation processes. Traditional approaches, including model fitting and ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST), often fail to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, and transferability under process-relevant conditions. Here, we introduce a material-to-process modeling framework that integrates macrostate probability distributions (MPDs) from flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations with rigorous cyclic process optimization. MPDs directly capture the joint occupancy distributions of adsorbates, producing reweightable landscape that enable high-fidelity mixture adsorption equilibria without repeated simulations or model assumptions. We show that coupling this statistical mechanical foundation with process modeling delivers accurate and computationally efficient evaluations for binary and ternary gas mixture separations. This integration establishes MPD-based modeling as a generalized method for predictive multicomponent adsorption equilibria, accelerating the discovery and design of adsorbent materials for carbon capture and other separation challenges.</description>

      <title>Atom-surface interaction induced by quenched monopolar charge disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the modification to the energy level shifts of an atom induced by the quenched monopolar charge disorder inside the bulk of neighboring dielectric slabs as well as their surfaces. By assuming that the charge disorder follows Gaussian statistics with a zero mean, we find that the disorder generally results in a downward shift of the energy levels, which corresponds to an attractive force that can compete with and overcome the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force for sufficiently large atom-surface separations $z_0$. For an atom near a single semi-infinite slab with bulk (surface) charge disorder, the shift decays as $z_0^{-1}$ ($z_0^{-2}$). For both surface and bulk disorder, the shift is proportional to the variance of the charge disorder density. In addition, we investigate the behavior of the charge disorder-induced energy level shift for an atom confined to a vacuum gap between two coplanar and semi-infinite slabs of the same dielectric material, finding that the position of net zero disorder-induced force occurs closer to the surface of the slab with the smaller charge disorder variance.</description>

      <title>Transport evidence of current-induced nematic Dirac valleys in a parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Itinerant antiferromagnets with broken time-reversal symmetry have recently attracted attention, since their spin-split bands enable large magnetotransport responses comparable to ferromagnets despite the negligible spontaneous magnetisation. When the inversion symmetry is further broken by the antiferromagnetic order, the emerging odd-parity multipole order renders the bands spin-degenerate but asymmetric in the momentum space. For such parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnets, it has been predicted that electronic nematicity is induced by current, allowing unconventional nonlinear transport phenomena. However, their experimental evidence has been lacking. Here, we report nonreciprocal angular magnetoresistance in the layered Dirac material SrMnBi$_2$ with parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnetic order in its Mn-Bi layers. By quantitatively modelling the angular and field dependencies using a phenomenological framework, we reveal that the observed nonreciprocal interlayer resistivity arises from the broken four-fold symmetry of the Dirac valleys in the Bi square net adjacent to the Mn-Bi layer. Furthermore, we demonstrate the alignment of parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnetic domains via current-field cooling, achieving electric-magnetic control of the $f$-wave polarity in momentum space. The observed switchable nonreciprocal transport associated with current-induced valley symmetry breaking paves the way for novel antiferromagnetic spintronic and valleytronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ammonia, a critical chemical fertilizer and a potential hydrogen carrier, can be sustainably synthesized from atmospheric nitrogen and water under ambient conditions through photocatalysis. In this study, high-entropy oxides with d0 and mixed d0+d10 cationic configurations are introduced as a new group of catalysts for nitrogen fixation and photocatalytic ammonia production. The oxides exhibit impressive efficiency in ammonia production compared to binary oxides, while the efficiency is improved by using a mixed cationic configuration. It was shown that the incorporation of d10 elements, such as gallium and zinc, boosts the photocatalytic reactions by improving light absorbance, charge separation and charge lifetime. These findings demonstrate the potential of high-entropy oxides as next-generation photocatalysts for green ammonia synthesis, offering an effective alternative to conventional catalytic systems.</description>

      <title>From plasma to pattern: observation and characterization of periodic structure formation in dielectric breakdown channels of electron-irradiated insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric breakdown of insulators is one of the most common failure modes of electronics in the high-radiation environment of space, but its mechanics remain poorly understood. When electron-irradiated polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) undergoes breakdown, the resulting channels exhibit striking periodic structures with characteristic wavelengths ~80 {\mu}m in the recently identified ivy-mode channels. These previously unobserved modulations offer unique insights into the physics of ultra-fast dielectric breakdown. Through materials characterization and theoretical modeling, we identify the physical instability mechanism responsible for these structures. Raman spectroscopy reveals that carbon deposition correlates with channel width variations, indicating that periodic structure formation occurs during the plasma discharge phase. We evaluated three candidate instability mechanisms: the Asaro-Tiller-Grinfeld instability, the Plateau-Rayleigh instability, and the z-pinch entropy mode. The first two mechanisms operate on incompatible timescales and require unphysical material parameters to match observations. In contrast, the z-pinch entropy mode operates during the nanosecond discharge phase and produces wavelengths consistent with plasma densities of 0.1-1% of solid density and temperatures of 10-100 eV. Current measurements from isolated discharge channels (~200 A) validate theoretical predictions for the entropy mode. These findings establish that the entropy mode plasma instability during the discharge phase, rather than post discharge thermal or mechanical processes, govern periodic structure formation in breakdown channels. This work provides new insights into the physics of dielectric breakdown and establishes a framework for predicting discharge morphology and characteristics in insulators.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Paradox and Non-Hermitian Topological Singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unidirectional modes in magnetically biased electromagnetic systems have long been associated with a thermodynamic paradox: the absence of counter-propagating channels may produce non-integrable singularities that may act as unphysical sinks of thermal radiation. Here we revisit this problem and show that material dissipation alone cannot regularize the singular behavior, in sharp contrast with reciprocal systems where any loss suffices. Instead, the paradox is resolved by nonlocal effects, which suppress the material response at short wavelengths and eliminate field singularities altogether. Our analysis reveals a fundamental link between nonlocality, topology, and thermodynamic consistency, showing that real-space singularities and ill-defined topologies go hand in hand, even in strongly dissipative platforms. These findings clarify the physical origin of the paradox and establish nonlocality as a natural and robust mechanism for its resolution, opening new avenues to explore the intertwined roles of topology and nonlocality in passive nonreciprocal photonics.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the frequency eigenchannels of ultrafast time-varying media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control over the interaction of waves with ultrafast time-varying materials - those that change on a time-scale commensurate with the wave period - holds much promise for developing a raft of new technologies. Time-varying materials exchange energy with the waves passing through them, thus exhibiting entirely new phenomena not possible with static media. Work to date has largely considered the realisation of ultrafast time-varying materials, with much less attention paid to how their interaction depends upon the shape of the incident waves themselves. Here we experimentally demonstrate 'waveform shaping' within ultrafast time-varying media: temporal shaping of incident pulses to optimise specific dynamic material interactions. We create an ultrafast time-varying medium by rapidly modulating a waveguide termination, and measure the spectrally resolved reflection matrix. Analysis of this reflection matrix enables the identification of the incident waveforms that undergo a desired spectral transformation. Using this approach, we first characterise the medium's eigenpulses; temporal modes that reflect from the medium without spectral distortion. Next, we identify the waveforms that are either maximally or minimally reflected, enabling strong broadband absorption arising from the temporal modulation of the medium. Finally, we show how energy can be optimally concentrated into a user-defined set of frequency bands upon reflection. Our work paves the way towards new applications of ultrafast time-varying media, spanning from optics to microwaves and acoustics.</description>

      <title>High-field NMR study of field-induced states in Pb(TiO)Cu$_4$(PO$_4$)$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The square cupola antiferromagnet Pb(TiO)Cu$_4$(PO$_4$)$_4$ exhibits the intriguing magnetoelectric responses arising from the consecutive change in the magnetic quadrupolar-type configuration of magnetic moments under external magnetic fields higher than 15 T. To clarify the high-field magnetic structures in Pb(TiO)Cu$_4$(PO$_4$)$_4$, an NMR measurement was performed in pulsed fields up to 32.2 T significantly extending the field range accessible by superconducting magnets. The double-peak structure of NMR spectra emerging above 29 T applied along the [001] direction evidences the successive magnetic transitions. The field dependence of NMR spectra was analyzed on the basis of cluster mean-field theory, which allows us to propose possible magnetic structures for the high-field magnetic states.</description>

      <title>Edge-state competition in a 2D topological insulator-semiconductor heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall edge transport in two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides depends on whether their one-dimensional edge channels are preserved under realistic substrates and device boundaries. Here we implement spin-orbit coupling in DFTB and GFN-xTB within the Amsterdam Modeling Suite, and apply it to 1T$'$/2H WSe$_2$ heterostructures. Edge-projected spectra reveal robust edge states in 1T$'$ ribbons; and these states remain robust against a laterally infinite 2H substrate, which only shifts the Dirac point via long-wavelength corrugation without introducing additional in-gap states. By contrast, terminated 2H edges generate trivial dispersion branches in the same energy window that hybridize only weakly with the topological edge modes. In the bulk, Fermi-level states are 1T$'$-derived; at the small twist angle, lattice-relaxation-induced strain drives miniband reconstruction, whereas at the large twist angle, the layers become electronically decoupled. These findings suggest the conditions -- controlled twist angle and avoidance of terminated 2H edges -- for achieving quantized conductance and unambiguous spectroscopic</description>

      <title>Gaussian basis sets for all-electron excited-state calculations of large molecules and the condensed phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of all-electron Gaussian basis sets, augmented MOLOPT, optimized for excited-state calculations on large molecules and crystals. We generate these basis sets by augmenting existing STO-3G, STO-6G, and MOLOPT basis sets optimizied for ground state energy calculations. The augmented MOLOPT basis sets achieve fast convergence of $GW$ gaps and Bethe-Salpeter excitation energies, while maintaining low condition numbers of the overlap matrix to ensure numerical stability. For $GW$ HOMO-LUMO gaps, the double-zeta augmented MOLOPT basis yields a mean absolute deviation of 60 meV to the complete basis set limit. The basis set convergence for excitation energies from time-dependent density functional theory and the Bethe-Salpeter equation is similar. We use our smallest generated augmented MOLOPT basis (aug-SZV-MOLOPT-ae-mini) to demonstrate $GW$ calculations on nanographenes with 2312 atoms requiring only 3500 core hours and 2.9 TB RAM as computational resources.</description>

      <title>Polarized electromagnetic radiation by chiral media with time-dependent chiral chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate photon production from media characterized by a time-dependent chiral chemical potential $\mu_5(t)$. We first consider the chiral anomaly as a small perturbation and show that $\mu_5\to 2\gamma$ process generates non-polarized radiation, as the probabilities of producing right and left-handed photons are equal. In chiral semimetal with a vanishing chiral chemical potential but a finite separation of Weyl nodes, ${\bf \Delta}(t)$, the photon production vanishes at the leading order of perturbation theory. We then employ the method of Bogolyubov transformation to obtain the photon spectrum that sums up all powers of $\mu_5$. Employing the exactly solvable model $\mu_5(t) \propto A+B\tanh(t/\tau)$, we demonstrate that the spectrum exhibits strong circular polarization, whose direction is determined by the sign of $\mu_5$. The spectrum contains resonances associated with the instability of the electromagnetic field in chiral media. We discuss potential phenomenological applications of these findings.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectricity evidence for quantum criticality in clean infinite-layer nickelate films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Seebeck coefficient ($S$) in infinite-layer nickelate films with different disorder levels. The disordered NdNiO$_{2}$ film exhibits a flat $S/T$ curve, whereas cleaner samples display a logarithmic divergence with decreasing temperature, followed by a pronounced ``hump'' near 25 K. These distinct behaviors reveal a disorder-driven transition from band-structure-dominated transport to quantum-critical-dominated transport. Below the ``hump'' temperature, four-fold symmetry breaking is observed in the in-plane angular magnetoresistance, indicating the presence of short-range antiferromagnetic order in parent infinite-layer nickelate films. Furthermore, the logarithmic divergence in $S/T$ is also observed in a clean superconducting Sm$_{0.73}$Ca$_{0.05}$Eu$_{0.22}$NiO$_{2}$ film, where it coexists with linear-in-temperature resistivity over the same temperature range. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum criticality over a wide doping range in clean infinite-layer nickelate films, similar to cuprates, which highlights the central role of antiferromagnetic spin correlations in their superconducting pairing mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Observation of Altermagnetic Spin Splitting in an Intercalated Transition Metal Dichalcogenide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a novel magnetic phase combining characteristics of both antiferromagnetism and ferromagnetic ordering. Despite growing theoretical interest in altermagnetic materials, reports of experimentally verified high Neel temperature layered compounds are limited or remain to be firmly established. Here, we present an angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) study of Co1/4TaSe2, a compound we identify as a layered altermagnetic material. Magnetic susceptibility measurements confirm type A antiferromagnetic ordering with a Neel temperature of 178 K. Our ARPES measurements reveal an electronic band structure in excellent agreement with DFT calculations, demonstrating clear signatures of altermagnetic spin splitting at the Fermi surface. Furthermore, temperature dependent ARPES reveals a reconstructed valence band structure, with observable band shifts and the closing of energy gaps upon heating above the Neel temperature (TN), consistent with the suppression of altermagnetic order. These findings establish Co1/4TaSe2 as a promising platform for exploring altermagnetic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion Lattice Domain Formation in a Non-Flat Energy Landscape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are chiral spin structures with non-trivial topology that comprise two-dimensional quasi-particles and are promising information carriers for data storage and processing devices. Skyrmion lattices in magnetic thin films exhibit Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) phase transitions and have garnered significant interest for studying emergent 2D phase behavior. In experimental skyrmion lattices, the main factor limiting the quasi-long-range order in thin films has been the non-flat energy landscape - often referred to as pinning effects. We demonstrate direct control of the skyrmion lattice order by effectively tuning the energy landscape employing magnetic field oscillations. By quantifying lattice order and dynamics, we explore how domain boundaries form and evolve due to pinning effects in Kerr microscopy experiments and in Brownian dynamics simulations, offering a pathway to control and study emergent skyrmion lattice properties and 2D phase behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Simulations of Catalytic Metal Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate quantum simulations of catalysis on metal surfaces are critical for advancing energy and materials science. Yet most existing methods fall short: density functional theory (DFT), although widely used for its computational efficiency, often lacks the accuracy needed for adsorption and reaction energetics at heterogeneous metal surfaces. Wavefunction-based theories, in contrast, are more accurate in principle but remain prohibitively costly when applied to realistic catalytic systems. Here we introduce FEMION (Fragment Embedding for Metals and Insulators with Onsite and Nonlocal correlation), a quantum embedding framework that resolves the long-standing challenge of accurately describing partially filled electronic states in metals while retaining accuracy for insulators. FEMION combines highly accurate solvers such as auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo to capture many-body effects at catalytic sites, together with a global random phase approximation treatment of nonlocal screening, providing a scalable and systematically improvable framework for accurate quantum simulations. We demonstrate chemical accuracy for two long-standing challenges in heterogeneous catalysis: the preference site of CO adsorption and the H2 desorption barrier on the Cu(111) surface, where conventional methods have struggled for decades. Beyond achieving quantitative accuracy, FEMION offers a many-body bonding analysis that reveals why DFT fails to capture the CO adsorption preference, highlighting the critical role of electron correlation in governing surface energetics. FEMION thus establishes a robust route to predictive, first-principles modeling of complex catalytic systems.</description>

      <title>Prediction of an alternative route to polymeric carbon dioxide: A metastable energetic material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of pressure to obtain new materials that can be recovered under ambient conditions is a central problem in high-pressure physics. Despite decades of research, this goal has only been achieved in the laboratory for a few notable examples, such as diamond and cubic boron nitride. An area of significant interest is the transformation under compression of light-element molecular compounds to extended covalent-bonded (polymeric) solids. Among them, CO$_2$ has been extensively studied because of its status as a prototypical simple molecular system with a rich phase diagram and due to its fundamental role in Earth's physics and chemistry. One of its polymeric crystalline phases, accessible at extreme pressures and temperatures, has been recently quenched to ambient pressure, but below room temperature. Here we report ab initio calculations predicting that isothermal compression of a carbon monoxide and oxygen mixture (CO+O$_2$), rather than the compound CO$_2$, lowers the onset of C-polymerization at room temperature from ~118 GPa to ~7 GPa (complete by ~23 GPa). Moreover, it leads to the formation of an intrinsically different polymer with enhanced metastability. We predict that this dense phase is an energetic material which can potentially be recovered to ambient pressure and temperature.</description>

Abstract: Electric conduction mechanisms are studied in the pressed nanoflake powder of the molybdenum-disulfide-oxide (MoSxOy) depending on their content and structure. The MoSxOy nanoflakes were prepared by reaction of (NH4)6Mo7O24 with thiourea in aqueous solution followed by aerial oxidation. The sintered nanoflakes are 10-20 nm thick and self-assembled in the "nanoflower"-shape aggregates forming powder particles. The chemical composition and structure of the powders were studied by XPS, EDS and Raman spectroscopy, which show that the powders have different chemical composition and structure depending on the preparation conditions. These studies revealed the existence of different forms of MoS2 and its oxides in the powders. These features are impactful on electric transport properties. The current vs voltage (I-V) dependences of the pressed MoSxOy nanoflakes reveal hysteresis-like behavior; and their loop width depends on the chemical composition and structure. In the samples with the highest content of Mo in the oxide/sulfoxide form the negative differential conductivity has been observed. The I-V curves of all MoSxOy nanoflake samples manifest the three-state resistive switching and the long-lasting transient charge/discharge on switching "on/off" the voltage across the sample, which evidences the role of interface charges in their conductivity. To describe theoretically the observed I-V curves, polar and electric-transport properties of the pressed MoSxOy nanoflakes, the Landau-Cahn-Hilliard approach considering flexo-chemical field has been used. The revealed in experiment and explained theoretically features of resistive switching and charge accumulation look promising for applications in memristors and high-performance supercapacitors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the thermal Hall effect can originate from magnons (magnon Hall effect), phonons (phonon Hall effect), or their combination (magnon-polaron Hall effect). The magnon-polaron Hall effect, first observed in Fe2Mo3O8, is particularly intriguing as its thermal Hall signal can be remarkably large. In this study, we explore the thermal Hall effect in MnPS3, an insulating antiferromagnetic material exhibiting a spin-flop transition and significant magnetoelastic coupling, making it a strong candidate for studying the thermal Hall effect originating from spin-lattice coupling. We report an exceptionally large thermal Hall angle down to 4 K and show that it cannot be accounted for by standard calculations based on the intrinsic magnon-polaron Berry curvature. Our findings provide an in-depth analysis of the role of the spin-flop transition in the thermal properties of MnPS3 and call for further theory development on magnon-phonon coupling and scattering to reveal their influence on transverse heat transport.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Generation in the Heterometallic Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ Complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate various types of quantum entanglement in the octanuclear heterometallic $3d/4f$ complexes denoted as Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ under an external magnetic field, using the exact diagonalization approach. These molecular magnets, which can be effectively described by Heisenberg spin models, consist of two identical $\{\text{Ni}^{2+}_2\text{Gd}^{3+}_2\}$ cubane subunits bridged by acetate and hydroxide ligands. Our analysis reveals that their magnetization exhibits intermediate plateaus at low temperatures, indicating distinct ground states characteristic of Ni-containing compounds. Using negativity as a measure of quantum entanglement, we examine the influence of single-ion anisotropy and magnetic field on tetrapartite, bipartite, 1$-$3 tangle, and 2$-$2 tangle entanglements in two families of Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes: $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ without anisotropy and $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ with anisotropy. Complex $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ exhibits strong bipartite entanglement between Ni ions, which persists up to $T \approx 3.0\,\text{K}$ and $B \approx 4.0\,\text{T}$, but shows significantly weaker tetrapartite entanglement and vanishing bipartite entanglement between Gd$\cdots$Gd and Ni$\cdots$Gd pairs. In contrast, complex $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ displays nonzero and sizable values for all types of entanglement considered. These findings emphasis the crucial role of single-ion anisotropy in generating and shaping the entanglement landscape of heterometallic Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes. Notably, we find that the 1$-$3 tangle entanglement between a Ni ion and the remaining sites in a cubane unit serves as a reliable indicator of ground-state phase transitions, exhibiting distinct changes across phase boundaries irrespective of the presence of single-ion anisotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitation of ordered quantum phases gives rise to collective modes and quasiparticles, as exemplified by spin waves and magnons emerging from magnetic order. Extending this paradigm to ferroelectric materials suggests the existence of polarization waves and their fundamental quanta, ferrons. Here, we report the generation and transport of polarization waves, i.e., coherent ferrons, in the van der Waals ferroelectric material NbOI2. Upon excitation by a short laser pulse, the polarization wave emits intense and narrow-band terahertz (THz) radiation at the ferroelectric transverse optical phonon frequency, modulates the ferroelectric order parameter, and propagates uniaxially along the polar axis at hypersonic velocities of ~105 m/s. These long-lived, uniaxial, and dipole-carrying polarization waves may find applications in narrow-band THz emission, ferronic information processing, and coherent electric control.</description>

      <title>Material-Limited Switching in Nanoscale Ferroelectrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ferroelectric switching speed has been experimentally obfuscated by the interaction between the measurement circuit and the ferroelectric switching itself. This has prohibited the observation of real material responses at nanosecond timescales and lower. Here, fundamental polarization switching speeds in ferroelectric materials with the perovskite, fluorite, and wurtzite structures are reported. Upon lateral scaling of island capacitors from micron to nanoscales, a clear transition from circuit-limited switching to a material-limited switching regime is observed. In La$_{0.15}$Bi$_{0.85}$FeO$_{3}$ capacitors, switching is as fast as ~150 ps, the fastest switching time reported. For polycrystalline Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_{2}$ capacitors, a fundamental switching limit of ~210 ps is observed. Switching times for Al$_{0.92}$B$_{0.08}$N are near 20 ns, limited by the coercive and breakdown electric fields. The activation field, instantaneous pseudo-resistivity, and energy-delay are reported in this material-limited regime. Lastly, a criterion for reaching the material-limited regime is provided. This regime enables observation of intrinsic material properties and favorable scaling trends for high-performance computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore machine learning techniques for predicting Curie temperatures of magnetic materials using the NEMAD database. By augmenting the dataset with composition-based and domain-aware descriptors, we evaluate the performance of several machine learning models. We find that the Extra Trees Regressor delivers the best performance reaching an R^2 score of up to 0.85 $\pm$ 0.01 (cross-validated) for a balanced dataset. We employ the k-means clustering algorithm to gain insights into the performance of chemically distinct material groups. Furthermore, we perform the SHAP analysis to identify key physicochemical drivers of Curie behavior, such as average atomic number and magnetic moment. By employing explainable AI techniques, this analysis offers insights into the model's predictive behavior, thereby advancing scientific interpretability.</description>

      <title>Electron Energy Loss Spectra Simulations of Coupled Phonon and Magnon Excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectra (EELS) in body-centered cubic iron at 300 K, capturing the effects of coupled phonon and magnon excitations within a unified dynamical formalism. By extending the Time Autocorrelation of Auxiliary Wavefunctions (TACAW) method to incorporate atomistic spin-lattice dynamics (ASLD), we simulate the full EELS signal - including interaction effects, dynamical diffraction, and multiple scattering. Our results reveal non-additive spectral features arising from phonon-magnon coupling, including interference and energy redistribution effects, and predict experimental detectability of magnon signals under optimized detector conditions. This framework advances quantitative magnon spectroscopy in STEM, establishing a direct link between dynamical theory and low-energy experimental EELS signatures.</description>

      <title>Observation of Analogue Dynamic Schwinger Effect and Non-Perturbative Light Sensing in Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dielectric breakdown of physical vacuum (Schwinger effect) is the textbook demonstration of compatibility of Relativity and Quantum theory. Although observing this effect is still practically unachievable, its analogue generalizations have been shown to be more readily attainable. This paper demonstrates that a gapped Dirac semiconductor, methylammonium lead-bromide perovskite (MAPbBr$_3$), exhibits analogue dynamical Schwinger effect. Tunneling ionization under deep sub-gap mid-infrared irradiation leads to intense photoluminescence in the visible range, in full agreement with quasi-adiabatic theory. In addition to revealing a gapped extended system suitable for studying the analogue Schwinger effect, this observation holds great potential for non-perturbative field sensing, i.e., sensing electric fields through non-perturbative light-matter interactions. First, this paper illustrates this by measuring the local deviation from the nominally cubic phase of a perovskite single crystal, which can be interpreted in terms of frozen-in fields. Next, it is shown that analogue dynamic Schwinger effect can be used for nonperturbative amplification of non-parametric upconversion process in perovskites driven simultaneously by multiple optical fields. This discovery demonstrates the potential for material response beyond perturbation theory in the Schwinger regime, offering extremely sensitive light detection and amplification across an ultrabroad spectral range not accessible by conventional devices.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional orbital-obstructed insulators with higher-order band topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Obstructed atomic phases, with their realizations in systems of diverse dimensionality, have recently arisen as one of the topological states with greatest potential to show higher-order phenomena. In this work we report a special type of obstruction, known as orbital-mediated atomic obstruction, in monolayers of materials with spatial symmetry described by the space group $P$-$3m1$. By means of a minimal tight-binding model and first-principles calculations, we show that this obstructed phase is related to the mismatch of the charge centers coming from the atomic limit with respect to the centers that are obtained from a reciprocal space description. Although we find atomic limits that correspond with occupied atomic sites, orbital-mediated atomic obstruction requires the presence of orbitals that have no support in real space. In order to demonstrate the nontrivial character of the obstruction, we confirm the presence of a filling anomaly for finite geometries that is directly associated with the bulk configuration, and discuss the role of the boundary states and their underlying mechanism. Several material examples are presented to illustrate the ubiquity of these nontrivial responses and, in turn, to discuss the differences related to the particular ground state configuration. In addition, we perform a survey of materials and elaborate a list of candidate systems which will host this obstructed phase in monolayer form.</description>

Abstract: Double perovskites containing heavy transition metal ions are an important family of compounds for the study of the interplay between electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling. Here, by combining magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and neutron scattering measurements, we investigate the dipolar and quadrupolar correlations in two prototype rhenium-based double perovskite compounds, Ba$_2$YReO$_6$ and Ba$_2$ScReO$_6$. A type-I dipolar antiferromagnetic ground state with a propagation vector $\mathbf{q} = (0, 0, 1)$ is observed in both compounds. At temperatures above the magnetic transitions, a quadrupolar ordered phase is identified. Weak spin excitations, which are gapped at low temperatures and softened in the correlated paramagnetic phase, are explained using a minimal model that considers both the dipolar and quadrupolar interactions. At larger wavevectors, we observe dominant phonon excitations that are well described by density functional calculations.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transitions in Kagome Ferromagnets: The Role of Intrinsic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theoretically predicted Chern insulators have highlighted the potential of easy-axis kagome ferromagnets to host the quantum anomalous Hall effect. This phenomenon can also emerge from in-plane ferromagnetism in kagome systems via the breaking of both out-of-plane and in-plane mirror symmetries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interplay between magnetism and mirror symmetries makes ferromagnetic kagome systems a versatile platform for realizing nontrivial topological phases, with the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$ at lattice sites serving as a key tuning parameter. We show that the symmetry allowed nearest-neighbor intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry together with the nearest-neighbor intrinsic SOC incorporated in a minimal tight-binding model captures the rich topological phase diagram of kagome systems as a function of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$, where SOC terms emerge due to the electric field produced by the surrounding atoms not lying in the kagome plane. Further, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $\phi$ promotes topological phase transition upon variation of in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(\theta=90^{\circ},\phi)$. However the topological phase transition for the variation of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi$=constant) is dictated by a competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for the ferromagnetic kagome monolayer Co$_3$Pb$_3$S$_2$, a representative compound belonging to the family Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ (X=Sn, Pb; Y=S, Se) further corroborate our predictions based on the proposed minimal tight-binding model.</description>

      <title>Host-dependent frequency offsets in $^{229}$Th nuclear clockwork</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in laser excitation of the low-energy nuclear isomer transition in $^{229}$Th have opened avenues for developing nuclear clocks, a novel quantum technology with exceptional performance and sensitivity to exotic physics. Here we explore the host-dependence of the nuclear clock frequency, focusing on the isomer shift induced by the difference in the nuclear charge distribution between the ground and excited nuclear states. We combine relativistic many-body methods of atomic structure with periodic density functional theory to evaluate the isomer shifts in solid-state hosts. We elucidate the critical importance of the ``relaxation'' effect in evaluating the isomer shifts. Our analysis predicts nuclear clock frequencies for various solid-state and trapped ion platforms: $ \omega_\text{clk}(\text{solid state}) = 2,020,407,384(40) \, \text{MHz}$, $\omega_\text{clk}(^{229}\text{Th}^{4+}) = 2,020,407,648(70) \, \text{MHz}$, and $ \omega_\text{clk}(^{229}\text{Th}^{3+}) = 2,020,407,114(70) \, \text{MHz}$. We also determine the nuclear transition energy for the bare $^{229}$Th nucleus to be $\omega_\text{nuc} = 8.272(22) \,\text{eV}$. Our calculated valence-band isomer shifts for different host materials constrain the nuclear transition frequencies to an 80 MHz-wide frequency window, aiding experimental searches for the $^{229}$Th nuclear transition in novel materials.</description>

      <title>LAMBench: A Benchmark for Large Atomistic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Atomistic Models (LAMs) have undergone remarkable progress recently, emerging as universal or fundamental representations of the potential energy surface defined by the first-principles calculations of atomistic systems. However, our understanding of the extent to which these models achieve true universality, as well as their comparative performance across different models, remains limited. This gap is largely due to the lack of comprehensive benchmarks capable of evaluating the effectiveness of LAMs as approximations to the universal potential energy surface. In this study, we introduce LAMBench, a benchmarking system designed to evaluate LAMs in terms of their generalizability, adaptability, and applicability. These attributes are crucial for deploying LAMs as ready-to-use tools across a diverse array of scientific discovery contexts. We benchmark ten state-of-the-art LAMs released prior to August 1, 2025, using LAMBench. Our findings reveal a significant gap between the current LAMs and the ideal universal potential energy surface. They also highlight the need for incorporating cross-domain training data, supporting multi-fidelity modeling, and ensuring the models' conservativeness and differentiability. As a dynamic and extensible platform, LAMBench is intended to continuously evolve, thereby facilitating the development of robust and generalizable LAMs capable of significantly advancing scientific research. The LAMBench code is open-sourced at https://github.com/deepmodeling/lambench, and an interactive leaderboard is available at https://www.aissquare.com/openlam?tab=Benchmark.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect caused by magnetic hopfions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are non-collinear spin textures that are characterized by an integer topological invariant, called Hopf index. The three-dimensional magnetic solitons can be thought of as a tube with a twisted magnetization that has been closed at both ends to form a torus. The tube consists of a magnetic whirl called in-plane skyrmion or bimeron. Although hopfions have been observed by microscopy techniques, their detection remains challenging as they lack an electronic hallmark so far. Here we predict a three-dimensional orbital Hall effect caused by hopfion textures: When an electric field is applied, the hopfion generates a transverse current of orbital angular momentum. The effect arises due to the local emergent field that gives rise to in-plane and out-of-plane orbital Hall conductivities. This orbital Hall response can be seen as a hallmark of hopfions and allows us to distinguish them from other textures, like skyrmioniums, that look similar in real-space microscopy experiments. While the two-dimensional topological invariant of a skyrmion determines its topological Hall transport, the unique three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect can be identified with the three-dimensional topological invariant that is the Hopf index. Our results make hopfions attractive for spin-orbitronic applications because their orbital signatures allow for their detection in devices and give rise to large orbital torques.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the resonant and higher-harmonic magnetic responses of a collinear antiferromagnet induced by N\'eel spin-orbit torques (NSOTs). By deriving the dynamical susceptibilities up to the third harmonic, we find remarkable NSOT-induced amplifications of the linear and nonlinear magnetic dynamics by orders of magnitude compared to conventional spin-orbit torques, enabling highly-efficient frequency conversion in the sub-terahertz frequency range. We then propose a multilayer antiferromagnetic nano-device leveraging the gigantic harmonic generation to achieve unprecedented frequency amplifiers and converters. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked role of the NSOTs in nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Tunable hyperbolic Landau-level polaritons in charge-neutral graphene nanoribbon metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetized charge-neutral graphene supports collective hybrid electronic excitations - polaritons - which have quantum origin. In contrast to polaritons in doped graphene, which arise from intraband electronic transitions, those in charge-neutral graphene originate from interband transitions between Landau levels, enabled by the applied magnetic field. Control of such quantum polaritons and shaping their wavefronts remains totally unexplored. Here we design an artificial two-dimensional quantum material formed by charge-neutral graphene nanoribbons exposed to an external magnetic field. In such metasurface, quantum polaritons acquire a hyperbolic dispersion. We find that the topology of the isofrequency curves of quantum hyperbolic magnetoexciton polaritons excited in this quantum material can change, so that the shape of isofrequency curves transforms from a closed to open one by tuning the external magnetic field strength. At the topological transition, we observe canalization phenomena, consisting of the propagation of all the polaritonic plane waves in the continuum along the same direction when excited by a point source. From a general perspective, our fundamental findings introduce a novel type of actively-tunable quantum polaritons with hyperbolic dispersion and can be further generalized to other types of quantum materials and polaritons in them. In practice, quantum hyperbolic polaritons can be used for applications related to quantum sensing and computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coupling between real-space coordinates and spin (r-s) provides an alternative route to achieve efficient spin manipulation in spintronics beyond the conventional momentum-spin (k-s) coupling paradigm. Here we demonstrate an unexpected manifestation of one-dimensional (1D) r-s coupling in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic second-order topological insulators, where the spin-split floating edge states - energetically isolated within the bulk band gap - emerge and exhibit both Neel-vector-dependent and electrically tunable behaviors. The 1D edge-spin r-s coupling ensures carrier transport to be exclusively carried by the edge states with quantized spin conductance, giving rise to an unconventional edge tunnel magnetoresistance (edge-TMR) effect that can be switched On or Off. As a proof of concept, we computationally design an edge-TMR device based on Cr2Se2O monolayer to demonstrate its edge transportation and controllability via the Neel order or electric field. Our findings propose a general prototype altermagnetic device for next-generation low-dimensional spintronics.</description>

Abstract: Over the past decade, graphene has emerged as a promising candidate for exploring the viscous nature of electronic flow facilitated by the availability of extremely high-quality devices employing a graphene channel encapsulated within dielectric layers of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). However, the level of disorder in such systems is mainly determined by the device fabrication protocols, making it impossible to obtain a tunability between the impurity-dominated and the viscous transport within the same device. In this work, using a combination of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and gate electric field, we have demonstrated a dynamic modulation of charge hydrodynamics, quantified in the thermal and electrical transport by the extent of departure from the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) Law in monolayer graphene devices at room temperature. We achieved this by tuning the disorder level continuously and reversibly using UV light to create transient trap states in the encapsulating hBN dielectric. With progressive UV radiation, we observed a dramatic increase in the momentum-relaxing scattering relative to that between the electrons and also the Lorentz number, by nearly a factor of ten, with increasing disorder, thereby approaching the restoration of the WF law in highly disordered graphene. Our experiments outline a potent strategy to tune the fundamental mechanism of charge flow in state-of-the-art graphene devices.</description>
