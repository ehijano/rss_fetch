      <title>Cytogenetic, Hematobiochemical, and Histopathological Assessment of Albino Rats (Rattus norvegicus) Fed on Gluten Extracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Literature shows that most of the information on the toxicity of gluten is generated from survey and observational studies, resulting in inconsistent outcomes and a decrease in the acceptability of gluten-rich foods. To determine gluten's safety, an in-depth in vitro and in vivo toxicological examination is required. This enables scientists to come up with ameliorative strategies if it turns out to have side effects, and consumers' trust can be restored. Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess the toxicity of gluten extracts on albino rats (Rattus norvegicus). Materials and Methods: Twenty-four rats were randomly selected and divided into four groups, each comprising six rats. Group 1 (control) rats were fed on pellet feeds and groups 2, 3, and 4 were fed on daily dosages of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 g gluten extracts, respectively. The rats' body weights and reactions were observed for 90 days before blood samples were collected for hematobiochemical and micronucleus tests. Histopathological examinations of the liver and kidneys were also performed. Results: There was no difference (P &gt; 0.05) in body weight, blood glucose level, or micronuclei between the control and treated rats. The lymphocytes, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase, total protein, and calcium ions of the test rats were all significantly (P &lt; 0.05) altered but remained within the normal ranges. Other hematobiochemical parameters, including packed cell volume, hemoglobin, white and red blood cells, aspartate transaminase, albumin, sodium ions, potassium ions, chloride ions, and urea, revealed no marked changes. The treated rats' livers and kidneys showed no histopathological changes. Conclusion: Gluten had no adverse effects. However, it altered hematobiochemical parameters, particularly the lymphocytes, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase, total protein, and calcium ions.</description>

      <title>From FAIR to CURE: Guidelines for Computational Models of Biological Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guidelines for managing scientific data have been established under the FAIR principles requiring that data be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. In many scientific disciplines, especially computational biology, both data and models are key to progress. For this reason, and recognizing that such models are a very special type of 'data', we argue that computational models, especially mechanistic models prevalent in medicine, physiology and systems biology, deserve a complementary set of guidelines. We propose the CURE principles, emphasizing that models should be Credible, Understandable, Reproducible, and Extensible. We delve into each principle, discussing verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification for model credibility; the clarity of model descriptions and annotations for understandability; adherence to standards and open science practices for reproducibility; and the use of open standards and modular code for extensibility and reuse. We outline recommended and baseline requirements for each aspect of CURE, aiming to enhance the impact and trustworthiness of computational models, particularly in biomedical applications where credibility is paramount. Our perspective underscores the need for a more disciplined approach to modeling, aligning with emerging trends such as Digital Twins and emphasizing the importance of data and modeling standards for interoperability and reuse. Finally, we emphasize that given the non-trivial effort required to implement the guidelines, the community moves to automate as many of the guidelines as possible.</description>
