      <title>First order transition region of an equation of state for QCD with a critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to signals for the critical point, evidence for a first order phase transition would indicate a nontrivial structure within the QCD phase diagram. Moreover, while not a direct measurement of the critical point, the presence of a first order transition would imply its existence. This motivates the need to understand signatures of this first order transition in addition to directly studying the effect of a critical point. To this effect, we map the mean-field Ising model equation of state onto the QCD phase diagram, and reconstruct the full coexistence region in the case of a first order phase transition. Beyond the coexistence line, we maintain access to the spinodal region in the phase diagram, thus providing a description of metastable and unstable phases of matter. Thus, we describe the super-heated hadronic phase and the super-cooled quark-gluon plasma, which is useful for hydrodynamic simulations of the fireball created in a heavy-ion collision at low collision energy, where a first order phase transition is expected. We discuss the features of the pressure and other thermodynamic observables as functions of temperature and baryonic chemical potential, in particular their behavior in the coexistence region. Finally, we compare our equation of state to 3D Ising model ones available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Exploring highly-deformed ground states involving the second intruder orbit in Z&gt;50 even-even nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic survey of even-even nuclei with $Z&gt;50$ to identify where a very large prolate configuration driven by the second intruder orbit emerges. Within the energy density functional theory framework, we find in representative cases a pronounced prolate minimum at quadrupole deformation $\beta_2\approx$ 0.3--0.4. A characteristic feature of these minima is a local enhancement of the hexadecapole ($\beta_4$) component relative to nearby deformations, which is a clear fingerprint of the $\beta_2$--$\beta_4$ coupling expected for the second intruder orbit. Representative comparisons among three Skyrme interactions show a similar appearance of the highly deformed minimum and a local enhancement of $\beta_4$ at the prolate minimum, indicating qualitative robustness with respect to the interaction. The resulting maps highlight specific heavy nuclei where highly deformed ground states are anticipated.</description>

      <title>Proper derivation of subspace mapping from whole space mapping in boson expansion theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The norm operator method, which was recently proposed as a new formulation of the boson expansion theory (BET), is used to show that the subspace mapping is properly derived from the whole space mapping. This derivation requires the appropriate renormalization of the contribution of phonons that are not adopted as boson excitations in the subspace mapping. This was impossible with conventional BETs (which ignore these contributions), and is only made possible for the first time by the norm operator method, which treats these contributions appropriately. We also correct the confusion in the claims of conventional BETs. Namely, contrary to conventional claims, we show that when the phonon excitations not adopted as boson excitations make no contribution at all, the subspace mapping is obtained simply by discarding those excitations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Park operator, which had been considered effective only in the whole space mapping, is also effective in the subspace mapping.</description>

      <title>Resolving the PREX-CREX puzzle in covariant density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PREX-CREX puzzle, an apparent tension between parity-violating electron-scattering results for $^{208}$Pb and $^{48}$Ca revealed by modern density functional analyses, has posed a major challenge for nuclear theory. We show that this puzzle can be resolved within covariant density-dependent point-coupling density functional theory by introducing an enhanced isovector tensor coupling. A nonrelativistic reduction identifies the resulting strong isovector spin-orbit interaction as the key mechanism that reconciles the PREX and CREX measurements.</description>

      <title>Relativistic mean-field model with density- and isospin-density-dependent couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new hadronic EoS with hyperons built within the relativistic mean-field (RMF) formalism with baryon-density- and isospin-density-dependent couplings. Motivated by microscopic calculations showing density- and isospin-asymmetry-dependence of self-energies, we implement a new form for the baryon-meson couplings. The parameters for the couplings are constrained by a Bayesian analysis, which anchors the model to nuclear saturation properties, chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) predictions for pure neutron matter, heavy-ion collision data, and HALQCD-based hyperon potential calculations at 3-momentum $|\mathbf{k}|=0$ in both isospin-symmetric and pure neutron matter. The resulting EoS satisfies neutron star mass-radius constraints from NICER and GW170817, providing another way to address the hyperon puzzle. The low-density part of the EoS is described via nuclear statistical equilibrium with modern mass tables (AME20/FRDM12, 8244 nuclei), providing a novel and complete general-purpose EoS for astrophysical simulations.</description>

      <title>Effects of short-range correlations at high densities on neutron stars with and without DM content: role of the repulsive self-interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate how short-range correlations affect relativistic hadronic models at high densities, with direct consequences for the structure of neutron stars, both with and without dark matter content. Two versions of the model are examined: one with vector self-interactions up to second order ($\omega_0^2$) and another including a fourth-order term ($\omega_0^4$). We show that SRC tend to soften the equation of state when only the quadratic term is present, but produce a noticeable stiffening once the $\omega_0^4$ term is included. The corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff solutions for pure neutron stars indicate that short-range correlations reduce the maximum mass in the first case but increase it in the second. Extending the analysis to stars containing a fermionic dark matter component, within the two-fluid formalism, we verify that the same features appear in the respective mass-radius diagrams. In particular, the decrease of the maximum mass with increasing dark matter fraction is partly compensated by the SRC effects in the hadronic sector for the model with the fourth-order term. In all cases, the resulting parametrizations are consistent with recent astrophysical constraints, including the joint NICER-XMM-Newton analyses of the pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, as well as the gravitational-wave event GW190425.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Assessment of $\mathrm{Th}^{3+}$ Properties for Nuclear Clock and Fundamental Physics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By employing singles, doubles, and triples excitations within the relativistic coupled-cluster framework, we perform comprehensive calculations of a wide range of atomic properties for the Th$^{3+}$ ion. These properties are essential for advancing nuclear clock technology and probing fundamental physics. Combining our isotope shift parameters with experimental data, we estimate highly accurate values of the differential nuclear charge radii for $^{232,229}$Th and $^{229m,229}$Th. Additionally, we determine the nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments for both the ground and isomeric states of $^{229}$Th by combining measured hyperfine structure constants with our theoretical calculations. Our precise evaluations of electric dipole polarizabilities and hyperfine-induced quadrupole moments are critical for assessing systematic uncertainties in $^{229}$Th$^{3+}$-based nuclear clock. Notably, we observe unexpectedly significant contributions from higher-order relativistic effects and excitations involving orbitals with higher angular momentum, which markedly influence the energies of the ground state and its fine-structure partner. These results highlight the substantial challenges in achieving highly accurate predictions for these properties.</description>

      <title>First observation of deuteron-{\Lambda} correlations at RHIC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise experimental information on hyperon-nucleon interactions is scarce but of paramount importance to our understanding of the inner structure of compact stars. In this letter, we report the first experimental results of correlation functions between deuterons (d) and {\Lambda} hyperons in Au+Au collisions at \sqrt{s_{NN} = 3.0 GeV measured by the STAR experiment at RHIC. A clear enhancement at small relative momenta has been observed in the correlation function. Through a Bayesian inference analysis, the source size parameters as a function of collision centrality and the spin- dependent strong interaction parameters (scattering length f0 and effective range d0) are extracted using the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz formalism. The derived doublet spin state parameters (f0, d0) lead to a novel method to precisely determine {\Lambda} separation energy for the weakly bounded hypertriton ^{3}_{{\Lambda}}H.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: Connecting Atomic Nuclei to Their Quantum Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the QCD Parton Model analysis by employing a factorized nuclear structure model that explicitly accounts for both individual nucleons and correlated nucleon pairs. This novel framework establishes a paradigm that directly links the nuclear physics description of matter (in terms of protons and neutrons) to the particle physics schema (in terms of quarks and gluons). Our analysis of high-energy data from lepton Deep-Inelastic Scattering, Drell-Yan, and W/Z production simultaneously extracts the universal effective distribution of quarks and gluons inside correlated nucleon pairs, and their nucleus-specific fractions. The successful extraction of these universal distributions marks a significant advance in our understanding of nuclear structure, as it directly connects nucleon-level and parton-level quantities.</description>

      <title>Resolving Ratio Redundancy in Chemical Freeze-out Studies with Principal Component Analysis and Bayesian Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)--Bayesian framework for extracting chemical freeze-out conditions in relativistic heavy-ion collisions that resolves long-standing ambiguities in hadron-ratio--based analyses. By constructing all possible hadron-yield ratios from a chosen set of species and transforming them into an orthogonal PCA basis, the method removes linear redundancies and eliminates the information loss and systematic uncertainties associated with ratio selection. Energy-wise Bayesian calibration of the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model is then performed directly in this decorrelated space, with a Gaussian Process emulator enabling fast and accurate model evaluations. A detailed Sobol sensitivity analysis, together with the PCA loading structure, identifies the most informative ratio combinations and reveals a transition from chemical-potential--dominated to temperature-controlled freeze-out with increasing $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. The calibrated model reproduces all measured ratios, and the extracted freeze-out parameters are consistent with previous HRG determinations.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Calculations of $\beta$-Decay Rates and Implications for $r$-Process Nucleosynthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear $\beta$ decay is a key element of the astrophysical rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process). In this paper, we present state-of-the-art global $\beta$-decay calculations based on the quantified relativistic nuclear energy density functional theory and the deformed proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase approximation. Our analysis considers contributions from allowed and first-forbidden transitions. We used two point-coupling functionals with carefully calibrated time-odd terms and isoscalar pairing strength. The new calculations display consistent results for both employed functionals, especially near the neutron drip line, suggesting slower $\beta$ decays past the $N=126$ neutron shell closure than in commonly used $\beta$-decay models. The new rates, along with the existing rates based on the latest non-relativistic calculations, are found to slow down the synthesis of heavy elements in the $r$-process and significantly reduce the contribution of neutron-induced fission.</description>

      <title>Coexisting phases in the chiral transition within the Linear sigma model with quarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is believed at present that the chiral transition changes from a smooth crossover to a first-order transition at low temperatures and high densities. Such regime is commonly analyzed using effective models since first principle calculations, as in lattice arrangements, are not feasible. This transition is assumed to be discontinuous, with unstable or metastable intermediate states. However, if multiple charges are simultaneously conserved the system could undergo a continuous change through a coexistence of equilibrium states. This type of transition has multiple manifestations, as in the nuclear liquid-gas transition causing the spinodal fragmentation. The coexistence of phases in the chiral transition is studied here for quark matter assuming the conservation of the isospin composition. Using the Linear sigma model with quarks several remarkable effects are found and discussed.</description>

      <title>A deep learning approach for predicting multiple observables in Au+Au collisions at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a neural network model, based on the processes of high-energy heavy-ion collisions, to study and predict several experimental observables in Au+Au collisions. We present a data-driven deep learning framework for predicting multiple bulk observables in Au+Au collisions at RHIC energies. A single neural network is trained exclusively on experimental measurements of charged-particle pseudorapidity density distributions, transverse-momentum spectra and elliptic flow coefficients over a broad range of collision energies and centralities. The network architecture is inspired by the stages of a heavy-ion collision, from the quark-gluon plasma to chemical and kinetic freeze-out, and employs locally connected hidden layers and a structured input design that encodes basic geometric and kinematic features of the system. We demonstrate that these physics-motivated choices significantly improve test performance compared to purely fully connected baselines. The trained model is then used to predict the above observables at collision energies not yet explored experimentally at RHIC, and the results are validated using the energy dependence of the total charged-particle multiplicity per participant pair as well as comparisons to a CLVisc hydrodynamic calculation with TRENTo initial conditions. Our findings indicate that such physics-guided neural networks can serve as efficient surrogates to fill critical data gaps at RHIC and to support further phenomenological studies of QGP properties.</description>

      <title>KNO scaling in quark and gluon jets at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koba-Nielsen-Olesen (KNO) scaling of hadron multiplicity distributions, empirically confirmed to hold approximately in $e^+e^-$ collisions and Deep Inelastic Scattering, has been observed to be violated in hadron-hadron collisions. In this work, we show that the universality of KNO scaling can be extended to hadron-hadron collisions when restricted to QCD jets. We present a comprehensive study of KNO scaling in QCD jets produced in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. Using perturbative QCD calculations in the double logarithmic approximation and PYTHIA simulations, we find that KNO scaling approximately holds for both quark and gluon jets across a broad jet $p_T$ range, from $0.1$ TeV to $2.5$ TeV, at both the parton and hadron levels. Especially, we highlight characteristic differences between the KNO scaling functions of quark and gluon jets, with the quark-jet scaling function lying above that of gluon jets at both low and high multiplicities. This distinction is essential for interpreting inclusive jet data at the LHC. Furthermore, we propose direct experimental tests of KNO scaling in QCD jets at the LHC through quark-gluon discrimination using jet substructure techniques, as demonstrated by applying energy correlation functions to PYTHIA-generated data.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Variation of the QCD Interaction Scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07266v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laboratory and astrophysical tests of ''constant variation'' have so far concentrated on the dimensionless fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and on the electron or quark mass ratios $X_{e,q}=m_{e,q}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$, treating the QCD scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ as unchangeable. Certain beyond Standard Model frameworks, most notably those with a dark matter or dark energy scalar field $\phi$ coupling with the gluon field, would make $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ itself time dependent while leaving $\alpha$ and the electron mass untouched. Under the minimal assumption that this gluonic channel is the sole $\phi$ interaction, we recast state-of-the-art atomic clock comparisons into $\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}=(3.2 \pm 3.5) \times 10^{-17} \ \text{yr}^{-1}$ limits, translate the isotope yields of the 1.8-Gyr-old Oklo natural reactor into a complementary geophysical limit of $|\delta\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;2\times10^{-9}$ over that time span, corresponding to the linear drift limit $|\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;1\times10^{-18} \text{yr}^{-1}$, and show that the proposed $8.4$ eV $^{229}$Th nuclear clock would amplify a putative $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ drift by four orders of magnitude compared with present atomic clocks. We also obtain constraints from quasar absorption spectra and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis data.</description>

Abstract: We show that the inference problem of constraining the dipole amplitude with inclusive deep inelastic scattering data can be written into a discrete linear inverse problem, in an analogous manner as can be done for computed tomography. To this formulation of the problem, we apply standard inverse problems methods and algorithms to reconstruct known dipole amplitudes from simulated reduced cross section data with realistic precision. The main difference of this approach to previous works is that this implementation does not require any fit parametrization of the dipole amplitude. The freedom from parametrization also enables us for the first time to quantify the uncertainties of the inferred dipole amplitude in a novel more general framework. This mathematical approach to small-$x$ phenomenology opens a path to parametrization bias free inference of the dipole amplitude from HERA and Electron--Ion Collider data.</description>
