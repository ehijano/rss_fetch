      <title>Topological holography for fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological holography is a conjectured correspondence between the symmetry charges and defects of a $D$-dimensional system with the anyons in a $(D+1)$-dimensional topological order: the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). Topological holography is conjectured to capture the topological aspects of symmetry in gapped and gapless systems, with different phases corresponding to different gapped boundaries (anyon condensations) of the SymTFT. This correspondence was previously considered primarily for bosonic systems, excluding many phases of condensed matter systems involving fermionic electrons. In this work, we extend the SymTFT framework to establish a topological holography correspondence for fermionic systems. We demonstrate that this fermionic SymTFT framework captures the known properties of $1+1D$ fermion gapped phases and critical points, including the classification, edge-modes, and stacking rules of fermionic symmetry-protected topological phases (SPTs), and computation of partition functions of fermionic conformal field theories (CFTs). Beyond merely reproducing known properties, we show that the SymTFT approach can additionally serve as a practical tool for discovering new physics, and use this framework to construct a new example of a fermionic intrinsically gapless SPT phase characterized by an emergent fermionic anomaly.</description>

      <title>Electronic correlations, layer distinction, and electron doping in the alternating single-layer trilayer La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ polymorph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a density-functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory framework to investigate the correlated electronic structure of the alternating single-layer trilayer (1313) polymorph of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure. We find that La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-1313 exhibits electronically distinct layers in terms of their correlations. At ambient pressure, the single-layer is in a Mott insulating regime and the low-energy physics is dominated by the trilayer block. Under pressure, the single-layer exhibits orbital-selective physics closing the gap allowing charge flow into the trilayer block. This change in effective doping of the trilayer block is likely linked to the higher T$_c$ obtained in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-1313 ($\sim$ 80 K) when compared to the nominal trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ ($\sim$ 30 K). We conclude that correlation-driven layer differentiation is crucial in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-1313 polymorph and that its low-energy physics aligns closely with the trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ (rather than the conventional bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$), in spite of the apparent differences in nominal filling.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric transport properties of the quasi-one-dimensional dimer-Mott insulator $\beta'$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$ICl$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dimensional materials, in which the electronic and transport properties are drastically modified in comparison to those of three-dimensional bulk materials, yield a key class of thermoelectric materials with high conversion efficiency. Among such materials, the organic compounds may serve peculiar properties owing to their unique molecular-based low-dimensional structures with highly anisotropic molecular orbitals. Here we present the thermoelectric transport properties of the quasi-one-dimensional dimer-Mott insulator $\beta'$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$ICl$_2$, where BEDT-TTF stands for bis(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene. We find that the thermopower exhibits typical activation-type temperature variation expected for insulators but its absolute value is anomalously large compared to the expected value from the activation-type temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity. Successively, the Jonker-plot analysis, in which the thermopower is usually scaled by the logarithm of the resistivity, shows an unusual relation among such transport quantities. We discuss a role of the low dimensionality for the enhanced thermopower along with recent observations of such a large thermopower in several low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Strong enhancement of magnetic coercivity induced by uniaxial stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of permanent magnets is intricately tied to their magnetic hysteresis loop. In this study, we investigate the heavy-fermion ferromagnet CeAgSb$_2$ through magnetization measurements under uniaxial stress. We observe a 2400 % increase in magnetic coercivity with just a modest stress of approximately 1 kbar. This effect persists even after pressure release, attributable to stress-induced defects that efficiently pin domain walls. Other magnetic properties such as ordering temperature and saturation moment exhibit only weak pressure dependencies and display full reversibility. Our findings offer a promising route for increasing coercive field strength and enhancing the energy product in ferromagnetic materials and are potentially applicable to a broad spectrum of commercial or emerging magnetic applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Modelling of Magnetism in Strongly Correlated Materials: Evaluating Constrained DFT and LDA+$U$+$J$ for Y114</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-metal compounds represent a fascinating playground for exploring the intricate relationship between structural distortions, electronic properties, and magnetic behaviour, holding significant promise for technological advancements. Among these compounds, YBaCo$_4$O$_{7}$ (Y114) is attractive due to its manifestation of a ferrimagnetic component at low temperature intertwined with distortion effect due to the charge disproportionation on Co ions, exerting profound impact on its magnetic properties. In this perspective paper, we study the structural and magnetic intricacies of the Y114 crystal. Traditionally, the investigation of such materials has relied heavily on computational modelling using density-functional theory (DFT) with the on-site Coulomb interaction correction $U$ (DFT+$U$) based on the Hubbard model (sometimes including Hund's exchange coupling parameter $J$, DFT+$U$+$J$) to unravel their complexities. Herein, we analysed the spurious effects of magnetic-moment delocalisation and spillover to non-magnetic ions in the lattice on electronic structure and magnetic properties of Y114. To overcome this problem we have applied constrained DFT (cDFT) based on the potential self-consistency approach, and comprehensively explore the Y114 crystal's characteristics in its ferrimagnetic order. We find that cDFT yields magnetic moments of Co ions much closer to the experimental values than LDA+$U$+$J$ with the parameters $U$ and $J$ fitted to reproduce experimental lattice constants. cDFT allows for an accurate prediction of magnetic properties using oxidation states of magnetic ions as well-defined parameters. Through this perspective, we not only enhance our understanding of the magnetic interactions in Y114 crystal, but also pave the way for future investigations into magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Composite antiferromagnetic and orbital order with altermagnetic properties at a cuprate/manganite interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterostructures from complex oxides allow one to combine various electronic and magnetic orders as to induce new quantum states. A prominent example is the coupling between superconducting and magnetic orders in multilayers from high-Tc cuprates and manganites. A key role is played here by the interfacial CuO2 layer whose distinct properties remain to be fully understood. Here, we study with resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) the magnon excitations of this interfacial CuO2 layer. In particular, we show that the underlying antiferromagnetic exchange interaction at the interface is strongly suppressed to J ~ 70 meV, as compared to J ~ 130 meV for the CuO2 layers away from the interface. Moreover, we observe an anomalous momentum dependence of the intensity of the interfacial magnon mode and show that it suggests that the antiferromagnetic order is accompanied by a particular kind of orbital order that yields a so-called altermagnetic state. Such a two-dimensional altermagnet has recently been predicted to enable new spintronic applications and superconducting proximity effects.</description>

      <title>Boundary effect and quantum phases in spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundary effect is a widespread idea in many-body theories. However, it is more of a conceptual notion than a rigorously defined physical quantity. One can quantify the boundary effect by comparing two ground states of the same physical model, which differ only slightly in system size. Here, we analyze the quantity, which we call a boundary effect function, for an XXZ spin-1/2 model using density matrix renormalization group calculations. We find that three quantum phases of the model manifest as different functional forms of the boundary effect function. As a result, the quantum phase transition of the model is associated with a nonanalytic change of the boundary effect function. This work thus provides and concretizes a novel perspective on the relationship between bulk and boundary properties of ground states.</description>

      <title>Classical origins of Landau-incompatible transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous phase transitions where symmetry is spontaneously broken are ubiquitous in physics and often found between `Landau-compatible' phases where residual symmetries of one phase are a subset of the other. However, continuous `deconfined quantum critical' transitions between Landau-incompatible symmetry-breaking phases are known to exist in certain quantum systems, often with anomalous microscopic symmetries. In this paper, we investigate the need for such special conditions. We show that Landau-incompatible transitions can be found in a family of well-known classical statistical mechanical models with anomaly-free on-site microscopic symmetries, introduced by Jos\'{e}, Kadanoff, Kirkpatick and Nelson (Phys. Rev. B 16, 1217). The models are labeled by a positive integer $Q$ and constructed by a deformation of the 2d classical XY model, defined on any lattice, with an on-site potential that preserves a discrete $Q$-fold spin rotation and reflection symmetry. For a range of temperatures, even $Q$ models exhibit two Landau-incompatible partial symmetry-breaking phases and a direct transition between them for $Q \ge 4$. Characteristic features of Landau-incompatible transitions are easily seen, such as enhanced symmetries and melting of charged defects. For odd $Q$, and corresponding temperature ranges, two regions of a single partial symmetry-breaking phase are obtained, split by a stable `unnecessary critical' line. We present quantum models with anomaly-free symmetries that also exhibit similar phase diagrams.</description>

      <title>Transitionless Quantum Driving of the Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) make the fast preparation of many-body states possible, circumventing the limitations of adiabatic strategies. We propose a fast STA protocol for generating interacting states in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid by counter-diabatic driving, stirring the dynamics with an auxiliary control field. To this end, we exploit the equivalence between the time-dependent Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid and an ensemble of quantum oscillators with driven mass and frequency. We specify the closed-form expression of the counterdiabatic control and demonstrate its efficiency in suppressing excitations.</description>

      <title>Sign problem in tensor network contraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the computational difficulty of contracting tensor networks depends on the sign structure of the tensor entries. Using results from computational complexity, we observe that the approximate contraction of tensor networks with only positive entries has lower complexity. This raises the question how this transition in computational complexity manifests itself in the hardness of different contraction schemes. We pursue this question by studying random tensor networks with varying bias towards positive entries. First, we consider contraction via Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the transition from hard to easy occurs when the entries become predominantly positive; this can be seen as a tensor network manifestation of the Quantum Monte Carlo sign problem. Second, we analyze the commonly used contraction based on boundary tensor networks. Its performance is governed by the amount of correlations (entanglement) in the tensor network. Remarkably, we find that the transition from hard to easy (i.e., from a volume law to a boundary law scaling of entanglement) occurs already for a slight bias towards a positive mean, and the earlier the larger the bond dimension is. This is in contrast to both expectations and the behavior found in Monte Carlo contraction. We gain further insight into this early transition from the study of an effective statmech model. Finally, we investigate the computational difficulty of computing expectation values of tensor network wavefunctions, i.e., PEPS, where we find that the complexity of entanglement-based contraction always remains low. We explain this by providing a local transformation which maps PEPS expectation values to a positive-valued tensor network. This not only provides insight into the origin of the observed boundary law entanglement scaling, but also suggests new approaches towards PEPS contraction based on positive decompositions.</description>

      <title>Many-body quantum thermal machines in a Lieb-kagome Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems serve as a suitable working medium for realizing quantum thermal machines (QTMs) by offering distinct advantages such as cooperative many-body effects, and performance boost at the quantum critical points. However, the bulk of the existing literature exploring the criticality of many-body systems in the context of QTMs involves models sans the electronic interactions, which are non-trivial to deal with and require sophisticated numerical techniques. Here we adopt the prototypical Hubbard model in two dimensions (2D) in the framework of the line graph Lieb-kagome lattice for the working medium of a multi-functional QTM. We resort to a non-perturbative, static path approximated (SPA) Monte Carlo technique to deal with the repulsive Hubbard model. We observe that in a Stirling cycle, in both the interacting and non-interacting limits, the heat engine function dominates and its performance gets better when the strain is induced from the kagome to the Lieb limit, while for the reverse the refrigeration action is preferred. Further, we show that the QTM performs better when the difference between the temperatures of the two baths is lower and the QTM reaches the Carnot limit in this regime. Further, we extensively study the performance of the QTM in the repulsive Hubbard interacting regime where the magnetic orders come into the picture. We explore the performance of the QTM along the quantum critical points and in the large interaction limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-configurational electronic structure theory delivers the most versatile approximations to many-electron wavefunctions, flexible enough to deal with all sorts of transformations, ranging from electronic excitations, to open-shell molecules and chemical reactions. Multi-configurational models are therefore essential to establish universally applicable, predictive ab initio methods for chemistry. Here, we present a discussion of explicit correlation approaches which address the nagging problem of dealing with static and dynamic electron correlation in multi-configurational active-space approaches. We review the latest developments and then point to their key obstacles. Our discussion is supported by new data obtained with tensor network methods. We argue in favor of simple electrons-only correlator expressions that may allow one to define transcorrelated models in which the correlator does not bear a dependence on molecular structure.</description>

      <title>Origin of Superconductivity in Rhombohedral Trilayer Graphene: Quasiparticle Pairing within the Inter-Valley Coherent Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity (SC) is observed in rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG) with an extremely low charge carrier densities, between the normal metal state and a probable inter-valley coherent (IVC) state. The measured coherence length in RTG is roughly two orders of magnitude shorter than the value predicted by a conventional BCS theory. To resolve these discrepancies, we propose that the RTG SC phase arises from the pairing of quasiparticles within the IVC phase. We illustrate the SC behavior using gapped Dirac cones with the chemical potential close to the conduction band's bottom and establish the Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our findings indicate that the mean-field transition temperature, $T_\mathrm{MF}$, is primarily determined by the density of states of quasiparticles within the IVC phase, and is more suppressed in comparison with the BCS relation. Interestingly, we discover that the coherence length behaves according to $\xi\sim 1/\sqrt{T_\mathrm{MF}}$. When the chemical potential lies within the band gap, the conventional coherence length becomes small, while the quantum metric contribution can diverge. Applying our approach to a microscopic model for RTG, our predictions align well with experimental data and effectively capture key measurable features of quantities such as the mean-field transition temperature $T_\mathrm{MF}$ and the coherence length $\xi$. Furthermore, we reveal that the quantum metric contribution, stemming from the multi-band properties of the IVC quasiparticles, plays a significant role in determining the coherence length around the transition regime from superconductivity to IVC. Lastly, experimental predictions are discussed on bebaviors of the upper critical field and coherence length at low temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A remarkable feature of topological superconductors is the emergence of Majorana fermions in electron systems. Whereas the emergent Majorana fermions share the self-anti-particle property with Majorana fermions in particle physics, they may have essentially different electromagnetic properties. In this paper, we argue the electromagnetic response of spinful Majorana fermions in topological superconductors. We present a general theory of the electromagnetic response of spinful Majorana fermions in topological superconductors and clarify how the pairing symmetry is encoded in the electromagnetic response. As an application, we predict the sublattice-dependent dipole (Ising)-type magnetic response of corner Majorana fermions in iron-based superconductors.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of two harmonically trapped atoms in the presence of spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling. The two-body energy spectrum is numerically calculated by utilizing the exact diagonalization method. We analyze how the degeneracy of energy levels is lifted under the interplay between the interatomic interaction and spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling. The exact numerical results show an excellent agreement with that of perturbation theory in the weak-interaction limit, as well as that in the absence of spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling. The properties of correlations between the two atoms are also discussed with respect to the interaction strength. The findings in this work may provide valuable insights into few-body physics subjected to spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling, and the possible experimental detection of spectrum functions in many-body systems, such as radio-frequency spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal electrodynamics and the penetration depth of superconducting Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal quasiparticles in a clean type-II superconductor with line nodes give rise to a quadratic low-temperature change of the penetration depth, $\Delta \lambda \sim T^2$, as first shown by Kosztin and Leggett [I. Kosztin and A. J. Leggett, Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 135 (1997)]. Here, we generalize this result to multiple nodes and compare it to numerically exact evaluations of the temperature-dependent penetration depth in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ using a high-precision tight-binding model. We compare the calculations to recent penetration depth measurements in high purity single crystals of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ [J. F. Landaeta et al., arXiv:2312.05129]. When assuming the order parameter to have $\mathrm{B}_{1\mathrm{g}}$ symmetry, we find that both a simple $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave and complicated gap structures with contributions from higher harmonics and accidental nodes can accommodate the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Density-wave-like gap evolution in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure revealed by ultrafast optical spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the quasiparticle dynamics in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ crystal using ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy at high pressure up to 34.2 GPa. At ambient pressure, the temperature dependence of relaxation indicates appearance of phonon bottleneck effect due to the opening of density-wave-like gap at 151 K. By analyzing the data with RT model, we identified the energy scale of the gap to be 70 meV at ambient pressure. The relaxation bottleneck effect is suppressed gradually by the pressure and disappears around 26 GPa. At high pressure above 29.4 GPa, we discover a new density-wave like order with transition temperature of $\sim$130 K. Our results not only provide the first experimental evidence of the density-wave like gap evolution under high pressure, but also offering insight into the underline interplay between the density wave order and superconductivity in pressured La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Nonstandard Hubbard model and electron pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a non-standard Hubbard model applicable to arbitrary single-particle potential profiles and inter-particle interactions. Our approach involves a novel treatment of Wannier functions, free from the ambiguities of conventional methods and applicable to finite systems without periodicity constraints. To ensure the consistent evaluation of Wannier functions, we develop a perturbative approach, utilizing the barrier penetration coefficient as a perturbation parameter. With the newly defined Wannier functions as a basis, we derive the Hubbard Hamiltonian, revealing the emergence of density-induced and pair tunneling terms alongside standard contributions. Our investigation demonstrates that long-range inter-particle interactions can induce a novel mechanism for repulsive particle pairing. This mechanism relies on the effective suppression of single-particle tunneling due to density-induced tunneling. Contrary to expectations based on the standard Hubbard model, an increase in inter-particle interaction does not lead to an insulating state. Instead, our proposed mechanism implies the coherent motion of correlated electron pairs, similar to bound states within a multi-well system, resistant to decay from single-electron tunneling transitions. These findings carry significant implications for various phenomena, including the formation of flat bands, the emergence of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene, and the possibility of a novel metal-insulator transition.</description>

      <title>Boosting Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo with Submatrix Updates: Unveiling the Phase Diagram of the 3D Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of strongly correlated fermionic systems, crucial for understanding condensed matter physics, has been significantly advanced by numerical computational methods. Among these, the Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method stands out for its ability to provide exact numerical solutions. However, the computational complexity of DQMC, particularly in dealing with large system sizes and the notorious sign problem, limits its applicability. We introduce an innovative approach to enhance DQMC efficiency through the implementation of submatrix updates. Building upon the foundational work of conventional fast updates and delay updates, our method leverages a generalized submatrix update algorithm to address challenges in simulating strongly correlated fermionic systems with both onsite and extended interactions at both finite and zero temperatures. We demonstrate the method's superiority by comparing it with previous update methods in terms of computational complexity and efficiency. Specifically, our submatrix update method significantly reduces the computational overhead, enabling the simulation of system sizes up to 8,000 sites without pushing hard. This advancement allows for a more accurate determination of the finite temperature phase diagram of the 3D Hubbard model at half-filling. Our findings not only shed light on the phase transitions within these complex systems but also pave the way for more effective simulations of strongly correlated electrons, potentially guiding experimental efforts in cold atom simulations of the 3D Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Inelastic decay from integrability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hallmark of integrable systems is the purely elastic scattering of their excitations. Such systems possess an extensive number of locally conserved charges, leading to the conservation of the number of scattered excitations, as well as their set of individual momenta. In this work, we show that inelastic decay can nevertheless be observed in circuit QED realizations of integrable boundary models. We consider the scattering of microwave photons off impurities in superconducting circuits implementing the boundary sine-Gordon and Kondo models, which are both integrable. We show that not only inelastic decay is possible for the microwave photons, in spite of integrability, and thanks to a nonlinear relation between them and the elastically-scattered excitations, but also that integrability in fact provides powerful analytical tools allowing to obtain exact expressions for response functions describing the inelastic decay. Using the framework of form factors, we calculate the total inelastic decay rate and elastic phase shift of the microwave photons, extracted from a 2-point response function. We then go beyond linear response and obtain the exact energy-resolved inelastic decay spectrum, using a novel method to evaluate form factor expansions of 3-point response functions, which could prove useful in other applications of integrable quantum field theories. We relate our results to several recent photon splitting experiments, and in particular to recent experimental data that provides evidence for the elusive Schmid-Bulgadaev dissipative quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>Axions and Superfluidity in Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An effective field theory (EFT) for dynamical axions in Weyl semimetals (WSMs) is presented. A pseudoscalar axion excitation is predicted in WSMs at sufficiently low temperatures, independently of the strength of the Weyl fermion self-coupling. For strong fermion self-coupling the axion is the gapless Goldstone boson of chiral $U(1)^{\text{ch}}$ spontaneous symmetry breaking. For weak fermion self-coupling an axion is also generated at non-zero chiral density for Weyl nodes displaced in energy, as a gapless collective mode of correlated fermion pair excitations of the Fermi surface. This is an explicit example of the extension of Goldstone's theorem to symmetry breaking by the axial anomaly itself. In both cases the axion is a chiral density wave or phason mode of the superfluid state of the WSM, and the Weyl fermions form a chiral condensate $\langle\bar{\psi}\psi\rangle$ at low temperatures. In the presence of an applied magnetic field the axion mode becomes gapped, in analogy to the Anderson-Higgs mechanism in a superconductor. 't Hooft anomaly matching from ultraviolet to infrared scales is directly verified in the EFT approach. WSMs thus provide an interesting quantum system in which superfluid, non-Fermi liquid behavior, and a dynamical axion are predicted to follow directly from the axial anomaly in a consistent EFT that may be tested experimentally.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the tricritical Ising model in tunable Josephson junction ladders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern hybrid superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junction arrays are a promising platform for analog quantum simulations. Their controllable and non-sinusoidal energy/phase relation opens the path to implement nontrivial interactions and study the emergence of exotic quantum phase transitions. Here, we propose the analysis of an array of hybrid Josephson junctions defining a 2-leg ladder geometry for the quantum simulation of the tricritical Ising phase transition. This transition provides the paradigmatic example of minimal conformal models beyond Ising criticality and its excitations are intimately related with Fibonacci non-Abelian anyons and topological order in two dimensions. We study this superconducting system and its thermodynamic phases based on bosonization and matrix-product-states techniques. Its effective continuous description in terms of a three-frequency sine-Gordon quantum field theory suggests the presence of the targeted tricritical point and the numerical simulations confirm this picture. Our results indicate which experimental observables can be adopted in realistic devices to probe the physics and the phase transitions of the model. Additionally, our proposal provides a useful one-dimensional building block to design exotic topological order in two-dimensional scalable Josephson junction arrays.</description>

      <title>Phononic dynamical axion in magnetic Dirac insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In cosmology, the axion is a hypothetical particle that is currently considered as candidate for dark matter. In condensed matter, a counterpart of the axion (the "axion quasiparticle") has been predicted to emerge in magnetoelectric insulators with fluctuating magnetic order and in charge-ordered Weyl semimetals. To date, both the cosmological and condensed-matter axions remain experimentally elusive or unconfirmed. Here, we show theoretically that ordinary lattice vibrations can form an axion quasiparticle in Dirac insulators with broken time- and space-inversion symmetries, even in the absence of magnetic fluctuations. The physical manifestation of the phononic axion is a magnetic-field-induced phonon effective charge, which can be probed in optical spectroscopy. By replacing magnetic fluctuations with lattice vibrations, our theory widens the scope for the observability of the axion quasiparticle in condensed matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06375v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic regime in metals with momentum-conserving electron-electron scattering. The conservation of momentum results in well-defined dynamics whose effects we investigate via the relevant continuity equations. We find anomalous contributions to the charge and heat transport currents arising from gradients of the velocity field in a semiclassical treatment with a Berry curvature. These contributions are non-vanishing for systems lacking inversion symmetry, and the corresponding transport coefficients do not obey the standard Onsager reciprocity relations. Instead, we show that the response coefficients relating the currents to the stress tensor obey independent reciprocity relations with the stress tensor and thus exhibit cross-tensor effects of charge and heat transport with the momentum transport. The Berry curvature contribution to the stress magnetization tensor is also derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for the numerical evaluation of five-point conformal blocks in $d$-dimensions, greatly improving the efficiency of their computation. To do this we use an appropriate ansatz for the blocks as a series expansion in radial coordinates, derive a set of recursion relations for the unknown coefficients in the ansatz, and evaluate the series using a Pad\'e approximant to accelerate its convergence. We then study the $\langle\sigma\sigma\epsilon\sigma\sigma\rangle$ correlator in the 3d critical Ising model by truncating the operator product expansion (OPE) and only including operators with conformal dimension below a cutoff $\Delta\leqslant \Delta_{\rm cutoff}$. We approximate the contributions of the operators above the cutoff by the corresponding contributions in a suitable disconnected five-point correlator. Using this approach, we compute a number of OPE coefficients with greater accuracy than previous methods.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a versatile class of quantum materials of interest to various fields including, e.g., nanoelectronics, optical devices, and topological and correlated quantum matter. Tailoring the electronic properties of TMDs is essential to their applications in many directions. Here, we report that a highly controllable and uniform on-chip 2D metallization process converts a class of atomically thin TMDs into robust superconductors, a property belonging to none of the starting materials. As examples, we demonstrate the introduction of superconductivity into a class of 2D air-sensitive topological TMDs, including monolayers of Td-WTe2, 1T'-MoTe2 and 2H-MoTe2, as well as their natural and twisted bilayers, metalized with an ultrathin layer of Palladium. This class of TMDs are known to exhibit intriguing topological phases ranging from topological insulator, Weyl semimetal to fractional Chern insulator. The unique, high-quality two-dimensional metallization process is based on our recent findings of the long-distance, non-Fickian in-plane mass transport and chemistry in 2D that occur at relatively low temperatures and in devices fully encapsulated with inert insulating layers. Highly compatible with existing nanofabrication techniques for van der Waals (vdW) stacks, our results offer a route to designing and engineering superconductivity and topological phases in a class of correlated 2D materials.</description>
