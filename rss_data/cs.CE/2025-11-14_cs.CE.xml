      <title>Localized kernel gradient correction for SPH simulations of water wave propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Basic Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) models exhibit excessive, numerical dissipation in the simulation of water wave propagation. This can be remedied using higher-order approaches such as kernel gradient correction, which introduce additional computational effort. The present work demonstrates, that the higher-order scheme is only required in a limited part of the water wave in order to obtain satisfying results. The criterion for distinguishing particles in need of special treatment from those that do not is motivated by water wave mechanics. Especially for deep water waves, the approach potentially spares large amounts of computational effort. The present paper also proposes a remedy for issues of the kernel gradient correction occurring at the free surface. Satisfying results for the proposed approach are shown for a standing wave in a basin and a progressive wave train in a long wave tank.</description>

      <title>Phase field modelling of cracking and capacity fade in core-shell cathode particles for lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-shell electrode particles are a promising morphology control strategy for high-performance lithium-ion batteries. However, experimental observations reveal that these structures remain prone to mechanical failure, with shell fractures and core-shell debonding occurring after a single charge. In this work, we present a novel, comprehensive computational framework to predict and gain insight into the failure of core-shell morphologies and the associated degradation in battery performance. The fully coupled chemo-mechano-damage model presented captures the interplay between mechanical damage and electrochemical behaviours, enabling the quantification of particle cracking and capacity fade. Both bulk material fracture and interface debonding are captured by utilising the phase field method. We quantify the severity of particle cracking and capacity loss through case studies on a representative core-shell system (NMC811@NMC532). The results bring valuable insights into cracking patterns, underlying mechanisms, and their impact on capacity loss. Surface cracks are found to initiate when a significantly higher lithium concentration accumulates in the core compared to the shell. Interfacial debonding is shown to arise from localised hoop stresses near the core-shell interface, due to greater shell expansion. This debonding develops rapidly, impedes lithium-ion transport, and can lead to more than 10\% capacity loss after a single discharge. Furthermore, larger particles may experience crack branching driven by extensive tensile zones, potentially fragmenting the entire particle. The framework developed can not only bring new insight into the degradation mechanisms of core-shell particles but also be used to design electrode materials with improved performance and extended lifetime.</description>

      <title>Boosting In-Silicon Directed Evolution with Fine-Tuned Protein Language Model and Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein evolution through amino acid sequence mutations is a cornerstone of life sciences. While current in-silicon directed evolution algorithms focus on designing search strategies, they overlook how to utilize the transformative protein language models, which encode rich evolutionary patterns, to guide search. To bridge this gap, we propose AlphaDE, a novel framework to evolve protein sequences by harnessing the innovative paradigms of large language models. First, AlphaDE fine-tunes pretrained protein language models using masked language modeling on homologous protein sequences to activate the evolutionary plausibility for the interested protein class. Second, AlphaDE introduces test-time inference based on Monte Carlo tree search, which effectively evolves proteins with evolutionary guidance from the fine-tuned protein language model. Extensive benchmark experiments show that AlphaDE remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods even with few-shot fine-tuning. An interesting case study further shows that AlphaDE supports condensing the protein sequence space through computational evolution.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Quantum Algorithms for Solving Nonlinear Differential Equations Using Multiple Bosonic Modes Coupled with Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers have long been expected to efficiently solve complex classical differential equations. Most digital, fault-tolerant approaches use Carleman linearization to map nonlinear systems to linear ones and then apply quantum linear-system solvers. However, provable speedups typically require digital truncation and full fault tolerance, rendering such linearization approaches challenging to implement on current hardware. Here we present an analog, continuous-variable algorithm based on coupled bosonic modes with qubit-based adaptive measurements that avoids Hilbert-space digitization. This method encodes classical fields as coherent states and, via Kraus-channel composition derived from the Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formalism, maps nonlinear evolution to linear dynamics. Unlike many analog schemes, the algorithm is provably efficient: advancing a first-order, $L$-grid point, $d$-dimensional, order-$K$ spatial-derivative, degree-$r$ polynomial-nonlinearity, strongly dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs) for $T$ time steps costs $\mathcal{O}\left(T(\log L + d r \log K)\right)$. The capability of the scheme is demonstrated by using it to simulate the one-dimensional Burgers' equation and two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation. The resilience of the method to photon loss is shown under strong-dissipation conditions and an analytic counterterm is derived that systematically cancels the dominant, experimentally calibrated noise. This work establishes a continuous-variable framework for simulating nonlinear systems and identifies a viable pathway toward practical quantum speedup on near-term analog hardware.</description>

      <title>Robust AI-ECG for Predicting Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction in Pediatric Congenital Heart Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) has shown promise as an inexpensive, ubiquitous, and non-invasive screening tool to detect left ventricular systolic dysfunction in pediatric congenital heart disease. However, current approaches rely heavily on large-scale labeled datasets, which poses a major obstacle to the democratization of AI in hospitals where only limited pediatric ECG data are available. In this work, we propose a robust training framework to improve AI-ECG performance under low-resource conditions. Specifically, we introduce an on-manifold adversarial perturbation strategy for pediatric ECGs to generate synthetic noise samples that better reflect real-world signal variations. Building on this, we develop an uncertainty-aware adversarial training algorithm that is architecture-agnostic and enhances model robustness. Evaluation on the real-world pediatric dataset demonstrates that our method enables low-cost and reliable detection of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, highlighting its potential for deployment in resource-limited clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Neural ODEs for Gene Regulatory Network Discovery under Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02409v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern high-throughput biological datasets with thousands of perturbations provide the opportunity for large-scale discovery of causal graphs that represent the regulatory interactions between genes. Differentiable causal graphical models have been proposed to infer a gene regulatory network (GRN) from large scale interventional datasets, capturing the causal gene regulatory relationships from genetic perturbations. However, existing models are limited in their expressivity and scalability while failing to address the dynamic nature of biological processes such as cellular differentiation. We propose PerturbODE, a novel framework that incorporates biologically informative neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) to model cell state trajectories under perturbations and derive the causal GRN from the neural ODE's parameters. We demonstrate PerturbODE's efficacy in trajectory prediction and GRN inference across simulated and real over-expression datasets.</description>

      <title>MLIP Arena: Advancing Fairness and Transparency in Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials via an Open, Accessible Benchmark Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized molecular and materials modeling, but existing benchmarks suffer from data leakage, limited transferability, and an over-reliance on error-based metrics tied to specific density functional theory (DFT) references. We introduce MLIP Arena, a benchmark platform that evaluates force field performance based on physics awareness, chemical reactivity, stability under extreme conditions, and predictive capabilities for thermodynamic properties and physical phenomena. By moving beyond static DFT references and revealing the important failure modes of current foundation MLIPs in real-world settings, MLIP Arena provides a reproducible framework to guide the next-generation MLIP development toward improved predictive accuracy and runtime efficiency while maintaining physical consistency. The Python package and online leaderboard are available at https://github.com/atomind-ai/mlip-arena.</description>

      <title>Personalized Chain-of-Thought Summarization of Financial News for Investor Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial advisors and investors struggle with information overload from financial news, where irrelevant content and noise obscure key market signals and hinder timely investment decisions. To address this, we propose a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) summarization framework that condenses financial news into concise, event-driven summaries. The framework integrates user-specified keywords to generate personalized outputs, ensuring that only the most relevant contexts are highlighted. These personalized summaries provide an intermediate layer that supports language models in producing investor-focused narratives, bridging the gap between raw news and actionable insights.</description>
