      <title>Controller to eliminate the first harmonic in delayed periodic signal with application to rotational scanning atomic force microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The plant (system to be controlled) produces a periodic signal containing broad spectrum of the Fourier harmonics. The first Fourier harmonic (sine-type signal) assumed to be undesirable and should be removed by an external force, while other harmonics should be preserved. Because the measured plant data has an unknown amount of time delay and a sensitivity of the plant to external force is unknown, thus the amplitude and the phase of an anti-sine control force are unknown as well. We developed an adaptive controller described as a linear time-invariant system which is able to remove the first harmonic from the plant's output by constantly adjusting it's parameters of control force even if time delay of the plant output signal and plant sensitivity to the external force have slow variations over time. That type of controller was requested to further extend capabilities of newly developed high-speed large-area rotational scanning atomic force microscopy technique where the sample is rotated and a tilt angle between the normal of the sample surface and the axis of rotation produces the parasitic first Fourier harmonic which significantly limits the scanning area.</description>

      <title>Modelling co-evolution of resource feedback and social network dynamics in human-environmental systems</title>

Abstract: Games with environmental feedback have become a crucial area of study across various scientific domains, modelling the dynamic interplay between human decisions and environmental changes, and highlighting the consequences of our choices on natural resources and biodiversity. In this work, we propose a co-evolutionary model for human-environment systems that incorporates the effects of knowledge feedback and social interaction on the sustainability of common pool resources. The model represents consumers as agents who adjust their resource extraction based on the resource's state. These agents are connected through social networks, where links symbolize either affinity or aversion among them. The interplay between social dynamics and resource dynamics is explored, with the system's evolution analyzed across various network topologies and initial conditions. We find that knowledge feedback can independently sustain common pool resources. However, the impact of social interactions on sustainability is dual-faceted: it can either support or impede sustainability, influenced by the network's connectivity and heterogeneity. A notable finding is the identification of a critical network mean degree, beyond which a depletion/repletion transition parallels an absorbing/active state transition in social dynamics, i.e., individual agents and their connections are/are not prone to being frozen in their social states. Furthermore, the study examines the evolution of the social network, revealing the emergence of two polarized groups where agents within each community have the same affinity. Comparative analyses using Monte-Carlo simulations and rate equations are employed, along with analytical arguments, to reinforce the study's findings. The model successfully captures how information spread and social dynamics may impact the sustanebility of common pool resource.</description>

  Information on power grids is confidential and thus real data is often inaccessible. This necessitates the use of synthetic power grid models in research. So far the models used, for example, in machine learning had to be very simple and homogeneous to produce large ensembles of robust grids. We present a modular framework to generate synthetic power grids that considers the heterogeneity of real power grid dynamics but remains simple and tractable. This enables the generation of large sets of synthetic grids for a wide range of applications. We also include the major drivers of fluctuations on short-time scales. The synthetic grids generated are robust and show good synchronization under all evaluated scenarios, as should be expected for realistic power grids. This opens the door to future research that studies grids under severe stress due to extreme events which could lead to destabilization and black-outs. A software package that includes an efficient Julia implementation of the framework is released as a companion to the paper.</description>

      <title>Complex Couplings -- A universal, adaptive and bilinear formulation of power grid dynamics</title>

  The energy transition introduces new classes of dynamical actors into the power grid. There is a growing need for so-called grid-forming inverters (GFIs) that can contribute to dynamic grid stability as the share of synchronous generators decreases. Understanding the collective behavior and stability of future grids, featuring a heterogeneous mix of dynamics, remains an urgent and challenging task. Two recent advances in describing such modern power grid dynamics have made this problem more tractable: First, the normal form for grid-forming actors provides a uniform, technology-neutral description of plausible grid dynamics, including grid-forming inverters and synchronous machines. Secondly, the notion of the complex frequency has been introduced to effortlessly describe how the nodal dynamics influence the power flows in the grid. The major contribution of this paper is to show how the normal form approach and the complex frequency dynamics of power grids combine, and how they relate naturally to adaptive dynamical networks and control affine systems. Using normal form and complex frequency, we derive a remarkably elementary and universal equation for the collective grid dynamics. Notably, we obtain an elegant equation entirely in terms of a matrix of complex couplings, in which the network topology does not explicitly appear. These complex couplings give rise to new adaptive network formulations of future power grid dynamics. We give a new formulation of the Kuramoto model with inertia as a special case.</description>

      <title>Cavity magnomechanics: from classical to quantum</title>

Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems based on magnons in magnetic materials have made significant progress in the past decade. They are built based on the couplings of magnons with microwave photons, optical photons, vibration phonons, and superconducting qubits. In particular, the interactions among magnons, microwave cavity photons, and vibration phonons form the system of cavity magnomechanics (CMM), which lies in the interdisciplinary field of cavity QED, magnonics, quantum optics, and quantum information. Here, we review the experimental and theoretical progress of this emerging field. We first introduce the underlying theories of the magnomechanical coupling, and then some representative classical phenomena that have been experimentally observed, including magnomechanically induced transparency, magnomechanical dynamical backaction, magnon-phonon cross-Kerr nonlinearity, etc. We also discuss a number of theoretical proposals, which show the potential of the CMM system for preparing different kinds of quantum states of magnons, phonons, and photons, and hybrid systems combining magnomechanics and optomechanics and relevant quantum protocols based on them. Finally, we summarize this review and provide an outlook for the future research directions in this field.</description>
