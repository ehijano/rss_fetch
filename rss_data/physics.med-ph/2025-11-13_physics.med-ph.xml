      <title>Per-Lesion Radiomics Analysis of 68Ga-DOTA FAPI-46 and 18F-FDG PET/CT in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This pilot study compares per-lesion radiomics features of [68Ga]-DOTA FAPI-46 and [18F]-FDG PET/CT in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to explore complementary insights into intratumoral heterogeneity beyond conventional SUV metrics, aiming to enhance lesion characterization and clinical decision-making. A total of 28 PET/CT scans (14 [18F]-FDG and 14 [68Ga]-DOTA FAPI-46) were acquired for the initial staging of biopsy-confirmed NSCLC. A total of 81 co-localized lesions (lung: 21, mediastinal lymph nodes: 42, bone: 18) were segmented, with radiomics features extracted via PyRadiomics after IBSI-compliant preprocessing. Paired per-lesion comparisons used t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction. Significant differences (adjusted P &lt; 0.05) were identified across intensity, texture, and shape features. In lung lesions, FAPI showed lower first-order metrics but higher variance and GLCM contrast, suggesting stromal heterogeneity. Mediastinal lymph nodes had fewer differences, with FAPI exhibiting lower run percentage (GLRLM: -0.298, -6.196, P=1.45E-08). Bone lesions showed extensive variations, including reduced FAPI entropy (e.g., Entropy: -1.743, -5.798, P=6.95E-08). Feature overlaps highlighted complementary stromal (FAPI) and metabolic (FDG) insights. This pilot study demonstrates that per-lesion radiomics can capture complementary biological information from FAPI and FDG PET in NSCLC, highlighting intratumoral heterogeneity and stromal activity not fully appreciated by conventional SUV-based metrics.</description>

      <title>An image-guided high-precision research platform for ultra-high dose rate spinal cord toxicity studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: While FLASH radiotherapy is recognized for short-term normal tissue sparing, its durability in late-responding organs remains uncertain, limiting clinical adoption. With its clinical importance and steep dose-response, the spinal cord is an ideal model for evaluating FLASH effect on late toxicity. This work introduces a robust image-guided research platform for high-precision irradiation at both CONV and UHDR to enable FLASH late toxicity studies using a rat spinal cord model. Approach: A modified LINAC was employed to irradiate the C1-T2 rat spinal cord with 18 MeV UHDR and CONV beams. A custom rat immobilization device, a portable X-ray imaging system, and an ion-chamber-based UHDR output monitoring system were integrated to ensure accurate C1-T2 localization and precise dose delivery. A Monte Carlo (MC) dose engine was developed to provide accurate dosimetry and support interpretation of in vivo results. Scintillator measurements were performed within the spinal cord to verify MC results and the precision of our platform. Results: We achieved submillimeter C1-T2 setup accuracy and maintained submillimeter intrafraction motion. Ion chamber readings showed linear correlation with UHDR output. MC indicated uniform irradiation along the central ~13 mm cord. Our CONV beam exhibited distribution close to that of the UHDR beam, with difference &lt;3%, isolating dose rate as the only variable. Scintillator-measured dose agreed with MC within 4%, confirming both MC accuracy and the platform's high-precision delivery. Significance: We developed the first comprehensive, image-guided preclinical platform for accurate UHDR and CONV irradiation to investigate FLASH-mitigated spinal cord toxicity in rats. This work thus establishes a robust foundation for systematic evaluation of the FLASH effect in late-responding organs and for determining clinical applicability of FLASH.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Partial Volume Correction on FDG PET Radiomics Reproducibility in Lymphoma Lesions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To evaluate how partial volume correction (PVC) affects the reproducibility of 18F-FDG PET radiomic features in lymphoma lesions, with respect to lesion volume and tissue type. This single-center retrospective study included 131 newly diagnosed lymphoma patients who underwent baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT. In total, 1,603 lesions (1,302 lymph nodes, 117 spleen/liver, 150 bone, and 34 bone/soft-tissue) were semi-automatically segmented and grouped by volume (&lt;3, 3-10, 10-30, &gt;30 mL) and tissue type. 93 radiomic features were extracted from non-PVC and PVC images processed with the Richardson-Lucy (RL) and Reblurred Van Cittert (RVC) algorithms following IBSI guidelines. Reproducibility was quantified using the coefficient of variation (CoV) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2, absolute agreement), with statistical comparisons performed via Mann-Whitney U tests and false-discovery-rate (FDR) correction. PVC significantly improved feature reproducibility, particularly for large lesions (&gt;30 mL), with median ICC2&gt;0.90 across most feature categories. Small lesions (&lt;3 mL) showed lower stability (ICC2=0.84-0.94) and higher CoV (0.09-0.21). First-Order and GLCM features were the most robust overall (ICC2=0.92-0.99; CoV=0.07-0.11). Bone and spleen lesions exhibited the highest reproducibility (median ICC2 approx 0.95), whereas lymph-node and liver features were more variable. All volume- and tissue-dependent differences remained significant after FDR correction (p&lt;0.05). PVC using RL and RVC markedly enhances FDG-PET radiomic reproducibility in lymphoma, particularly for larger and structurally uniform lesions. Robust features such as First-Order and GLCM can support standardized radiomics workflows and the development of reliable biomarkers for prognosis and personalized therapy. Multicenter validation is warranted to confirm generalizability beyond a single-center setting.</description>

      <title>Patient-Scale Blood Flow Analysis in Artery Stent Implantation via Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A unified Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation framework for coronary stent implantation is developed, which unifies weakly compressible hemodynamics, Neo-Hookean solids, and stent-artery contacts, based on a multi-resolution particle discretization. Prior to application, feasibility and accuracy are established via three baseline validations: (i) poiseuille flow in a two-dimensional channel with prescribed parabolic inflow and a pressure outlet, maintaining parabolic profiles with low Root Mean Squared Error of Prediction (RMSEP); (ii) channel flow initialized with a uniform velocity field and driven by a specified inlet-outlet pressure differential, with agreement to reference profiles quantified by low RMSEP at five reference instants; and (iii) a three-ring impact benchmark in solid mechanics, capturing large deformation, multi-body contact, and self-contact. The validated framework is subsequently applied to a coronary bifurcation with a focal stenosis, where flow-field diagnostics reveal acceleration at the stenotic throat, near-wall low-velocity zones, and co-localization of elevated pressure with increased Von Mises stress at the bifurcation and inlet. Following simulated stent implantation, velocity transitions across the stenosis become smoother, pressure gradients are reduced, and the fractional flow reserve increases from 0.45 to 0.91. These results demonstrate that the proposed SPH framework yields quantitatively reliable, clinically interpretable hemodynamic metrics alongside robust solid-solid contact predictions, thereby supporting rigorous analysis and pre-procedural planning of vascular interventions.</description>

      <title>Augment to Augment: Diverse Augmentations Enable Competitive Ultra-Low-Field MRI Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI promises broader accessibility but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), reduced spatial resolution, and contrasts that deviate from high-field standards. Image-to-image translation can map ULF images to a high-field appearance, yet efficacy is limited by scarce paired training data. Working within the ULF-EnC challenge constraints (50 paired 3D volumes; no external data), we study how task-adapted data augmentations impact a standard deep model for ULF image enhancement. We show that strong, diverse augmentations, including auxiliary tasks on high-field data, substantially improve fidelity. Our submission ranked third by brain-masked SSIM on the public validation leaderboard and fourth by the official score on the final test leaderboard.

      <title>$\beta^+$ radioactive nuclei created during proton therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During proton therapy, the beam flux decreases due to inelastic interactions with nuclei. At the highest energies used in proton therapy around 25\% protons initiate nuclear reactions. This report presents the cross section measurements of proton-induced production of three $\beta^+$ emitters -- $^{11}$C, $^{13}$N, $^{15}$O -- with half-lives between 2 and 20 minutes, using solid C, BN and SiO$_2$ targets. Stacks of up to 15 targets were irradiated simultaneously with proton beams of kinetic energy below 58 MeV at the AIC-144 cyclotron of the Institute of Nuclear Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences. The measured cross sections follow the excitation function obtained in the previous experiments, with uncertainty of a few percent.</description>
