      <title>Isabelle as Systems Platform: Managing Automated and Quasi-interactive Builds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive theorem provers are complex systems that require sophisticated platform efforts - and hence systems programming environments - to manage effectively. The Isabelle platform exemplifies this with its Isabelle/Scala systems programming environment, which has proven to be very successful. In contrast, much of the project infrastructure has relied on external tooling in the past, despite shortcomings. For continuous integration, the previous system employed a Jenkins server, which did not adequately support user-submitted Isabelle builds and faced issues with reliability and performance. In this work, we present our design and implementation of a new Isabelle build manager that replaces the old continuous integration system, fully implemented within Isabelle/Scala. We illustrate how our implementation utilizes different modules of the environment, which supported all aspects of the build manager well.</description>

      <title>Contract-based Design and Verification of Multi-Agent Systems with Quantitative Temporal Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative requirements play an important role in the context of multi-agent systems, where there is often a trade-off between the tasks of individual agents and the constraints that the agents must jointly adhere to. We study multi-agent systems whose requirements are formally specified in the quantitative temporal logic LTL[$\mathcal{F}$] as a combination of local task specifications for the individual agents and a shared safety constraint, The intricate dependencies between the individual agents entailed by their local and shared objectives make the design of multi-agent systems error-prone, and their verification time-consuming. In this paper we address this problem by proposing a novel notion of quantitative assume-guarantee contracts, that enables the compositional design and verification of multi-agent systems with quantitative temporal specifications. The crux of these contracts lies in their ability to capture the coordination between the individual agents to achieve an optimal value of the overall specification under any possible behavior of the external environment. We show that the proposed framework improves the scalability and modularity of formal verification of multi-agent systems against quantitative temporal specifications.</description>

      <title>Checking Continuous Stochastic Logic against Quantum Continuous-Time Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.05412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verifying quantum systems has attracted a lot of interest in the last decades.In this paper, we study the quantitative model-checking of quantum continuous-time Markov chains (quantum CTMCs). The branching-time properties of quantum CTMCs are specified by continuous stochastic logic (CSL), which is well-known for verifying real-time systems, including classical CTMCs. The core of checking the CSL formulas lies in tackling multiphase until formulas. We develop an algebraic method using proper projection, matrix exponentiation, and definite integration to symbolically calculate the probability measures of path formulas. Thus the decidability of CSL is established. To be efficient, numerical methods are incorporated to guarantee that the time complexity is polynomial in the encoding size of the input model and linear in the size of the input formula. A running example of Apollonian networks is further provided to demonstrate our method.</description>

      <title>A Variable Occurrence-Centric Framework for Inconsistency Handling (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a syntactic framework for analyzing and handling inconsistencies in propositional bases. Our approach focuses on examining the relationships between variable occurrences within conflicts. We propose two dual concepts: Minimal Inconsistency Relation (MIR) and Maximal Consistency Relation (MCR). Each MIR is a minimal equivalence relation on variable occurrences that results in inconsistency, while each MCR is a maximal equivalence relation designed to prevent inconsistency. Notably, MIRs capture conflicts overlooked by minimal inconsistent subsets. Using MCRs, we develop a series of non-explosive inference relations. The main strategy involves restoring consistency by modifying the propositional base according to each MCR, followed by employing the classical inference relation to derive conclusions. Additionally, we propose an unusual semantics that assigns truth values to variable occurrences instead of the variables themselves. The associated inference relations are established through Boolean interpretations compatible with the occurrence-based models.</description>
