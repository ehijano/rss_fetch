      <title>The existence of even factors based on the $A_\alpha$-spectral radius of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An even factor of $G$ is a spanning subgraph $F$ such that every vertex in $F$ has a nonzero even degree. Note that $\delta(G)\geq2$ is a trivial necessary condition for a graph to have an even factor, where $\delta(G)$ is the minimum degree of $G$. In this paper, for a connected graph $G$ with minimum degree $\delta$, we establish a lower bound on the $A_\alpha$-spectral radius of $G$ such that $G$ contains an even factor.</description>

      <title>Graphings with few circulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2021, motivated by graph limit theory Lov\'asz extended most of the theory of flows to a measure theoretic setting. Using this framework, the first author constructed $d$-regular treeings that are measurably bipartite, and have no nonzero measurable circulations, that is, flows without sources or sinks. In particular, these treeings do not admit a measurable perfect matching.
  In this paper, we develop tools to build $d$-regular treeings where the space of circulations is exactly $k$-dimensional for any positive integer $k$. As applications, we construct 1) a treeing with a single balanced orientation, but no Schreier decoration; 2) a treeing with a single Schreier decoration; 3) and a treeing with a proper edge $d$-coloring, but no further perfect matchings.
  The first answers a question raised by Lov\'asz, as this particular balanced orientation does not decompose as a linear combination of finite cycles and infinite paths.</description>

      <title>On Matrix Product Factorization of Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study when the adjacency matrix of a Cayley graph factors as the product of two adjacency matrices of Cayley graphs. Let $G$ be a finite group and let $U\subseteq G\setminus \{e\}$ be symmetric. Writing $A(G;U)$ for the adjacency matrix of the Cayley graph of $G$ with respect to $U$, we prove that for symmetric subsets $S,T,U$ of $G\setminus \{e\}$, $A(G;U)=A(G;S)\,A(G;T)$ if and only if $U=ST$ and each $u\in U$ has a unique representation $u=st$, equivalently $\bigl(\sum_{s\in S}s\bigr)\bigl(\sum_{t\in T}t\bigr)=\sum_{u\in U}u$ in the group algebra. When $S,T,U$ are unions of conjugacy classes, this is characterized character-theoretically by $\chi(U)=\chi(S)\chi(T)/\chi(1)$ for all $\chi\in\mathrm{Irr}(G)$. In addition, for abelian groups, we identify $A(G;S)A(G;T)$ with the $0\!-\!1$ convolution $\mathbf{1}_S*\mathbf{1}_T$, so factorability is equivalent to $(S,T)$ being a Sidon pair, i.e., $(S-S)\cap(T-T)=\{0\}$. For cyclic groups, we reformulate factorability via mask polynomials and reduce to prime-power components using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. We also analyze dihedral groups $D_{2n}$, presenting infinite families of factorable generating sets, and give explicit constructions of subsets whose Cayley graphs do and do not admit such factorizations.</description>

      <title>Verifying Hadwiger's Conjecture for Examples of Graphs with $\alpha(G) = 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17114v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadwiger's Conjecture states that every graph with chromatic number $k$ contains a complete graph on $k$ vertices as a minor. This conjecture is a tremendous strengthening of the Four-Colour Theorem and is regarded as one of the most important open problems in graph theory. The case of Hadwiger's Conjecture for graphs with $\alpha(G) = 2$ has garnered much attention. Seymour writes: ``My own belief is, if Hadwiger's Conjecture is true for graphs with stability number two then it is probably true in general, so it would be very nice to decide this case.''
  This paper presents several tools useful for proving that a graph $G$ with $\alpha(G) = 2$ satisfies Hadwiger's Conjecture. In doing so, we survey and generalise several classical results on the $\alpha(G) = 2$ case of Hadwiger's Conjecture. Further, we apply these tools to prove variants of Hadwiger's Conjecture for several noteworthy classes of graphs with $\alpha(G) = 2$. In particular, we prove Hadwiger's Conjecture for inflations of the complements of the following graphs: graphs with girth at least $5$, triangle-free Kneser graphs, and the Clebsch, Mesner, and Gewirtz graphs. This paper also highlights classes of graphs with $\alpha(G) = 2$ where it is unknown if Hadwiger's Conjecture holds.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of multipartite series-reduced trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a generating function for the degree sequences and colors of rooted multipartite labeled series-reduced trees. As an application of this result, we determine the number of symbolic ultrametrics (introduced by B\"ocker and Dress) and increasingly labeled processes. We also find that the number of multipartite labeled series-reduced trees and the colored chain-increasing binary trees are the same. We obtain the number of rooted multipartite unlabeled series-reduced trees. We also find a refinement of the result of Riordan and Shannon.</description>

      <title>An Induced $A$-Path Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and $\mathcal{A}\subseteq V(G)$, a classical theorem of Gallai (1964) states that for every positive integer $k$, the graph $G$ contains $k$ pairwise vertex-disjoint $\mathcal{A}$-paths, or a set $Z\subseteq V(G)$ of size at most $2(k-1)$ such that $G-Z$ contains no $\mathcal{A}$-paths. We generalise Gallai's theorem to the induced setting: We prove that $G$ contains $k$ pairwise anti-complete $\mathcal{A}$-paths, or a set $Z$ of size at most $78(k-1)$ such that, after removing the closed neighbourhood of $Z$, the resulting graph has no $\mathcal{A}$-path. Here, two paths are anti-complete if they are vertex disjoint and there is no edge in $G$ having one endpoint in each of them.
  We further show that the bound $78(k-1)$ on the size of $Z$ can be reduced to $4(k-1)$ if one removes the balls of radius $4$ around the vertices of $Z$ (instead of radius $1$), which is within a factor $2$ of optimal. We also establish analogous results for long induced $\mathcal{A}$-paths.</description>

      <title>Quasiprimitive and bi-quasiprimitive highly-arc-transitive digraphs and finite simple groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the notion of an $H$-normal quotient digraph of an $H$-vertex-transitive digraph to that of an $H$-subnormal quotient digraph. Using these concepts, together with bipartite halves of bipartite digraphs, we show that, for each finite connected $H$-vertex-transitive, $(H,s)$-arc-transitive digraph with $s\geqslant6$, either some $H$-normal quotient is a directed cycle of length at least $3$, or there is an $(L,t)$-arc-transitive digraph with $t\geqslant (s-3)/2$, and $L$ a vertex-quasiprimitive almost simple group with socle a composition factor of $H$. This connection demonstrates that, to understand finite $s$-arc-transitive digraphs with large $s$, those admitting a vertex-quasiprimitive almost simple $s$-arc-transitive subgroup of automorphisms play a central role. We show that for each $s$ and each odd valency $k$, there are infinitely many $(H,s)$-arc-transitive digraphs of valency $k$ with $H$ a finite alternating group.
  In addition we discovered a novel construction which takes as input a connected non-bipartite $H$-vertex-transitive, $(H,s)$-arc-transitive digraph, and outputs a connected bipartite $G$-vertex-transitive, $(G,2s)$-arc-transitive digraph with $G=(H\times H).2$. This leads to construction of vertex-bi-quasiprimitive $s$-arc-transitive digraphs, for arbitrarily large $s$. Our investigations yield several new open problems.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Embedding Constants of Corona Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratic embedding constant (QEC) of a connected graph is defined to be the maximum of the quadratic function associated with its distance matrix on a certain unit sphere of codimension two. In this paper we derive a formula for the QEC of a corona graph $G\odot H$. It is shown that $\mathrm{QEC}(G\odot H)=\psi_{H*}^{-1}(\mathrm{QEC}(G))$ holds under some spectral assumptions on $H$, where $\psi_{H*}^{-1}$ is the inverse function of the most right branch of the analytic function $\psi_H$ defined by means of the main eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of $H$. Moreover, if $H$ is a regular graph of which the adjacency matrix has the smallest eigenvalue $-2$, then the formula is written down explicitly.</description>

      <title>Nowhere-zero flow reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of nowhere-zero flow reconfiguration. The natural question is whether any two nowhere-zero $k$-flows of a given graph $G$ are connected by a sequence of nowhere-zero $k$-flows of $G$, such that any two consecutive flows in the sequence differ only on a cycle of $G$. We conjecture that any two nowhere-zero 5-flows in any 2-edge-connected graph are connected in this way. This can be seen as a reconfiguration variant of Tutte's 5-flow conjecture.
  We study this problem in the setting of integer flows and group flows, and show that the structure of groups affects the answer, contrary to the existence of nowhere-zero flows. We also highlight a duality with recoloring in planar graphs and deduce that any two nowhere-zero 7-flows in a planar graph are connected, among other results. Finally we show that for any graph $G$, there is an abelian group $A$ such that all nowhere-zero $A$-flows in $G$ are connected, which is a weak form of our original conjecture. We conclude with several problems and conjectures.</description>

      <title>Forbidding just one intersection for short integer sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the famous Erd\H{o}s--S\'os forbidden intersection problem for words over alphabet of size $m$: what is the maximal size of a subfamily $\mathcal{F}$ of $[m]^n$ that does not contain two vectors $x, y$ that coincide on exactly $t - 1$ coordinates? We answer this question provided $m \ge poly(t)$, $n \ge poly(t)$ for some polynomial function $poly(\cdot)$ of $t$, greatly extending the recent result of Keevash, Lifshitz, Long and Minzer. Our proof combines some of the recently developed methods in extremal combinatorics, including the spread approximation technique of Kupavskii and Zakharov, and the hypercontractivity approach developed in a series of works of Keevash, Keller, Lifshitz, Long, Marcus and Minzer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove power-saving bounds for the corelation of the M\"obius function with polynomial phases of degree $k$ in function fields $\mathbb{F}_p[t]$, when $p &gt; k$. The proof relies on a new approximation result for phases of biased multilinear forms and the recently established strong bounds for the problem of finding bounded codimension varieties inside the dense ones. Along the way, we also obtain polynomial bounds in the inverse theorem for Gowers uniformity norms in the special case of polynomial phases in finite vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds for Sequence Saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the saturation function $\mathrm{Sat}(n,u)$ for sequences. Saturation for sequences was introduced by Anand, Geneson, Kaustav, and Tsai (2021), who proved that $\mathrm{Sat}(n,u)=O(n)$ for two-letter sequences $u$ and conjectured that this bound holds for all sequences. We present an algorithm that constructs a $u$-saturated sequence on $n$ letters and apply it to show $\mathrm{Sat}(n,u)=O(n)$ for several families of sequences $u$, including all repetitions of the form $abcabc\dots$. We further establish $\mathrm{Sat}(n,u)=O(n)$ for a broad class of sequences of the form $aa\dots bb$. In addition, we prove that for most sequences $u$, there exists an infinite $u$-saturated sequence. For three-letter sequences of the form $abc\dots xyz$, where $a,b,c$ are distinct and $xyz$ is a permutation of $abc$, we show -- under certain structural assumptions on $u$ -- that $\mathrm{Sat}(n,u)=O(n)$. Finally, we describe a linear program that computes the exact value of $\mathrm{Sat}(n,u)$ for arbitrary $n$ and $u$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G = (V, E)$ is called antimagic if there exists a bijective labelling $f : E \rightarrow \{1, 2, \ldots, |E|\}$ such that the vertex-sums of labels over edges incident to a given vertex are all distinct. In this paper, we extend the antimagicness results over graphs with a dominating clique. We also introduce an alternative to the usual definition of antimagic graphs, called C-antimagic, allowing for the labelling to be injective in $\{1, 2, . . . , |E| + C\}$ instead of bijective, and show that almost all graphs with a dominating clique are 3-antimagic.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Bipartite Degree Realizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the \emph{Bipartite Degree Realization} (BDR) problem: given a graphic degree sequence $D$, decide whether it admits a realization as a bipartite graph. While bipartite realizability for a fixed vertex partition can be decided in polynomial time via the Gale--Ryser theorem, the computational complexity of BDR without a prescribed partition remains unresolved. We address this question through a parameterized analysis.
  For constants $0 \le c_1 \le c_2 \le 1$, we define $\mathrm{BDR}_{c_1,c_2}$ as the restriction of BDR to degree sequences of length $n$ whose degrees lie in the interval $[c_1 n, c_2 n]$. Our main result shows that $\mathrm{BDR}_{c_1,c_2}$ is solvable in polynomial time whenever $0 \le c_1 \le c_2 \le \frac{\sqrt{c_1(c_1+4)}-c_1}{2}$, as well as for all $c_1 &gt; \tfrac12$. The proof relies on a reduction to extremal \emph{least balanced degree sequences} and a detailed verification of the critical Gale--Ryser inequalities, combined with a bounded subset-sum formulation.
  We further show that, assuming the NP-completeness of unrestricted BDR, the problem $\mathrm{BDR}_{c_1,c_2}$ remains NP-complete for all $0 &lt; c_2 &lt; \tfrac12$ and $c_1 &lt; 1 - c_2 - \sqrt{1-2c_2}$. Our results clarify the algorithmic landscape of bipartite degree realization and contribute to the broader study of potentially bipartite graphic degree sequences.</description>

Abstract: We give a simple proof of the recent remarkable exponential improvement for Ramsey lower bounds, obtained by Ma, Shen and Xie. Our key ingredient is an alternative construction based on Gaussian random graphs, which allows us to simplify their analysis significantly. As a consequence of this simpler analysis, we also obtain better quantitative bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study orientably-regular maps of Euler characteristic $-2p^2$ and classify those that admit a group of orientation-preserving automorphisms of order $10p^2$, where $p$ is a prime number. Along the way, we classify all compact Riemann surfaces (or complex algebraic curves) of genus $1+p^2$ endowed with a group of conformal automorphisms of order $5p^2$.</description>

      <title>A matrix approach to the enumeration of naturally labeled posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a matrix approach for enumerating naturally labeled posets by representing each poset $P$ on $[n]$ as a Boolean poset matrix $A$. This algebraic representation enables a systematic handling of partial orderings through $v$-extensions of the form $A^v=\bigl[\begin{smallmatrix}A&amp;0\\ v&amp;1\end{smallmatrix}\bigr]$. We show that $A^v$ defines a valid poset matrix if and only if the Boolean vector $v$ represents an order ideal of the poset $P$ associated to $A$, equivalently satisfying the fixed-point equation $vA=v$. Furthermore, we explore the twin-class decomposition of $A$, which partitions the elements of $P$ according to identical down- and up-sets. Finally, we present an algorithmic generation scheme for the posets based on the topological growth of their distribution lattices, offering a new approach to constructive enumeration of poset families.</description>

      <title>A linear upper bound for zero-sum Ramsey numbers of bounded degree graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and $\Gamma$ a finite abelian group. The zero-sum Ramsey number of $G$ over $\Gamma$, denoted by $R(G, \Gamma)$, is the smallest positive integer $t$ (if it exists) such that any edge-colouring $c:E(K_t)\to\Gamma$ contains a copy of $G$ with $\sum_{e\in E(G)}c(e)=0_\Gamma$.
  We prove a linear upper bound $R(G, \Gamma)\leq Cn$ that holds for every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with bounded maximum degree and every finite abelian group $\Gamma$ with $|\Gamma|$ dividing $e(G)$.</description>

      <title>Plane Strong Connectivity Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of strong connectivity augmentation within plane oriented graphs.
  We show that deciding whether a plane oriented graph $D$ can be augmented with (any number of) arcs $X$ such that $D+X$ is strongly connected, but still plane and oriented, is NP-hard.
  This question becomes trivial within plane digraphs, like most connectivity augmentation problems without a budget constraint.
  The budgeted version, Plane Strong Connectivity Augmentation (PSCA) considers a plane oriented graph $D$ along with some integer $k$, and asks for an $X$ of size at most $k$ ensuring that $D+X$ is strongly connected, while remaining plane and oriented.
  Our main result is a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for PSCA, running in time $2^{O(k)} n^{O(1)}$.
  The cornerstone of our procedure is a structural result showing that, for any fixed $k$, each face admits a bounded number of partial solutions "dominating" all others.
  Then, our algorithm for PSCA combines face-wise branching with a Monte-Carlo reduction to the polynomial Minimum Dijoin problem, which we derandomize.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first FPT algorithm for a (hard) connectivity augmentation problem constrained by planarity.</description>

      <title>New Theoretical Insights and Algorithmic Solutions for Reconstructing Score Sequences from Tournament Score Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The score set of a tournament is defined as the set of its distinct out-degrees. In 1978, Reid proposed the conjecture that for any set of nonnegative integers $D$, there exists a tournament $T$ with a degree set $D$. In 1989, Yao presented an arithmetical proof of the conjecture, but a general polynomial-time construction algorithm is not known. This paper proposes a necessary and sufficient condition and a separate necessary condition, based on the existing Landau's theorem for the problem of reconstructing score sequences from score sets of tournament graphs. The necessary condition introduces a structured set that enables the use of group-theoretic techniques, offering not only a framework for solving the reconstruction problem but also a new perspective for approaching similar problems. In particular, the same theoretical approach can be extended to reconstruct valid score sets given constraints on the frequency of distinct scores in tournaments. Based on these conditions, we have developed three algorithms that demonstrate the practical utility of our framework: a polynomial-time algorithm and a scalable algorithm for reconstructing score sequences, and a polynomial-time network-building method that finds all possible score sequences for a given score set. Moreover, the polynomial-time algorithm for reconstructing the score sequence of a tournament for a given score set can be used to verify Reid's conjecture. These algorithms have practical applications in sports analysis, ranking prediction, and machine learning tasks such as learning-to-rank models and data imputation, where the reconstruction of partial rankings or sequences is essential for recommendation systems and anomaly detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical diagram categories and monoids, including the Temperley--Lieb, Brauer, and partition cases, arise as special instances of the category of two dimensional cobordisms and admit additional twists that produce a large new family of diagram categories and monoids. In this paper we introduce this family and develop a unified approach to their representation theory.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture of Baruah and Sarma on sign patterns of certain infinite products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let \[ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}A(n)q^{n} := \frac{(q^{2};q^{5})_{\infty}^{5}(q^{3};q^{5})_{\infty}^{5}}{(q;q^{5})_{\infty}^{5}(q^{4};q^{5})_{\infty}^{5}}, \] \[ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} B(n)q^{n} := \frac{(q;q^{5})_{\infty}^{5} (q^{4};q^{5})_{\infty}^{5}} {(q^{2};q^{5})_{\infty}^{5}(q^{3}; q^{5})_{\infty}^{5}}, \] and \[ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} D(n)q^{n} := \frac{(q^{5};q^{25})_{\infty}(q^{20}; q^{25})_{\infty}} {(q^{10};q^{25})_{\infty}(q^{15}; q^{25})_{\infty}} \frac{(q^{2}; q^{5})_{\infty}^{5}(q^{3};q^{5})_{\infty}^{5}} {(q;q^{5})_{\infty}^{5} (q^{4};q^{5})_{\infty}^{5}} \] where $(a;q)_{\infty} := \prod_{k=0}^{\infty}(1-aq^{k})$ and $|q|&lt;1.$ These sequences are closely related to the celebrated Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction.
  In this paper, we study the sign behavior o of the coefficients $A(n),B(n)$ and $D(n).$ We prove that for all integers $n\geq0,$ \begin{align*} A(5n)&lt;0\quad(n\neq0),\qquad B(5n) &lt; 0\quad(n\neq0),\qquad D(5n+1)&gt;0. \end{align*} This confirms a recent conjecture of Baruah and Sarma. Our proof is different from the previous method of Baruah and Sarma, and combines asymptotic coefficient analysis with symbolic computation for finite case verification.</description>

      <title>An inverse theorem for all finite abelian groups via nilmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a first inverse theorem for Gowers norms on all finite abelian groups that uses only nilmanifolds (rather than possibly more general nilspaces). This makes progress toward confirming the Jamneshan--Tao conjecture. The correlating function in our theorem is a projected nilsequence, obtained as the fiber-wise average of a nilsequence defined on a boundedly-larger abelian group extending the original abelian group. This result is tight in the following sense: we prove also that $k$-step projected nilsequences of bounded complexity are genuine obstructions to having small Gowers $U^{k+1}$-norm. This inverse theorem relies on a new result concerning compact finite-rank (CFR) nilspaces, which is the main contribution in this paper: every $k$-step CFR nilspace is a factor of a $k$-step nilmanifold. This new connection between the classical theory of nilmanifolds and the more recent theory of nilspaces has applications beyond arithmetic combinatorics. We illustrate this with an application in topological dynamics, by proving the following result making progress on a question of Jamneshan, Shalom and Tao: every minimal $\mathbb{Z}^\omega$-system of order $k$ is a factor of an inverse limit of $\mathbb{Z}^\omega$-polynomial orbit systems of order $k$, these being natural generalizations of nilsystems alternative to translational systems.</description>

      <title>Persistent commutative algebra on graphs and hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a persistent commutative algebra for studying the algebraic and combinatorial evolution of edge ideals of graphs and hypergraphs under filtration. Building on the Persistent Stanley--Reisner Theory (PSRT), we develop the notion of persistent edge ideals and analyze their graded Betti numbers across the filtration of graphs or hypergraphs. To enable this analysis, we establish a persistent extension of Hochster's formula, providing a functorial correspondence between algebraic and topological persistence. We further examine the behavior of Betti splittings in the persistent setting, proving a general inequality that extends the classical splitting result to the filtration of monomial ideals. Motivated by graph-theoretic interpretations, we introduce persistent minimal vertex covers, which encode the temporal structure of combinatorial dependencies within evolving graphs or hypergraphs. Applications to alignment-free genomic classification and molecular isomer discrimination demonstrate the interpretability and representatbility of persistent edge ideals as algebraic invariants, bridging combinatorial commutative algebra and data science.</description>

      <title>On exponentially height-penalized random trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$, a $\textit{$\mu$-height-biased tree of size $n$}$ is a random plane tree $\mathbf{\mathbf{T}}_n$ with $n$ vertices with law given by $\mathbb{P}(\mathbf{T}=t) \propto e^{-\mu h(t)}$, where $t$ ranges over fixed plane trees with $n$ vertices, and $h(t)$ is the height of $t$. Fix a sequence $(\mu_n)_{n \ge 1}$ of real numbers, and for $n \ge 1$ let $\mathbf{T}_n$ be a $\mu$-height-biased tree of size $n$. Durhuus and \"Unel (2023) described the asymptotic behaviour of $h(\mathbf{T}_n)$ when $\mu_n \equiv \mu \in \mathbb{R}$ is fixed. In this work, we extend their results to arbitrary sequences of positive parameters depending on $n$. Most notably, we show that such a tree behaves like a height-biased Continuum Random Tree (CRT) when $\mu_n$ is of order $1/\sqrt{n}$; that its height is asymptotically $(2\pi^2n/\mu_n)^{1/3}$ when $\mu_n$ is of larger order than $1/\sqrt{n}$ and of smaller order than $n$; and that its height converges to a fixed constant when $\mu_n$ is of order at least $n$, with some random jumps under specific conditions on $\mu_n$. We additionally prove various results on second order behaviours, and large deviation principles for the height, for different regimes of $\mu_n$. Finally, we describe new statistics of these trees, covering their widths, their root degrees, and the local structure around their roots.</description>

Abstract: This paper completes the classification of maximal unrefinable partitions, extending a previous work of Aragona et al. devoted only to the case of triangular numbers. We show that the number of maximal unrefinable partitions of an integer coincides with the number of suitable partitions into distinct parts, depending on the distance from the successive triangular number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04728v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizing both Dirac's condition and Ore's condition for Hamilton cycles, Chv\'atal in 1972 established a degree sequence condition for the existence of a Hamilton cycle in a graph. Ho\`ang in 1995 generalized Chv\'atal's degree sequence condition for 1-tough graphs and conjectured a $t$-tough analogue for any positive integer $t\ge 1$. Ho\`ang in the same paper verified his conjecture for $t\le 3$ and recently Ho\`ang and Robin verified the conjecture for $t=4$. In this paper, we confirm the conjecture for all $t\ge 4$. The proof depends on two newly established results on cycle structures in tough graphs, which hold independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a distance-regular graph with classical parameters $(D, b, \alpha, \beta)$ satisfying $b\geq 2$ and $D\geq 3$. Let $r=1+b+b^2+\cdots+b^{D-1}$. In 1999, K. Metsch showed that there exists a positive constant $C(\alpha,b)$ only depending on $\alpha$ and $b$, such that if $\beta \geq C(\alpha, b)r^2$, then either $\Gamma$ is a Grassmann graph or a bilinear forms graph.
  In this work, we show that for $b\geq 2$ and $D\geq 3$, then there exists a constant $C_1(\alpha, b)$ only depending on $\alpha$ and $b$, such that if $\beta \geq C_1(\alpha, b)r$, then either $\Gamma$ is a Grassmann graph, or a bilinear forms graph.</description>

      <title>Feedback Arc Sets and Feedback Arc Set Decompositions in Weighted and Unweighted Oriented Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $D=(V(D),A(D))$ be a digraph with at least one directed cycle. A set $F$ of arcs is a feedback arc set (FAS) if $D-F$ has no directed cycle. The FAS decomposition number ${\rm fasd}(D)$ of $D$ is the maximum number of pairwise disjoint FASs whose union is $A(D)$. The directed girth $g(D)$ of $D$ is the minimum length of a directed cycle of $D$. Note that ${\rm fasd}(D)\le g(D).$ The FAS decomposition number appears in the well-known and far-from-solved conjecture of Woodall (1978) stating that for every planar digraph $D$ with at least one directed cycle, ${\rm fasd}(D)=g(D).$ The degree of a vertex of $D$ is the sum of its in-degree and out-degree.
  Let $D$ be an arc-weighted digraph and let ${\rm fas}_w(D)$ denote the minimum weight of its FAS. In this paper, we study bounds on ${\rm fasd}(D)$, ${\rm fas}_w(D)$ and ${\rm fas}(D)$ for arc-weighted oriented graphs $D$ (i.e., digraphs without opposite arcs) with upper-bounded maximum degree $\Delta(D)$ and lower-bounded $g(D)$. Note that these parameters are related: ${\rm fas}_w(D)\le w(D)/{\rm fasd}(D)$, where $w(D)$ is the total weight of $D$, and ${\rm fas}(D)\le |A(D)|/{\rm fasd}(D).$ In particular, we prove the following: (i) If $\Delta(D)\leq~4$ and $g(D)\geq 3$, then ${\rm fasd}(D) \geq 3$ and therefore ${\rm fas}_w(D)\leq \frac{w(D)}{3}$ which generalizes a known tight bound for an unweighted oriented graph with maximum degree at most 4; (ii) If $\Delta(D)\leq 3$ and $g(D)\in \{3,4,5\}$, then ${\rm fasd}(D)=g(D)$; (iii) If $\Delta(D)\leq 3$ and $g(D)\ge 8$ then ${\rm fasd}(D)&lt;g(D).$ We also give some bounds for the cases when $\Delta$ or $g$ are large and state several open problems and a conjecture.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian cycles in tough $(P_4 \cup P_1)$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1973, Chv\'atal conjectured that there exists a constant $t_0$ such that every $t_0$-tough graph on at least three vertices is Hamiltonian. This conjecture has inspired extensive research and has been verified for several special classes of graphs. Notably, Jung in 1978 proved that every 1-tough $P_4$-free graph on at least three vertices is Hamiltonian. However, the problem remains challenging even when restricted to graphs with no induced $P_4\cup P_1$, the disjoint union of a path on four vertices and a one-vertex path. In 2013, Nikoghosyan conjectured that every 1-tough $(P_4\cup P_1)$-free graph on at least three vertices is Hamiltonian. Later in 2015, Broersma remarked that ``this question seems to be very hard to answer, even if we impose a higher toughness." He instead posed the following question: ``Is the general conjecture of Chv\'atal's true for $(P_4\cup P_1)$-free graphs?" We provide a positive answer to Broersma's question by establishing that every $23$-tough $(P_4\cup P_1)$-free graph on at least three vertices is Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04179v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given any two sequences of complex numbers, we establish simple relations between their binomial convolution and the binomial convolution of their individual binomial transforms. We employ these relations to derive new identities involving Fibonacci numbers, Bernoulli numbers, Catalan numbers, harmonic numbers, odd harmonic numbers, Stirling numbers of the second kind, and binomial coefficients. In addition, we present several results which allow the construction of new binomial-transform pairs from existing ones. Many new relations concerning self-inverse sequences are also derived.</description>

      <title>A new conjecture on the inertia of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph with adjacency matrix $A(G)$. We conjecture that \[2n^+(G) \le n^-(G)(n^-(G) + 1),\] where $n^+(G)$ and $n^-(G)$ denote the number of positive and negative eigenvalues of $A(G)$, respectively. This conjecture generalizes to all graphs the well-known absolute bound for strongly regular graphs. The conjecture also relates to a question posed by Torga\v{s}ev. We prove the conjecture for special graph families, including line graphs and planar graphs, and provide examples where the conjecture is exact. We also conjecture that for any connected graph $G$, its line graph $L(G)$ satisfies $n^+(L(G)) \le n^-(L(G)) + 1$, and obtain partial results.</description>

      <title>Ehrhart non-positivity and unimodular triangulations for classes of s-lecture hall simplices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counting lattice points and triangulating polytopes is a prominent subject in discrete geometry, yet proving Ehrhart positivity or existence of unimodular triangulations remain of utmost difficulty in general, even for ``easy'' simplices. We study these questions for classes of s-lecture hall simplices. Inspired by a question of Olsen, we present a new natural class of sequences s for which the s-lecture hall simplices are not Ehrhart positive, by explicitly estimating a negative coefficient. Meanwhile, motivated by a conjecture of Hibi, Olsen and Tsuchiya, we extend the previously known classes of sequences s for which the s-lecture hall simplex admits a flag, regular and unimodular triangulation. The triangulations we construct are explicit.</description>

      <title>Chow polynomials of rank-uniform labeled posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and develop the theory of UMEL-shellable posets. These are posets equipped with an edge-lexicographical labeling satisfying certain uniformity and monotonicity properties. This framework encompasses classical families of combinatorial geometries, including uniform matroids, projective and affine geometries, braid matroids of type A and B, and all Dowling geometries. It also comprises all rank-uniform supersolvable lattices, and therefore also all rank-uniform distributive lattices. Our main result establishes real-rootedness phenomena for the Chow polynomials, the augmented Chow polynomials, and the chain polynomials associated with those posets, thus making simultaneous progress towards conjectures by Ferroni--Schr\"oter, Huh--Stevens, and Athanasiadis--Kalampogia-Evangelinou. In the special case of lattices of flats of matroids, the (augmented) Chow polynomials coincide with the Hilbert--Poincar\'e series of the Chow ring associated to the smooth and generally noncompact toric varieties of the (augmented) Bergman fan of the matroid, whereas the chain polynomial encodes the Hilbert--Poincar\'e series of the Stanley--Reisner ring of the Bergman complex of the matroid. Therefore, these real-rootedness results are tightly linked to the study of these algebro-geometric structures in matroid theory.</description>

      <title>Indecomposability and beyond via the graph of edge dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A polytope is called indecomposable if it cannot be expressed (non-trivially) as a Minkowski sum of other polytopes. Since the concept was introduced by Gale in 1954, several increasingly strong criteria have been developed to characterize indecomposability. Our first contribution is a new indecomposability criterion that unifies and generalizes most of the previous techniques. The key new ingredient of our method is the introduction of the graph of (implicit) edge dependencies, which has broader applications in the study of deformation cones of polytopes, beyond indecomposability. One of our main applications is providing new indecomposable deformed permutahedra that are not matroid polytopes. In 1970, Edmonds posed the problem of characterizing the extreme rays of the submodular cone, that is, indecomposable deformed permutahedra. Matroid polytopes from connected matroids give one such family of polytopes. We provide a new infinite disjoint family by taking certain graphical zonotopes and deeply truncating 1 or 2 specific vertices. In this way, we construct $2 \lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\rfloor$ new indecomposable deformations of the $n$-permutahedron in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We also showcase other applications of our tools. For example, we use them to refute a conjecture by Smilansky (1987) stating that an indecomposable polytope needs to have few vertices with respect to its number of facets. We provide bounds on the dimension of deformation cones and characterize certain of their rays, we introduce parallelogramic Minkowski sums whose deformation cone can be written as a product of deformation cones, and we construct indecomposable polytopes via truncations and stackings.</description>

      <title>On the Codebook Design for NOMA Schemes from Bent Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uplink grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technology for massive connectivity with low latency and high energy efficiency. In code-domain NOMA schemes, the requirements boil down to the design of codebooks that contain a large number of spreading sequences with low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) while maintaining low coherence. When employing binary Golay sequences with guaranteed low PAPR in the design, the fundamental problem is to construct a large set of $n$-variable quadratic bent or near-bent functions in a particular form such that the difference of any two is bent for even $n$ or near-bent for odd $n$ to achieve optimally low coherence. In this work, we propose a theoretical construction of NOMA codebooks by applying a recursive approach to those particular quadratic bent functions in smaller dimensions. The proposed construction yields desired NOMA codebooks that contain $6\cdot N$ Golay sequences of length $N=2^{4m}$ for any positive integer $m$ and have the lowest possible coherence $1/\sqrt{N}$.</description>

      <title>Polarization and Gorenstein liaison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major open question in the theory of Gorenstein liaison is whether or not every arithmetically Cohen--Macaulay subscheme of $\mathbb{P}^n$ can be G-linked to a complete intersection. Migliore and Nagel showed that, if such a scheme is generically Gorenstein (e.g., reduced), then, after re-embedding so that it is viewed as a subscheme of $\mathbb{P}^{n+1}$, indeed it can be G-linked to a complete intersection. Motivated by this result, we consider techniques for constructing G-links on a scheme from G-links on a closely related reduced scheme.
  Polarization is a tool for producing a squarefree monomial ideal from an arbitrary monomial ideal. Basic double G-links on squarefree monomial ideals can be induced from vertex decompositions of their Stanley--Reisner complexes. Given a monomial ideal $I$ and a vertex decomposition of the Stanley--Reisner complex of its polarization $P(I)$, we give conditions that allow for the lifting of an associated basic double G-link of $P(I)$ to a basic double G-link of $I$ itself. We use the relationship we develop in the process to show that the Stanley--Reisner complexes of polarizations of stable Cohen--Macaulay monomial ideals are vertex decomposable.
  We then introduce and study polarization of a Gr\"obner basis of an arbitrary homogeneous ideal and give a relationship between geometric vertex decomposition of a polarization and elementary G-biliaison that is analogous to our result on vertex decomposition and basic double G-linkage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Additive codes may have better parameters than linear codes. However, still very few cases are known and the explicit construction of such codes is a challenging problem. Here we show that a Griesmer type bound for the length of additive codes can always be attained with equality if the minimum distance is sufficiently large. This solves the problem for the optimal parameters of additive codes when the minimum distance is large and yields many infinite series of additive codes that outperform linear codes.</description>

      <title>Multispecies inhomogeneous $t$-PushTASEP from antisymmetric fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the recently introduced inhomogeneous $n$-species $t$-PushTASEP, a long-range stochastic process on a periodic lattice. A Baxter-type formula is established, expressing the Markov matrix as an alternating sum of commuting transfer matrices over all the fundamental representations of $U_t(\widehat{sl}_{n+1})$. This superposition acts as an inclusion-exclusion principle, selectively extracting the sequential particle transitions characteristic of the PushTASEP, while canceling forbidden channels. The homogeneous specialization connects the PushTASEP to ASEP, showing that the two models share eigenstates and a common integrability structure.</description>

      <title>Going deep and going wide: Counting logic and homomorphism indistinguishability over graphs of bounded treedepth and treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the expressive power of first-order logic with counting quantifiers, especially the $k$-variable and quantifier-rank-$q$ fragment $\mathsf{C}^k_q$, using homomorphism indistinguishability. Recently, Dawar, Jakl, and Reggio (2021) proved that two graphs satisfy the same $\mathsf{C}^k_q$-sentences iff they are homomorphism indistinguishable over the class $\mathcal{T}^k_q$ of graphs admitting a $k$-pebble forest cover of depth $q$. After reproving this result using elementary means, we provide a graph-theoretic analysis of $\mathcal{T}^k_q$. This allows us to separate $\mathcal{T}^k_q$ from the intersection $\mathcal{TW}_{k-1} \cap \mathcal{TD}_q$, provided that $q$ is sufficiently larger than $k$. Here $\mathcal{TW}_{k-1}$ is the class of all graphs of treewidth at most $k-1$ and $\mathcal{TD}_q$ is the class of all graphs of treedepth at most $q$.
  We are able to lift this separation to a separation of the respective homomorphism indistinguishability relations $\equiv_{\mathcal{T}^k_q}$ and $\equiv_{\mathcal{TW}_{k-1} \cap \mathcal{TD}_q}$. We do this by showing that the classes $\mathcal{TD}_q$ and $\mathcal{T}^k_q$ are homomorphism distinguishing closed, as conjectured by Roberson (2022).
  In order to prove Roberson's conjecture for $\mathcal{T}^k_q$, we characterise $\mathcal{T}^k_q$ in terms of a monotone Cops-and-Robber game. The crux is to prove that if Cop has a winning strategy then Cop also has a winning strategy that is monotone. To that end, we transform Cops' winning strategy into a pree-tree-decomposition, which is inspired by decompositions of matroids, and then apply an intricate breadth-first cleaning up procedure along the pree-tree-decomposition (which may temporarily lose the property of representing a strategy). Thereby, we achieve monotonicity while controlling the number of rounds across all branches of the decomposition via a vertex exchange argument.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and study several affine (=annular in this paper) versions of the classical diagram algebras such as Temperley-Lieb, partition, Brauer, Motzkin, rook Brauer, rook, planar partition, and planar rook algebras. We give generators and relation presentation for them and their associated categories, study their representation theory, and the asymptotic behavior of tensor products of their representations in the monoid case. Under a mild hypothesis, we also prove a previous conjecture concerning the asymptotic growth of the number of indecomposable summands in the tensor powers of representations for finite monoids.</description>

      <title>Distribution questions for isogeny graphs over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we fix a non-CM elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ and an odd prime $\ell$ and investigate the distribution of invariants associated to the $\ell$-volcano containing the reduction $E_p$, as $p$ ranges over primes of good ordinary reduction. Let $H(p)$ be the height of the volcano and let $d'(p)$ denote the relative position of $j(E_p)$ above the floor, and let $r\ge 0$ be an integer. Assuming that the $\ell$-adic Galois representation attached to $E$ is surjective, we derive an explicit formula for the natural density of primes $p$ for which $H(p)=r$ (resp.\ $d'(p)=r$). In the non-surjective case, we show that all sufficiently large heights occur with positive density. In the second part of the paper, we analyze the distribution of $\ell$-volcano heights over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ and consider the limit as $q\to\infty$. Using analytic estimates for sums of Hurwitz class numbers in arithmetic progressions, we compute exact limiting densities for ordinary elliptic curves whose $\ell$-isogeny graph has a prescribed height $r$.</description>
