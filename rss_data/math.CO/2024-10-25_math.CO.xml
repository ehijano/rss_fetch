      <title>Locally seeded embeddings, and Ramsey numbers of bipartite graphs with sublinear bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A seminal result of Lee asserts that the Ramsey number of any bipartite $d$-degenerate graph $H$ satisfies $\log r(H) = \log n + O(d)$. In particular, this bound applies to every bipartite graph of maximal degree $\Delta$. It remains a compelling challenge to identify conditions that guarantee that an $n$-vertex graph $H$ has Ramsey number linear in $n$, independently of $\Delta$. Our contribution is a characterization of bipartite graphs with linear-size Ramsey numbers in terms of graph bandwidth, a notion of local connectivity. We prove that for any $n$-vertex bipartite graph $H$ with maximal degree at most $\Delta$ and bandwidth $b(H)$ at most $\exp(-C\Delta\log\Delta)\,n$, we have $\log r(H) = \log n + O(1)$. This characterization is nearly optimal: for every $\Delta$ there exists an $n$-vertex bipartite graph $H$ of degree at most $\Delta$ and $b(H) \leq \exp(-c\Delta)\,n$, such that $\log r(H) = \log n + \Omega(\Delta)$. We also provide bounds interpolating between these two bandwidth regimes.</description>

      <title>Exponential odd-distance sets under the Manhattan metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a set of $2^n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that all pairwise Manhattan distances are odd integers, which improves the recent linear lower bound of Golovanov, Kupavskii and Sagdeev. In contrast to the Euclidean and maximum metrics, this shows that the odd-distance set problem behaves very differently to the equilateral set problem under the Manhattan metric. Moreover, all coordinates of the points in our construction are integers or half-integers, and we show that our construction is optimal under this additional restriction.</description>

      <title>On a clique-building game of Erd\H{o}s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The following game was introduced in a list of open problems from 1983 attributed to Erd\H{o}s: two players take turns claiming edges of a $K_n$ until all edges are exhausted. Player 1 wins the game if the largest clique that they claim at the end is strictly larger than the largest clique of their opponent; otherwise, Player 2 wins the game. Erd\H{o}s conjectured that Player 2 always wins this game for $n\geq 3$. We make the first known progress on this problem, proving that this holds for at least $3/4$ of all such $n$. We also address a biased version of this game, as well as the corresponding degree-building game, both of which were originally proposed by Erd\H{o}s as well.</description>

      <title>Every $3$-connected $\{K_{1,3},\Gamma_3\}$-free graph is Hamilton-connected</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every $3$-connected $\{K_{1,3},\Gamma_3\}$-free graph is Hamilton-connected, where $\Gamma_3$ is the graph obtained by joining two vertex-disjoint triangles with a path of length $3$. This resolves one of the two last open cases in the characterization of pairs of connected forbidden subgraphs implying Hamilton-connectedness. The proof is based on a new closure technique, developed in a previous paper, and on a structural analysis of small subgraphs, cycles and paths in line graphs of multigraphs. The most technical steps of the analysis are computer-assisted.

      <title>Fan distributions via Tverberg partitions and Gale duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equipartition theory, beginning with the classical ham sandwich theorem, seeks the fair division of finite point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ by full-dimensional regions determined by a prescribed geometric dissection of $\mathbb{R}^d$. Here we examine \emph{equidistributions} of finite point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ by prescribed \emph{low dimensional} subsets. Our main result states that if $r\geq 3$ is a prime power, then for any $m$-coloring of a sufficiently small point set $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ there exists a certain type of $r$-fan in $\mathbb{R}^d$ -- namely, the union of $r$ ``half-flats'' of codimension $r-2$ centered about a common $(r-1)$-codimensional affine subspace -- which captures all the points of $X$ in such a way that each half-flat contains at most an $r$-th of the points from each color class. The number of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ we require for this is essentially tight when $m\geq 2$, and for typical point sets the \emph{interiors} of the half-flats must share a robust fraction of the points of $X$. We also give analogous equidistribution results for small point sets in $\mathbb{C}^d$ by regular $r$-fans which are centered about a complex hyperplane.
  In the same way that a theorem of Dolnikov on hyperplane piercings generalizes the ham sandwich theorem, our equidistribution results extend to ``piercing distributions'' for families of subsets of $X$ satisfying particular intersection criteria. Our proof method continues recent work of Frick et al., where the Gale transform was shown to link Dolnikov-type hyperplane transversals and Radon-type partitions. Similarly, our results arise as the real and complex Gale duals of linear versions of Tverberg-type theorems. Finally, we extend our distribution results to multiple $r$-fans after establishing a multiple intersection version of a topological Tverberg-type theorem due to Sarkaria.</description>

      <title>Hook-valued tableaux uncrowding and tableau switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refined canonical stable Grothendieck polynomials were introduced by Hwang, Jang, Kim, Song, and Song. There exist two combinatorial models for these polynomials: one using hook-valued tableaux and the other using pairs of a semistandard Young tableau and (what we call) an exquisite tableau. An uncrowding algorithm on hook-valued tableaux was introduced by Pan, Pappe, Poh, and Schilling. In this paper, we discover a novel connection between the two models via the uncrowding and Goulden--Greene's jeu de taquin algorithms, using a classical result of Benkart, Sottile, and Stroomer on tableau switching. This connection reveals a hidden symmetry of the uncrowding algorithm defined on hook-valued tableaux. As a corollary, we obtain another combinatorial model for the refined canonical stable Grothendieck polynomials in terms of biflagged tableaux, which naturally appear in the characterization of the image of the uncrowding map.</description>

      <title>Growth of recurrences with mixed multifold convolutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing some popular sequences like Catalan's number, Schr\"oder's number, etc, we consider the sequence $s_n$ with $s_0=1$ and for $n\ge 1$, \begin{multline*}
  s_n=\sum_{x_1+\dots+x_{\ell_1}=n-1} \kappa_1 s_{x_1}\dots s_{x_{\ell_1}} + \dots +\sum_{x_1+\dots+x_{\ell_{t'}}=n-1} \kappa_{t'} s_{x_1}\dots s_{x_{\ell_{t'}}}+\\ \max_{x_1+\dots+x_{\ell_{t'+1}}=n-1} \kappa_{t'+1} s_{x_1}\dots s_{x_{\ell_{t'+1}}} + \dots + \max_{x_1+\dots+x_{\ell_t}=n-1} \kappa_t s_{x_1}\dots s_{x_{\ell_t}}, \end{multline*} where $x_i$ are nonnegative integers, $\ell_1,\dots,\ell_t$ are positive integers, and $\kappa_1,\dots,\kappa_t$ are positive reals. We show that it is possible to compute the growth rate $\lambda$ of $s_n$ to any precision. In particular, for every $n\ge 2$,
  \[
  \sqrt[n]{\frac{\kappa^*}{\mathcal L(n-1) s_1} s_n} \le \lambda \le \sqrt[n]{3^{18\log 3 + 2\log\frac{s_1\mathcal L^2}{\kappa^*}} n^{3\log n + 12\log 3 + \log\frac{s_1\mathcal L^2}{\kappa^*}} s_n},
  \]where $\mathcal L=\max_i \ell_i$ and $\kappa^*=\kappa_i$ for some $i$ with $\ell_i\ge 2$, and the logarithm has the base $\frac{\mathcal L+1}{\mathcal L}$. The constants in the inequalities are not very well optimized and serve mostly as a proof of concept with the ratio of the upper bound and the lower bound converging to $1$ as $n$ goes to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, we study the $2$-edge-connected subgraph polytope $\mathrm{TECSP}(G)$, which is given by the convex hull of the incidence vectors of all $2$-edge-connected subgraphs of $G$. We describe the lattice points of this polytope by linear inequalities which provides an ILP-algorithm for finding a $2$-edge-connected subgraph of maximum weight. Furthermore, we characterize when these inequalities define facets of $\mathrm{TECSP}(G)$. We also consider further types of supporting hyperplanes of $\mathrm{TECSP}(G)$ and study when they are facet-defining. Finally, we investigate the efficiency of our considered inequalities practically on some classes of graphs.</description>

      <title>Counting sparse induced sugraphs in locally dense graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $n$-vertex graph $G$ is locally dense if every induced subgraph of size larger than $\zeta n$ has density at least $d &gt; 0$, for some parameters $\zeta, d &gt; 0$. We show that the number of induced subgraphs of $G$ with $m$ vertices and maximum degree significantly smaller than $dm$ is roughly $\binom{\zeta n}{m}$, for $m \ll \zeta n$ which is not too small. This generalises a result of Kohayakawa, Lee, R\"odl, and Samotij on the number of independent sets in locally dense graphs.
  As an application, we slightly improve a result of Balogh, Chen, and Luo on the generalised Erd\H{o}s-Rogers function for graphs with small extremal number. As a special case, for any tree $T$ we show that a largest $T$-free induced subgraph one can guarantee to find in any $K_4$-free graph with $n$ vertices is of size $O(n^{1/3} (\log n)^{4/3})$. This matches the upper bound on the size of a largest independent set, obtained by Mattheus and Verstraete.</description>

      <title>The diameter of random spanning trees interpolating between the UST and the MST of the complete graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce $\mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(K_n)$ as the weighted spanning tree of the complete graph $K_n$ w.r.t. the random electric network of conductances $\{\exp(-\beta_nU_{e})\}_{e\in E(K_n)}$ with $\mathrm{Unif}[0,1]$ i.i.d. $U_e$'s.
  Moving from $\beta_n\equiv 0$ to faster and faster growing $\beta_n$'s, the model interpolates between the \emph{uniform} and the \emph{minimum} spanning trees: $\mathsf{WST}^0(K_n)=\mathsf{UST}(K_n)$, and there are phase transitions for $\mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(K_n)$ behaving more and more like $\mathsf{MST}(K_n)$:
  - around $\beta_n=n^{3+o(1)}$ regarding the agreement of the two standard algorithms generating these models : Aldous-Broder and Prim's invasion algorithms,
  - around $\beta_n=n^{2+o(1)}$ regarding the models consisting of exactly the same edges, and
  - around $\beta_n=n^{1+o(1)}$ regarding the expected total length $\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{e\in \mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(K_n)}U_e\right]$.
  But most importantly, we study the global geometry of the model: we prove that the typical diameter of $\mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(K_n)$ grows like $\Theta(n^{1/3})$ for $\beta_n\ge n^{4/3+o(1)}$ likewise the $\mathsf{MST}(K_n)$ case, and it grows like $\Theta(n^{1/2})$ for $\beta_n\le n^{1+o(1)}$ similarly to the $\mathsf{UST}(K_n)$ case. For $\beta_n=n^{\alpha}$ with $1&lt;\alpha&lt;4/3$, the behavior of the typical diameter is a more delicate open question, but we conjecture that its exponent strictly between 1/2 and 1/3.</description>

      <title>On maximal almost balanced non-overlapping codes and non-overlapping codes with restricted run-lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns non-overlapping codes, block codes motivated by synchronisation and DNA-based storage applications. Most existing constructions of these codes do not account for the restrictions posed by the physical properties of communication channels. If undesired sequences are not avoided, the system using the encoding may start behaving incorrectly. Hence, we aim to characterise all non-overlapping codes satisfying two additional constraints. For the first constraint, where approximately half of the letters in each word are positive, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the code's non-expandability and improve known bounds on its maximum size. We also determine exact values for the maximum sizes of polarity-balanced non-overlapping codes having small block and alphabet sizes. For the other constraint, where long sequences of consecutive equal symbols lead to undesired behaviour, we derive bounds and constructions of constrained non-overlapping codes. Moreover, we provide constructions of non-overlapping codes that satisfy both constraints and analyse the sizes of the obtained codes.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Normality and Concentration Inequalities of Statistics of Core Partitions with Bounded Perimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core partitions have attracted much attention since Anderson's work (2002) on the number of $(s,t)$-core partitions for coprime $s,t$. Recently there has been interest in studying the limit distribution of the sizes of random simultaneous core partitions. In this paper, we prove the asymptotic normality of certain statistics of random core partitions with bounded perimeters under the uniform measure, in the Kolmogorov and Wasserstein-$1$ distances, including the length and size of a random (strict) $n$-core partition, the size of the Durfee square and the size of a random self-conjugate $n$-core partition. Accordingly, we prove that these statistics are subgaussian. This behavior contrasts with that of the size of a random $(s, t)$-core partition for coprime $s,t$ studied in Even-Zohar (2022), which converges in law to Watson's $U^2$-distribution. Our results show that the distribution of the size of a random strict $(n, dn+1)$-core partition is asymptotically normal when $d \ge 3$ is fixed and $n$ tends to infinity, which is an analog of Zaleski's conjecture (2017) and covers Koml\'{o}s-Sergel-Tusn\'{a}dy's result (2020) as a special case. Our proof applies several tools including Stein's method based on Hoeffding decomposition, Hoeffding's combinatorial central limit theorem, Efron-Stein inequalities on product spaces and slices, and asymptotics of P\'{o}lya frequency sequences. We believe our approach can be generalized to establish the asymptotic normality of functionals of random variables with certain global dependence structure that can be decomposed into appropriate mixture forms.</description>

      <title>On dynamical $C^{\star}$-set and its combinatorial consequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the methods from topological dynamics, H. Furstenberg introduced the notion of a central set and proved the famous Central Sets Theorem. Later D. De, Neil Hindman, and D. Strauss [Fund. Math.199 (2008), 155-175.] established a stronger version of the Central Sets Theorem and then introduced the notion of $C$-sets satisfying the Central Sets Theorem and studied the properties of these sets. For any weak mixing system $\left(X, \mathcal{B},\mu, T\right),$ and $A_{0},A_{1}\in\mathcal{B}$, with $\mu\left(A_{0}\right)\mu\left(A_{1}\right)&gt;0$, R. Kung and X.Ye [Disc. Cont. Dyn. sys., 18 (2007) 817-827.] proved that the set $N\left(A,B\right)= \left\{n:\mu\left(A_{0}\cap T^{-n}A_{1}\right)&gt;0\right\}$ intersects all sets of positive upper Banach density. However, later N. Hindman and D. Strauss [New York J. Math. 26 (2020) 230-260.] proved that there exist $C$-sets having zero upper Banach density. Inspired by this result, in this article, we prove that $N\left(A, B \right)$ intersects with all $C$-sets. Then we introduce the notion of a dynamical $C^{\star}$-set and then we study their combinatorial properties.</description>

Abstract: We develop a method initiated by Bacher and Venkov, and based on a study of the Kneser neighbors of the standard lattice Z^n, which allows to classify the integral unimodular Euclidean lattices of rank n. As an application, of computational flavour, we determine the isometry classes of unimodular lattices of rank 26 and 27.</description>

      <title>Braid groups of J-reflection groups and associated classical and dual Garside structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The family of $J$-reflection groups can be seen as a combinatorial generalisation of irreducible rank two complex reflection groups and was introduced by the author in a previous article. In this article, we define the braid groups associated to $J$-reflection groups, which coincide with the complex braid group when the $J$-reflection group is finite. We show that the isomorphism type of the braid groups only depend on the reflection isomorphism types of the corresponding $J$-reflection groups. Moreover, we show that these braid groups are always abstractly isomorphic to circular groups. At the same time, we show that the center of the braid groups is cyclic and sent onto the center of the corresponding $J$-reflection groups under the natural quotient. Finally, we exhibit two Garside structures for each braid group of $J$-reflection group. These structures generalise the classical and dual Garside structures (when defined) of rank two irreducible complex reflection groups. In particular, the dual Garside structure of $J$-reflection groups provides candidates for dual monoids associated to the irreducible complex reflection groups of rank two which do not already have one.</description>

      <title>On some building blocks of hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09764v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the interrelation between hypergraph symmetries represented by equivalence relations on the vertex set and the spectra of operators associated with the hypergraph. We introduce the idea of equivalence relation compatible operators related to hypergraphs. Some eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors can be computed directly from the equivalence classes of the equivalence relation. The other eigenvalues can be computed from a quotient operator obtained by identifying each equivalence class as an element. We provide an equivalence relation $\mathfrak{R}_s$ on the vertex set of a hypergraph such that the Adjacency, Laplacian, and signless Laplacian operators associated with that hypergraph become $\mathfrak{R}_s$-compatible. The $\mathfrak{R}_s$-equivalence classes are named as units. Using units, we find some more symmetric substructures of hypergraphs called twin units, regular sets, co-regular sets, and symmetric sets. We collectively classify them as building blocks of hypergraphs. We show that the presence of these building blocks leaves certain traces in the spectrum and the corresponding eigenspaces of the $\mathfrak{R}_s$-compatible operators associated with the hypergraph. We also show that, conversely, some specific footprints in the spectrum and the corresponding eigenvectors retrace the presence of some of these building blocks in the hypergraph. Besides the spectra of $\mathfrak{R}_s$-compatible operators, building blocks are also interrelated with hypergraph colouring, distances in hypergraphs, hypergraph automorphisms, and random walks on hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Perfect colorings of hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perfect colorings (equitable partitions) of graphs are extensively studied, while the same concept for hypergraphs attracts much less attention. The aim of this paper is to develop basic notions and properties of perfect colorings for hypergraphs. Firstly, we introduce a multidimensional matrix equation for perfect colorings of hypergraphs and compare this definition with a standard approach based on the incidence graph. Next, we show that the eigenvalues of the parameter matrix of a perfect coloring are eigenvalues of the multidimensional adjacency matrix of a hypergraph. We consider coverings of hypergraphs as a special case of perfect colorings and prove a theorem on the existence of a common covering of two hypergraphs. As an example, we show that a $k$-transversal in a hypergraph corresponds to a perfect coloring and calculate its parameters. At last, we find all perfect $2$-colorings of the Fano's plane hypergraph and compute some eigenvalues of this hypergraph.</description>

      <title>Maker-Breaker Strong Resolving Game</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph with vertex set $V$. A set $S \subseteq V$ is a \emph{strong resolving set} of $G$ if, for distinct $x,y\in V$, there exists $z\in S$ such that either $x$ lies on a $y-z$ geodesic or $y$ lies on an $x-z$ geodesic in $G$. In this paper, we study maker-breaker strong resolving game (MBSRG) played on a graph by two players, Maker and Breaker, where the two players alternately select a vertex of $G$ not yet chosen. Maker wins if he is able to choose vertices that form a strong resolving set of $G$ and Breaker wins if she is able to prevent Maker from winning in the course of MBSRG. We denote by $O_{\rm SR}(G)$ the outcome of MBSRG played on $G$. We obtain some general results on MBSRG and examine the relation between $O_{\rm SR}(G)$ and $O_{\rm R}(G)$, where $O_{\rm R}(G)$ denotes the outcome of the maker-breaker resolving game of $G$. We determine the outcome of MBSRG played on some graph classes, including corona product graphs, Cartesian product graphs, and modular product graphs.</description>

Abstract: We describe a genetic algorithm to find candidates for $h^*$-vectors satisfying given properties in the space of integers vectors of finite length. We use an implementation of such algorithm to find a 52-dimensional lattice polytope having a non-unimodal $h^*$-vector which is the Cartesian product of two lattice polytopes having unimodal $h^*$-vectors. This counterexample answers negatively to a question by Ferroni and Higashitani.</description>

Abstract: We give a framework for growth models on posets which simultaneously generalizes the Classical Sequential Growth models for posets from causal set theory and the tree growth models of natural growth and simple tree classes, the latter of which also appear as solutions of combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations in quantum field theory. We prove which cases of the Classical Sequential Growth models give subHopf algebras of the Hopf algebra of posets, in analogy to a characterization due to Foissy in the Dyson-Schwinger case. We find a family of generating sets for the Connes-Moscovici Hopf algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00265v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A three-path-configuration is a graph consisting of three pairwise internally-disjoint paths the union of every two of which is an induced cycle of length at least four. A graph is 3PC-free if no induced subgraph of it is a three-path-configuration. We prove that 3PC-free graphs have poly-logarithmic tree-independence number. More explicitly, we show that there exists a constant $c$ such that every $n$-vertex 3PC-free graph graph has a tree decomposition in which every bag has stability number at most $c (\log n)^2$. This implies that the Maximum Weight Independent Set problem, as well as several other natural algorithmic problems, that are known to be NP-hard in general, can be solved in quasi-polynomial time if the input graph is 3PC-free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The degree-diameter problem for graphs is to find the largest number of vertices a graph can have given its diameter and maximum degree. We show we can realize this problem in terms of quasigroups, 1-factors and permutation groups. Our investigation originated from the study of graphs as the Cayley graphs of groupoids with d generators, a left identity and right cancellation; that is, a right quasigroup. This enables us to provide compact algebraic definitions for some important graphs that are either given as explicit edge lists or as the Cayley coset graphs of groups larger than the graph. One such example is a single expression for the Hoffman-Singleton graph. From there, we notice that the groupoids can be represented uniquely by a set of disjoint permutations and we explore the consequences of that observation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate normal trees of directed graphs, which extend the fundamental concept of normal trees of undirected graphs and form a special case of normal trees of connectoids.
  We show that a directed graph $D$ has a normal spanning tree if and only if the topological space $|D|$ is metrizable. This generalises Diestel's result for undirected graphs.
  We further show that the existence of normal arborescences implies the existence of normal trees in directed graphs and the converse does not hold true in general. Furthermore, we discuss properties of normal trees that carry over from connectoids to directed graphs.</description>

      <title>Hall-Littlewood polynomials, affine Schubert series, and lattice enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce multivariate rational generating series called Hall-Littlewood-Schubert ($\mathsf{HLS}_n$) series. They are defined in terms of polynomials related to Hall-Littlewood polynomials and semistandard Young tableaux. We show that $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series provide solutions to a range of enumeration problems upon judicious substitutions of their variables. These include the problem to enumerate sublattices of a $p$-adic lattice according to the elementary divisor types of their intersections with the members of a complete flag of reference in the ambient lattice. This is an affine analog of the stratification of Grassmannians by Schubert varieties. Other substitutions of $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series yield new formulae for Hecke series and $p$-adic integrals associated with symplectic $p$-adic groups, and combinatorially defined quiver representation zeta functions. $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series are $q$-analogs of Hilbert series of Stanley-Reisner rings associated with posets arising from parabolic quotients of Coxeter groups of type $\mathsf{B}$ with the Bruhat order. Special values of coarsened $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series yield analogs of the classical Littlewood identity for the generating functions of Schur polynomials.</description>

      <title>On the $r$-th Power Energy of Connected Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the $r$-th power energy, also known as $r$-Schatten energy, of connected graphs. We focus on addressing a question posed by Nikiforov regarding whether the $r$-th power energy of a connected graph is greater than or equal to that of the star graph $ S_n $ for $ 1 &lt; r &lt; 2 $. Our main result confirms that, for any connected graph $ G $ of order $ n $, $ \mathcal{E}_r(G) \geq \mathcal{E}_r(S_n) $ for $ 0 &lt; r &lt; 2 $, with equality if and only if $ G $ is the star graph $ S_n $. We derive a Coulson-Jacobs-type formula for the $r$-th power energy of connected graphs and obtain sharper upper bounds for the $r$-th power energy when $ r &gt; 2 $. These results improve previous bounds given by Nikiforov and extend the understanding of graph energies, especially in the range $ 0 &lt; r &lt; 2 $.</description>

      <title>Comparing Three Generations of D-Wave Quantum Annealers for Minor Embedded Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03009v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a novel type of analog computation that aims to use quantum mechanical fluctuations to search for optimal solutions of Ising problems. Quantum annealing in the Transverse Ising model, implemented on D-Wave QPUs, are available as cloud computing resources. In this article we report concise benchmarks across three generations of D-Wave quantum annealers, consisting of four different devices, for the NP-Hard combinatorial optimization problems unweighted maximum clique and unweighted maximum cut on random graphs. The Ising, or equivalently QUBO, formulation of these problems do not require auxiliary variables for order reduction, and their overall structure and weights are not highly complex, which makes these problems simple test cases to understand the sampling capability of current D-Wave quantum annealers. All-to-all minor embeddings of size $52$, with relatively uniform chain lengths, are used for a direct comparison across the Chimera, Pegasus, and Zephyr device topologies. A grid search over annealing times and the minor embedding chain strengths is performed in order to determine the level of reasonable performance for each device and problem type. Experiment metrics that are reported are approximation ratios for non-broken chain samples and chain break proportions. How fairly the quantum annealers sample optimal maximum cliques, for instances which contain multiple maximum cliques, is also quantified using entropy of the measured ground state distributions. The newest generation of quantum annealing hardware, which has a Zephyr hardware connectivity, performed the best overall with respect to approximation ratios and chain break frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a direct combinatorial proof of a Feynman graph identity which implies a wide generalization of a formality theorem by Kontsevich. For a Feynman graph $\Gamma$, we associate to each vertex a position $x_v \in \mathbb R$ and to each edge $e$ the combination $s_e = a_e^{-\frac 12} \left( x^+_e - x^-_e \right)$, where $x^\pm_e$ are the positions of the two end vertices of $e$, and $a_e$ is a Schwinger parameter. The "topological propagator" $P_e = e^{-s_e^2}\text d s_e$ includes a part proportional to $\text d x_v$ and a part proportional to $\text d a_e$. Integrating the product of all $P_e$ over positions produces a differential form $\alpha_\Gamma$ in the variables $a_e$. We derive an explicit combinatorial formula for $\alpha_\Gamma$, and we prove that $\alpha_\Gamma \wedge \alpha_\Gamma=0$.</description>

      <title>Intersecting families of polynomials over finite fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes an analog of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem to polynomial rings over finite fields, affirmatively answering a conjecture of C. Tompkins.
  A $k$-uniform family of subsets of a set of finite size $n$ is $l$-intersecting if any two subsets in the family intersect in at least $l$ elements. The study of such intersecting families is a core subject of extremal set theory, tracing its roots to the seminal 1961 Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem, which establishes a sharp upper bound on the size of these families.
  As an analog of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem, we determine the largest possible size of a family of monic polynomials, each of degree $n$, over a finite field $F_q$, where every pair of polynomials in the family shares a common factor of degree at least $l$. We establish that the upper bound for this size is $q^{n-l}$ and characterize all extremal families that achieve this maximum size.
  Further extending our study to triple-intersecting families, where every triplet of polynomials shares a common factor of degree at least $l$, we prove that only trivial families achieve the corresponding upper bound. Moreover, by relaxing the conditions to include polynomials of degree at most $n$, we affirm that only trivial families achieve the corresponding upper bound.</description>
