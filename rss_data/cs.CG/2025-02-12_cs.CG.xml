      <title>VLWE: Variety-based Learning with Errors for Vector Encryption through Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice-based cryptography is a foundation for post-quantum security, with the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem as a core component in key exchange, encryption, and homomorphic computation. Structured variants like Ring-LWE (RLWE) and Module-LWE (MLWE) improve efficiency using polynomial rings but remain constrained by traditional polynomial multiplication rules, limiting their ability to handle structured vectorized data. This work introduces Variety-LWE (VLWE), a new structured lattice problem based on algebraic geometry. Unlike RLWE and MLWE, which use polynomial quotient rings with standard multiplication, VLWE operates over multivariate polynomial rings defined by algebraic varieties. A key difference is that these polynomials lack mixed variables, and multiplication is coordinate-wise rather than following standard polynomial multiplication. This enables direct encoding and homomorphic processing of high-dimensional data while preserving worst-case to average-case hardness reductions. We prove VLWE's security by reducing it to multiple independent Ideal-SVP instances, demonstrating resilience against classical and quantum attacks. Additionally, we analyze hybrid algebraic-lattice attacks, showing that existing Grobner basis and lattice reduction methods do not directly threaten VLWE. We further construct a vector homomorphic encryption scheme based on VLWE, supporting structured computations while controlling noise growth. This scheme offers advantages in privacy-preserving machine learning, encrypted search, and secure computations over structured data. VLWE emerges as a novel and independent paradigm in lattice-based cryptography, leveraging algebraic geometry to enable new cryptographic capabilities beyond traditional polynomial quotient rings.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sparsification of Simplicial Complexes via Local Densities of States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simplicial complexes (SCs), a generalization of graph models for relational data that account for higher-order relations between data items, have become a popular abstraction for analyzing complex data using tools from topological data analysis or topological signal processing. However, the analysis of many real-world datasets leads to dense SCs with a large number of higher-order interactions. Unfortunately, analyzing such large SCs often has a prohibitive cost in terms of computation time and memory consumption. The sparsification of such complexes, i.e., the approximation of an original SC with a sparser simplicial complex with only a log-linear number of high-order simplices while maintaining a spectrum close to the original SC, is of broad interest.
  In this work, we develop a novel method for a probabilistic sparsifaction of SCs. At its core lies the efficient computation of sparsifying sampling probability through local densities of states as functional descriptors of the spectral information. To avoid pathological structures in the spectrum of the corresponding Hodge Laplacian operators, we suggest a "kernel-ignoring" decomposition for approximating the sampling probability; additionally, we exploit error estimates to show asymptotically prevailing algorithmic complexity of the developed method. The performance of the framework is demonstrated on the family of Vietoris--Rips filtered simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Multiview Point Cloud Registration Based on Minimum Potential Energy for Free-Form Blade Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point cloud registration is an essential step for free-form blade reconstruction in industrial measurement. Nonetheless, measuring defects of the 3D acquisition system unavoidably result in noisy and incomplete point cloud data, which renders efficient and accurate registration challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel global registration method that is based on the minimum potential energy (MPE) method to address these problems. The basic strategy is that the objective function is defined as the minimum potential energy optimization function of the physical registration system. The function distributes more weight to the majority of inlier points and less weight to the noise and outliers, which essentially reduces the influence of perturbations in the mathematical formulation. We decompose the solution into a globally optimal approximation procedure and a fine registration process with the trimmed iterative closest point algorithm to boost convergence. The approximation procedure consists of two main steps. First, according to the construction of the force traction operator, we can simply compute the position of the potential energy minimum. Second, to find the MPE point, we propose a new theory that employs two flags to observe the status of the registration procedure. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm on four types of blades. The proposed method outperforms the other global methods in terms of both accuracy and noise resistance.</description>
