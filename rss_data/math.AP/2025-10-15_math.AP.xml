      <title>The local regularity theory for the Stokes and Navier--Stokes equations near the curved boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study local regularity of the solutions to the Stokes equations near a curved boundary under no-slip or Navier boundary conditions. We extend previous boundary estimates near a flat boundary to that near a curved boundary, under very low starting regularity assumptions. Compared with the flat case, the proof for the curved case is more complicated and we adapt new techniques such as the ``normal form" after the mollification with even-even-odd extension, recovering vertical derivative estimates from horizontal derivative estimates, and transferring temporal derivatives to spatial derivatives, to deal with the higher order perturbation terms generated by boundary straightening. As an application, we propose a new definition of boundary regular points for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations that guarantees higher spatial regularity.</description>

      <title>Enhanced dissipation and Taylor dispersion by a parallel shear flow in an infinite cylinder with unbounded cross section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the long-time behavior of a passive scalar advected by a parallel shear flow in an infinite cylinder with unbounded cross section, in the regime where the viscosity coefficient satisfies $\nu \ll 1$, and in arbitrary spatial dimension. Under the assumption of an infinite cylinder, that is, $x \in \mathbb{R}$, the corresponding Fourier frequency $k$ (often referred to as the streamwise wave number) also ranges over the whole real line $\mathbb{R}$. In this setting, the enhanced dissipation phenomenon only occurs for high frequencies $\nu \le |k|$, whereas for low frequencies $|k| \le \nu$ only the decay of Taylor dispersion appears. It is worth noting that, in the case where $x \in \mathbb{T}$, the Fourier frequency does not contain low frequencies near zero, and thus enhanced dissipation occurs for all nonzero modes. Previously, Coti Zelati and Gallay study in [8] the case of infinite cylinders with bounded cross sections. For the unbounded case considered here, we find that a non-degeneracy condition at infinity is also required.</description>

      <title>The local well-posedness, blow-up phenomena and ill-posedness of a new fifth-order Camassa-Holm type equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a new fifth-order Camassa-Holm type equation derived by Li \cite{Li.Z}. We firstly establish the local well-posedness in the sense of Hadamard for the Cauchy problem of the new fifth-order Camassa-Holm type equation in Besov spaces. Secondly, we obtain blow-up criteria. Building upon this, by utilizing the conservation laws and establishing local boundedness, we derive a blow-up result that precisely determines the blow-up time. Finally, the ill-posedness of the new fifth-order Camassa-Holm type equation in the critical Sobolev space $H^{\frac{1}{2}}$ is established via a norm inflation argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the fifth order Camassa-Holm model. Firstly, we improve the local well-posedness results in \cite{TangLiu2015,FOCH2021}. Secondly, we give the blow up criteria and conditions for global existence. Finally, when $b=\frac 53$ in the model, we obtain the ill-posedness in $B^1_{\infty,1}$ and $B^{\frac 32}_{2,q}$ with $q\in(1,+\infty]$ in the sense of norm inflation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of the Kolmogorov flow at high Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the asymptotic stability of the Kolmogorov flow on a non-square torus for perturbations $\omega_0$ satisfying $\|\omega_0\|_{H^3}\ll\nu^{1/3}$, where $0&lt;\nu\ll1$ is the viscosity. Kolmogorov flows are important metastable states to the two dimensional incompressible Navier Stokes equations in the high Reynolds number regime. Our result shows that the perturbed solution will rapidly converge to a shear flow close to the Kolmogorov flow, before settling down to the Kolmogorov flow and slowly decaying to $0$ as $t\to\infty$. In fact, our analysis reveals several interesting time scales and rich dynamical behavior of the perturbation in the transition period $0&lt;t\leq 1/\nu$.
  The threshold $\nu^{1/3}$, which is the same as that for the Couette flow, is quite surprising since one of the key stability mechanisms, enhanced dissipation, becomes considerably weaker in the case of Kolmogorov flows due to the presence of critical points. To overcome this essential new difficulty, we establish sharp vorticity depletion estimates near the critical points to obtain improved decay rates for the vorticity and velocity fields that are comparable with those for Couette flows, at least for our purposes. We then combine these estimates (enhanced dissipation, inviscid damping and vorticity depletion) with a quasilinear approximation scheme and a multiple-timescale analysis naturally adapted to the dynamics of the perturbation, to obtain the $\nu^{1/3}$ threshold for dynamic stability of Kolmogorov flows. The threshold is expected to be sharp when the perturbation is considered in Sobolev spaces. This appears to be the first result that applies vorticity depletion estimates to improve thresholds for nonlinear asymptotic stability in incompressible fluid equations.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many solutions for the prescribed scalar curvature problem with volcano-like curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following prescribed scalar curvature problem:
  \begin{equation*}
  -\Delta u = K(x) u^{\frac{n+2}{n-2}}, \quad u&gt;0\quad\hbox{in}\quad \mathbb{R}^n, \quad
  u \in D^{1,2}(\mathbb{R}^n),
  \end{equation*}
  where $K(x)$ is a volcano-like positive function such that
  $$ K(x)= K(r_0)- c_0 | |x|- r_0|^m + O( | |x|- r_0|^{m+\theta}),\quad r_0- \delta &lt;|x| &lt;r_0+\delta$$
  with $K(r_0), c_0, \delta&gt;0, \theta &gt;2, \min \{\frac{n-2}{2}, 2\} &lt; m&lt; n-2$.
  We first prove the existence of infinitely many positive solutions. A consequence of our proof yields that the infinitely many solutions constructed in \cite{WY} are non-degenerate in the whole $D^{1, 2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ space. To our knowledge, it seems to be the first result of infinitely many solutions of prescribed scalar curvature problem when the potential function $K(x)$ is not radial. Our non-degeneracy results are also more complete and improve the result in \cite{GMPS}.</description>

      <title>Non variational type critical growth nonlocal system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the existence, uniqueness, and multiplicity of positive solutions for a system of fractional differential equations given by: \begin{equation*} (-\Delta)^{s_i} u_{i}+\lambda_{i} u_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{n} \alpha_{i j}\left|u_{j}\right|^{q_{i j}}\left|u_{i}\right|^{p_{i j}-2} u_{i} , u_i\in {\mathscr{D}^{s_i,2}\left(\mathbb{R}^{N}\right)}, i=1,2,\cdots,n, \end{equation*} where $N&gt;2s=\max\{2s_i\}$, $s_i\in(0,1)$, $n\geq 2$, $\lambda_{i} \geq 0$, $\alpha _{ij}&gt;0$, $p_{ij}&lt;2^{*}_{s}$, and $p_{ij}+q_{ij}=2^{*}_{s}=\min\{{\frac{2N}{N-2s_i}\}}$ for $i\neq j \in \{1,2,...,n\}$. $2^{*}_s$ called the fractional critical sobolev exponent and $2^{*}_s=2 N /(N-2s)$ for $N &gt; 2s$ and $2^{*}_s=+\infty$ for $N=2s$ or $N&lt;2s$. Our work establishes novel uniqueness and multiplicity results for positive solutions, applicable whether the system possesses a variational structure or not. We provide a comprehensive characterization of the exact number of positive solutions under specific parameter configurations. Our analysis shows that the positive solution set behaves differently across three distinct regimes: $p_{ij}&lt;2$, $p_{ij}=2$, and $2&lt;p_{ij}&lt;2^{*}_{s}$.</description>

      <title>The Boltzmann equation on smooth and cylindrical domains with Maxwell boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the well-posedness of the Boltzmann equation near its hydrodynamic limit on a bounded domain. We consider two types of domains, namely $C^2$ domains with Maxwell boundary conditions where the accommodation coefficient is a continuous space dependent function $\iota \in [\iota_0,1]$ for any $\iota_0 \in (0,1]$, or cylindrical domains with diffusive reflection on the bases of the cylinder and specular reflection on the rest of the boundary. Furthermore, we work with polynomial, stretched exponential and inverse gaussian weights to construct the Cauchy theory near the equilibrium. We remark that all methods are quantitative thus all the constants are constructive and tractable.</description>

      <title>Universal Potential Estimates for Mixed Local and Nonlocal Nonlinear Measure Data Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the nonlinear potential theory for mixed local and nonlocal $p$-Laplace type equations with coefficients and measure data, involving both superquadratic and subquadratic cases. We prove a class of universal pointwise estimates for the solution and its gradient via Riesz and Wolff potentials. These are achieved by imposing various low regularity conditions on the coefficient of the local term, while the kernel coefficient for the nonlocal term is merely assumed to be measurable. The key to these proofs lies in introducing a novel fractional maximum function that can capture both local and nonlocal features simultaneously, and in establishing pointwise estimates for such maximum operators of the solution and its gradient. Notably, our universal potential estimates not only precisely characterize the oscillations of solutions, but also identify the borderline case that bounds their size, thereby refining the pointwise potential estimates available in earlier work.</description>

      <title>Curvature penalization of strongly anisotropic interfaces models and their phase-field approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the effect of anisotropy on sharp or diffuse interfaces models. When the surface tension is a convex function of the normal to the interface, the anisotropy is said to be weak. This usually ensures the lower semicontinuity of the associated energy. If, however, the surface tension depends on the normal in a nonconvex way, this so-called strong anisotropy may lead to instabilities related to the lack of lower semicontinuity of the functional. We investigate the regularizing effects of adding a higher order term of Willmore type to the energy. We consider two types of problems. The first one is an anisotropic nonconvex generalization of the perimeter, and the second one is an anisotropic nonconvex Mumford-Shah functional. In both cases, lower semicontinuity properties of the energies with respect to a natural mode of convergence are established, as well as $\Gamma$-convergence type results by means of a phase field approximation. In comparison with related results for curvature dependent energies, one of the original aspects of our work is that, in the context of free discontinuity problems, we are able to consider singular structures such as crack-tips or multiple junctions.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation and multiplicity results for critical Grushin-Choquard problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following nonlocal Br\'ezis-Nirenberg type critical Choquard problem involving the Grushin operator
  \begin{equation*}
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
  -\Delta_\gamma &amp; u =\lambda u + \left(\displaystyle\int_\Omega \frac{|u(w)|^{2^*_{\gamma, \mu}}}{d(z-w)^\mu}dw\right) |u|^{2^*_{\gamma, \mu}-2}u \quad &amp;&amp;\text{in} \ \Omega,
  u &amp;= 0 \quad &amp;&amp;\text{on} \, \partial \Omega,
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
  \end{equation*}
  where $\Omega$ is an open bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$, with $N \geq 3$, and $\lambda &gt;0$ is a parameter. Here, $\Delta_\gamma$ represents the Grushin operator, defined as
  \[
  \Delta_\gamma u(z) = \Delta_x u(z) +(1+\gamma)^2 |x|^{2\gamma} \Delta_y u(z), \quad \gamma \geq 0,
  \]
  where $z=(x,y)\in \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^m\times \mathbb{R}^n$, $m+n=N \geq 3$ and $2^*_{\gamma,\mu}= \frac{2N_\gamma-\mu}{N_\gamma-2}$ is the Sobolev critical exponent in the Hardy-Littlewood context with $N_\gamma= m+(1+\gamma)n$ is the homogeneous dimension associated to the Grushin operator and $0&lt;\mu&lt;N_\gamma$. The homogeneous norm related to the Grushin operator is denoted by
  $d(\cdot)$. In this article, we prove the existence of bifurcation from any eigenvalue $\lambda^*$ of $-\Delta_\gamma$ under Dirichlet boundary conditions. Furthermore, we show that in a suitable left neighborhood of $\lambda^*$, the number of nontrivial solutions to the problem is at least twice the multiplicity of $\lambda^*$.</description>

      <title>The Neumann problem for the fractional Laplacian: optimal regularity via the Mellin transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the optimal regularity of solutions to the Neumann problem for the fractional Laplacian, $(-\Delta)^s u=h$ in $\Omega$, with the external condition $\mathcal N^s u=0$ in $\Omega^c$. For this, a key point is to establish a 1D Liouville theorem for functions with growth, which we prove by using complex analysis and the Mellin transform.
  More precisely, we prove a ``meta-theorem'' relating the classification of 1D solutions to general linear homogeneous equations of the type $Lu=0$ in $(0,\infty)$ to the (complex) roots of an explicit meromorphic function $f(z)$ that depends on $L$. In case of the fractional Laplacian with Neumann conditions, we show that all solutions are $C^{2s+\alpha}$ when $s\leq 1/2$, and $C^{s+\frac12+\alpha}$ when $s\geq1/2$.
  Moreover, quite surprisingly, we prove that even in 1D there exist highly oscillating solutions of the type $u(x)=x^{a} \cos(b \log x)$ for $x&gt;0$, with $a&gt;0$ and $b&gt;0$ that depend on $s$, and $a&lt;2s$ for $s\sim1$.</description>

      <title>Recovery of a matrix valued potential for the wave equation on stationary spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of recovering a time dependent matrix valued potential on a globally hyperbolic manifold from the knowledge of the source to solution map of a wave equation including a connection 1-form term. We exhibit sufficient conditions for solving this inverse problem under the assumption that the the manifold is stationary and that the connection term is time independent. The proof is based on two ingredients. The first is reduction of the problem to the study of a non-Abelian light ray transform and holds assuming global hyperbolicity only. The second is the study of this transform and establishing a link with a Riemannian analogue.</description>

      <title>Liouville properties for differential inequalities with $(p,q)$ Laplacian operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish several Liouville-type theorems for a class of nonhomogenenous quasilinear inequalities. In the first part, we prove various Liouville results associated with nonnegative solutions to \begin{equation*}\tag{$P_s$} -\Delta_p u-\Delta_q u\geq u^{s-1} \, \text{ in }\, \Omega, \end{equation*} where $1&lt;q&lt;p$, $s&gt;1$ and $\Omega$ is any exterior domain of $\mathbb{R}^N$. In particular, we prove that for $q&lt;N$, inequality $(P_s)$ does not admit any positive solution when $s&lt;q_*$ and $(P_s)$ admits a positive solution if $s&gt;q_*$, where $q_*=\frac{q(N-1)}{N-q}$ is the Serrin exponent for the $q$-Laplacian. Further, we show that when $s=q_*$ and $p&lt;s$ the only nonnegative solution to $(P_s)$ is the trivial solution. On the other hand, for $q\geq N$ we prove that $u\equiv 0$ is the only nonnegative solution for $(P_s)$ for any $s&gt;1$.
  In the second part, we consider the inequality \begin{equation*}\tag{$P_{sm}$} -\Delta_p u-\Delta_q u \geq u^s |\nabla u|^m \quad \text{ in }\mathbb{R}^N, \end{equation*} where $1&lt;q&lt;p$, $N&gt;q$ and $s, \, m\geq 0$. We prove that, for $\{0\leq m\leq q-1\}\cup\{m&gt;p-1\}$, the only positive solution to $(P_{sm})$ is constant, provided $s(N-q)+m(N-1)&lt;N(q-1)$. This, in particular, proves that if $\Omega=\mathbb{R}^N$ then any nonnegative solution to $(P_s)$ with $1&lt;q&lt;N$ and $1&lt;s&lt;q_*$ is the trivial solution. To prove Liouville in the range $0\leq m&lt;q-1$, we first prove an almost optimal lower estimate of any nonnegative supersolution of $(P_{sm})$ and then leveraging this estimate we prove Liouville result. To the best of our knowledge, this technique is completely new and provides an alternative approach to the capacity method of Mitidieri-Pohozaev provided higher regularity is available.</description>

      <title>Strong solution for polymeric fluid-structure interaction with small initial acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of a 3D-3D-2D mutually coupled solute-solvent-structure three-states system. This describes the interaction of a flexible structure with a polymeric fluid of classical Oldroyd-B type without centre-of-mass diffusion. We construct a unique higher-order regularity notion of a strong solution for the system by decoupling the solute from the solvent-structure subsystem, solving the decoupled system individually, and glueing the solutions through a fixed-point argument. As a requirement for the construction, we rely on a maximal regularity result for the Stokes problem on moving domains with non-trivial boundary conditions; a result that is also of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem for capillary hypersurfaces for $p&gt;q$, which aims to find a capillary convex body with a prescribed capillary $(p,q)$-the dual curvature measure in the Euclidean half-space. We reduce it to a Monge-Amp\`ere type equation with a Robin boundary condition on the unit spherical cap, and prove that there exists a unique smooth solution that solves this problem provided $\theta\in (0,\frac{\pi}{2})$.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we solve the fundamental problem of describing the coordinate transformations that preserve the upper triangular Toeplitz form of the given operator field. Surprisingly, this problem is closely related to the description of all Nijenhuis operators in the same form. This description, as well as the formulas for the aforementioned coordinate transformations, are given by the implicit formulas involving matrix-valued functions.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principles for the Gross Pitaevskii Gibbs measure at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the large deviation principle for the conditional Gibbs measure associated with the focusing Gross Pitaevskii equation in the low temperature regime. This conditional measure is of mixed type, being canonical in energy and microcanonical in particle number. In particular, our result extends the large deviation principle for the mixed ensemble studied by Ellis, Jordan, Otto, and Turkington to a more singular setting, where the interaction potential is unbounded and the conditional event involves diverging renormalization constants. As a consequence of the large deviation principle, the Gibbs measure concentrates along the soliton manifold in the low temperature limit.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Gaussianity of the 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the qualitative properties of solutions to the 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with forcing that is white in time and coloured in space. Our main result shows that the unique invariant measure of this system is equivalent to that of the corresponding Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.
  Our method relies on a generalization of the "time-shifted Girsanov method" of [MS05, MRS22] to compare the laws of time marginals for dissipative SPDEs. This generalisation allows to not only compare solutions to a nonlinear equation to those of the corresponding linear equation, but also to directly compare two nonlinear equations. We use this to establish equivalence of the Navier-Stokes system to a "twisted" nonlinear system that leaves the Gaussian measure invariant. We further apply this method to establish similar equivalence statements for a family of hypoviscous Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Partial Regularity for the Three-dimensional Stochastic Ericksen--Leslie equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the global existence of martingale suitable weak solutions to stochastic Ericksen-Leslie equations with additive noise in a 3D torus. The notion of suitable weak solutions has been introduced to address possible emergence of finite-time singularities, which remains a notably challenging question in the field of fluid dynamics. Weak solutions offer an approach to account for these potential singularities. A restricted class of weak solutions that exhibit a higher level of regularity, and are therefore more likely to be physically meaningful, is naturally called for. Consequently, suitable weak solutions -- that is, weak solutions that satisfy a local energy inequality -- have become a focus of research, including investigations into how regular these solutions can be. In this article, we prove that, despite the presence of white noise, the paths of martingale suitable weak solutions of 3D stochastic Ericksen-Leslie equations exhibit singular points of one-dimensional parabolic Hausdorff measure zero. To establish this result, we utilize two techniques that can potentially be generalized to handle other stochastically forced complex fluid dynamics equations with a similar structure. First, a local energy-preserving approximation is constructed, which markedly facilitates the proof of the global existence of martingale suitable weak solutions. Second, to demonstrate partial regularity of these solutions, a blow-up argument is formulated, which efficiently yields the desired key estimate.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of periodic fractional discrete NLS in the continuum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fractional discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (fDNLS) is studied on a periodic lattice from the analytic and dynamic perspective by varying the mesh size $h&gt;0$ and the nonlocal L\'evy index $\alpha \in (0,2]$. We show that the discrete system converges to the fractional NLS as $h \rightarrow 0$ below the energy space by directly estimating the difference between the discrete and continuum solutions in $L^2(\mathbb{T})$ using the discrete periodic Strichartz estimates. The sharp convergence rate via the finite difference method (FDM) is shown to be $O(h^{\frac{\alpha}{2+\alpha}})$ in the energy space. To further illustrate the convergent behavior of fDNLS, we survey various dynamical behaviors of the continuous wave (CW) solutions in the context of modulational instability, emphasizing the interplay between linear dispersion (or lattice diffraction), characterized by the nonlocal lattice coupling, and nonlinearity. In particular, the transition as $h \rightarrow 0$ from the linear dependence of maximum gain $\Omega_m$ on the amplitude $A$ of CW solutions to the quadratic dependence is shown analytically and numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metaplectic operators form a relevant class of operators appearing in different applications, in the present work we study their Schwartz kernels. Namely, diagonality of a kernel is defined by imposing rapid off-diagonal decay conditions, and quasi-diagonality by imposing the same conditions on the smoothing of the kernel through convolution with the Gaussian. Kernels of metaplectic operators are not diagonal. Nevertheless, as we shall prove, they are quasi-diagonal under suitable conditions. Motivation for our study comes from problems in time-frequency analysis, that we discuss in the last section.</description>

Abstract: We study the following Liouville system defined on a flat torus \begin{equation} \left\{ \begin{array}{lr} -\Delta u_i=\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}\rho_j\Big(\frac{h_j e^{u_j}}{\int_\Omega h_j e^{u_j}}-1\Big),\nonumber \\ u_j\in H_{per}^1(\Omega)\mbox{ for }i\in I=\{1,\cdots,n\}\nonumber, \end{array} \right. \end{equation} where $h_j\in C^3(\Omega)$, $h_j&gt;0$, $\rho_j&gt;0$ and $u=(u_1,..,u_n)$ is doubly periodic on $\partial\Omega$. The matrix $A=(a_{ij})_{n\times n}$ satisfies certain properties. One central problem about Liouville systems is whether multi-bubble solutions do exist. In this work we present a comprehensive construction of multi-bubble solutions in the most general setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the initial-boundary value problem for weakly coupled systems of time-fractional subdiffusion equations with spatially and temporally varying coupling coefficients. By combining the energy method with the coercivity of fractional derivatives, we convert the original partial differential equations into a coupled ordinary differential system. Through Laplace transform and maximum principle arguments, we reveal a dichotomy in decay behavior: When the highest fractional order is less than one, solutions exhibit sublinear decay, whereas systems with the highest order equal to one demonstrate a distinct superlinear decay pattern. This phenomenon fundamentally distinguishes coupled systems from single fractional diffusion equations, where such accelerated superlinear decay never occurs. Numerical experiments employing finite difference methods and implicit discretization schemes validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a general result about the recovery of the analytic wavefront set of a distribution from the analytic wavefront set of its transform coming from a classical elliptic analytic Fourier integral operator (FIO) satisfying some conditions including the Bolker condition. Furthermore, we give a simple explicit analytic parametrix in the form of a classical elliptic analytic FIO for general analytic second order hyperbolic differential operators. Finally, we apply these results together with microlocal analytic continuation and a layer stripping argument to a problem from seismic inversion to prove the injectivity of a linearized operator in the analytic setting. It is the use of wave packet techniques that allows us to give the precise relation how the FIOs under consideration transform the analytic wavefront set, whereas the explicit analytic parametrix comes from a reformulation of the parametrix construction of Hadamard and H\"ormander.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the parabolic $p$-Laplace equation with $p&gt;2$ in a moving domain under a Neumann type boundary condition corresponding to the total mass conservation. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution by the Galerkin method in evolving Bochner spaces and a monotonicity argument. The main difficulty is in characterizing the weak limit of the nonlinear gradient term, where we need to deal with a term which comes from the boundary condition and cannot be absorbed into a monotone operator. To overcome this difficulty, we prove a uniform-in-time Friedrichs type inequality on a moving domain with time-dependent basis functions and make use of it to get the strong convergence of approximate solutions. We also show that the time derivative exists in the $L^2$ sense when given data have a better regularity.</description>

      <title>The Cauchy problem for the integrable RZQ equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study a new integrable fifth-order Camassa-Holm (CH)-type equation derived by Reyes, Zhu, and Qiao, which we call the RZQ equation. The m-form of this equation possesses a striking similarity to the m-form of the CH equation. However, unlike the CH equation, the nonlocal form of this equation cannot be interpreted as a nonlocal perturbation of Burgers' equation. We prove that the initial value problem corresponding to the RZQ equation is well-posed in the sense of Hadamard, in Sobolev spaces $H^s$, $s&gt;7/2$. We further show that the data-to-solution map is not uniformly continuous in the $H^s$ topology, though it is H\"older continuous in a weaker topology. The initial value problem corresponding to the RZQ equation is ill-posed in $H^s$ for $s&lt;7/2$.</description>

      <title>A Convergent Finite Element Scheme for the Q-Tensor Model of Liquid Crystals Subjected to an Electric Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Landau-de Gennes Q-tensor model of liquid crystals subjected to an electric field and develop a fully discrete numerical scheme for its solution. The scheme uses a convex splitting of the bulk potential, and we introduce a truncation operator for the Q-tensors to ensure well-posedness of the problem. We prove the stability and well-posedness of the scheme. Finally, making a restriction on the admissible parameters of the scheme, we show that up to a subsequence, solutions to the fully discrete scheme converge to weak solutions of the Q-tensor model as the time step and mesh are refined. We then present numerical results computed by the numerical scheme, among which we show that it is possible to simulate the Fr\'eedericksz transition with this scheme.</description>

      <title>Convexity and rigidity of hypersurfaces in Cartan-Hadamard manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that in Cartan-Hadamard manifolds $M^n$, $n\geq 3$, closed infinitesimally convex hypersurfaces $\Gamma$ bound convex flat regions, if curvature of $M^n$ vanishes on tangent planes of $\Gamma$. This encompasses Chern-Lashof-Sacksteder characterization of compact convex hypersurfaces in Euclidean space, and some results of Greene-Wu-Gromov on rigidity of Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. It follows that closed simply connected surfaces in $M^3$ with minimal total absolute curvature bound Euclidean convex bodies, as stated by Gromov in 1985. The proofs employ the Gauss-Codazzi equations, a generalization of Schur comparison theorem to CAT($k$) spaces, and other techniques from Alexandrov geometry outlined by Petrunin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07741v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was asked by Marques-Neves which min-max $p$-widths of the unit $3$-sphere lie strictly between $2\pi^2$ and $8\pi$. We show that the 10th to the 13th widths do. More generally, we prove stronger versions of X. Zhou's multiplicity one theorem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of uniqueness of solutions in the conformal method for solving the constraint equations in general relativity with arbitrary mean curvature as developed initially by Holst, Nagy, Tsogtegerel and Maxwell. We show that the solution they construct is unique amongst those having volume below a certain threshold.</description>

      <title>The Combinatorial Loewner Property and super-multiplicativity inequalities for symmetric self-similar metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a general construction of self-similar metric spaces as limits of discrete graphs. Our framework produces many classical examples, such as the Sierpi\'nski carpet and the higher dimensional Menger sponges, but also a rich class of new examples. The main result of the work roughly speaking states: If the construction is sufficiently symmetric then the limiting object supports useful moduli estimates, namely the Combinatorial Loewner property of Bourdon--Kleiner and the super-multiplicativity inequalities. The latter are established on Menger sponges for which it had not been previously known. The main new technique the work offers is a general framework of flows and resistance estimates.</description>

      <title>Rate of convergence for numerical $\alpha$-dissipative solutions of the Hunter-Saxton equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07712v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that $\alpha$-dissipative solutions to the Cauchy problem of the Hunter-Saxton equation, where $\alpha \in W^{1, \infty}(\mathbb{R}, [0, 1))$, can be computed numerically with order $\mathcal{O}(\Delta x^{{1}/{8}}+\Delta x^{{\beta}/{4}})$ in $L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$, provided there exist constants $C &gt; 0$ and $\beta \in (0, 1]$ such that the initial spatial derivative $\bar{u}_{x}$ satisfies $\|\bar{u}_x(\cdot + h) - \bar{u}_x(\cdot)\|_2 \leq Ch^{\beta}$ for all $h \in (0, 2]$. The derived convergence rate is exemplified by a number of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A rigorous formulation of Density Functional Theory for spinless fermions in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a completely rigorous formulation of Kohn-Sham density functional theory for spinless fermions living in one dimensional space. More precisely, we consider Schr\"odinger operators of the form $H_N(v,w) = -\Delta + \sum_{i\neq j}^N w(x_i,x_j) + \sum_{j=1}^N v(x_i)$ acting on $\wedge^N \mathrm{L}^2([0,1])$, where the external and interaction potentials $v$ and $w$ belong to a suitable class of distributions. In this setting, we obtain a complete characterization of the set of pure-state $v$-representable densities on the interval. Then, we prove a Hohenberg-Kohn theorem that applies to the class of distributional potentials studied here. Lastly, we establish the differentiability of the exchange-correlation functional and therefore the existence of a unique exchange-correlation potential. We then combine these results to provide a rigorous formulation of the Kohn-Sham scheme. In particular, these results show that the Kohn-Sham scheme is rigorously exact in this setting.</description>

      <title>How smooth are restrictions of Besov functions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a previous work, we showed that Besov spaces do not enjoy the restriction property unless $q\leq p$. Specifically, we proved that if $p&lt;q$, then it is always possible to construct a function $f\in B_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^N)$ such that $f(\cdot,y)\notin B_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for a.e. $y\in \mathbb{R}^{N-d}$, while this "pathology" does not happen if $q\leq p$. We showed that the partial maps belong, in fact, to the Besov space of generalised smoothness $B_{p,q}^{(s,\Psi)}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ provided the function $\Psi$ satisfies a simple summability condition involving $p$ and $q$. This short note completes the picture by showing that this characterisation is sharp.</description>
