      <title>On the fundamental regularity theorem for mass-minimizing flat chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the theory of flat chains with coefficients in a normed abelian group, we give a simple necessary and sufficient condition on a group element $g$ in order for the following fundamental regularity principle to hold: if a mass-minimizing chain is, in a ball disjoint from the boundary, sufficiently weakly close to a multiplicity $g$ disk, then, in a smaller ball, it is a $C^{1,\alpha}$ perturbation with multiplicity $g$ of that disk.</description>

      <title>Geometric bounds for low Steklov eigenvalues of finite volume hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain geometric lower bounds for the low Steklov eigenvalues of finite-volume hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic boundary. The bounds we obtain depend on the length of a shortest multi-geodesic disconnecting the surfaces into connected components each containing a boundary component and the rate of dependency on it is sharp. Our result also identifies situations when the bound is independent of the length of this multi-geodesic. The bounds also hold when the Gaussian curvature is bounded between two negative constants and can be viewed as a counterpart of the well-known Schoen-Wolpert-Yau inequality for Laplace eigenvalues. The proof is based on analysing the behaviour of the {corresponding Steklov} eigenfunction on an adapted version of thick-thin decomposition for hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic boundary. Our results extend and improve the previously known result in the compact case obtained by a different method.</description>

      <title>Delayed parabolic regularity for curve shortening flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two curves bounding a region of area $A$ that evolve under curve shortening flow, we propose the principle that the regularity of one should be controllable in terms of the regularity of the other, starting from time $A/\pi$. We prove several results of this form and demonstrate that no estimate can hold before that time. As an example application, we construct solutions to graphical curve shortening flow starting with initial data that is merely an $L^1$ function.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e's lemma for formal manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a paper in a series that studies smooth relative Lie algebra homologies and cohomologies based on the theory of formal manifolds and formal Lie groups. In two previous papers, we develop the basic theory of formal manifolds, including generalizations of vector-valued distributions and generalized functions on smooth manifolds to the setting of formal manifolds. In this paper, we establish Poincar\'e's lemma for de Rham complexes with coefficients in formal functions, formal generalized functions, compactly supported formal densities, or compactly supported formal distributions.</description>

      <title>Elementary derivation of the Kerr metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to simplify and popularise the construction from the 2013 paper by Apostolov, Calderbank, and Gauduchon, which (among other things) derives the Plebanski-Demianski family of solutions of GR using ideas of complex geometry. The starting point of this construction is the observation that the Euclidean versions of these metrics should have two different commuting complex structures, as well as two commuting Killing vector fields. After some linear algebra, this leads to an ansatz for the metrics, which is half-way to their complete determination. Kerr metric is a special 2-parameter subfamily in this class, which makes these considerations directly relevant to Kerr as well. This results in a derivation of the Kerr metric that is self-contained and elementary.</description>

      <title>On the Generalized Class of $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{R}$-warped product submanifolds in para-K\"{a}hler Manifolds</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a new generalized class of $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{R}$-warped product submanifolds under the name $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{R}$-pseudo-slant warped product submanifolds in para-K\"{a}hler manifolds $\bar{M}$. The results of existence and non-existence for $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{R}$-pseudo-slant warped product submanifolds with proper slant factor in $\bar{M}$ are shown. In addition to these results, we give an elementary illustration of such warped product submanifold in $\bar{M}$.</description>

      <title>Remarks on asymptotic isometric embeddings of conic transforms for torus actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a Hodge manifold and assume that a torus acts on it in a Hamiltonian and holomorphic manner and that this action linearizes on a given quantizing line bundle. Inside the dual of the line bundle one can define the circle bundle, which is a strictly pseudoconvex CR manifold. Then, there is an associated unitary representation on the Hardy space of the circle bundle. Under suitable assumptions on the moment map, we consider certain loci in unit circle bundle, naturally associated to a ray through an irreducible weight. Their quotients are called conic transforms. We introduce maps which are asymptotic embeddings of conic transforms making use of the corresponding equivariant Szeg\H{o} projector.</description>

Abstract: In this expository article we revisit the Bernstein problem for several geometric PDEs including the minimal surface, Monge-Amp\`{e}re, and special Lagrangian equations. We also discuss the minimal surface system where appropriate. The article is based on a lecture series given by the author for the inaugural European Doctorate School of Differential Geometry, held in Granada in June 2024.</description>

      <title>Dirac eigenvalues and the hyperspherical radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For closed connected Riemannian spin manifolds an upper estimate of the smallest eigenvalue of the Dirac operator in terms of the hyperspherical radius is proved. When combined with known lower Dirac eigenvalue estimates, this has a number of geometric consequences. Some are known and include Llarull's scalar curvature rigidity of the standard metric on the sphere, Geroch's conjecture on the impossibility of positive scalar curvature on tori and a mean curvature estimate for spin fill-ins with nonnegative scalar curvature due to Gromov, including its rigidity statement recently proved by Cecchini, Hirsch and Zeidler. New applications provide a comparison of the hyperspherical radius with the Yamabe constant and improved estimates of the hyperspherical radius for K\"ahler manifolds, K\"ahler-Einstein manifolds, quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds and manifolds with a harmonic 1-form of constant length.</description>

      <title>Double b-fibrations and desingularization of the X-ray transform on manifolds with strictly convex boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14904v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the mapping properties of the X-ray transform and its adjoint on spaces of conormal functions on Riemannian manifolds with strictly convex boundary. After desingularizing the double fibration, and expressing the X-ray transform and its adjoint using b-fibrations operations, we employ tools related to Melrose's Pushforward Theorem to describe the mapping properties of these operators on various classes of polyhomogeneous functions, with special focus to computing how leading order coefficients are transformed. The appendix explains that a na\"ive use of the Pushforward Theorem leads to a suboptimal result with non-sharp index sets. Our improved results are obtained by closely inspecting Mellin functions which arise in the process, showing that certain coefficients vanish. This recovers some sharp results known by other methods. A number of consequences for the mapping properties of the X-ray transform and its normal operator(s) follow.</description>

      <title>Generalized Finsler geometry and the anisotropic tearing of skin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A continuum mechanical theory with foundations in generalized Finsler geometry describes the complex anisotropic behavior of skin. A fiber bundle approach, encompassing total spaces with assigned linear and nonlinear connections, geometrically characterizes evolving configurations of a deformable body with microstructure. An internal state vector is introduced on each configuration, describing subscale physics. A generalized Finsler metric depends on position and the state vector, where the latter dependence allows for both direction (i.e., as in Finsler geometry) as well as magnitude. Equilibrium equations are derived using a variational method, extending concepts of finite-strain hyperelasticity coupled to phase-field mechanics to generalized Finsler space. For application to skin tearing, state vector components represent microscopic damage processes (e.g., fiber rearrangements and ruptures) in different directions with respect to intrinsic orientations (e.g., parallel or perpendicular to Langer's lines). Nonlinear potentials, motivated from soft-tissue mechanics and phase-field fracture theories, are assigned with orthotropic material symmetry pertinent to properties of skin. Governing equations are derived for one- and two-dimensional base manifolds. Analytical solutions capture experimental force-stretch data, toughness, and observations on evolving microstructure, in a more geometrically and physically descriptive way than prior phenomenological models.</description>
