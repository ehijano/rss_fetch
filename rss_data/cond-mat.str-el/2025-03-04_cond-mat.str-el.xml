      <description>arXiv:2503.00100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Julia package FuzzifiED aims at simplifying the numerical calculations on the fuzzy sphere. It supports exact diagonalisation (ED) and density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) calculations. FuzzifiED can also apply to generic fermionic and bosonic models. This documentation provides a review of the fuzzy sphere regularisation and an instruction for using FuzzifiED for numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Anomalies of Coset Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalies of global symmetries provide important information on the quantum dynamics. We show the dynamical constraints can be organized into three classes: genuine anomalies, fractional topological responses, and integer responses that can be realized in symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Coset symmetry can be present in many physical systems including quantum spin liquids, and the coset symmetry can be a non-invertible symmetry. We introduce twists in coset symmetries, which modify the fusion rules and the generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. We call such coset symmetries twisted coset symmetries, and they are labeled by the quadruple $(G,K,\omega_{D+1},\alpha_D)$ in $D$ spacetime dimensions where $G$ is a group and $K\subset G$ is a discrete subgroup, $\omega_{D+1}$ is a $(D+1)$-cocycle for group $G$, and $\alpha_{D}$ is a $D$-cochain for group $K$. We present several examples with twisted coset symmetries using lattice models and field theory, including both gapped and gapless systems (such as gapless symmetry-protected topological phases). We investigate the anomalies of general twisted coset symmetry, which presents obstructions to realizing the coset symmetry in (gapped) symmetry-protected topological phases. We show that finite coset symmetry $G/K$ becomes anomalous when $G$ cannot be expressed as the bicrossed product $G=H\Join K$, and such anomalous coset symmetry leads to symmetry-enforced gaplessness in generic spacetime dimensions. We illustrate examples of anomalous coset symmetries with $A_5/\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, with realizations in lattice models.</description>

      <title>Zeeman split Kramers doublets in spin-supersolid candidate Na$_{2}$BaCo(PO$_{4}$)$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Na$_{2}$BaCo(PO$_{4}$)$_{2}$ is a triangular antiferromagnet that displays highly efficient adiabatic demagnetization cooling (J. Xiang $\textit{et al.}$ Nature ${\bf{625}}$, 270 (2024)) near a quantum critical point at $\mu_{0}H_{c}\sim 1.6$ T, separating a low-field magnetically disordered from a high-field fully polarized ferromagnetic phase. We apply high resolution backscattering neutron spectroscopy in an applied field to study the magnetic excitations near $\mu_{0}H_{c}$. At large fields we observe ferromagnetic fluctuations that gradually transition to being overdamped in energy below $\mu_{0}H_{c}$ where the magnetism is spatially disordered. We parameterize the excitations in the high field polarized phase in terms of coupled Zeeman split Kramers doublets originating from the presence of spin-orbit coupling. On reducing the field, the splitting between the Kramers doublets is reduced and if done adiabatically, provides a mechanism for reducing temperature. On lowering the applied field through the $\mu_{0}H_{c}$ the excitations characterize a textured phase that we suggest is inefficient for cooling. Low temperature disordered frustrated magnets built on Kramers doublets with nearby quantum critical points provide a route for efficient magnetocalorics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic order and spin dynamics across the ferromagnetic quantum critical point in Ni\boldmath{$_{1-x}$}Mo\boldmath{$_{x}$}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing a quantum critical point (QCP) in clean ferromagnetic (FM) metals has remained elusive due to the coupling of magnetization to the electronic soft modes that drive the transition to be of first order. However, by introducing a suitable amount of quenched disorder, one can still establish a QCP in ferromagnets. In this study, we ascertain that the itinerant ferromagnet Ni$_{1-x}$Mo$_{x}$ exhibits a FM QCP at a critical doping of $x_c \simeq 0.125$. Through magnetization and muon-spin relaxation measurements, we demonstrate that the FM ordering temperature is suppressed continuously to zero at $x_c$, while the magnetic volume fraction remains $100\%$ up to $x_c$, indicating a second-order phase transition. The QCP is accompanied by a non-Fermi liquid behavior, as evidenced by the logarithmic divergence of the specific heat and the linear temperature dependence of the low-temperature resistivity. Our findings reveal a minimal effect of disorder on the critical spin dynamics of Ni$_{1-x}$Mo$_{x}$ at $x_c$, highlighting it as one of the rare systems to exhibit a clean FM QCP.</description>

      <title>Possible quantum spin liquid state of CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ is a recently found two-dimensional triangular lattice antiferromagnet without showing magnetic order. We grew high-quality CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ single crystals and studied the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and thermal conductivity. The dc magnetic susceptibility and magnetization reveal its nature of effective spin-1/2, easy axis anisotropy, and antiferromagnetic spin coupling. The ultralow-temperature ac susceptibility and specific heat data indicate the absence of any phase transition down to 20 mK. The ultralow-temperature thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) at zero magnetic field exhibits a non-zero residual term $\kappa_0/T =$ 0.0056 W/K$^2$m. Although the magnetic field dependence of $\kappa$ is rather weak, the 14 T thermal conductivity shows an essential zero residual term. All these results point to a possible ground state of quantum spin liquid.</description>

      <title>Deconfined criticality as intrinsically gapless topological state in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deconfined criticality and gapless topological states have recently attracted growing attention, as both phenomena go beyond the traditional Landau paradigm. However, the deep connection between these two critical states, particularly in lattice realization, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we reveal that certain deconfined criticality can be regarded as an intrinsically gapless topological state without gapped counterparts in a one dimensional lattice model. Using a combination of field-theoretic arguments and large-scale numerical simulations, we establish the global phase diagram of the model, which features deconfined critical lines separating two distinct spontaneous symmetry breaking ordered phases. More importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that the mixed anomaly inherent to deconfined criticality enforces topologically robust edge modes near the boundary, providing a general mechanism by which deconfined criticality manifests as a gapless topological state. Our findings not only offer a new perspective on deconfined criticality but also deepen our understanding of gapless topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Non-trivial phonon dynamics and significant electron-phonon coupling of the high frequency modes in a Dirac semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using finite temperature Raman spectroscopy, we investigate the electron-phonon interactions
  (EPI) and phonon-phonon scattering dynamics in the Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 in different fre quency regimes. Strong softening of the Raman shifts below 200 K is observed for almost all the
  phonon modes with a marked deviation from the standard anharmonic behavior. The experimen tally observed Raman linewidth seems to be captured well by a combination of EPI, relevant at
  low temperature (LT) and phonon-phonon scattering, which is predominant at high temperatures
  (HT), leading to an observable minima in the thermal evolution of the linewidth. While this fea ture is most prominently observed in the highest-frequency Raman mode (196 cm-1), its intensity
  gradually diminishes as the Raman frequency decreases. Computation of the electronic contribution
  to the phonon linewidth, for both the high and low frequency modes, from the phonon self-energy
  shows that it qualitatively mimics the experimental observations. It is found that phonon-induced
  interband scattering results in the presence of a maxima in phonon linewidth that crucially depends
  on the finiteness of the chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Effects of the three-dimensional interplanar coupling on the centrosymmetric skyrmion crystal formation in the frustrated stacked-triangular Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effects of the three-dimensional (3D) interplanar coupling on centrosymmetric skyrmion crystal (SkX) formation is investigated via extensive Monte Carlo simulations on the frustrated isotropic Heisenberg model on a stacked-triangular lattice in both cases of the ferromagnetic (F) and the antiferromagnetic (AF) nearest-neighbor interplanar coupling $J_{1c}$. The SkX phase is stabilized at finite fields and at finite temperatures for both F and AF $J_{1c}$, although it is destabilized by modestly weak AF $J_{1c}$. The magnetic phase diagram of the 3D short-range model is more or less similar to those of the 2D short-range model and of the 2D long-range RKKY model. We find that an intriguing phenomenon of replica-symmetry breaking, popular in glass physics and recently identified in the SkX phase of the 3D long-range RKKY model [K. Mitsumoto and H. Kawamura, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 104}, 184432 (2021)], does not arise in the 3D short-range model, suggesting that the long-range nature of interaction might be necessary to realize the RSB in centrosymmetric SkX state.</description>

      <title>Magnon damping and mode softening in quantum double-exchange ferromagnets without Jahn-Teller phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the magnetic excitations and electronic properties of fully quantum double-exchange ferromagnets, i.e., systems where ferromagnetic ordering emerges from the competition between spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom, but without the canonical approximation of using classical localized spins. Specifically, we investigate spin excitations within the Kondo lattice-like model, as well as a two-orbital Hubbard Hamiltonian in proximity to the orbital-selective Mott phase. Computational analysis of the magnon dispersion, damping, and spectral weight within these models reveals unexpected phenomena, such as magnon mode softening and the anomalous decoherence of magnetic excitations as observed in earlier experimental efforts, but explained here without the use of the phononic degrees of freedom. We show that these effects are intrinsically linked to incoherent spectral features near the Fermi level, which arise due to the quantum nature of the local (on-site) triplets. This incoherent spectrum leads to a Stoner-like continuum on which spin excitations scatter, governing magnon lifetime and strongly influencing the dynamical spin structure factor. Our study explores the transition from coherent to incoherent magnon spectra by varying the electron density. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the magnitude of the localized spin mitigates decoherence by suppressing the incoherent spectral contributions near the Fermi level. We also discuss the effective $J_1$-$J_2$ spin Hamiltonian, which can accurately describe the large doping region characterized by the magnon-mode softening. Finally, we show that this behavior is also present in multiorbital models with partially filled orbitals, namely, in systems without localized spin moments, provided that the model is in a strong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Haldane Fractional Statistics for 1D Heisenberg Spin XXX Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Haldane's fractional exclusion statistics (FES) describes a generalized Pauli exclusion statistics, which can be regarded as an emergent quantum statistics induced by the intrinsic dynamical interaction. A non-mutual FES has been identified at the quantum criticality of the one-dimensional (1D) and 2D interacting Bose Gas [Nat. Sci. Rev. 9, nwac027 (2022)]. It is naturally asked if such a non-mutual FES can be induced by the spin-spin interaction in the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 XXX chain? In this article, we first represent the Bethe ansatz equations of spin strings in terms of the FES equations of different species. Then we show that the 1D spin XXX chain remarkably possesses the non-mutual FES in the critical region. We observe that the equation of state in terms of the FES gives rises to full statistical properties of the model at quantum criticality, which are in good agreement with the results obtained from the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) equations of the model. From the non-mutual FES, we also precisely determine the quantum scaling functions, which further agree well with the previous TBA results [Phys. Rev. B 96, 220401(R) (2017)]. Finally, we also build up an exact mapping between the scaling functions of the Lieb-Liniger model and the spin Heisenberg spin chain at quantum criticality. Our method provides deep insights into the critical phase of matter from quantum FES point of view.</description>

      <title>Dynamical exponents as an emergent property at interacting topological quantum critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In standard studies of quantum critical points (QCPs), the dynamical exponent $z$ is introduced as a fundamental parameter along with global symmetries to identify universality classes. Often, the dynamical exponent $z$ is set to be one as the most natural choice for quantum field theory representations, which further implies emergence of higher space-time symmetries near QCPs in many condensed matter systems. In this article, we study a family of topological quantum critical points (tQCPs) where the $z=1$ quantum field theory is prohibited in a fundamental representation by a protecting symmetry, resulting in tQCPs with $z=2$. We further illustrate that when strong interactions are properly taken into account, the stable weakly interacting gapless tQCPs with $z=2$ can further make a transition to another family of gapless tQCPs with dynamical exponent $z=1$, without breaking the protecting symmetry. Our studies suggest that dynamical exponents, as well as the degrees of freedom in fermion fields, can crucially depend on interactions in topological quantum phase transitions; in tQCPs, to a large extent, they are better thought of as emergent properties.</description>

      <title>Universal whirling magnetic orders in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type quasicrystal approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01517v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic orders of non-Heisenberg Tsai-type 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) in the Au-Ga-Dy system were studied through bulk magnetization, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering techniques. The results uncovered noncoplanar, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configurations whirling along [111] crystallographic axis, which is analogous to those observed in the Tb- and Ho-contained counterparts. The crystal electric field excitations similar to those in the Tb-based counterpart are also observed indicating the strong Ising-like magnetic anisotropy. These comprehensive experiments and analyses have revealed the existence of a universal mechanism that stabilizes noncoplanar FM and AFM structures in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type ACs, independent of the rare-earth species (Tb, Dy, Ho); FM intra-cluster interactions and strong Ising-like anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Flat bands and temperature-driven phase transition in quasi-one-dimensional zigzag chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat-band materials have garnered extensive attention due to their captivating properties associated with strong correlation effects. While flat bands have been discovered in several types of 2D materials, their existence in 1D systems remains elusive. Here, we propose a 1D frustrated lattice, specifically the 1D zigzag lattice, as a platform for hosting flat bands. This lattice can be experimentally realized by growing CuTe chains on Cu(111). The presence of flat bands was confirmed by tight-binding model analysis, first-principles calculations, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. In addition, we discovered a temperature-driven phase transition at approximately 250 K. Detailed analyses demonstrate that the system has a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior, accompanied by spin-charge separation effects. Our work unveils new prospects for investigating strongly correlated electron behaviors and topological properties in the 1D limit.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the one-dimensional $XX$ lattice model and its cousins through the lens of momentum and winding $U(1)$ symmetries. We distinguish two closely related $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries based on their relation to the $U(1)$ symmetries, and establish a web of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging relations among these models, rooted in two fundamental seeds: the $ XY \pm YX$ models. These two seeds, each self-dual under gauging of the respective $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetries, possess manifestly symmetric conserved charges, making transparent the connection between the noninvertible symmetries and the Kramers-Wannier duality. By leveraging the self-dualities of these two seed models, we derive the self-dualities of their cousins, including the $XX$ model and the Levin-Gu model, through appropriate gauging procedures. Moreover, under these gauging schemes, the lattice T-duality matrices take the form of the identity matrix. Finally, we unify the mapping structures of local conserved charges across these models, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding their symmetries and dualities.</description>

Abstract: This comment critically examines the claims made in arXiv papers arXiv:2501.17230 and arXiv:2502.00103, which argue that a multiplicity of polar optical phonons can generate a long-range attractive interaction via a generalized Frohlich coupling. I identify a fundamental flaw in their derivation, showing that their result relies on an unphysical assumption--specifically, neglecting the intermode Coulomb interactions between different polar optical phonons. By restoring these missing interactions I show the screened Coulomb interaction is always repulsive in the static limit.</description>

      <title>Understanding Floquet Resonances in Ultracold Gas Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scattering by a short-range potential with time-periodic interaction strength is investigated with a Floquet-scattering theory. Sharp resonances occur, at which the s-wave scattering length can be tuned to large positive and negative values. We show that the shape of these resonances is described by a simple formula, and find that both resonance position and prefactor can be altered by the driving strength. Our approach allows to identify the physical origin of the scattering resonances as Floquet bound states with positive energies, which are dynamically created by the drive. This insight is valuable for a detailed analysis and uncovers a general resource for enhanced or reduced scattering in Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Generating Generalised Ground-State Ansatzes from Few-Body Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method that generates ground state ansatzes for quantum many-body systems which are both analytically tractable and accurate over wide parameter regimes. Our approach leverages a custom symbolic language to construct tensor network states (TNS) via an evolutionary algorithm. This language provides operations that allow the generated TNS to automatically scale with system size. Consequently, we can evaluate ansatz fitness for small systems, which is computationally efficient, while favouring structures that continue to perform well with increasing system size. This ensures that the ansatz captures robust features of the ground state structure. Remarkably, we find analytically tractable ansatzes with a degree of universality, which encode correlations, capture finite-size effects, accurately predict ground state energies, and offer a good description of critical phenomena. We demonstrate this method on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model (LMG) and the quantum transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), where the same ansatz was independently generated for both. The simple structure of the ansatz allows us to restore broken symmetries and obtain exact expressions for local observables and correlation functions. We also point out an interesting connection between this ansatz and a well-studied sequence in analytical number theory and the one-dimensional classical Ising model.</description>

      <title>Compactfying Electronic Wavefunctions I: Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transcorrelation (TC) techniques effectively enhance convergence rates in strongly correlated fermionic systems by embedding electron-electron cusp into the Jastrow factor of similarity transformations, yielding a non-Hermitian, yet iso-spectral, Hamiltonian. This non-Hermitian nature introduces significant challenges for variational methods such as the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). To address these, existing approaches often rely on computationally expensive methods prone to errors, such as imaginary-time evolution. We introduce an Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG (EMTC-DMRG), a classical variational algorithm that overcomes these challenges by integrating existing techniques to achieve superior accuracy and efficiency. Key features of our algorithm include: (a) an analytical formulation of the transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian; (b) a numerically exact, uncompressed Matrix Product Operator (MPO) representation developed via symbolic optimization and the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm; and (c) a time-independent DMRG with a two-site sweep algorithm; (d) we use Davidson solver even for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method significantly enhances computational efficiency and accuracy in determining ground-state energies for the two-dimensional transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, it can be adapted to compute both ground and excited states in molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Insight into interplay between bandstructure and Coulomb interaction via quasiparticle interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticle interference has been used frequently for the purpose of unraveling the electronic states in the vicinity of the Fermi level as well as the nature of superconducting gap in the unconventional superconductors. Using the metallic spin-density wave state of iron pnictides as an example, we demonstrate that the quasiparticle interference can also be used as a probe to provide crucial insight into the interplay of the electronic bandstructure and correlation effects in addition to bringing forth the essential features of electronic states in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Our study reveals that the features of quasiparticle interference pattern can help us narrowing down the interaction parameter window and choose a more realistic tight-binding model.</description>

      <title>Exchange-phase erasure in anyonic Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-particle interferometry is an important tool for extracting the exchange statistics of quantum particles. We theoretically investigate the prospects of such interferometry to probe the statistics of point-like anyonic excitations injected in a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) setup based on a quantum point contact device in the fractional quantum Hall regime. We compute the standard HOM ratio, i.e., the ratio of tunneling noises for two- and one-particle injections, and find that for point-like anyons, it only depends on the temperature and the anyon scaling dimension. Importantly, the latter is not necessarily related to the exchange phase. In fact, we establish that the HOM ratio does not reveal the exchange phase of the injected anyons: For injection-time delays that are small compared to the thermal time scale, we find that the exchange phase accumulated due to time-domain braiding between injected and thermally activated anyons is erased due to two mutually canceling sub-processes. In contrast, for time delays large compared to the thermal time, only a single sub-process contributes to the braiding, but the accumulated phase is canceled in the HOM ratio. These findings suggest caution when interpreting HOM interferometry experiments with anyons and approaches beyond the standard HOM ratio are thus necessary to extract anyonic statistics with two-particle interferometry experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a first-principles lattice calculations to comprehend the thermal expansion $\alpha(T)$ and lattice thermal conductivity $\kappa_{ph}$ of ScAgC. The obtained positive frequencies of phonon dispersion shows the dynamical stability of ScAgC in FCC structure. The estimated $\alpha(T)$ from quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) at 300(1200) K is $\sim$4(4.6)$\times$$10^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$. The predicted value of total $\kappa_{ph}$ from phonon-phonon interaction (PPI) at 300(1200) K is $\sim$7.4(1.8) Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$. The highest group velocity for acoustic $\&amp;$ optical branches (AB $\&amp;$ OB) is $\sim$6.7 and $\sim$3.5 km/s, respectively. The predicted average phonon lifetime ($\tau_{\lambda}$) for AB(OB) is $\sim$2.5(1.65) ps at 300 K, whereas it is $\sim$0.6(0.4) ps at 1200 K. The estimated highest heat capacity ($C_{\lambda}$) at 200 K for AB(OB) is $\sim$23.5 (19.5) meV/K. We fitted the equation $A_{\kappa}$T$^{-x_{\kappa}}$($A_{\tau}$T$^{-x_{\tau}}$) in the $\kappa_{ph}$($\tau_{\lambda}$) curve to gain a thorough understanding of temperature-dependent $\kappa_{ph}$ trend. The $x_{\kappa}$ for total branches is calculated to be $\sim$1.02. The $x_{\tau}$ value due to total AB(OB) is estimated to be $\sim$1.04(1.02), while it is $\sim$1.03 for total branches. The calculated $x_{\kappa}$ for total AB(OB) is $\sim$1.04(0.95), implying that AB contributes more to the total $\kappa_{ph}$. This research could be important for enhancing the properties of ScAgC regarding thermoelectric and photovoltaic applications.</description>

      <title>Numerical evidence for spin chirality emerging from itinerant ferromagnets in bands with Berry curvature</title>

Abstract: The behavior of strongly interacting electrons in bands with Berry curvature is a problem of wide interest. In this paper, we study this problem by numerically studying a fluxed Hubbard-type model on square lattice. Using this model, we demonstrate a metallic ferromagnet in electron bands equipped with Berry curvature can develop non-coplanar spin order in which spin polarization axes at different position span finite solid angles. We find spin chirality can emerge in this setting by doping or adding gauge flux on top of a collinear ferromagnet. This result supports the prediction of spin chirality occurring through an emergent spin orbital interaction. Meanwhile, our result shows that, on top a ferromagnetic background, the spin chirality emerges at a finite threshold value of orbital magnetization, resembling the predicted behavior in theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum anomaly of a global symmetry is known to strongly constrain the allowed low-energy physics in a clean and isolated quantum system. However, the effect of quantum anomalies in disordered systems is much less understood, especially when the global symmetry is only preserved on average by the disorder. In this work, we focus on disordered systems with both average and exact symmetries $A\times K$, where the exact symmetry $K$ is respected in every disorder configuration, and the average $A$ is only preserved on average by the disorder ensemble. When there is a mixed quantum anomaly between the average and exact symmetries, we argue that the mixed state representing the ensemble of disordered ground states cannot be featureless. While disordered mixed states smoothly connected to the anomaly-compatible phases in clean limit are certainly allowed, we also found disordered phases that have no clean-limit counterparts, including the glassy states with strong-to-weak symmetry breaking, and average topological orders for certain anomalies. We construct solvable lattice models to demonstrate each of these possibilities. We also provide a field-theoretic argument to provide a criterion for whether a given average-exact mixed anomaly admits a compatible average topological order.</description>

      <title>Fate of transient order parameter domain walls in ultrafast experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ultrafast experiments, an optical pump pulse often generates transient domain walls of the order parameter in materials with spontaneous symmetry breaking, due to either a finite penetration depth of light on a three-dimensional (3D) material, or a finite spot size on a two-dimensional (2D) material. We show that the domain wall decays due to unstable order parameter fluctuations. We study a generic system with $U(1)$-symmetric order, and those with an additional weak $Z_2$ ($U(1)$-symmetry-breaking) term, representing the charge-density-wave (CDW) orders in recent experiments. During the first stage of the decay dynamics, exponentially growing thermal fluctuations convert the domain wall into an interface with randomly distributed topological defects. In the second stage, the topological defects undergo a coarsening dynamics within the interface. For a 2D interface in a 3D system, the coarsening dynamics leads to a diffusive growth of the correlation length. For a one-dimensional (1D) interface in a 2D system with the weak $Z_2$ term, the correlation-length growth shows a crossover from diffusive to sub-diffusive behavior.</description>

Abstract: In geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets, conventional long-range order is suppressed due to the presence of primitive triangular structural units, and the nature of the ensuing ground state remains elusive. One class of candidate states, extensively sought in experiments and vigorously studied theoretically, is the quantum spin liquid (QSL), a magnetically-disordered state in which all spins participate in a quantum-coherent many-body state. Randomly located impurities, present in all materials, may prevent QSL formation and instead lead to the formation of a spin-glass state. In this article, we review available data on the specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and neutron scattering in GF materials. Such data show that a pure GF magnet possesses a characteristic ``hidden energy scale'' significantly exceeded by the other microscopic energy scales in the material. When cooled down to a temperature below the hidden energy scale, a GF material develops significant short-range order that dominates its properties and, in particular, dictates the spin-glass transition temperature for experimentally accessible impurity densities. We review the manifestations of short-range order in the commonly observed thermodynamics quantities in GF materials, possible scenarios for the hidden energy scale, and related open questions.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic degeneracy of ground state in the frustrated Heisenberg diamond chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg diamond chain with ferro- and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions is studied. The phase boundary in the parametric space of these interactions is determined, where the transition between the ferromagnetic and other (singlet or ferrimagnetic) ground state phases occurs. On this phase boundary there is a dispersionless (flat) energy band in the one-magnon spectrum and these states can be represented as localized magnons in the trapping cells between neighboring diamonds. The ground state consists of the localized magnons and special magnon complexes and it is macroscopically degenerate. A remarkable feature of the model is the existence, on a certain part of the phase boundary, of two- and three-magnon localized states, forming flat bands in two- and three-magnon spectrum. All these localized states also belong to the ground state manifold, which turns out to be exactly the same as for the system of independent spins-$\frac{3}{2}$. This implies a large macroscopic degeneracy of the ground state $4^n$ ($n$ is number of diamonds in the chain) and a high residual entropy per spin $s_{0}=\frac{2}{3}\ln 2$.</description>

Abstract: The Fermi-edge singularity in x-ray absorption spectra of metals is a paradigmatic case of a logarithmically divergent perturbation series. Prior work has thoroughly analyzed the leading logarithmic terms. Here, we investigate the perturbation theory beyond leading logarithms and formulate self-consistent equations to incorporate all leading and next-to-leading logarithmic terms. This parquet solution of the Fermi-edge singularity goes beyond the previous first-order parquet solution and sheds new light on the parquet formalism regarding logarithmic behavior. We present numerical results in the Matsubara formalism and discuss the characteristic power laws. We also show that, within the single-boson exchange framework, multi-boson exchange diagrams are needed already at the leading logarithmic level.</description>

      <title>From $G_2$ to $SO(8)$: Emergence and reminiscence of supersymmetry and triality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)-dimension continuum model of 4-component fermions incorporating the exceptional Lie group symmetry $G_2$. Four gapped and five gapless phases are identified via the one-loop renormalization group analysis. The gapped phases are controlled by four different stable $SO(8)$ Gross-Neveu fixed points, among which three exhibit an emergent triality, while the rest one possesses the self-triality, i.e., invariant under the triality mapping. The gapless phases include three $SO(7)$ critical ones, a $G_2$ critical one, and a Luttinger liquid. Three $SO(7)$ critical phases correspond to different $SO(7)$ Gross-Neveu fixed points connected by the triality relation similar to the gapped SO(8) case. The $G_2$ critical phase is controlled by an unstable fixed point described by a direct product of the Ising and tricritical Ising conformal field theories with the central charges $c=\frac{1}{2}$ and $c=\frac{7}{10}$, respectively, while the latter one is known to possess spacetime supersymmetry. In the lattice realization with a Hubbard-type interaction, the triality is broken into the duality between two $SO(7)$ symmetries and the supersymmetric $G_2$ critical phase exhibits the degeneracy between bosonic and fermionic states, which are reminiscences of the continuum model.</description>

      <title>Ising phase transitions and thermodynamics of correlated fermions in a two-dimensional spin-dependent lattice potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a {\it numerically exact} study of the Hubbard model with spin-dependent anisotropic hopping on the square lattice using auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. At half filling, the system undergoes Ising phase transitions upon cooling, leading to the formation of Ising-type antiferromagnetic order for repulsive interactions and charge-density wave order for attractive interactions at finite temperatures. By elegantly implementing the sign-problem-free condition and Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations, we achieve significant improvements in precision control of the numerical calculations and obtain highly accurate results of the transition temperatures from weak to strong interactions across representative anisotropies. We further characterize the system by examining the temperature dependence of various thermodynamic properties, including the energy, double occupancy, specific heat and charge susceptibility. Specifically, we provide unbiased numerical results of the entropy map on temperature-interaction plane, the critical entropy, and the spin, singlon and doublon correlations, all of which are directly measurable in optical lattice experiments. Away from half filling, we explore the behavior of the sign problem and investigate the possible emergence of stripe spin-density wave order in the system with repulsive interaction.</description>

      <title>Spin wave interactions in the pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of magnon interactions on the spin wave spectra of the all-in-all-out phase of the pyrochlore nearest neighbour antiferromagnet with a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction ($D$). The leading order corrections to spin wave energies indicate a significant renormalisation for commonly encountered strengths of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya term. For low values of $D$ we find a potential instability of the phase itself, indicated by the renormalisation of magnon frequencies to negative values. We have also studied the renormalized spectra in the presence of magnetic fields along three high symmetry directions of the lattice, namely the $[111]$, $[100]$ and $[110]$ directions. Generically, we find that for a fixed value of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction renormalized spectra for the lowest band decrease with an increasing strength of the field. We have also analyzed the limits of the two magnon continuum and probed the possibility of magnon decay. For a range of $D$ and the field strength we identify possible parameter regimes where the decay of the higher bands of the system are kinematically allowed.</description>

      <title>Predicted versatile topological nodal magnons in the icosahedral quasicrystal 1/1 approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a recenly-estabilished band representation analysis, we discover two distinct types of topological nodal magnons in the real-space antiferroic ordering of whirling spin arrangements in the icosahedral quasicrystal 1/1 approximants, both of which originate from a composite band representation $A\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(24)$ and its constituent ${}^1E_g\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(8)$ (or ${}^2E_g\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(8)$). The first type is doubly-degenerate nodal line network and nodal planes associated with two-dimensional irreducible band representation, while the second type is a nodal line network due to accidental band inversions. Since our analysis, which relies solely on magnetocrystalline symmetry, is valid for a wide range of materials and spin textures belonging to the same magnetic space group irrespective of composition, these findings offer new universal insights into the research of quasicrystals and their approximants as well as a contribution to broadening the range of topological magnon-hosting materials.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh nonperturbative field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to spin-boson and spin-chain-boson models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00765</link>

Abstract: Open quantum systems with many interacting degrees of freedom pose a formidable challenge for presently available theoretical methods, especially when dissipative environment imposes non-Markovian dynamics on them with memory effects and revival of genuine quantum properties. Even the archetypical spin-boson model, where a single spin-1/2 interacts with an infinite bosonic bath, requires switching between methods for different choice of system and bath parameters. Here, we construct a field-theoretic framework as a single methodology that can handle many mutually interacting quantum spins of arbitrary value S, spatial dimensionality, system-bath coupling, bath temperature and spectral properties of the bath. Our framework combines Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) with two-particle irreducible (2PI) action resumming a class of Feynman diagrams to an infinite order originating from 1/N expansion, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons to which the spin is mapped. Remarkably, the SKFT+2PI approach closely tracks numerically exact benchmarks for spin-boson in the non-Markovian regime obtained from hierarchical equations of motion or tensor network methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our SKFT+2PI framework to compute two-spin correlators of an antiferromagnetic quantum spin chain whose edge spins are coupled to a set of three bosonic baths (one for each spin component) at different temperatures. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by SKFT+2PI framework with increasing number of spins, time steps or spatial dimensionality makes it a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and quantum spintronics in the presence of a single or multiple dissipative environments.</description>

      <title>Variational Mapping of Chern Bands to Landau Levels: Application to Fractional Chern Insulators in Twisted MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of mapping between Chern bands and generalized Landau levels in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ ($t$MoTe$_2$), where fractional Chern insulators down to zero magnetic fields have been observed. We construct an exact Landau-level representation of moir\'e bands, where the basis functions, characterized by a uniform quantum geometry, are derived from Landau-level wavefunctions dressed by spinors aligned or antialigned with the layer pseudospin skyrmion field. We further generalize the dressed zeroth Landau level to a variational wavefunction with an ideal yet nonuniform quantum geometry and variationally maximize its weight in the first moir\'e band. The variational wavefunction has a high overlap with the first band and quantitatively captures the exact diagonalization spectra of fractional Chern insulators at hole-filling factors $\nu_h=2/3$ and $3/5$, providing a clear theoretical mechanism for the formation and properties of the fractionalized states. Our work introduces a variational approach to studying fractional states by mapping Chern bands to Landau levels, with application to other systems beyond $t$MoTe$_2$ also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Quantum origin of Ohm's reciprocity relation and its violation: conductivity as inverse resistivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom teaches us that the electrical conductivity in a material is the inverse of its resistivity. In this work, we show that when both of these transport coefficients are defined in linear response through the Kubo formulae as two-point correlators of conserved currents in quantum field theory, this Ohm's reciprocity relation is generically violated in theories with dynamical electromagnetism. We then elucidate how in certain special limits (e.g., in the DC limit in the presence of thermal effects, in certain 2+1$d$ conformal theories, and in holographic supersymmetric theories) the reciprocity relation is reinstated as an emergent property of conductive and resistive transport. We also show that if the response of a material is measured with respect to the total electric field that includes quantum corrections, then the reciprocity relation is satisfied by definition. However, in that case, the transport coefficients are given by the photon vacuum polarisation and not the correlators of conserved currents that dominate the hydrodynamic macroscopic late-time transport.</description>

      <title>Machine-learned nodal structures of Fermion systems</title>

Abstract: Simulating strongly correlated fermionic systems remains a fundamental challenge in quantum physics, largely due to the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. We present a neural network-based variational Monte Carlo (NN-VMC) approach, leveraging a flexible neural network ansatz to represent the many-body wavefunction. Focusing on quantum dots with up to 30 electrons, we demonstrate that NN-VMC significantly reduces variational bias and achieves ground-state energies surpassing those of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). A key feature is that the neural network adaptively learns and optimizes nodal structures during energy minimization. We provide qualitative insights into the nodal structure of fermionic wavefunctions by comparing the nodal structures generated by NN-VMC with those obtained from traditional trial functions. Additionally, we reveal spin-resolved radial distributions and electron density profiles, highlighting the versatility and accuracy of NN-VMC. This work underscores the potential of machine learning to advance quantum simulations and deepen our understanding of strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-breaking induced surface magnetization in non-magnetic RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a newly identified phase of magnetism distinct from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. RuO$_2$ has been considered a prototypical metallic altermagnet with a critical temperature higher than room temperature. Previous interpretations of the unusual magnetic properties of RuO$_2$ relied on the theoretical prediction that local moments on two Ru sublattices, which are connected by four-fold rotational symmetry, are quite significant (approximately 1 $\mu_B$), leading to long-range antiferromagnetic order. However, accumulated experimental data suggest that local moments on Ru in RuO$_2$ are vanishingly small, indicating that the bulk material is likely non-magnetic. This observation is consistent with the delocalized nature of the 4$d$ electrons of Ru and the strong screening effect in the metallic state. In this work, we show that despite the non-magnetic bulk, the RuO$_2$(110) surface exhibits spontaneous magnetization. We attribute this effect to the breaking of local symmetry, which results in electronic redistribution and magnetic moment enhancement. The emergence of surface magnetism gives rise to interesting spectroscopic phenomena, including spin-polarized surface states, spin-polarized scanning probe microscopy images, and potentially spin-dependent transport effects. These findings highlight the important role of surface magnetic structures in the otherwise non-magnetic bulk RuO$_2$.</description>
