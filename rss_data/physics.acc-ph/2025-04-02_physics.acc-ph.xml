      <title>LEP3: A High-Luminosity e+e- Higgs and ElectroweakFactory in the LHC Tunnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As stated in the 2019 European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP), it is of the utmost importance that the HL-LHC upgrade of the accelerator and the experiments be successfully completed in a timely manner. All necessary efforts should be devoted to achieving this goal. We also recall two of the principal recommendations of the 2019 ESPP for future accelerator initiatives, namely that 1) An electron-positron Higgs factory is the highest priority for the next collider (Rec. c). 2) Europe, together with its international partners, should investigate the technical and financial feasibility of a future hadron collider at CERN with a centre-of-mass energy of at least 100 TeV and with an electron-positron Higgs and electroweak factory as a possible first stage (Rec. e). A major objective in particle physics is always to operate an accelerator that allows a leap of an order of magnitude in the constituent centre-of-mass energy with respect to the previous one. We support FCC-ee and FCC-hh as the preferred option for CERN future, as it addresses both of the above recommendations.
  The guidance for the 2025 ESPP requests, in addition to the preferred option, the inclusion of ``prioritised alternatives to be pursued if the chosen preferred option turns out not to be feasible or competitive''. Proposed alternatives to the preferred FCC option include linear, muon colliders and LHeC accelerators. In response to this request we propose reusing the existing LHC tunnel for an electron-positron collider, called LEP3, as a back-up alternative if the FCC cannot proceed. LEP3 leverages much of the R\&amp;D conducted for FCC-ee, offers high-precision studies of Z, W, and Higgs bosons below the tt threshold, and offers potential physics performance comparable or superior to other fallback options at a lower cost while supporting continued R\&amp;D towards a next-generation energy frontier machine.</description>

      <title>AWAKE Input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update on behalf of the AWAKE Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Advanced Wakefield Experiment, AWAKE, is a well-established international collaboration and aims to develop the proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration of electron bunches to energies and qualities suitable for first particle physics applications, such as strong-field QED and fixed target experiments ($\sim$50-200GeV). Numerical simulations show that these energies can be reached with an average accelerating gradient of $\sim1$GeV/m in a single proton-driven plasma wakefield stage. This is enabled by the high energy per particle and per bunch of the CERN SPS 19kJ, 400GeV and LHC ($\sim$120kJ, 7TeV) proton bunches. Bunches produced by synchrotrons are long, and AWAKE takes advantage of the self-modulation process to drive wakefields with GV/m amplitude. By the end of 2025, all physics concepts related to self-modulation will have been experimentally established as part of the AWAKE ongoing program that started in 2016. Key achievements include: direct observation of self-modulation, stabilization and control by two seeding methods, acceleration of externally injected electrons from 19MeV to more than 2GeV, and sustained high wakefield amplitudes beyond self-modulation saturation using a plasma density step. In addition to a brief summary of achievements reached so far, this document outlines the AWAKE roadmap as a demonstrator facility for producing beams with quality sufficient for first applications. The plan includes: 1) Accelerating a quality-controlled electron bunch to multi-GeV energies in a 10m plasma by 2031; 2) Demonstrating scalability to even higher energies by LS4. Synergies of the R&amp;D performed in AWAKE that are relevant for advancing plasma wakefield acceleration in general are highlighted. We argue that AWAKE and similar advanced accelerator R&amp;D be strongly supported by the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update.</description>

      <title>Design Initiative for a 10 TeV pCM Wakefield Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This document outlines a community-driven Design Study for a 10 TeV pCM Wakefield Accelerator Collider. The 2020 ESPP Report emphasized the need for Advanced Accelerator R\&amp;D, and the 2023 P5 Report calls for the ``delivery of an end-to-end design concept, including cost scales, with self-consistent parameters throughout." This Design Study leverages recent experimental and theoretical progress resulting from a global R\&amp;D program in order to deliver a unified, 10 TeV Wakefield Collider concept. Wakefield Accelerators provide ultra-high accelerating gradients which enables an upgrade path that will extend the reach of Linear Colliders beyond the electroweak scale. Here, we describe the organization of the Design Study including timeline and deliverables, and we detail the requirements and challenges on the path to a 10 TeV Wakefield Collider.</description>

      <title>Magnet R&amp;D for the Muon Collider -- European Strategy Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Muon Collider, proposed under the International Muon Collider Collaboration (IMCC), represents a groundbreaking advancement in circular collider technology. By using muons instead of protons or electrons, this collider has the potential of unprecedented discovery reach, luminosity, and compact design, significantly increasing energy efficiency, reducing environmental impact and improving sustainability. However, achieving this vision necessitates overcoming unique and extreme challenges in superconducting magnet technology. This document summarizes the state of the art, challenges, and the proposed R&amp;D roadmap for developing the next generation of superconducting magnet systems crucial for the Muon Collider over the next ten years. The goal is to advance accelerator magnet technology beyond current limits, with a special focus on High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS) materials for high-field and high-temperature applications. This note is a concise summary of the extensive proposal [BOT-2025] which we refer to for detailed referencing and as supporting material. We focus here on the technology gap to be filled by the proposed R&amp;D, the structure and objectives of the proposed R&amp;D, and provide the resource estimate for the next ten years.</description>

      <title>HTS Potential and Needs for Future Accelerator Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: HTS has the potential of a game changer for many applications of superconductivity, not last in the field of particle accelerators and detectors. This paper explores the potential of HTS, with a focus on REBCO-coated conductors, in relation to the evolving demands of superconducting magnets for accelerators. HTS already have a spectacular current carrying ability at high field, demonstrated and available on relevant lengths. Recent advances in non-conventional winding techniques for solenoids, in particular non-insulated windings, have shown that it is possible to reach engineering current densities in the coil exceeding by far those of LTS . This approach seems to offer an extended field reach, as well as solutions to the challenges associated with magnet mechanics, quench management and cost. Most important, beyond the ability to reach a field range higher than what is possible with LTS, HTS offers an extended range of operating temperature, with large margin. This can be exploited to obtain higher availability and better cryogenic efficiency, a must for the future of sustainable large scale research infrastructures such as particle accelerators.</description>
