      <title>Reliable Programmatic Weak Supervision with Confidence Intervals for Label Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate labeling of datasets is often both costly and time-consuming. Given an unlabeled dataset, programmatic weak supervision obtains probabilistic predictions for the labels by leveraging multiple weak labeling functions (LFs) that provide rough guesses for labels. Weak LFs commonly provide guesses with assorted types and unknown interdependences that can result in unreliable predictions. Furthermore, existing techniques for programmatic weak supervision cannot provide assessments for the reliability of the probabilistic predictions for labels. This paper presents a methodology for programmatic weak supervision that can provide confidence intervals for label probabilities and obtain more reliable predictions. In particular, the methods proposed use uncertainty sets of distributions that encapsulate the information provided by LFs with unrestricted behavior and typology. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show the improvement of the presented methods over the state-of-the-art and the practicality of the confidence intervals presented.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning in MDPs with Information-Ordered Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an epoch-based reinforcement learning algorithm for infinite-horizon average-cost Markov decision processes (MDPs) that leverages a partial order over a policy class. In this structure, $\pi' \leq \pi$ if data collected under $\pi$ can be used to estimate the performance of $\pi'$, enabling counterfactual inference without additional environment interaction. Leveraging this partial order, we show that our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{w \log(|\Theta|) T})$, where $w$ is the width of the partial order. Notably, the bound is independent of the state and action space sizes. We illustrate the applicability of these partial orders in many domains in operations research, including inventory control and queuing systems. For each, we apply our framework to that problem, yielding new theoretical guarantees and strong empirical results without imposing extra assumptions such as convexity in the inventory model or specialized arrival-rate structure in the queuing model.</description>

      <title>Negative binomial regression and inference using a pre-trained transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative binomial regression is essential for analyzing over-dispersed count data in in comparative studies, but parameter estimation becomes computationally challenging in large screens requiring millions of comparisons. We investigate using a pre-trained transformer to produce estimates of negative binomial regression parameters from observed count data, trained through synthetic data generation to learn to invert the process of generating counts from parameters. The transformer method achieved better parameter accuracy than maximum likelihood optimization while being 20 times faster. However, comparisons unexpectedly revealed that method of moment estimates performed as well as maximum likelihood optimization in accuracy, while being 1,000 times faster and producing better-calibrated and more powerful tests, making it the most efficient solution for this application.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Network-Driven Adaptive Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a deep neural network (DNN)-driven framework to address the longstanding generalization challenge in adaptive filtering (AF). In contrast to traditional AF frameworks that emphasize explicit cost function design, the proposed framework shifts the paradigm toward direct gradient acquisition. The DNN, functioning as a universal nonlinear operator, is structurally embedded into the core architecture of the AF system, establishing a direct mapping between filtering residuals and learning gradients. The maximum likelihood is adopted as the implicit cost function, rendering the derived algorithm inherently data-driven and thus endowed with exemplary generalization capability, which is validated by extensive numerical experiments across a spectrum of non-Gaussian scenarios. Corresponding mean value and mean square stability analyses are also conducted in detail.</description>

      <title>The Relative Instability of Model Comparison with Cross-validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing work has shown that cross-validation (CV) can be used to provide an asymptotic confidence interval for the test error of a stable machine learning algorithm, and existing stability results for many popular algorithms can be applied to derive positive instances where such confidence intervals will be valid. However, in the common setting where CV is used to compare two algorithms, it becomes necessary to consider a notion of relative stability which cannot easily be derived from existing stability results, even for simple algorithms. To better understand relative stability and when CV provides valid confidence intervals for the test error difference of two algorithms, we study the soft-thresholded least squares algorithm, a close cousin of the Lasso. We prove that while stability holds when assessing the individual test error of this algorithm, relative stability fails to hold when comparing the test error of two such algorithms, even in a sparse low-dimensional linear model setting. Additionally, we empirically confirm the invalidity of CV confidence intervals for the test error difference when either soft-thresholding or the Lasso is used. In short, caution is needed when quantifying the uncertainty of CV estimates of the performance difference of two machine learning algorithms, even when both algorithms are individually stable.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Uncertainty and its Disentanglement in multi-label Chest X-Ray Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for trustworthy decision-making and the deployment of AI models in medical imaging. While prior work has explored the ability of neural networks to quantify predictive, epistemic, and aleatoric uncertainties using an information-theoretical approach in synthetic or well defined data settings like natural image classification, its applicability to real life medical diagnosis tasks remains underexplored. In this study, we provide an extensive uncertainty quantification benchmark for multi-label chest X-ray classification using the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset. We evaluate 13 uncertainty quantification methods for convolutional (ResNet) and transformer-based (Vision Transformer) architectures across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, we extend Evidential Deep Learning, HetClass NNs, and Deep Deterministic Uncertainty to the multi-label setting. Our analysis provides insights into uncertainty estimation effectiveness and the ability to disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, revealing method- and architecture-specific strengths and limitations.</description>

      <title>Metric Learning in an RKHS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metric learning from a set of triplet comparisons in the form of "Do you think item h is more similar to item i or item j?", indicating similarity and differences between items, plays a key role in various applications including image retrieval, recommendation systems, and cognitive psychology. The goal is to learn a metric in the RKHS that reflects the comparisons. Nonlinear metric learning using kernel methods and neural networks have shown great empirical promise. While previous works have addressed certain aspects of this problem, there is little or no theoretical understanding of such methods. The exception is the special (linear) case in which the RKHS is the standard Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$; there is a comprehensive theory for metric learning in $\mathbb{R}^d$. This paper develops a general RKHS framework for metric learning and provides novel generalization guarantees and sample complexity bounds. We validate our findings through a set of simulations and experiments on real datasets. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/RamyaLab/metric-learning-RKHS.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI Methods for Neuroimaging: Systematic Failures of Common Tools, the Need for Domain-Specific Validation, and a Proposal for Safe Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trustworthy interpretation of deep learning models is critical for neuroimaging applications, yet commonly used Explainable AI (XAI) methods lack rigorous validation, risking misinterpretation. We performed the first large-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain MRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes verifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal sources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical lesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals systematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM consistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance Propagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest incompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate that these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design principles tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for neuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad, which makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently accurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this domain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation and validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior neuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and provide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.</description>

      <title>Two-sample comparison through additive tree models for density ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ratio of two densities characterizes their differences. We consider learning the density ratio given i.i.d. observations from each of the two distributions. We propose additive tree models for the density ratio along with efficient algorithms for training these models using a new loss function called the balancing loss. With this loss, additive tree models for the density ratio can be trained using algorithms original designed for supervised learning. Specifically, they can be trained from both an optimization perspective that parallels tree boosting and from a (generalized) Bayesian perspective that parallels Bayesian additive regression trees (BART). For the former, we present two boosting algorithms -- one based on forward-stagewise fitting and the other based on gradient boosting, both of which produce a point estimate for the density ratio function. For the latter, we show that due to the loss function's resemblance to an exponential family kernel, the new loss can serve as a pseudo-likelihood for which conjugate priors exist, thereby enabling effective generalized Bayesian inference on the density ratio using backfitting samplers designed for BART. The resulting uncertainty quantification on the inferred density ratio is critical for applications involving high-dimensional and complex distributions in which uncertainty given limited data can often be substantial. We provide insights on the balancing loss through its close connection to the exponential loss in binary classification and to the variational form of f-divergence, in particular that of the squared Hellinger distance. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach while providing unique capabilities in uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate the application of our method in a case study involving assessing the quality of generative models for microbiome compositional data.</description>

      <title>Scalable Neural Network-based Blackbox Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a widely used approach for blackbox optimization that leverages a Gaussian process (GP) model and an acquisition function to guide future sampling. While effective in low-dimensional settings, BO faces scalability challenges in high-dimensional spaces and with large number of function evaluations due to the computational complexity of GP models. In contrast, neural networks (NNs) offer better scalability and can model complex functions, which led to the development of NN-based BO approaches. However, these methods typically rely on estimating model uncertainty in NN prediction -- a process that is often computationally intensive and complex, particularly in high dimensions. To address these limitations, a novel method, called scalable neural network-based blackbox optimization (SNBO), is proposed that does not rely on model uncertainty estimation. Specifically, SNBO adds new samples using separate criteria for exploration and exploitation, while adaptively controlling the sampling region to ensure efficient optimization. SNBO is evaluated on a range of optimization problems spanning from 10 to 102 dimensions and compared against four state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. Across the majority of test problems, SNBO attains function values better than the best-performing baseline algorithm, while requiring 40-60% fewer function evaluations and reducing the runtime by at least an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>DP-NCB: Privacy Preserving Fair Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-armed bandit algorithms are fundamental tools for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, with widespread applications across domains such as clinical trials and personalized decision-making. As bandit algorithms are increasingly deployed in these socially sensitive settings, it becomes critical to protect user data privacy and ensure fair treatment across decision rounds. While prior work has independently addressed privacy and fairness in bandit settings, the question of whether both objectives can be achieved simultaneously has remained largely open. Existing privacy-preserving bandit algorithms typically optimize average regret, a utilitarian measure, whereas fairness-aware approaches focus on minimizing Nash regret, which penalizes inequitable reward distributions, but often disregard privacy concerns.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce Differentially Private Nash Confidence Bound (DP-NCB)-a novel and unified algorithmic framework that simultaneously ensures $\epsilon$-differential privacy and achieves order-optimal Nash regret, matching known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. The framework is sufficiently general to operate under both global and local differential privacy models, and is anytime, requiring no prior knowledge of the time horizon. We support our theoretical guarantees with simulations on synthetic bandit instances, showing that DP-NCB incurs substantially lower Nash regret than state-of-the-art baselines. Our results offer a principled foundation for designing bandit algorithms that are both privacy-preserving and fair, making them suitable for high-stakes, socially impactful applications.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a class of algebraic varieties naturally associated with ReLU neural networks, arising from the piecewise linear structure of their outputs across activation regions in input space, and the piecewise multilinear structure in parameter space. By analyzing the rank constraints on the network outputs within each activation region, we derive polynomial equations that characterize the functions representable by the network. We further investigate conditions under which these varieties attain their expected dimension, providing insight into the expressive and structural properties of ReLU networks.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Explanations of Distance-Based Classifiers by Uncovering Latent Explanatory Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distance-based classifiers, such as k-nearest neighbors and support vector machines, continue to be a workhorse of machine learning, widely used in science and industry. In practice, to derive insights from these models, it is also important to ensure that their predictions are explainable. While the field of Explainable AI has supplied methods that are in principle applicable to any model, it has also emphasized the usefulness of latent structures (e.g. the sequence of layers in a neural network) to produce explanations. In this paper, we contribute by uncovering a hidden neural network structure in distance-based classifiers (consisting of linear detection units combined with nonlinear pooling layers) upon which Explainable AI techniques such as layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) become applicable. Through quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate the advantage of our novel explanation approach over several baselines. We also show the overall usefulness of explaining distance-based models through two practical use cases.</description>

      <title>FairPOT: Balancing AUC Performance and Fairness with Proportional Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness metrics utilizing the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) have gained increasing attention in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. In these domains, fairness is often evaluated over risk scores rather than binary outcomes, and a common challenge is that enforcing strict fairness can significantly degrade AUC performance. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Proportional Optimal Transport (FairPOT), a novel, model-agnostic post-processing framework that strategically aligns risk score distributions across different groups using optimal transport, but does so selectively by transforming a controllable proportion, i.e., the top-lambda quantile, of scores within the disadvantaged group. By varying lambda, our method allows for a tunable trade-off between reducing AUC disparities and maintaining overall AUC performance. Furthermore, we extend FairPOT to the partial AUC setting, enabling fairness interventions to concentrate on the highest-risk regions. Extensive experiments on synthetic, public, and clinical datasets show that FairPOT consistently outperforms existing post-processing techniques in both global and partial AUC scenarios, often achieving improved fairness with slight AUC degradation or even positive gains in utility. The computational efficiency and practical adaptability of FairPOT make it a promising solution for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Generative Flexible Latent Structure Regression (GFLSR) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent structure methods, specifically linear continuous latent structure methods, are a type of fundamental statistical learning strategy. They are widely used for dimension reduction, regression and prediction, in the fields of chemometrics, economics, social science and etc. However, due to the lack of model inference, generative form, and unidentifiable parameters, most of these methods are always used as an algorithm, instead of a model. This paper proposed a Generative Flexible Latent Structure Regression (GFLSR) model structure to address this problem. Moreover, we show that most linear continuous latent variable methods can be represented under the proposed framework. The recursive structure allows potential model inference and residual analysis. Then, the traditional Partial Least Squares (PLS) is focused; we show that the PLS can be specialised in the proposed model structure, named Generative-PLS. With a model structure, we analyse the convergence of the parameters and the latent variables. Under additional distribution assumptions, we show that the proposed model structure can lead to model inference without solving the probabilistic model. Additionally, we proposed a novel bootstrap algorithm that enables uncertainty on parameters and on prediction for new datasets. A simulation study and a Real-world dataset are used to verify the proposed Generative-PLS model structure. Although the traditional PLS is a special case, this proposed GFLSRM structure leads to a potential inference structure for all the linear continuous latent variable methods.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose new randomized algorithms for estimating the two-to-infinity and one-to-two norms in a matrix-free setting, using only matrix-vector multiplications. Our methods are based on appropriate modifications of Hutchinson's diagonal estimator and its Hutch++ version. We provide oracle complexity bounds for both modifications. We further illustrate the practical utility of our algorithms for Jacobian-based regularization in deep neural network training on image classification tasks. We also demonstrate that our methodology can be applied to mitigate the effect of adversarial attacks in the domain of recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Learning via Moderate Deviations Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14496v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a statistically optimal approach for learning a function value using a confidence interval in a wide range of models, including general non-parametric estimation of an expected loss described as a stochastic programming problem or various SDE models. More precisely, we develop a systematic construction of highly accurate confidence intervals by using a moderate deviation principle-based approach. It is shown that the proposed confidence intervals are statistically optimal in the sense that they satisfy criteria regarding exponential accuracy, minimality, consistency, mischaracterization probability, and eventual uniformly most accurate (UMA) property. The confidence intervals suggested by this approach are expressed as solutions to robust optimization problems, where the uncertainty is expressed via the underlying moderate deviation rate function induced by the data-generating process. We demonstrate that for many models these optimization problems admit tractable reformulations as finite convex programs even when they are infinite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Thompson Exploration with Best Challenger Rule in Best Arm Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the fixed-confidence best arm identification (BAI) problem in the bandit framework in the canonical single-parameter exponential models. For this problem, many policies have been proposed, but most of them require solving an optimization problem at every round and/or are forced to explore an arm at least a certain number of times except those restricted to the Gaussian model. To address these limitations, we propose a novel policy that combines Thompson sampling with a computationally efficient approach known as the best challenger rule. While Thompson sampling was originally considered for maximizing the cumulative reward, we demonstrate that it can be used to naturally explore arms in BAI without forcing it. We show that our policy is asymptotically optimal for any two-armed bandit problems and achieves near optimality for general $K$-armed bandit problems for $K\geq 3$. Nevertheless, in numerical experiments, our policy shows competitive performance compared to asymptotically optimal policies in terms of sample complexity while requiring less computation cost. In addition, we highlight the advantages of our policy by comparing it to the concept of $\beta$-optimality, a relaxed notion of asymptotic optimality commonly considered in the analysis of a class of policies including the proposed one.</description>

      <title>Generating Accurate Synthetic Survival Data by Conditioning on Outcomes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetically generated data can improve privacy, fairness, and data accessibility; however, it can be challenging in specialized scenarios such as survival analysis. One key challenge in this setting is censoring, i.e., the timing of an event is unknown in some cases. Existing methods struggle to accurately reproduce the distributions of both observed and censored event times when generating synthetic data. We propose a conceptually simple approach that generates covariates conditioned on event times and censoring indicators by leveraging existing tabular data generation models without making assumptions about the mechanism underlying censoring. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and improves downstream survival model performance.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Consistent Nonparametric Linkage-Based Clustering of Data Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13922v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonparametric clustering of $M$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data sequences generated from {\em unknown} distributions. The distributions of the $M$ data sequences belong to $K$ underlying distribution clusters. Existing results on exponentially consistent nonparametric clustering algorithms, like single linkage-based (SLINK) clustering and $k$-medoids distribution clustering, assume that the maximum intra-cluster distance ($d_L$) is smaller than the minimum inter-cluster distance ($d_H$). First, in the fixed sample size (FSS) setting, we show that exponential consistency can be achieved for SLINK clustering under a less strict assumption, $d_I &lt; d_H$, where $d_I$ is the maximum distance between any two sub-clusters of a cluster that partition the cluster. Note that $d_I &lt; d_L$ in general. Thus, our results show that SLINK is exponentially consistent for a larger class of problems than previously known. In our simulations, we also identify examples where $k$-medoids clustering is unable to find the true clusters, but SLINK is exponentially consistent. Then, we propose a sequential clustering algorithm, named SLINK-SEQ, based on SLINK and prove that it is also exponentially consistent. Simulation results show that the SLINK-SEQ algorithm requires fewer expected number of samples than the FSS SLINK algorithm for the same probability of error.</description>

      <title>Deep Discrete Encoders: Identifiable Deep Generative Models for Rich Data with Discrete Latent Layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of generative AI, deep generative models (DGMs) with latent representations have gained tremendous popularity. Despite their impressive empirical performance, the statistical properties of these models remain underexplored. DGMs are often overparametrized, non-identifiable, and uninterpretable black boxes, raising serious concerns when deploying them in high-stakes applications. Motivated by this, we propose interpretable deep generative models for rich data types with discrete latent layers, called Deep Discrete Encoders (DDEs). A DDE is a directed graphical model with multiple binary latent layers. Theoretically, we propose transparent identifiability conditions for DDEs, which imply progressively smaller sizes of the latent layers as they go deeper. Identifiability ensures consistent parameter estimation and inspires an interpretable design of the deep architecture. Computationally, we propose a scalable estimation pipeline of a layerwise nonlinear spectral initialization followed by a penalized stochastic approximation EM algorithm. This procedure can efficiently estimate models with exponentially many latent components. Extensive simulation studies for high-dimensional data and deep architectures validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the excellent performance of our algorithms. We apply DDEs to three diverse real datasets with different data types to perform hierarchical topic modeling, image representation learning, and response time modeling in educational testing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the advent of the ``Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE)'' paper, learning ODEs with deep learning has been applied to system identification, time-series forecasting, and related areas. Exploiting the diffeomorphic nature of ODE solution maps, neural ODEs has also enabled their use in generative modeling. Despite the rich potential to incorporate various kinds of physical information, training Neural ODEs remains challenging in practice. This study demonstrates, through the simplest one-dimensional linear model, why training Neural ODEs is difficult. We then propose a new stabilization method and provide an analytical convergence analysis. The insights and techniques presented here serve as a concise tutorial for researchers beginning work on Neural ODEs.</description>

      <title>On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06382v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes a fundamental impossibility theorem: no LLM capable performing non-trivial knowledge aggregation can simultaneously achieve truthful (internally consistent) knowledge representation, semantic information conservation, complete revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality. This impossibility is not an engineering limitation but arises from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself. We establish this result by describing the inference process as an auction of ideas, where distributed components compete exploiting their partial knowledge to shape responses. The proof spans three independent mathematical domains: mechanism design theory (Green-Laffont), the theory of proper scoring rules (Savage), and direct architectural analysis of transformers (Log-Sum-Exp convexity). In particular, we show how in the strictly concave settings the score of an aggregate of diverse beliefs strictly exceeds the sum of individual scores. That gap may quantify the creation of unattributable certainty or overconfidence -- the mathematical origin of both hallucination and creativity, or imagination.
  To support this analysis, we introduce the complementary concepts of the semantic information measure and the emergence operator to model bounded reasoning in a general setting. We prove that while bounded reasoning generates accessible information, providing valuable insights and inspirations, idealized reasoning strictly preserves semantic content. By demonstrating that hallucination and imagination are mathematically identical phenomena-grounded in the necessary violation of information conservation-this paper offers a principled foundation for managing these behaviors in advanced AI systems. Finally, we present some speculative ideas to inspire evaluation and refinements of the proposed theory.</description>

      <title>Supervised Dynamic Dimension Reduction with Deep Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of dimension reduction, tailored to improving time series forecasting with high-dimensional predictors. We propose a novel Supervised Deep Dynamic Principal component analysis (SDDP) framework that incorporates the target variable and lagged observations into the factor extraction process. Assisted by a temporal neural network, we construct target-aware predictors by scaling the original predictors in a supervised manner, with larger weights assigned to predictors with stronger forecasting power. A principal component analysis is then performed on the target-aware predictors to extract the estimated SDDP factors. This supervised factor extraction not only improves predictive accuracy in the downstream forecasting task but also yields more interpretable and target-specific latent factors. Building upon SDDP, we propose a factor-augmented nonlinear dynamic forecasting model that unifies a broad family of factor-model-based forecasting approaches. To further demonstrate the broader applicability of SDDP, we extend our studies to a more challenging scenario when the predictors are only partially observable. We validate the empirical performance of the proposed method on several real-world public datasets. The results show that our algorithm achieves notable improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

Abstract: We consider the nonconvex optimization problem associated with the decomposition of a real symmetric tensor into a sum of rank-one terms. Use is made of the rich symmetry structure to construct infinite families of critical points represented by Puiseux series in the problem dimension, and so obtain precise analytic estimates on the objective function value and the Hessian spectrum. The results enable an analytic characterization of various obstructions to local optimization methods, revealing, in particular, a complex array of saddles and minima that differ in their symmetry, structure, and analytic properties. A notable phenomenon, observed for all critical points considered, concerns the index of the Hessian increasing with the objective function value.</description>

Abstract: Many modern deep learning applications require balancing multiple objectives that are often conflicting. Examples include multi-task learning, fairness-aware learning, and the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). This leads to multi-objective deep learning, which tries to find optimal trade-offs or Pareto-optimal solutions by adapting mathematical principles from the field of Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO). However, directly applying gradient-based MOO techniques to deep neural networks presents unique challenges, including high computational costs, optimization instability, and the difficulty of effectively incorporating user preferences. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of gradient-based techniques for multi-objective deep learning. We systematically categorize existing algorithms based on their outputs: (i) methods that find a single, well-balanced solution, (ii) methods that generate a finite set of diverse Pareto-optimal solutions, and (iii) methods that learn a continuous Pareto set of solutions. In addition to this taxonomy, the survey covers theoretical analyses, key applications, practical resources, and highlights open challenges and promising directions for future research. A comprehensive list of multi-objective deep learning algorithms is available at https://github.com/Baijiong-Lin/Awesome-Multi-Objective-Deep-Learning.</description>

      <title>Approximation Rates in Besov Norms and Sample-Complexity of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Residual Connections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold superposition theorem, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as an improved backbone for most deep learning frameworks, promising more adaptivity than their multilayer perceptron (MLP) predecessor by allowing for trainable spline-based activation functions. In this paper, we probe the theoretical foundations of the KAN architecture by showing that it can optimally approximate any Besov function in $B^{s}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$ on a bounded open, or even fractal, domain $\mathcal{X}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ at the optimal approximation rate with respect to any weaker Besov norm $B^{\alpha}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$; where $\alpha &lt; s$. We complement our approximation result with a statistical guarantee by bounding the pseudodimension of the relevant class of Res-KANs. As an application of the latter, we directly deduce a dimension-free estimate on the sample complexity of a residual KAN model when learning a function of Besov regularity from $N$ i.i.d. noiseless samples, showing that KANs can learn the smooth maps which they can approximate.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Traffic Flow Modeling: a Multi-Gradient Descent and Pareto Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is crucial in modern traffic flow modeling because it combines the benefits of both physics-based and data-driven approaches. In conventional PIML, physical information is typically incorporated by constructing a hybrid loss function that combines data-driven loss and physics loss through linear scalarization. The goal is to find a trade-off between these two objectives to improve the accuracy of model predictions. However, from a mathematical perspective, linear scalarization is limited to identifying only the convex region of the Pareto front, as it treats data-driven and physics losses as separate objectives. Given that most PIML loss functions are non-convex, linear scalarization restricts the achievable trade-off solutions. Moreover, tuning the weighting coefficients for the two loss components can be both time-consuming and computationally challenging. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a paradigm shift in PIML by reformulating the training process as a multi-objective optimization problem, treating data-driven loss and physics loss independently. We apply several multi-gradient descent algorithms (MGDAs), including traditional multi-gradient descent (TMGD) and dual cone gradient descent (DCGD), to explore the Pareto front in this multi-objective setting. These methods are evaluated on both macroscopic and microscopic traffic flow models. In the macroscopic case, MGDAs achieved comparable performance to traditional linear scalarization methods. Notably, in the microscopic case, MGDAs significantly outperformed their scalarization-based counterparts, demonstrating the advantages of a multi-objective optimization approach in complex PIML scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in time series forecasting, accurate modeling of time series with strong heterogeneity in magnitude and/or sparsity patterns remains challenging for state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. We identify several factors that lead existing models to systematically underperform on low-magnitude and sparse time series, including loss functions with implicit biases toward high-magnitude series, training-time sampling methods, and limitations of time series encoding methods.
  SPADE-S is a robust forecasting architecture that significantly reduces magnitude- and sparsity-based systematic biases and improves overall prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that SPADE-S outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across a diverse set of use cases in demand forecasting. In particular, we show that, depending on the quantile forecast and magnitude of the series, SPADE-S can improve forecast accuracy by up to 15%. This results in P90 overall forecast accuracy gains of 2.21%, 6.58%, and 4.28%, and P50 forecast accuracy gains of 0.92%, 0.77%, and 1.95%, respectively, for each of three distinct datasets, ranging from 3 million to 700 million series, from a large online retailer.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Encodings for Active Feature Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01957</link>

Abstract: Active Feature Acquisition is an instance-wise, sequential decision making problem. The aim is to dynamically select which feature to measure based on current observations, independently for each test instance. Common approaches either use Reinforcement Learning, which experiences training difficulties, or greedily maximize the conditional mutual information of the label and unobserved features, which makes myopic acquisitions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a latent variable model, trained in a supervised manner. Acquisitions are made by reasoning about the features across many possible unobserved realizations in a stochastic latent space. Extensive evaluation on a large range of synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that our approach reliably outperforms a diverse set of baselines.</description>

      <title>Streaming Generated Gaussian Process Experts for Online Learning and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time settings. In this paper, we propose a streaming kernel-induced progressively generated expert framework of Gaussian processes (SkyGP) that addresses both computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts, while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>
