      <title>Predicting the future with magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting complex, chaotic signals is a central challenge across science and technology, with implications ranging from secure communications to climate modeling. Here we demonstrate that magnons - the collective spin excitations in magnetically ordered materials - can serve as an efficient physical reservoir for predicting such dynamics. Using a magnetic microdisk in the vortex state as a magnon-scattering reservoir, we show that intrinsic nonlinear interactions transform a simple microwave input into a high-dimensional spectral output suitable for reservoir computing, in particular, for time series predictions. Trained on the Mackey-Glass benchmark, which generates a cyclic yet aperiodic time series widely used to test machine-learning models, the system achieves accurate and reliable predictions that rival state-of-the-art physical reservoirs. We further identify key design principles: spectral resolution governs the trade-off between dimensionality and accuracy, while combining multiple device geometries systematically improves performance. These results establish magnonics as a promising platform for unconventional computing, offering a path toward scalable and CMOS-compatible hardware for real-time prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Effects in a Molecular Quantum NAND Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecules provide the smallest possible circuits in which quantum interference and electron correlation can be engineered to perform logical operations, including the universal NAND gate. We investigate a chemically encoded quantum NAND tree based on alkynyl-extended iso-polyacetylene backbones, where inputs are set by end-group substitution and outputs are read from the presence or absence of transmission nodes. Using quantum many-body transport theory, we show that NAND behavior persists in the presence of dynamic correlations, but that the nodal positions and their chemical shifts depend sensitively on electron-electron interactions. This sensitivity highlights the potential of these systems not only to probe the strength of electronic correlations but also to harness them in shaping logical response. The thermopower is identified as a chemically robust readout of gate logic, providing discrimination margins that greatly exceed typical experimental uncertainties, in an observable governed primarily by the variation of transport rather than its absolute magnitude.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Optical Response in Pseudo-Hermitian Systems at Steady State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a steady-state theory for nonlinear optical conductivity in pseudo-Hermitian systems. We derive compact formulas for the first and second order conductivity tensors in both the velocity and length gauges and prove their exact equivalence through generalized sum rules and Berry connection identities by formulating the nonlinear response in terms of a biorthogonal density matrix. Utilizing the formalism on parity-time symmetric two-level systems reveals nonlinear phenomena that are not present in Hermitian systems, such as extra terms in the conductivity, corrections to the velocity operator, photocurrent, and resonance structures with higher-order poles at one-photon transitions. These features yield qualitatively distinct harmonic generation responses like real second-order conductivities and nonzero DC limits. These results provide new insights into nonlinear light-matter interactions in active media characterized by balanced gain and loss, with implications for non-Hermitian photonics, dissipative topological systems, and quantum devices designed with engineered dissipation.</description>

      <title>Interband optical conductivity in two-dimensional semi-Dirac bands tilting along the quadratic dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) semi-Dirac materials feature a unique anisotropic band structure characterized by quadratic dispersion along one spatial direction and linear dispersion along the other, effectively hybridizing ordinary and Dirac fermions. The anisotropy of energy dispersion can be further modulated through band tilting along either spatial direction of the wave vector. We propose a new definition of tilt parameter to characterize Lifshitz phases in 2D semi-Dirac bands tilting along the quadratically dispersing direction. Using linear response theory, we theoretically investigate the interband optical conductivity of 2D tilted semi-Dirac bands. Our analytical zero-temperature results reveal pronounced distinctions from Dirac and semi-Dirac systems tilting along the linearly dispersing direction. Notably, we find that spectral fixed point emerges in the optical conductivity over a specific range of the tilt parameter, a phenomenon explained by the corresponding behavior of the joint density of states. These findings provide a robust theoretical framework for identifying and characterizing 2D tilted semi-Dirac materials and establish clear spectral fingerprints that distinguish different kinds of 2D semi-Dirac bands and Dirac bands. Our predictions can guide future experimental studies of anisotropic band engineering and tilt-dependent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic ultrafast edge photocurrent dynamics in WTe$_2$ driven by broken crystal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directional photocurrents in two-dimensional materials arise from broken crystal symmetry, offering pathways to high-speed, bias-free photodetection beyond conventional devices. Tungsten ditelluride (WTe$_2$), a type-II Weyl semimetal, exhibits robust symmetry-breaking-induced edge photocurrents from competing nonlinear optical and photothermoelectric (PTE) mechanisms, whose intrinsic dynamics have remained experimentally inaccessible. Here, we directly resolve sub-picosecond edge photocurrent dynamics in WTe$_2$ through ohmic contacts over temperatures from 300 K to 4 K. We demonstrate ultrafast optical-to-electrical conversion with a 3 dB bandwidth of $\sim$250 GHz and reveal picosecond-timescale switching of the net photocurrent direction below 150 K, linked to a Lifshitz transition. This transient bipolar response arises from non-equilibrium Seebeck effects due to asymmetric cooling of hot electrons and holes. These findings reveal previously hidden ultrafast dynamics in symmetry-engineered materials, offering new strategies to disentangle competing photocurrent mechanisms and enabling the development of self-powered, ultrafast optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Signatures of broken symmetries in the excitations of a periodic 2DEG coupled to a cylindrical photon cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a periodic lateral superlattice subjected to an external homogeneous magnetic field and in a cylindrical far-infrared photon cavity we search for effects of broken symmetries: Static ones, stemming from the unit cell of the system, and the external magnetic field together with the dynamic ones caused by the vector potential of the cavity promoting magnetic types of transitions, and the chirality of the excitation pulse. The Coulomb interaction of the electrons is described within density functional theory, but the electron-photon interactions are handled by a configuration interaction formalism within each step of the density functional approach, both for the static and the dynamic system. In the dynamical calculations we observe weak chiral effects that change character as the strength of the electron-photon interaction and the external magnetic field are increased. From the analysis of the chiral effects we identify an important connection of the para- and diamagnetic electron-photon interactions that promotes the diamagnetic interaction in the present system when the interaction strength is increased. Furthermore, the asymmetric potential in the unit cell of the square array activates collective oscillation modes that are not present in the system when the unit cell has a higher symmetry.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-Field-Induced Geometric Response of Mean-Field Projectors: Streda Formula and Orbital Magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the magnetic-field response of interacting electron systems within mean-field theory using perturbation theory. We show that the linear response of the mean-field density-matrix to a weak magnetic field is purely geometric: it depends only on wavefunction derivatives, the Berry connections linking the occupied and unoccupied subspaces, and is independent of the interaction potential and the quasiparticle dispersion. This leads to compact, gauge-invariant projector expressions for both the St\v{r}eda formula and the formula for orbital magnetization. Our calculation explicitly elucidates the role of exchange and self-consistency in defining current vertices for orbital magnetization calculations. Our work establishes a direct connection between mean-field theory, quantum geometry and the non-interacting topological band theory.</description>

      <title>Thermal gradient-driven skyrmion dynamics with near-zero skyrmion Hall angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal gradient driven skyrmion dynamics offers a promising route toward green spintronics, enabling the utilization of waste heat for information transport and processing. Using micromagnetic simulations, we investigate Neel skyrmions in a Co-Pt bilayer nanoracetrack and demonstrate that stochastic torques induced by a thermal gradient drive skyrmion motion toward the hotter region with a nearly vanishing Hall angle. The dynamics depends sensitively on intrinsic material parameters - the skyrmion velocity decreases with increasing damping constant, increases with stronger thermal gradients, and varies systematically with saturation magnetization, interfacial DMI strength, and uniaxial out of plane anisotropy. Importantly, we identify a specific range of material parameters within which the skyrmion velocity changes sharply while the Hall angle remains strongly suppressed, saturating near zero. This comprehensive parameter-dependent study establishes a universal design framework for minimizing the Hall effect in thermal gradient driven spintronic systems.</description>

      <title>Noninteracting tight-binding models for Fock parafermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By mapping itinerant spin-$1/2$ fermions to four-state Fock parafermions, we construct noninteracting tight-binding models for Fock parafermions in one dimension. They have single-particle real energy spectra consisting of a sum of single-particle energy levels each multiplied by a parafermionic occupation number. The single-particle levels may be determined by diagonalizing a square matrix whose order scales linearly with system size. These levels are the same as those of noninteracting fermionic models, as we show explicitly for the Rice-Mele model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We show that the thermodynamic distribution function for the occupation numbers of noninteracting four-state parafermions is consistent with the mapping to spin-$1/2$ fermions. We apply the mapping to create a parafermionic counterpart of the Kitaev superconducting chain and show that the ground state in the topological phase is fourfold degenerate, with each ground state distinguished by the fourfold parafermionic occupation numbers of Majorana edge modes.</description>

      <title>Topology of the generalized Brillouin zone of one-dimensional models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Brillouin zones (GBZs) are integral in the analysis of non-Hermitian band structures. Conventional wisdom suggests that the GBZ should be connected, where each point can be indexed by the real part of the wavevector, similar to the Brillouin zone. Here we demonstrate rich topological features of the GBZs in generic non-Hermitian one-dimensional models. We prove and discuss a set of sufficient conditions for the model to ensure the connectivity of its GBZ. In addition, we show that the GBZ can become disconnected and have more connected components than the number of bands, which results from the point-gap features of the band structure. This novel GBZ topology is applied to further demonstrate a counterintuitive effect, where the line gap of an open-boundary spectrum with sublattice symmetry may be closed without changing its point-gap topology. Our results challenge the current understanding of bands and gaps in non-Hermitian systems and highlight the need to further investigate the topological effects associated with the GBZ including topological invariants and open-boundary braiding.</description>

      <title>Beyond the non-Hermitian skin effect: scaling-controlled topology from Exceptional-Bound Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a novel mechanism for topological transitions in non-Hermitian systems that are controlled by the system size. Based on a new paradigm known as exceptional-bound (EB) band engineering, its mechanism hinges on the unique critical scaling behavior near an exceptional point, totally unrelated to the well-known non-Hermitian skin effect. Through a series of ansatz models, we analytically derive and numerically demonstrate how topological transitions depend on the system size with increasingly sophisticated topological phase boundaries. Our approach can be generically applied to design scaling-dependent bands in multi-dimensional lattices, gapped or gapless, challenging established critical and entanglement behavior. It can be experimentally demonstrated in any non-Hermitian platform with versatile couplings or multi-orbital unit cells, such as photonic crystals, as well as classical and quantum circuits. The identification of this new EB band mechanism provides new design principles for engineering band structures through scaling-dependent phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Entangling remote qubits through a two-mode squeezed reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of entanglement across distant qubits is a central challenge for the operation of scalable quantum computers and large-scale quantum networks. Existing approaches rely on deterministic state transfer schemes or probabilistic protocols that require active control or measurement and postselection. Here we demonstrate an alternative, fully autonomous process, where two remote qubits are entangled through their coupling to a quantum-correlated photonic reservoir. In our experiment, a Josephson parametric converter produces a Gaussian, continuous-variable entangled state of propagating microwave fields that drives two spatially separated superconducting transmon qubits into a stationary, discrete-variable entangled state. Beyond entanglement distribution, we also show that superconducting qubits can be used to directly certify two-mode squeezing, with higher sensitivity and without the need for calibrated noise-subtraction. These results establish networks of qubits interfaced with distributed continuous-variable entangled states as a powerful new platform for both foundational studies and quantum-technology relevant applications.</description>

      <title>Electrical readout of spins in the absence of spin blockade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In semiconductor nanostructures, spin blockade (SB) is the most scalable mechanism for electrical spin readout, requiring only two bound spins for its implementation. In conjunction with charge sensing techniques, SB has led to high-fidelity readout of spins in semiconductor-based quantum processors. However, various mechanisms may lift SB, such as strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or low-lying excited states, hence posing challenges to perform spin readout at scale and with high fidelity in such systems. Here, we present a method, based on the dependence of the two-spin system polarizability on energy detuning, to perform spin state readout even when SB lifting mechanisms are dominant. It leverages SB lifting as a resource to detect selectively different spin measurement outcomes. We demonstrate the method using a hybrid system formed by a quantum dot (QD) and a Boron acceptor in a silicon p-type transistor and show spin-selective readout of different spin states under SB lifting conditions due to (i) SOC and (ii) low-lying orbital states in the QD. We further use the method to determine the detuning-dependent spin relaxation time of 0.1 - 8 $\mu$s. Our method should help perform projective spin measurements with high spin-to-charge conversion fidelity in systems subject to strong SOC, will facilitate state leakage detection and enable complete readout of two-spin states.</description>

      <title>Chirality-induced selectivity of angular momentum by orbital Edelstein effect in carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising materials exhibiting exceptional strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal properties, making them promising for various technologies. Besides achiral configurations with a zigzag or armchair edge, there exist chiral CNTs with a broken inversion symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that chiral CNTs exhibit chirality-induced orbital selectivity (CIOS), which is caused by the orbital Edelstein effect and could be detected as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). We find that the orbital Edelstein susceptibility is an odd function of the chirality angle of the nanotube and is proportional to its radius. For metallic CNTs close to the Fermi level, the orbital Edelstein susceptibility increases quadratically with energy. This makes the CISS and CIOS of metallic chiral nanotubes conveniently tunable by doping or applying a gate voltage, which allows for the generation of spin- and orbital-polarized currents. The possibility of generating large torques makes chiral CNTs interesting candidates for technological applications in spin-orbitronics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Scattering of a Dirac particle by a Berry phase domain wall</title>

Abstract: Massless Dirac particles are characterized by an effective pseudospin-momentum locking, which is the origin of the peculiar scattering properties of Dirac particles through potential barriers. This pseudospin-momentum locking also governs the quantum geometric properties (such as the Berry phase and Berry curvature) of Dirac particles. In the present work, we demonstrate that a domain wall separating two regions with distinct quantum geometric properties can serve as an alternative to potential barriers. Specifically, using the three-band $\alpha-T_3$ model of two-dimensional Dirac particles, we show that a Berry phase domain wall results in partial reflection and transmission of the Dirac particles, despite the fact that the incident and refracted momenta are identical.</description>

      <title>Voltage-tuned anomalous-metal to metal transition in hybrid Josephson junction arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report voltage-tuned phase transitions in arrays of hybrid semiconductor-superconductor islands arranged in a square lattice. A double-layer electrostatic gate geometry enables independent tuning of inter-island coupling and proximity-induced superconductivity. This design enables access to the superconductor-insulator, superconductor-metal, and metal-insulator transitions in a single device, revealing critical points and emergent intermediate phases. We find that the superconductor-insulator transition is interrupted by an anomalous metallic phase with saturating low-temperature resistivity. Across gate voltages, this regime extends over three orders of magnitude in resistivity and can be continuously tuned into the conventional metallic phase. The signature of the anomalous metallic phase is suppressed by magnetic frustration.</description>

      <title>Frequency as a Clock: Synchronization and Intrinsic Recovery in Graphene Transistor Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hysteresis and memory effects in graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) offer unique opportunities for neuromorphic computing, sensing, and memory applications, yet their physical origins remain debated due to competing volatile and nonvolatile interpretations. Here, we present a unified dynamic model that captures the essential physics of the GFET response under periodic gate modulation, accounting for both intrinsic relaxation processes and externally driven charge transfer. By modeling non-equilibrium carrier dynamics as a competition between injection and reabsorption rates, we uncover two distinct regimes: one governed by intrinsic, frequency-independent relaxation and another exhibiting frequency-locked behavior where the response is tied to the external drive. This distinction resolves apparent nonvolatile effects and explains loop invariance in floating-gate structures via displacement current-driven charge injection. Our framework predicts the evolution of the hysteresis loop shape, amplitude, and direction across a wide range of driving conditions, offering a versatile tool for interpreting experimental results and guiding the design of next-generation graphene-based electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Interference Supernodes, Thermoelectric Enhancement, and the Role of Dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum interference (QI) can strongly enhance thermoelectric response, with higher-order "supernodes" predicted to yield scalable gains in thermopower and efficiency. A central question, however, is whether such features are intrinsically more fragile to dephasing. Using $B\"uttiker$ voltage-temperature probes, we establish an order-selection rule: the effective near-node order is set by the lowest among coherent and probe-assisted channels. Supernodes are therefore fragile in an absolute sense because their transmission is parametrically suppressed with order. However, once an incoherent floor dominates, the fractional suppression of thermopower, efficiency, and figure of merit becomes universal and order-independent. Illustrating these principles with benzene- and biphenyl-based junction calculations, we show that the geometry of environmental coupling -- through a single orbital or across many -- dictates whether coherence is lost by order reduction or by floor building. These results yield general scaling rules for the thermoelectric response of interference nodes under dephasing.</description>

      <title>Resonant current-in-plane spin-torque diode effect in magnet$-$normal metal bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Via the spin-Hall effect and its inverse, in-plane charge currents in a normal metal$-$ferromagnet (N$|$F) bilayer can be used to excite and detect magnetization dynamics in F. Using a magneto-electric circuit approach, we here consider the current response to quadratic order in the applied electric field, which is resonantly enhanced for driving frequencies close to frequencies of coherent magnetization modes. Our theory can be applied to bilayers with a magnetic insulator or with a magnetic metal. It focuses on the contribution of coherent magnetization dynamics to spin currents collinear with the equilibrium magnetization direction, but also takes into account relaxation of spin accumulation via spin currents carried by incoherent magnons and conduction electrons in F.</description>

      <title>Controlling Collective Phenomena Via the Quantum State of Interaction-Mediators: Changing the Criticality of Photon-Mediated Superconductivity Via Fock States of Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How are two-body scattering and the resulting collective phenomena affected by preparing the mediator of interactions in different quantum states? This question has recently become experimentally relevant in a specific non-relativistic version of QED implemented within materials, where standard techniques of quantum optics are available for the preparation of desired quantum states of the photon mediating interactions between matter's constituents. We develop the necessary non-equilibrium approach for computing the vertex function and find that, in addition to the energy and momentum structure of the scattering, a further structure emerges which reflects the Hilbert-space distribution of the mediator's quantum state. This emergent structure becomes non-trivial for non-Gaussian quantum states of the mediator, and can dramatically affect scattering and collective phenomena. As a first application, we show that by preparing photons in pure Fock states one can enhance pair correlations, and even modify the criticality of the superconducting phase transition. Our results also reveal that the thermal mixture of Fock states regularises the strong pair correlations present in each of its components, yielding the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer criticality. Besides the above QED platform, ultracold atomic mixtures are among the most promising candidates for the experimental implementation of these ideas.</description>

      <title>A single-phonon directional coupler</title>

Abstract: Integrated photonics has revolutionized fields such as telecommunications, quantum optics, and metrology by enabling compact, scalable circuits through highly confined optical modes. Within the field of quantum acoustics, phonons have emerged as a compelling alternative, offering advantages such as lower energy, smaller mode volume, and low propagation speeds, which make them ideal for interfacing diverse quantum systems. Developing integrated phononic circuits is thus essential for unlocking the full potential of quantum acoustics and advancing technologies such as quantum computing and hybrid systems. In this work, we demonstrate the first 4-port directional coupler for quantum mechanical excitations - a key building block for phononic circuits. By tuning the coupling region length, we achieve phononic beam splitters with controllable splitting ratios. We validate quantum-level performance by sending a single-phonon Fock state through the device. This work represents a foundational advance toward scalable, integrated phononic platforms for both classical and quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Diode effect in the Fraunhofer pattern of disordered planar Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Josephson diode effect describes the property of a Josephson junction to have different values of the critical current for different direction of applied bias current and it is the focus of intense research thanks to the possible applications. The ubiquity of the effect experimentally reported calls for a study of the impact that disorder can have in the appearance of the effect. We study the Fraunhofer pattern of planar Josephson junctions in presence of different kinds of disorder and imperfections and we find that a junction that is {\it mirror} symmetric at zero-field forbids the diode effect and that the diode effect is typically magnified at the nodal points of the Fraunhofer pattern. The work presents a comprehensive treatment of the role of pure spatial inhomogeneity in the emergence of a diode effect in planar junctions, with an extension to the multi-terminal case and to systems of Josephson junctions connected in parallel.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Printing of Single Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unique optical properties of quantum dots (QDs), size-tunable emission and high quantum yield, make them ideal candidates for applications in secure quantum communication, quantum computing, targeted single-cell and molecular tagging, and sensing. Scalable and deterministic heterointegration strategies for single QDs have, however, remained largely out of reach due to inherent material incompatibilities with conventional semiconductor manufacturing processes. To advance scalable photonic quantum device architectures, it is therefore crucial to adopt placement and heterointegration strategies that can address these challenges. Here, we present an electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing model, single particle extraction electrodynamics (SPEED) printing, that exploits a novel regime of nanoscale dielectrophoretics to print and deterministically position single colloidal QDs. Using QDs solubilized in apolar solvents, this additive, zero-waste nanomanufacturing process overcomes continuum fluid surface energetics and stochastic imprecision that limited previous colloidal deposition strategies, achieving selective extraction and deposition of individual QDs at sub-zeptoliter volumes. Photoluminescence and autocorrelation function (g(2)) measurements confirm nanophotonic cavity-QD integration and single-photon emission from single printed QDs. By enabling deterministic placement of single quantum dots, this method provides a powerful, scalable, and sustainable platform for integrating complex photonic circuits and quantum light sources with nanoscale precision.</description>

      <title>Quantum work statistics across a critical point: full crossover from sudden quench to the adiabatic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When an external parameter drives a system across a quantum phase transition at a finite rate, work is performed on the system and entropy is dissipated, due to the creation of excitations via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Although both the adiabatic and sudden-quench limits have been studied in detail, the quantum work statistics along the crossover connecting these limits has largely been an open question. Here we obtain exact scaling functions for the work statistics along the full crossover from adiabatic to sudden-quench limits for critical quantum impurity problems, by combining linear response theory, conformal field theory, and the numerical renormalization group. These predictions can be tested in charge-multichannel Kondo quantum dot devices, where the dissipated work corresponds to the creation of nontrivial excitations such as Majorana fermions or Fibonacci anyons.</description>

      <title>Sharp transitions in small exciton spectra for multi-orbital lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that strongly bound excitons, whose radii approach the lattice constant, display physics that eludes continuum descriptions not just quantitatively but qualitatively. We investigate such phenomenology by calculating the exciton spectra for several one- and two-dimensional lattice models, whose valence band has a multi-orbital character. We identify sharp transitions in the character and momentum of the lowest-energy exciton, driven directly by the multi-orbital nature of the lattice models. Such transitions cannot occur in simple continuum descriptions.</description>
