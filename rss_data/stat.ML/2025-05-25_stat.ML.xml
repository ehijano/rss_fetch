      <title>Learning Probabilities of Causation from Finite Population Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilities of causation play a crucial role in modern decision-making. This paper addresses the challenge of predicting probabilities of causation for subpopulations with \textbf{insufficient} data using machine learning models. Tian and Pearl first defined and derived tight bounds for three fundamental probabilities of causation: the probability of necessity and sufficiency (PNS), the probability of sufficiency (PS), and the probability of necessity (PN). However, estimating these probabilities requires both experimental and observational distributions specific to each subpopulation, which are often unavailable or impractical to obtain with limited population-level data. Therefore, for most subgroups, the amount of data they have is not enough to guarantee the accuracy of their probabilities. Hence, to estimate these probabilities for subpopulations with \textbf{insufficient} data, we propose using machine learning models that draw insights from subpopulations with sufficient data. Our evaluation of multiple machine learning models indicates that, given the population-level data and an appropriate choice of machine learning model and activation function, PNS can be effectively predicted. Through simulation studies on multiple Structured Causal Models (SCMs), we show that our multilayer perceptron (MLP) model with the Mish activation function achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately $0.02$ in predicting PNS for $32,768$ subpopulations across most SCMs using data from only $2,000$ subpopulations with known PNS values.</description>

      <title>Liouville PDE-based sliced-Wasserstein flow for fair regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sliced Wasserstein flow (SWF), a nonparametric and implicit generative gradient flow, is applied to fair regression. We have improved the SWF in a few aspects. First, the stochastic diffusive term from the Fokker-Planck equation-based Monte Carlo is transformed to Liouville partial differential equation (PDE)-based transport with density estimation, however, without the diffusive term. Now, the computation of the Wasserstein barycenter is approximated by the SWF barycenter with the prescription of Kantorovich potentials for the induced gradient flow to generate its samples. These two efforts improve the convergence in training and testing SWF and SWF barycenters with reduced variance. Applying the generative SWF barycenter for fair regression demonstrates competent profiles in the accuracy-fairness Pareto curves.</description>

      <title>Deconfounded Warm-Start Thompson Sampling with Applications to Precision Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized clinical trials often require large patient cohorts before drawing definitive conclusions, yet abundant observational data from parallel studies remains underutilized due to confounding and hidden biases. To bridge this gap, we propose Deconfounded Warm-Start Thompson Sampling (DWTS), a practical approach that leverages a Doubly Debiased LASSO (DDL) procedure to identify a sparse set of reliable measured covariates and combines them with key hidden covariates to form a reduced context. By initializing Thompson Sampling (LinTS) priors with DDL-estimated means and variances on these measured features -- while keeping uninformative priors on hidden features -- DWTS effectively harnesses confounded observational data to kick-start adaptive clinical trials. Evaluated on both a purely synthetic environment and a virtual environment created using real cardiovascular risk dataset, DWTS consistently achieves lower cumulative regret than standard LinTS, showing how offline causal insights from observational data can improve trial efficiency and support more personalized treatment decisions.</description>

      <title>Learning to Choose or Choosing to Learn: Best-of-N vs. Supervised Fine-Tuning for Bit String Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the bit string generation problem as a case study, we theoretically compare two standard methods for adapting large language models to new tasks. The first, referred to as supervised fine-tuning, involves training a new next token predictor on good generations. The second method, Best-of-N, trains a reward model to select good responses from a collection generated by an unaltered base model. If the learning setting is realizable, we find that supervised fine-tuning outperforms BoN through a better dependence on the response length in its rate of convergence. If realizability fails, then depending on the failure mode, BoN can enjoy a better rate of convergence in either n or a rate of convergence with better dependence on the response length.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport with Heterogeneously Missing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of solving the optimal transport problem between two empirical distributions with missing values. Our main assumption is that the data is missing completely at random (MCAR), but we allow for heterogeneous missingness probabilities across features and across the two distributions. As a first contribution, we show that the Wasserstein distance between empirical Gaussian distributions and linear Monge maps between arbitrary distributions can be debiased without significantly affecting the sample complexity. Secondly, we show that entropic regularized optimal transport can be estimated efficiently and consistently using iterative singular value thresholding (ISVT). We propose a validation set-free hyperparameter selection strategy for ISVT that leverages our estimator of the Bures-Wasserstein distance, which could be of independent interest in general matrix completion problems. Finally, we validate our findings on a wide range of numerical applications.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Online Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Construction of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for functionals based on asymptotically normal estimators is a classical topic in statistical inference. The simplest and in many cases optimal inference procedure is the Wald interval or the likelihood ratio test, both of which require an estimator and an estimate of the asymptotic variance of the estimator. Estimators obtained from online/sequential algorithms forces one to consider the computational aspects of the inference problem, i.e., one cannot access all of the data as many times as needed. Several works on this topic explored the online estimation of asymptotic variance. In this article, we propose computationally efficient, rate-optimal, and asymptotically valid confidence regions based on the output of online algorithms {\em without} estimating the asymptotic variance. As a special case, this implies inference from any algorithm that yields an asymptotically normal estimator. We focus our efforts on stochastic gradient descent with Polyak averaging to understand the practical performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Repulsive Ensembles for Bayesian Inference in Physics-informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have proven an effective tool for solving differential equations, in particular when considering non-standard or ill-posed settings. When inferring solutions and parameters of the differential equation from data, uncertainty estimates are preferable to point estimates, as they give an idea about the accuracy of the solution. In this work, we consider the inverse problem and employ repulsive ensembles of PINNs (RE-PINN) for obtaining such estimates. The repulsion is implemented by adding a particular repulsive term to the loss function, which has the property that the ensemble predictions correspond to the true Bayesian posterior in the limit of infinite ensemble members. Where possible, we compare the ensemble predictions to Monte Carlo baselines. Whereas the standard ensemble tends to collapse to maximum-a-posteriori solutions, the repulsive ensemble produces significantly more accurate uncertainty estimates and exhibits higher sample diversity.</description>

      <title>Offline Constrained Reinforcement Learning under Partial Data Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study offline constrained reinforcement learning (RL) with general function approximation. We aim to learn a policy from a pre-collected dataset that maximizes the expected discounted cumulative reward for a primary reward signal while ensuring that expected discounted returns for multiple auxiliary reward signals are above predefined thresholds. Existing algorithms either require fully exploratory data, are computationally inefficient, or depend on an additional auxiliary function classes to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with sample complexity $O(\epsilon^{-2})$. In this paper, we propose an oracle-efficient primal-dual algorithm based on a linear programming (LP) formulation, achieving $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity under partial data coverage. By introducing a realizability assumption, our approach ensures that all saddle points of the Lagrangian are optimal, removing the need for regularization that complicated prior analyses. Through Lagrangian decomposition, our method extracts policies without requiring knowledge of the data-generating distribution, enhancing practical applicability.</description>

      <title>A Distributionally-Robust Framework for Nuisance in Causal Effect Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal inference requires evaluating models on balanced distributions between treatment and control groups, while training data often exhibits imbalance due to historical decision-making policies. Most conventional statistical methods address this distribution shift through inverse probability weighting (IPW), which requires estimating propensity scores as an intermediate step. These methods face two key challenges: inaccurate propensity estimation and instability from extreme weights. We decompose the generalization error to isolate these issues--propensity ambiguity and statistical instability--and address them through an adversarial loss function. Our approach combines distributionally robust optimization for handling propensity uncertainty with weight regularization based on weighted Rademacher complexity. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal Online Change Detection via Random Fourier Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies the problem of online non-parametric change point detection in multivariate data streams. We approach the problem through the lens of kernel-based two-sample testing and introduce a sequential testing procedure based on random Fourier features, running with logarithmic time complexity per observation and with overall logarithmic space complexity. The algorithm has two advantages compared to the state of the art. First, our approach is genuinely online, and no access to training data known to be from the pre-change distribution is necessary. Second, the algorithm does not require the user to specify a window parameter over which local tests are to be calculated. We prove strong theoretical guarantees on the algorithm's performance, including information-theoretic bounds demonstrating that the detection delay is optimal in the minimax sense. Numerical studies on real and synthetic data show that our algorithm is competitive with respect to the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Quantifying uncertainty in spectral clusterings: expectations for perturbed and incomplete data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral clustering is a popular unsupervised learning technique which is able to partition unlabelled data into disjoint clusters of distinct shapes. However, the data under consideration are often experimental data, implying that the data is subject to measurement errors and measurements may even be lost or invalid. These uncertainties in the corrupted input data induce corresponding uncertainties in the resulting clusters, and the clusterings thus become unreliable.
  Modelling the uncertainties as random processes, we discuss a mathematical framework based on random set theory for the computational Monte Carlo approximation of statistically expected clusterings in case of corrupted, i.e., perturbed, incomplete, and possibly even additional, data. We propose several computationally accessible quantities of interest and analyze their consistency in the infinite data point and infinite Monte Carlo sample limit. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate and compare the proposed quantities.</description>

      <title>Robust Distributed Estimation: Extending Gossip Algorithms to Ranking and Trimmed Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of robust estimation in gossip algorithms over arbitrary communication graphs. Gossip algorithms are fully decentralized, relying only on local neighbor-to-neighbor communication, making them well-suited for situations where communication is constrained. A fundamental challenge in existing mean-based gossip algorithms is their vulnerability to malicious or corrupted nodes. In this paper, we show that an outlier-robust mean can be computed by globally estimating a robust statistic. More specifically, we propose a novel gossip algorithm for rank estimation, referred to as \textsc{GoRank}, and leverage it to design a gossip procedure dedicated to trimmed mean estimation, coined \textsc{GoTrim}. In addition to a detailed description of the proposed methods, a key contribution of our work is a precise convergence analysis: we establish an $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ rate for rank estimation and an $\mathcal{O}(\log(t)/t)$ rate for trimmed mean estimation, where by $t$ is meant the number of iterations. Moreover, we provide a breakdown point analysis of \textsc{GoTrim}. We empirically validate our theoretical results through experiments on diverse network topologies, data distributions and contamination schemes.</description>

      <title>Continuum Transformers Perform In-Context Learning by Operator Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers robustly exhibit the ability to perform in-context learning, whereby their predictive accuracy on a task can increase not by parameter updates but merely with the placement of training samples in their context windows. Recent works have shown that transformers achieve this by implementing gradient descent in their forward passes. Such results, however, are restricted to standard transformer architectures, which handle finite-dimensional inputs. In the space of PDE surrogate modeling, a generalization of transformers to handle infinite-dimensional function inputs, known as "continuum transformers," has been proposed and similarly observed to exhibit in-context learning. Despite impressive empirical performance, such in-context learning has yet to be theoretically characterized. We herein demonstrate that continuum transformers perform in-context operator learning by performing gradient descent in an operator RKHS. We demonstrate this using novel proof strategies that leverage a generalized representer theorem for Hilbert spaces and gradient flows over the space of functionals of a Hilbert space. We additionally show the operator learned in context is the Bayes Optimal Predictor in the infinite depth limit of the transformer. We then provide empirical validations of this optimality result and demonstrate that the parameters under which such gradient descent is performed are recovered through the continuum transformer training.</description>

      <title>DataRater: Meta-Learned Dataset Curation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of foundation models depends heavily on their training data. Consequently, great efforts have been put into dataset curation. Yet most approaches rely on manual tuning of coarse-grained mixtures of large buckets of data, or filtering by hand-crafted heuristics. An approach that is ultimately more scalable (let alone more satisfying) is to \emph{learn} which data is actually valuable for training. This type of meta-learning could allow more sophisticated, fine-grained, and effective curation. Our proposed \emph{DataRater} is an instance of this idea. It estimates the value of training on any particular data point. This is done by meta-learning using `meta-gradients', with the objective of improving training efficiency on held out data. In extensive experiments across a range of model scales and datasets, we find that using our DataRater to filter data is highly effective, resulting in significantly improved compute efficiency.</description>

      <title>Function Forms of Simple ReLU Networks with Random Hidden Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the function space dynamics of a two-layer ReLU neural network in the infinite-width limit, highlighting the Fisher information matrix (FIM)'s role in steering learning. Extending seminal works on approximate eigendecomposition of the FIM, we derive the asymptotic behavior of basis functions ($f_v(x) = X^{\top} v $) for four groups of approximate eigenvectors, showing their convergence to distinct function forms. These functions, prioritized by gradient descent, exhibit FIM-induced inner products that approximate orthogonality in the function space, forging a novel connection between parameter and function spaces. Simulations validate the accuracy of these theoretical approximations, confirming their practical relevance. By refining the function space inner product's role, we advance the theoretical framework for ReLU networks, illuminating their optimization and expressivity. Overall, this work offers a robust foundation for understanding wide neural networks and enhances insights into scalable deep learning architectures, paving the way for improved design and analysis of neural networks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method, termed the M-learner, for estimating heterogeneous indirect and total treatment effects and identifying relevant subgroups within a mediation framework. The procedure comprises four key steps. First, we compute individual-level conditional average indirect/total treatment effect Second, we construct a distance matrix based on pairwise differences. Third, we apply tSNE to project this matrix into a low-dimensional Euclidean space, followed by K-means clustering to identify subgroup structures. Finally, we calibrate and refine the clusters using a threshold-based procedure to determine the optimal configuration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach specifically designed to capture treatment effect heterogeneity in the presence of mediation. Experimental results validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed framework. Application to the real-world Jobs II dataset highlights the broad adaptability and potential applicability of our method.Code is available at https: //anonymous.4open.science/r/M-learner-C4BB.</description>

      <title>The Nuclear Route: Sharp Asymptotics of ERM in Overparameterized Quadratic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the high-dimensional asymptotics of empirical risk minimization (ERM) in over-parametrized two-layer neural networks with quadratic activations trained on synthetic data. We derive sharp asymptotics for both training and test errors by mapping the $\ell_2$-regularized learning problem to a convex matrix sensing task with nuclear norm penalization. This reveals that capacity control in such networks emerges from a low-rank structure in the learned feature maps. Our results characterize the global minima of the loss and yield precise generalization thresholds, showing how the width of the target function governs learnability. This analysis bridges and extends ideas from spin-glass methods, matrix factorization, and convex optimization and emphasizes the deep link between low-rank matrix sensing and learning in quadratic neural networks.</description>

      <title>Anytime-valid, Bayes-assisted,Prediction-Powered Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a large pool of unlabelled data and a smaller amount of labels, prediction-powered inference (PPI) leverages machine learning predictions to increase the statistical efficiency of standard confidence interval procedures based solely on labelled data, while preserving their fixed-time validity.
  In this paper, we extend the PPI framework to the sequential setting, where labelled and unlabelled datasets grow over time.
  Exploiting Ville's inequality and the method of mixtures, we propose prediction-powered confidence sequence procedures that are valid uniformly over time and naturally accommodate prior knowledge on the quality of the predictions to further boost efficiency.
  We carefully illustrate the design choices behind our method and demonstrate its effectiveness in real and synthetic examples.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Deep Learning for Discrete Choice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete choice models (DCMs) are used to analyze individual decision-making in contexts such as transportation choices, political elections, and consumer preferences. DCMs play a central role in applied econometrics by enabling inference on key economic variables, such as marginal rates of substitution, rather than focusing solely on predicting choices on new unlabeled data. However, while traditional DCMs offer high interpretability and support for point and interval estimation of economic quantities, these models often underperform in predictive tasks compared to deep learning (DL) models. Despite their predictive advantages, DL models remain largely underutilized in discrete choice due to concerns about their lack of interpretability, unstable parameter estimates, and the absence of established methods for uncertainty quantification. Here, we introduce a deep learning model architecture specifically designed to integrate with approximate Bayesian inference methods, such as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). Our proposed model collapses to behaviorally informed hypotheses when data is limited, mitigating overfitting and instability in underspecified settings while retaining the flexibility to capture complex nonlinear relationships when sufficient data is available. We demonstrate our approach using SGLD through a Monte Carlo simulation study, evaluating both predictive metrics--such as out-of-sample balanced accuracy--and inferential metrics--such as empirical coverage for marginal rates of substitution interval estimates. Additionally, we present results from two empirical case studies: one using revealed mode choice data in NYC, and the other based on the widely used Swiss train choice stated preference data.</description>

      <title>Scalable Policy Maximization Under Network Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many interventions, such as vaccines in clinical trials or coupons in online marketplaces, must be assigned sequentially without full knowledge of their effects. Multi-armed bandit algorithms have proven successful in such settings. However, standard independence assumptions fail when the treatment status of one individual impacts the outcomes of others, a phenomenon known as interference. We study optimal-policy learning under interference on a dynamic network. Existing approaches to this problem require repeated observations of the same fixed network and struggle to scale in sample size beyond as few as fifteen connected units -- both limit applications. We show that under common assumptions on the structure of interference, rewards become linear. This enables us to develop a scalable Thompson sampling algorithm that maximizes policy impact when a new $n$-node network is observed each round. We prove a Bayesian regret bound that is sublinear in $n$ and the number of rounds. Simulation experiments show that our algorithm learns quickly and outperforms existing methods. The results close a key scalability gap between causal inference methods for interference and practical bandit algorithms, enabling policy optimization in large-scale networked systems.</description>

      <title>Scale-invariant Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One persistent challenge in LLM research is the development of attention mechanisms that are able to generalise from training on shorter contexts to inference on longer contexts. We propose two conditions that we expect all effective long context attention mechanisms to have: scale-invariant total attention, and scale-invariant attention sparsity. Under a Gaussian assumption, we show that a simple position-dependent transformation of the attention logits is sufficient for these conditions to hold. Experimentally we find that the resulting scale-invariant attention scheme gives considerable benefits in terms of validation loss when zero-shot generalising from training on short contexts to validation on longer contexts, and is effective at long-context retrieval.</description>

      <title>Conformal Language Model Reasoning with Coherent Factuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models are increasingly being used in important decision pipelines, so ensuring the correctness of their outputs is crucial. Recent work has proposed evaluating the "factuality" of claims decomposed from a language model generation and applying conformal prediction techniques to filter out those claims that are not factual. This can be effective for tasks such as information retrieval, where constituent claims may be evaluated in isolation for factuality, but is not appropriate for reasoning tasks, as steps of a logical argument can be evaluated for correctness only within the context of the claims that precede them. To capture this, we define "coherent factuality" and develop a conformal-prediction-based method to guarantee coherent factuality for language model outputs. Our approach applies split conformal prediction to subgraphs within a "deducibility" graph" that represents the steps of a reasoning problem. We evaluate our method on mathematical reasoning problems from the MATH and FELM datasets and find that our algorithm consistently produces correct and substantiated orderings of claims, achieving coherent factuality across target coverage levels. Moreover, we achieve 90% factuality on our stricter definition while retaining 80% or more of the original claims, highlighting the utility of our deducibility-graph-guided approach.</description>

      <title>Relative Bias: A Comparative Framework for Quantifying Bias in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) has amplified concerns regarding their inherent biases, raising critical questions about their fairness, safety, and societal impact. However, quantifying LLM bias remains a fundamental challenge, complicated by the ambiguity of what "bias" entails. This challenge grows as new models emerge rapidly and gain widespread use, while introducing potential biases that have not been systematically assessed. In this paper, we propose the Relative Bias framework, a method designed to assess how an LLM's behavior deviates from other LLMs within a specified target domain. We introduce two complementary methodologies: (1) Embedding Transformation analysis, which captures relative bias patterns through sentence representations over the embedding space, and (2) LLM-as-a-Judge, which employs a language model to evaluate outputs comparatively. Applying our framework to several case studies on bias and alignment scenarios following by statistical tests for validation, we find strong alignment between the two scoring methods, offering a systematic, scalable, and statistically grounded approach for comparative bias analysis in LLMs.</description>

      <title>CT-OT Flow: Estimating Continuous-Time Dynamics from Discrete Temporal Snapshots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, data are observed only as discrete-time snapshots spanning finite time intervals and subject to noisy timestamps, with no continuous trajectories available. Recovering the underlying continuous-time dynamics from these snapshots with coarse and noisy observation times is a critical and challenging task. We propose Continuous-Time Optimal Transport Flow (CT-OT Flow), which first infers high-resolution time labels via partial optimal transport and then reconstructs a continuous-time data distribution through a temporal kernel smoothing. This reconstruction enables accurate training of dynamics models such as ODEs and SDEs. CT-OT Flow consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic benchmarks and achieves lower reconstruction errors on real scRNA-seq and typhoon-track datasets. Our results highlight the benefits of explicitly modeling temporal discretization and timestamp uncertainty, offering an accurate and general framework for bridging discrete snapshots and continuous-time processes.</description>

      <title>Variational Autoencoding Discrete Diffusion with Enhanced Dimensional Correlations Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently shown great promise for modeling complex discrete data, with masked diffusion models (MDMs) offering a compelling trade-off between quality and generation speed. MDMs denoise by progressively unmasking multiple dimensions from an all-masked input, but their performance can degrade when using few denoising steps due to limited modeling of inter-dimensional dependencies. In this paper, we propose Variational Autoencoding Discrete Diffusion (VADD), a novel framework that enhances discrete diffusion with latent variable modeling to implicitly capture correlations among dimensions. By introducing an auxiliary recognition model, VADD enables stable training via variational lower bounds maximization and amortized inference over the training set. Our approach retains the efficiency of traditional MDMs while significantly improving sample quality, especially when the number of denoising steps is small. Empirical results on 2D toy data, pixel-level image generation, and text generation demonstrate that VADD consistently outperforms MDM baselines.</description>

      <title>Minimax Rate-Optimal Algorithms for High-Dimensional Stochastic Linear Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stochastic linear bandit problem with multiple arms over $T$ rounds, where the covariate dimension $d$ may exceed $T$, but each arm-specific parameter vector is $s$-sparse. We begin by analyzing the sequential estimation problem in the single-arm setting, focusing on cumulative mean-squared error. We show that Lasso estimators are provably suboptimal in the sequential setting, exhibiting suboptimal dependence on $d$ and $T$, whereas thresholded Lasso estimators -- obtained by applying least squares to the support selected by thresholding an initial Lasso estimator -- achieve the minimax rate. Building on these insights, we consider the full linear contextual bandit problem and propose a three-stage arm selection algorithm that uses thresholded Lasso as the main estimation method. We derive an upper bound on the cumulative regret of order $s(\log s)(\log d + \log T)$, and establish a matching lower bound up to a $\log s$ factor, thereby characterizing the minimax regret rate up to a logarithmic term in $s$. Moreover, when a short initial period is excluded from the regret, the proposed algorithm achieves exact minimax optimality.</description>

      <title>Efficient Adaptive Experimentation with Non-Compliance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) in adaptive experiments where treatment can only be encouraged--rather than directly assigned--via a binary instrumental variable. Building on semiparametric efficiency theory, we derive the efficiency bound for ATE estimation under arbitrary, history-dependent instrument-assignment policies, and show it is minimized by a variance-aware allocation rule that balances outcome noise and compliance variability. Leveraging this insight, we introduce AMRIV--an \textbf{A}daptive, \textbf{M}ultiply-\textbf{R}obust estimator for \textbf{I}nstrumental-\textbf{V}ariable settings with variance-optimal assignment. AMRIV pairs (i) an online policy that adaptively approximates the optimal allocation with (ii) a sequential, influence-function-based estimator that attains the semiparametric efficiency bound while retaining multiply-robust consistency. We establish asymptotic normality, explicit convergence rates, and anytime-valid asymptotic confidence sequences that enable sequential inference. Finally, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our approach through empirical studies, showing that adaptive instrument assignment, when combined with the AMRIV estimator, yields improved efficiency and robustness compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Why Diffusion Models Don't Memorize: The Role of Implicit Dynamical Regularization in Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of generative tasks. A key challenge is understanding the mechanisms that prevent their memorization of training data and allow generalization. In this work, we investigate the role of the training dynamics in the transition from generalization to memorization. Through extensive experiments and theoretical analysis, we identify two distinct timescales: an early time $\tau_\mathrm{gen}$ at which models begin to generate high-quality samples, and a later time $\tau_\mathrm{mem}$ beyond which memorization emerges. Crucially, we find that $\tau_\mathrm{mem}$ increases linearly with the training set size $n$, while $\tau_\mathrm{gen}$ remains constant. This creates a growing window of training times with $n$ where models generalize effectively, despite showing strong memorization if training continues beyond it. It is only when $n$ becomes larger than a model-dependent threshold that overfitting disappears at infinite training times. These findings reveal a form of implicit dynamical regularization in the training dynamics, which allow to avoid memorization even in highly overparameterized settings. Our results are supported by numerical experiments with standard U-Net architectures on realistic and synthetic datasets, and by a theoretical analysis using a tractable random features model studied in the high-dimensional limit.</description>

      <title>Discrete Neural Flow Samplers with Locally Equivariant Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling from unnormalised discrete distributions is a fundamental problem across various domains. While Markov chain Monte Carlo offers a principled approach, it often suffers from slow mixing and poor convergence. In this paper, we propose Discrete Neural Flow Samplers (DNFS), a trainable and efficient framework for discrete sampling. DNFS learns the rate matrix of a continuous-time Markov chain such that the resulting dynamics satisfy the Kolmogorov equation. As this objective involves the intractable partition function, we then employ control variates to reduce the variance of its Monte Carlo estimation, leading to a coordinate descent learning algorithm. To further facilitate computational efficiency, we propose locally equivaraint Transformer, a novel parameterisation of the rate matrix that significantly improves training efficiency while preserving powerful network expressiveness. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of DNFS in a wide range of applications, including sampling from unnormalised distributions, training discrete energy-based models, and solving combinatorial optimisation problems.</description>

      <title>Scalable Valuation of Human Feedback through Provably Robust Model Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the importance of aligning language models with human preferences, crowd-sourced human feedback is often noisy -- for example, preferring less desirable responses -- posing a fundamental challenge to alignment. A truly robust alignment objective should yield identical model parameters even under severe label noise, a property known as redescending. We prove that no existing alignment methods satisfy this property. To address this, we propose H\"older-DPO, the first principled alignment loss with a provable redescending property, enabling estimation of the clean data distribution from noisy feedback. The aligned model estimates the likelihood of clean data, providing a theoretically grounded metric for dataset valuation that identifies the location and fraction of mislabels. This metric is gradient-free, enabling scalable and automated human feedback valuation without costly manual verification or clean validation dataset. H\"older-DPO achieves state-of-the-art robust alignment performance while accurately detecting mislabels in controlled datasets. Finally, we apply H\"older-DPO to widely used alignment datasets, revealing substantial noise levels and demonstrating that removing these mislabels significantly improves alignment performance across methods.</description>

Abstract: The analysis of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) often relies on making some assumption on the variance of the stochastic gradients, which is usually not satisfied or difficult to verify in practice. This paper contributes to a recent line of works which attempt to provide guarantees without making any variance assumption, leveraging only the (strong) convexity and smoothness of the loss functions. In this context, we prove new theoretical bounds derived from the monotonicity of a simple Lyapunov energy, improving the current state-of-the-art and extending their validity to larger step-sizes. Our theoretical analysis is backed by a Performance Estimation Problem analysis, which allows us to claim that, empirically, the bias term in our bounds is tight within our framework.</description>

      <title>Distances for Markov chains from sample streams</title>

Abstract: Bisimulation metrics are powerful tools for measuring similarities between stochastic processes, and specifically Markov chains. Recent advances have uncovered that bisimulation metrics are, in fact, optimal-transport distances, which has enabled the development of fast algorithms for computing such metrics with provable accuracy and runtime guarantees. However, these recent methods, as well as all previously known methods, assume full knowledge of the transition dynamics. This is often an impractical assumption in most real-world scenarios, where typically only sample trajectories are available. In this work, we propose a stochastic optimization method that addresses this limitation and estimates bisimulation metrics based on sample access, without requiring explicit transition models. Our approach is derived from a new linear programming (LP) formulation of bisimulation metrics, which we solve using a stochastic primal-dual optimization method. We provide theoretical guarantees on the sample complexity of the algorithm and validate its effectiveness through a series of empirical evaluations.</description>

      <title>Linear Mixture Distributionally Robust Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems face the off-dynamics challenge: the agent learns a policy in a source domain and deploys it in a target domain with different state transitions. The distributionally robust Markov decision process (DRMDP) addresses this challenge by finding a robust policy that performs well under the worst-case environment within a pre-specified uncertainty set of transition dynamics. Its effectiveness heavily hinges on the proper design of these uncertainty sets, based on prior knowledge of the dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel linear mixture DRMDP framework, where the nominal dynamics is assumed to be a linear mixture model. In contrast with existing uncertainty sets directly defined as a ball centered around the nominal kernel, linear mixture DRMDPs define the uncertainty sets based on a ball around the mixture weighting parameter. We show that this new framework provides a more refined representation of uncertainties compared to conventional models based on $(s,a)$-rectangularity and $d$-rectangularity, when prior knowledge about the mixture model is present. We propose a meta algorithm for robust policy learning in linear mixture DRMDPs with general $f$-divergence defined uncertainty sets, and analyze its sample complexities under three divergence metrics instantiations: total variation, Kullback-Leibler, and $\chi^2$ divergences. These results establish the statistical learnability of linear mixture DRMDPs, laying the theoretical foundation for future research on this new setting.</description>

      <title>Learning with Restricted Boltzmann Machines: Asymptotics of AMP and GD in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is one of the simplest generative neural networks capable of learning input distributions. Despite its simplicity, the analysis of its performance in learning from the training data is only well understood in cases that essentially reduce to singular value decomposition of the data. Here, we consider the limit of a large dimension of the input space and a constant number of hidden units. In this limit, we simplify the standard RBM training objective into a form that is equivalent to the multi-index model with non-separable regularization. This opens a path to analyze training of the RBM using methods that are established for multi-index models, such as Approximate Message Passing (AMP) and its state evolution, and the analysis of Gradient Descent (GD) via the dynamical mean-field theory. We then give rigorous asymptotics of the training dynamics of RBM on data generated by the spiked covariance model as a prototype of a structure suitable for unsupervised learning. We show in particular that RBM reaches the optimal computational weak recovery threshold, aligning with the BBP transition, in the spiked covariance model.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically optimal regret in communicating Markov decision processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a learning algorithm that achieves asymptotically optimal regret for Markov decision processes in average reward under a communicating assumption. That is, given a communicating Markov decision process $M$, our algorithm has regret $K(M) \log(T) + \mathrm{o}(\log(T))$ where $T$ is the number of learning steps and $K(M)$ is the best possible constant. This algorithm works by explicitly tracking the constant $K(M)$ to learn optimally, then balances the trade-off between exploration (playing sub-optimally to gain information), co-exploration (playing optimally to gain information) and exploitation (playing optimally to score maximally). We further show that the function $K(M)$ is discontinuous, which is a consequence challenge for our approach. To that end, we describe a regularization mechanism to estimate $K(M)$ with arbitrary precision from empirical data.</description>

      <title>Generative Distribution Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world problems require reasoning across multiple scales, demanding models which operate not on single data points, but on entire distributions. We introduce generative distribution embeddings (GDE), a framework that lifts autoencoders to the space of distributions. In GDEs, an encoder acts on sets of samples, and the decoder is replaced by a generator which aims to match the input distribution. This framework enables learning representations of distributions by coupling conditional generative models with encoder networks which satisfy a criterion we call distributional invariance. We show that GDEs learn predictive sufficient statistics embedded in the Wasserstein space, such that latent GDE distances approximately recover the $W_2$ distance, and latent interpolation approximately recovers optimal transport trajectories for Gaussian and Gaussian mixture distributions. We systematically benchmark GDEs against existing approaches on synthetic datasets, demonstrating consistently stronger performance. We then apply GDEs to six key problems in computational biology: learning representations of cell populations from lineage-tracing data (150K cells), predicting perturbation effects on single-cell transcriptomes (1M cells), predicting perturbation effects on cellular phenotypes (20M single-cell images), modeling tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns (253M sequences), designing synthetic yeast promoters (34M sequences), and spatiotemporal modeling of viral protein sequences (1M sequences).</description>

      <title>Quantifying Statistical Significance in Diffusion-Based Anomaly Localization via Selective Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11789v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomaly localization in images (identifying regions that deviate from expected patterns) is vital in applications such as medical diagnosis and industrial inspection. A recent trend is the use of image generation models in anomaly localization, where these models generate normal-looking counterparts of anomalous images, thereby allowing flexible and adaptive anomaly localization. However, these methods inherit the uncertainty and bias implicitly embedded in the employed generative model, raising concerns about the reliability. To address this, we propose a statistical framework based on selective inference to quantify the significance of detected anomalous regions. Our method provides $p$-values to assess the false positive detection rates, providing a principled measure of reliability. As a proof of concept, we consider anomaly localization using a diffusion model and its applications to medical diagnoses and industrial inspections. The results indicate that the proposed method effectively controls the risk of false positive detection, supporting its use in high-stakes decision-making tasks.</description>

      <title>E$^2$M: Double Bounded $\alpha$-Divergence Optimization for Tensor-based Discrete Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor-based discrete density estimation requires flexible modeling and proper divergence criteria to enable effective learning; however, traditional approaches using $\alpha$-divergence face analytical challenges due to the $\alpha$-power terms in the objective function, which hinder the derivation of closed-form update rules. We present a generalization of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, called E$^2$M algorithm. It circumvents this issue by first relaxing the optimization into minimization of a surrogate objective based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which is tractable via the standard EM algorithm, and subsequently applying a tensor many-body approximation in the M-step to enable simultaneous closed-form updates of all parameters. Our approach offers flexible modeling for not only a variety of low-rank structures, including the CP, Tucker, and Tensor Train formats, but also their mixtures, thus allowing us to leverage the strengths of different low-rank structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in classification and density estimation tasks.</description>

      <title>Importance Corrected Neural JKO Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to sample from an unnormalized probability density function, we propose to combine continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with rejection-resampling steps based on importance weights. We relate the iterative training of CNFs with regularized velocity fields to a JKO scheme and prove convergence of the involved velocity fields to the velocity field of the Wasserstein gradient flow (WGF). The alternation of local flow steps and non-local rejection-resampling steps allows to overcome local minima or slow convergence of the WGF for multimodal distributions. Since the proposal of the rejection step is generated by the model itself, they do not suffer from common drawbacks of classical rejection schemes. The arising model can be trained iteratively, reduces the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) loss function in each step, allows to generate iid samples and moreover allows for evaluations of the generated underlying density. Numerical examples show that our method yields accurate results on various test distributions including high-dimensional multimodal targets and outperforms the state of the art in almost all cases significantly.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Learning-to-Defer Approach for Multi-Task Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15729v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Two-Stage Learning-to-Defer (L2D) framework has been extensively studied for classification and, more recently, regression tasks. However, many real-world applications require solving both tasks jointly in a multi-task setting. We introduce a novel Two-Stage L2D framework for multi-task learning that integrates classification and regression through a unified deferral mechanism. Our method leverages a two-stage surrogate loss family, which we prove to be both Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{R})$-consistent, ensuring convergence to the Bayes-optimal rejector. We derive explicit consistency bounds tied to the cross-entropy surrogate and the $L_1$-norm of agent-specific costs, and extend minimizability gap analysis to the multi-expert two-stage regime. We also make explicit how shared representation learning--commonly used in multi-task models--affects these consistency guarantees. Experiments on object detection and electronic health record analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the limitations of existing L2D methods in multi-task scenarios.</description>

      <title>Beyond Log-Concavity and Score Regularity: Improved Convergence Bounds for Score-Based Generative Models in W2-distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) aim to sample from a target distribution by learning score functions using samples perturbed by Gaussian noise. Existing convergence bounds for SGMs in the $\mathcal{W}_2$-distance rely on stringent assumptions about the data distribution. In this work, we present a novel framework for analyzing $\mathcal{W}_2$-convergence in SGMs, significantly relaxing traditional assumptions such as log-concavity and score regularity. Leveraging the regularization properties of the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) process, we show that weak log-concavity of the data distribution evolves into log-concavity over time. This transition is rigorously quantified through a PDE-based analysis of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation governing the log-density of the forward process. Moreover, we establish that the drift of the time-reversed OU process alternates between contractive and non-contractive regimes, reflecting the dynamics of concavity. Our approach circumvents the need for stringent regularity conditions on the score function and its estimators, relying instead on milder, more practical assumptions. We demonstrate the wide applicability of this framework through explicit computations on Gaussian mixture models, illustrating its versatility and potential for broader classes of data distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Random Feature Representation Boosting (RFRBoost), a novel method for constructing deep residual random feature neural networks (RFNNs) using boosting theory. RFRBoost uses random features at each layer to learn the functional gradient of the network representation, enhancing performance while preserving the convex optimization benefits of RFNNs. In the case of MSE loss, we obtain closed-form solutions to greedy layer-wise boosting with random features. For general loss functions, we show that fitting random feature residual blocks reduces to solving a quadratically constrained least squares problem. Through extensive numerical experiments on tabular datasets for both regression and classification, we show that RFRBoost significantly outperforms RFNNs and end-to-end trained MLP ResNets in the small- to medium-scale regime where RFNNs are typically applied. Moreover, RFRBoost offers substantial computational benefits, and theoretical guarantees stemming from boosting theory.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Robustness in Two-Stage Learning-to-Defer: Algorithms and Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-stage Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables optimal task delegation by assigning each input to either a fixed main model or one of several offline experts, supporting reliable decision-making in complex, multi-agent environments. However, existing L2D frameworks assume clean inputs and are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that can manipulate query allocation--causing costly misrouting or expert overload. We present the first comprehensive study of adversarial robustness in two-stage L2D systems. We introduce two novel attack strategie--untargeted and targeted--which respectively disrupt optimal allocations or force queries to specific agents. To defend against such threats, we propose SARD, a convex learning algorithm built on a family of surrogate losses that are provably Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$-consistent. These guarantees hold across classification, regression, and multi-task settings. Empirical results demonstrate that SARD significantly improves robustness under adversarial attacks while maintaining strong clean performance, marking a critical step toward secure and trustworthy L2D deployment.</description>

      <title>iLOCO: Distribution-Free Inference for Feature Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature importance measures are widely studied and are essential for understanding model behavior, guiding feature selection, and enhancing interpretability. However, many machine learning fitted models involve complex interactions between features. Existing feature importance metrics fail to capture these pairwise or higher-order effects, while existing interaction metrics often suffer from limited applicability or excessive computation; no methods exist to conduct statistical inference for feature interactions. To bridge this gap, we first propose a new model-agnostic metric, interaction Leave-One-Covariate-Out (iLOCO), for measuring the importance of pairwise feature interactions, with extensions to higher-order interactions. Next, we leverage recent advances in LOCO inference to develop distribution-free and assumption-light confidence intervals for our iLOCO metric. To address computational challenges, we also introduce an ensemble learning method for calculating the iLOCO metric and confidence intervals that we show is both computationally and statistically efficient. We validate our iLOCO metric and our confidence intervals on both synthetic and real data sets, showing that our approach outperforms existing methods and provides the first inferential approach to detecting feature interactions.</description>

      <title>Model Selection for Gaussian-gated Gaussian Mixture of Experts Using Dendrograms of Mixing Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models constitute a widely utilized class of ensemble learning approaches in statistics and machine learning, known for their flexibility and computational efficiency. They have become integral components in numerous state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures, particularly for analyzing heterogeneous data across diverse domains. Despite their practical success, the theoretical understanding of model selection, especially concerning the optimal number of mixture components or experts, remains limited and poses significant challenges. These challenges primarily stem from the inclusion of covariates in both the Gaussian gating functions and expert networks, which introduces intrinsic interactions governed by partial differential equations with respect to their parameters. In this paper, we revisit the concept of dendrograms of mixing measures and introduce a novel extension to Gaussian-gated Gaussian MoE models that enables consistent estimation of the true number of mixture components and achieves the pointwise optimal convergence rate for parameter estimation in overfitted scenarios. Notably, this approach circumvents the need to train and compare a range of models with varying numbers of components, thereby alleviating the computational burden, particularly in high-dimensional or deep neural network settings. Experimental results on synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately recovering the number of experts. It outperforms common criteria such as the Akaike information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion, and the integrated completed likelihood, while achieving optimal convergence rates for parameter estimation and accurately approximating the regression function.</description>

      <title>Minimum-Excess-Work Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a regularization framework inspired by thermodynamic work for guiding pre-trained probability flow generative models (e.g., continuous normalizing flows or diffusion models) by minimizing excess work, a concept rooted in statistical mechanics and with strong conceptual connections to optimal transport. Our approach enables efficient guidance in sparse-data regimes common to scientific applications, where only limited target samples or partial density constraints are available. We introduce two strategies: Path Guidance for sampling rare transition states by concentrating probability mass on user-defined subsets, and Observable Guidance for aligning generated distributions with experimental observables while preserving entropy. We demonstrate the framework's versatility on a coarse-grained protein model, guiding it to sample transition configurations between folded/unfolded states and correct systematic biases using experimental data. The method bridges thermodynamic principles with modern generative architectures, offering a principled, efficient, and physics-inspired alternative to standard fine-tuning in data-scarce domains. Empirical results highlight improved sample efficiency and bias reduction, underscoring its applicability to molecular simulations and beyond.</description>

      <title>A Linear Approach to Data Poisoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the theoretical foundations of data poisoning attacks in machine learning models. Our analysis reveals that the Hessian with respect to the input serves as a diagnostic tool for detecting poisoning, exhibiting spectral signatures that characterize compromised datasets. We use random matrix theory (RMT) to develop a theory for the impact of poisoning proportion and regularisation on attack efficacy in linear regression. Through QR stepwise regression, we study the spectral signatures of the Hessian in multi-output regression. We perform experiments on deep networks to show experimentally that this theory extends to modern convolutional and transformer networks under the cross-entropy loss. Based on these insights we develop preliminary algorithms to determine if a network has been poisoned and remedies which do not require further training.</description>

      <title>TULiP: Test-time Uncertainty Estimation via Linearization and Weight Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A reliable uncertainty estimation method is the foundation of many modern out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors, which are critical for safe deployments of deep learning models in the open world. In this work, we propose TULiP, a theoretically-driven post-hoc uncertainty estimator for OOD detection. Our approach considers a hypothetical perturbation applied to the network before convergence. Based on linearized training dynamics, we bound the effect of such perturbation, resulting in an uncertainty score computable by perturbing model parameters. Ultimately, our approach computes uncertainty from a set of sampled predictions. We visualize our bound on synthetic regression and classification datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TULiP using large-scale OOD detection benchmarks for image classification. Our method exhibits state-of-the-art performance, particularly for near-distribution samples.</description>

      <title>Architecture Selection via the Trade-off Between Accuracy and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01354</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.01354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a general framework for characterizing the trade-off between accuracy and robustness in supervised learning. We propose a method and define quantities to characterize the trade-off between accuracy and robustness for a given architecture, and provide theoretical insight into the trade-off. Specifically we introduce a simple trade-off curve, define and study an influence function that captures the sensitivity, under adversarial attack, of the optima of a given loss function. We further show how adversarial training regularizes the parameters in an over-parameterized linear model, recovering the LASSO and ridge regression as special cases, which also allows us to theoretically analyze the behavior of the trade-off curve. In experiments, we demonstrate the corresponding trade-off curves of neural networks and how they vary with respect to factors such as number of layers, neurons, and across different network structures. Such information provides a useful guideline to architecture selection.</description>

      <title>Integrating Random Forests and Generalized Linear Models for Improved Accuracy and Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random forests (RFs) are among the most popular supervised learning algorithms due to their nonlinear flexibility and ease-of-use. However, as black box models, they can only be interpreted via algorithmically-defined feature importance methods, such as Mean Decrease in Impurity (MDI), which have been observed to be highly unstable and have ambiguous scientific meaning. Furthermore, they can perform poorly in the presence of smooth or additive structure. To address this, we reinterpret decision trees and MDI as linear regression and $R^2$ values, respectively, with respect to engineered features associated with the tree's decision splits. This allows us to combine the respective strengths of RFs and generalized linear models in a framework called RF+, which also yields an improved feature importance method we call MDI+. Through extensive data-inspired simulations and real-world datasets, we show that RF+ improves prediction accuracy over RFs and that MDI+ outperforms popular feature importance measures in identifying signal features, often yielding more than a 10% improvement over its closest competitor. In case studies on drug response prediction and breast cancer subtyping, we further show that MDI+ extracts well-established genes with significantly greater stability compared to existing feature importance measures.</description>

      <title>Achieving Linear Speedup with ProxSkip in Distributed Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ProxSkip algorithm for distributed optimization is gaining increasing attention due to its proven benefits in accelerating communication complexity while maintaining robustness against data heterogeneity. However, existing analyses of ProxSkip are limited to the strongly convex setting and do not achieve linear speedup, where convergence performance increases linearly with respect to the number of nodes. So far, questions remain open about how ProxSkip behaves in the non-convex setting and whether linear speedup is achievable. In this paper, we revisit distributed ProxSkip and address both questions. We demonstrate that the leading communication complexity of ProxSkip is $\mathcal{O}(\frac{p\sigma^2}{n\epsilon^2})$ for non-convex and convex settings, and $\mathcal{O}(\frac{p\sigma^2}{n\epsilon})$ for the strongly convex setting, where $n$ represents the number of nodes, $p$ denotes the probability of communication, $\sigma^2$ signifies the level of stochastic noise, and $\epsilon$ denotes the desired accuracy level. This result illustrates that ProxSkip achieves linear speedup and can asymptotically reduce communication overhead proportional to the probability of communication. Additionally, for the strongly convex setting, we further prove that ProxSkip can achieve linear speedup with network-independent stepsizes.</description>

      <title>Compact Matrix Quantum Group Equivariant Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group equivariant neural networks have proven effective in modelling a wide range of tasks where the data lives in a classical geometric space and exhibits well-defined group symmetries. However, these networks are not suitable for learning from data that lives in a non-commutative geometry, described formally by non-commutative $C^{*}$-algebras, since the $C^{*}$-algebra of continuous functions on a compact matrix group is commutative. To address this limitation, we derive the existence of a new type of equivariant neural network, called compact matrix quantum group equivariant neural networks, which encode symmetries that are described by compact matrix quantum groups. We characterise the weight matrices that appear in these neural networks for the easy compact matrix quantum groups, which are defined by set partitions. As a result, we obtain new characterisations of equivariant weight matrices for some compact matrix groups that have not appeared previously in the machine learning literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze geometric aspects of the gradient descent algorithm in Deep Learning (DL), and give a detailed discussion of the circumstance that in underparametrized DL networks, zero loss minimization can generically not be attained. As a consequence, we conclude that the distribution of training inputs must necessarily be non-generic in order to produce zero loss minimizers, both for the method constructed in [Chen-Munoz Ewald 2023, 2024], or for gradient descent [Chen 2025] (which assume clustering of training data).</description>

      <title>Explaining Black-box Model Predictions via Two-level Nested Feature Attributions with Consistency Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Techniques that explain the predictions of black-box machine learning models are crucial to make the models transparent, thereby increasing trust in AI systems. The input features to the models often have a nested structure that consists of high- and low-level features, and each high-level feature is decomposed into multiple low-level features. For such inputs, both high-level feature attributions (HiFAs) and low-level feature attributions (LoFAs) are important for better understanding the model's decision. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic local explanation method that effectively exploits the nested structure of the input to estimate the two-level feature attributions simultaneously. A key idea of the proposed method is to introduce the consistency property that should exist between the HiFAs and LoFAs, thereby bridging the separate optimization problems for estimating them. Thanks to this consistency property, the proposed method can produce HiFAs and LoFAs that are both faithful to the black-box models and consistent with each other, using a smaller number of queries to the models. In experiments on image classification in multiple instance learning and text classification using language models, we demonstrate that the HiFAs and LoFAs estimated by the proposed method are accurate, faithful to the behaviors of the black-box models, and provide consistent explanations.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction for Ensembles: Improving Efficiency via Score-Based Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distribution-free uncertainty estimation for ensemble methods is increasingly desirable due to the widening deployment of multi-modal black-box predictive models. Conformal prediction is one approach that avoids such distributional assumptions. Methods for conformal aggregation have in turn been proposed for ensembled prediction, where the prediction regions of individual models are merged as to retain coverage guarantees while minimizing conservatism. Merging the prediction regions directly, however, sacrifices structures present in the conformal scores that can further reduce conservatism. We, therefore, propose a novel framework that extends the standard scalar formulation of a score function to a multivariate score that produces more efficient prediction regions. We then demonstrate that such a framework can be efficiently leveraged in both classification and predict-then-optimize regression settings downstream and empirically show the advantage over alternate conformal aggregation methods.</description>

      <title>A New Forward Discriminant Analysis Framework Based On Pillai's Trace and ULDA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), a traditional classification tool, suffers from limitations such as sensitivity to noise and computational challenges when dealing with non-invertible within-class scatter matrices. Traditional stepwise LDA frameworks, which iteratively select the most informative features, often exacerbate these issues by relying heavily on Wilks' $\Lambda$, potentially causing premature stopping of the selection process. This paper introduces a novel forward discriminant analysis framework that integrates Pillai's trace with Uncorrelated Linear Discriminant Analysis (ULDA) to address these challenges, and offers a unified and stand-alone classifier. Through simulations and real-world datasets, the new framework demonstrates effective control of Type I error rates and improved classification accuracy, particularly in cases involving perfect group separations. The results highlight the potential of this approach as a robust alternative to the traditional stepwise LDA framework.</description>

      <title>Score-based Pullback Riemannian Geometry: Extracting the Data Manifold Geometry using Anisotropic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven Riemannian geometry has emerged as a powerful tool for interpretable representation learning, offering improved efficiency in downstream tasks. Moving forward, it is crucial to balance cheap manifold mappings with efficient training algorithms. In this work, we integrate concepts from pullback Riemannian geometry and generative models to propose a framework for data-driven Riemannian geometry that is scalable in both geometry and learning: score-based pullback Riemannian geometry. Focusing on unimodal distributions as a first step, we propose a score-based Riemannian structure with closed-form geodesics that pass through the data probability density. With this structure, we construct a Riemannian autoencoder (RAE) with error bounds for discovering the correct data manifold dimension. This framework can naturally be used with anisotropic normalizing flows by adopting isometry regularization during training. Through numerical experiments on diverse datasets, including image data, we demonstrate that the proposed framework produces high-quality geodesics passing through the data support, reliably estimates the intrinsic dimension of the data manifold, and provides a global chart of the manifold. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable framework for extracting the complete geometry of the data manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22559v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disentanglement, or identifying statistically independent factors of the data, is relevant to much of machine learning, from controlled data generation and robust classification to efficient encoding and improving our understanding of the data itself. Disentanglement arises in several generative paradigms including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks and diffusion models. Prior work takes a step towards understanding disentanglement in VAEs by showing diagonal posterior covariance matrices promote orthogonality between columns of the decoder's Jacobian. Building on this, we close the gap in our understanding of disentanglement by showing how if follows from such orthogonality and equates to factoring the data distribution into statistically independent components.</description>

      <title>FoLDTree: A ULDA-Based Decision Tree Framework for Efficient Oblique Splits and Feature Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional decision trees are limited by axis-orthogonal splits, which can perform poorly when true decision boundaries are oblique. While oblique decision tree methods address this limitation, they often face high computational costs, difficulties with multi-class classification, and a lack of effective feature selection. In this paper, we introduce LDATree and FoLDTree, two novel frameworks that integrate Uncorrelated Linear Discriminant Analysis (ULDA) and Forward ULDA into a decision tree structure. These methods enable efficient oblique splits, handle missing values, support feature selection, and provide both class labels and probabilities as model outputs. Through evaluations on simulated and real-world datasets, LDATree and FoLDTree consistently outperform axis-orthogonal and other oblique decision tree methods, achieving accuracy levels comparable to the random forest. The results highlight the potential of these frameworks as robust alternatives to traditional single-tree methods.</description>

      <title>The Alpha-Alternator: Dynamic Adaptation To Varying Noise Levels In Sequences Using The Vendi Score For Improved Robustness and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art dynamical models, such as Mamba, assume the same level of noisiness for all elements of a given sequence, which limits their performance on noisy temporal data. In this paper, we introduce the $\alpha$-Alternator, a novel generative model for time-dependent data that dynamically adapts to the complexity introduced by varying noise levels in sequences. The $\alpha$-Alternator leverages the Vendi Score (VS), a flexible similarity-based diversity metric, to adjust, at each time step $t$, the influence of the sequence element at time $t$ and the latent representation of the dynamics up to that time step on the predicted future dynamics. This influence is captured by a parameter that is learned and shared across all sequences in a given dataset. The sign of this parameter determines the direction of influence. A negative value indicates a noisy dataset, where a sequence element that increases the VS is considered noisy, and the model relies more on the latent history when processing that element. Conversely, when the parameter is positive, a sequence element that increases the VS is considered informative, and the $\alpha$-Alternator relies more on this new input than on the latent history when updating its predicted latent dynamics. The $\alpha$-Alternator is trained using a combination of observation masking and Alternator loss minimization. Masking simulates varying noise levels in sequences, enabling the model to be more robust to these fluctuations and improving its performance in trajectory prediction, imputation, and forecasting. Our experimental results demonstrate that the $\alpha$-Alternator outperforms both Alternators and state-of-the-art state-space models across neural decoding and time-series forecasting benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: The dynamics of learning in modern large AI systems is hierarchical, often characterized by abrupt, qualitative shifts akin to phase transitions observed in physical systems. While these phenomena hold promise for uncovering the mechanisms behind neural networks and language models, existing theories remain fragmented, addressing specific cases. In this position paper, we advocate for the crucial role of the research direction of parameter symmetries in unifying these fragmented theories. This position is founded on a centralizing hypothesis for this direction: parameter symmetry breaking and restoration are the unifying mechanisms underlying the hierarchical learning behavior of AI models. We synthesize prior observations and theories to argue that this direction of research could lead to a unified understanding of three distinct hierarchies in neural networks: learning dynamics, model complexity, and representation formation. By connecting these hierarchies, our position paper elevates symmetry -- a cornerstone of theoretical physics -- to become a potential fundamental principle in modern AI.</description>

      <title>Causal Lifting of Neural Representations: Zero-Shot Generalization for Causal Inferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many scientific domains, the cost of data annotation limits the scale and pace of experimentation. Yet, modern machine learning systems offer a promising alternative, provided their predictions yield correct conclusions. We focus on Prediction-Powered Causal Inferences (PPCI), i.e., estimating the treatment effect in a target experiment with unlabeled factual outcomes, retrievable zero-shot from a pre-trained model. We first identify the conditional calibration property to guarantee valid PPCI at population level. Then, we introduce causal lifting, a new causal lifting constraint transferring validity across experiments, which we propose to enforce in practice in Deconfounded Empirical Risk Minimization, our new model-agnostic training objective. We validate our method on synthetic and real-world scientific data, offering solutions to instances not solvable by vanilla Empirical Risk Minimization and invariant training. In particular, we solve zero-shot PPCI on the ISTAnt dataset for the first time, fine-tuning a foundational model on our replica dataset of their ecological experiment with a different recording platform and treatment.</description>

      <title>Partial-Label Learning with Conformal Candidate Cleaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world data is often ambiguous; for example, human annotation produces instances with multiple conflicting class labels. Partial-label learning (PLL) aims at training a classifier in this challenging setting, where each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels and one correct, but unknown, class label. A multitude of algorithms targeting this setting exists and, to enhance their prediction quality, several extensions that are applicable across a wide range of PLL methods have been introduced. While many of these extensions rely on heuristics, this article proposes a novel enhancing method that incrementally prunes candidate sets using conformal prediction. To work around the missing labeled validation set, which is typically required for conformal prediction, we propose a strategy that alternates between training a PLL classifier to label the validation set, leveraging these predicted class labels for calibration, and pruning candidate labels that are not part of the resulting conformal sets. In this sense, our method alternates between empirical risk minimization and candidate set pruning. We establish that our pruning method preserves the conformal validity with respect to the unknown ground truth. Our extensive experiments on artificial and real-world data show that the proposed approach significantly improves the test set accuracies of several state-of-the-art PLL classifiers.</description>

      <title>MixMin: Finding Data Mixtures via Convex Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning pipelines are increasingly combining and mixing data from diverse and disparate sources, e.g., pre-training large language models. Yet, finding the optimal data mixture is a challenging and open problem. We formalize this data mixing problem as a bi-level objective: the best mixture is the one that would lead to the best model for a downstream objective. Unfortunately, this objective is generally intractable. In this paper, we make the observation that the bi-level data mixing objective becomes convex as our model class becomes larger. We develop and study a gradient-based approach for optimizing this convex objective, which we call MixMin, and test it on language modeling and chemistry tasks. MixMin was the only method that uniformly improved the data mixture in all our experiments. With MixMin, we improved the data mixture using less than 0.2% additional compute for a pythia-410M model trained on 8.2B tokens, resulting between 1-5% relative improvement to negative log likelihood on PIQA, ARC Easy, SciQ, and OpenWebMath. Crucially, we found that MixMin mixtures for smaller models improved training of larger models, suggesting that MixMin mixtures may be scale-invariant. When mixing bioassay data to train an XGBoost model, we saw improvements to average precision scores of 0.03-0.15.</description>

      <title>Permutation Equivariant Neural Networks for Symmetric Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating permutation equivariance into neural networks has proven to be useful in ensuring that models respect symmetries that exist in data. Symmetric tensors, which naturally appear in statistics, machine learning, and graph theory, are essential for many applications in physics, chemistry, and materials science, amongst others. However, existing research on permutation equivariant models has not explored symmetric tensors as inputs, and most prior work on learning from these tensors has focused on equivariance to Euclidean groups. In this paper, we present two different characterisations of all linear permutation equivariant functions between symmetric power spaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We show on two tasks that these functions are highly data efficient compared to standard MLPs and have potential to generalise well to symmetric tensors of different sizes.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding the Benefits of Neural Network Parameterizations in Geophysical Inversions: A Study With Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we employ neural fields, which use neural networks to map a coordinate to the corresponding physical property value at that coordinate, in a test-time learning manner. For a test-time learning method, the weights are learned during the inversion, as compared to traditional approaches which require a network to be trained using a training dataset. Results for synthetic examples in seismic tomography and direct current resistivity inversions are shown first. We then perform a singular value decomposition analysis on the Jacobian of the weights of the neural network (SVD analysis) for both cases to explore the effects of neural networks on the recovered model. The results show that the test-time learning approach can eliminate unwanted artifacts in the recovered subsurface physical property model caused by the sensitivity of the survey and physics. Therefore, NFs-Inv improves the inversion results compared to the conventional inversion in some cases such as the recovery of the dip angle or the prediction of the boundaries of the main target. In the SVD analysis, we observe similar patterns in the left-singular vectors as were observed in some diffusion models, trained in a supervised manner, for generative tasks in computer vision. This observation provides evidence that there is an implicit bias, which is inherent in neural network structures, that is useful in supervised learning and test-time learning models. This implicit bias has the potential to be useful for recovering models in geophysical inversions.</description>

      <title>StealthRank: LLM Ranking Manipulation via Stealthy Prompt Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into information retrieval systems introduces new attack surfaces, particularly for adversarial ranking manipulations. We present $\textbf{StealthRank}$, a novel adversarial attack method that manipulates LLM-driven ranking systems while maintaining textual fluency and stealth. Unlike existing methods that often introduce detectable anomalies, StealthRank employs an energy-based optimization framework combined with Langevin dynamics to generate StealthRank Prompts (SRPs)-adversarial text sequences embedded within item or document descriptions that subtly yet effectively influence LLM ranking mechanisms. We evaluate StealthRank across multiple LLMs, demonstrating its ability to covertly boost the ranking of target items while avoiding explicit manipulation traces. Our results show that StealthRank consistently outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial ranking baselines in both effectiveness and stealth, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in LLM-driven ranking systems. Our code is publicly available at $\href{https://github.com/Tangyiming205069/controllable-seo}{here}$.</description>

      <title>Identifying Causal Direction via Variational Bayesian Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Telling apart the cause and effect between two random variables with purely observational data is a challenging problem that finds applications in various scientific disciplines. A key principle utilized in this task is the algorithmic Markov condition, which postulates that the joint distribution, when factorized according to the causal direction, yields a more succinct codelength compared to the anti-causal direction. Previous approaches approximate these codelengths by relying on simple functions or Gaussian processes (GPs) with easily evaluable complexity, compromising between model fitness and computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose leveraging the variational Bayesian learning of neural networks as an interpretation of the codelengths. Consequently, we can enhance the model fitness while promoting the succinctness of the codelengths, while avoiding the significant computational complexity of the GP-based approaches. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks in cause-effect identification demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, surpassing the overall performance of related complexity-based and structural causal model regression-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Fair Clustering via Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic fairness in clustering aims to balance the proportions of instances assigned to each cluster with respect to a given sensitive attribute. While recently developed fair clustering algorithms optimize clustering objectives under specific fairness constraints, their inherent complexity or approximation often results in suboptimal clustering utility or numerical instability in practice. To resolve these limitations, we propose a new fair clustering algorithm based on a novel decomposition of the fair $K$-means clustering objective function. The proposed algorithm, called Fair Clustering via Alignment (FCA), operates by alternately (i) finding a joint probability distribution to align the data from different protected groups, and (ii) optimizing cluster centers in the aligned space. A key advantage of FCA is that it theoretically guarantees approximately optimal clustering utility for any given fairness level without complex constraints, thereby enabling high-utility fair clustering in practice. Experiments show that FCA outperforms existing methods by (i) attaining a superior trade-off between fairness level and clustering utility, and (ii) achieving near-perfect fairness without numerical instability.</description>
