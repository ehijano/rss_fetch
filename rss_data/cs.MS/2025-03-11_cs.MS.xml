      <title>InfoFusion Controller: Informed TRRT Star with Mutual Information based on Fusion of Pure Pursuit and MPC for Enhanced Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the InfoFusion Controller, an advanced path planning algorithm that integrates both global and local planning strategies to enhance autonomous driving in complex urban environments. The global planner utilizes the informed Theta-Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star (Informed-TRRT*) algorithm to generate an optimal reference path, while the local planner combines Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Pure Pursuit algorithms. Mutual Information (MI) is employed to fuse the outputs of the MPC and Pure Pursuit controllers, effectively balancing their strengths and compensating for their weaknesses. The proposed method addresses the challenges of navigating in dynamic environments with unpredictable obstacles by reducing uncertainty in local path planning and improving dynamic obstacle avoidance capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that the InfoFusion Controller outperforms traditional methods in terms of safety, stability, and efficiency across various scenarios, including complex maps generated using SLAM techniques.
  The code for the InfoFusion Controller is available at https: //github.com/DrawingProcess/InfoFusionController.</description>

      <title>A Sparse Tensor Generator with Efficient Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse tensor operations are increasingly important in diverse applications such as social networks, deep learning, diagnosis, crime, and review analysis. However, a major obstacle in sparse tensor research is the lack of large-scale sparse tensor datasets. Another challenge lies in analyzing sparse tensor features, which are essential not only for understanding the nonzero pattern but also for selecting the most suitable storage format, decomposition algorithm, and reordering methods. However, due to the large size of real-world tensors, even extracting these features can be computationally expensive without careful optimization. To address these limitations, we have developed a smart sparse tensor generator that replicates key characteristics of real sparse tensors. Additionally, we propose efficient methods for extracting a comprehensive set of sparse tensor features. The effectiveness of our generator is validated through the quality of extracted features and the performance of decomposition on the generated tensors. Both the sparse tensor feature extractor and the tensor generator are open source with all the artifacts available at https://github.com/sparcityeu/FeaTensor and https://github.com/sparcityeu/GenTensor, respectively.</description>
