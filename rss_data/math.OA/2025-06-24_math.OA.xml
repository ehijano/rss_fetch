      <title>On the Jordan-Chevalley-Dunford decomposition of operators in type $I$ Murray-von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, for $n \ge 3$, the mapping on $M_n(\mathbb{C})$ which sends a matrix to its diagonalizable part in its Jordan-Chevalley decomposition, is {\bf norm-unbounded} on any neighbourhood of the zero matrix. Let $X$ be a Stonean space, and $\mathcal{N}(X)$ denote the $*$-algebra of (unbounded) normal functions on $X$, containing $C(X)$ as a $*$-subalgebra. We show that every element of $M_n\big(\mathcal{N}(X)\big)$ has a unique Jordan-Chevalley decomposition. Furthermore, when $n \ge 3$ and $X$ has infinitely many points, using the unboundedness of the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition, we show that there is an element of $M_n\big(C(X)\big)$ whose diagonalizable and nilpotent parts are not bounded, that is, do not lie in $M_n\big(C(X)\big)$. Using these results in the context of a type $I$ finite von Neumann algebra $\mathscr{N}$, we prove a canonical Jordan-Chevalley-Dunford decomposition for densely-defined closed operators affiliated with $\mathscr{N}$, expressing each such operator as the strong-sum of a unique commuting pair consisting of (what we call) a $\mathfrak{u}$-scalar-type affiliated operator and an $\mathfrak{m}$-quasinilpotent affiliated operator. The functorial nature of Murray-von Neumann algebras, coupled with the above observations, indicates that considering unbounded affiliated operators is both necessary and natural in the quest for a Jordan-Chevalley-Dunford decomposition for bounded operators in type $II_1$ von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>Brown-Voiculescu entropy revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aided by the tools and outlook provided by modern classification theory, we take a new look at the Brown-Voiculescu entropy of endomorphisms of nuclear C*-algebras. In particular, we introduce `coloured' versions of noncommutative topological entropy suitable for C*-algebras A of finite nuclear dimension or finite decomposition rank. In the latter case, assuming further that A is simple, separable, unital, satisfies the UCT and has finitely many extremal traces, we prove a variational type principle in terms of quasidiagonal approximations relative to this finite set of traces. Building on work of Kerr, we also show that infinite entropy occurs generically among endomorphisms and automorphisms of certain classifiable C*-algebras that function as noncommutative spaces of observables of topological manifolds.</description>

      <title>The Baum-Connes conjecture for extensions revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we verify that the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients is closed under group extensions. More precisely, for an extension $1\rightarrow N \rightarrow \Gamma \rightarrow \Gamma / N \rightarrow 1$ of discrete countable groups, we prove that the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients holds for $\Gamma$ if it holds for $N$ and $\Gamma / N$. This result will enlarge the class of groups satisfying the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of the B\"{o}ttcher-Wenzel inequality for three rectangular matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $m,n$ be positive integers. For all $m\times n$ complex matrices $A, C$ and an $n\times m$ matrix $B$, we define a generalized commutator as $ABC-CBA$. We estimated the Frobenius norm of it, and finally got the inequality, which is a generalization of the B\"{o}ttcher-Wenzel inequality. If $n=1$ or $m=1$, then the Frobenius norm of $ABC-CBA$ can be estimated with a tighter upper bound.</description>

      <title>An operator system approach to self-testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for self-testing, in which bipartite correlations are described by states on the commuting tensor product of a pair of operator systems. We propose a definition of a local isometry between bipartite quantum systems in the commuting operator model, and define self-testing and abstract self-testing in the latter generality. We show that self-tests are in the general case always abstract self-tests and that, in some cases, the converse is also true. We apply our framework in a variety of instances, including to correlations with quantum inputs and outputs, quantum commuting correlations for the CHSH game, synchronous correlations, contextuality scenarios, quantum colourings and Schur quantum channels.</description>

      <title>Proper cocycles, measure equivalence and $L_p$-Fourier multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new transference method for completely bounded $L_p$-Fourier multipliers via proper cocycles arising from probability measure-preserving group actions. This method extends earlier results by Haagerup and Jolissaint, which were limited to the case $p = \infty$. Based on this approach, we present a new and simple proof of the main result in [Hong-Wang-Wang, Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 2024] regarding the pointwise convergence of noncommutative Fourier series on amenable groups, refining the associated estimate for maximal inequalities. In addition, this framework yields a transference principle for $L_p$-Fourier multipliers from lattices in linear Lie groups to their ambient groups, establishing a noncommutative analogue of Jodeit's theorem. As a further application, we construct a natural analogue of the Hilbert transform on $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>The Lifting Property for Frame Multipliers and Toeplitz Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frame multipliers are an abstract version of Toeplitz operators in frame theory and consist of a composition of a multiplication operator with the analysis and synthesis operators. Whereas the boundedness properties of frame multipliers on Banach spaces associated to a frame, so-called coorbit spaces, are well understood, their invertibility is much more difficult. We show that frame multipliers with a positive symbol are Banach space isomorphisms between the corresponding coorbit spaces. The results resemble the lifting theorems in the theory of Besov spaces and modulation spaces. Indeed, the application of the abstract lifting theorem to Gabor frames yields a new lifting theorem between modulation spaces. A second application to Fock spaces yields isomorphisms between weighted Fock spaces.
  The main techniques are the theory of localized frames and existence of inverse-closed matrix algebras.</description>

      <title>Unique Games and Games Based on Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study unique games and estimate some of their values. We prove that if a unique game has a quantum-assisted value close to 1, then it must have a perfect deterministic strategy. We introduce a family of unique games based on groups that generalize XOR games, and show that when the group is the cyclic group of order 3, then these games correspond to a 3-labelling problem for directed graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is an introduction to advanced linear algebra, with emphasis on geometric aspects, and with some applications included too. We first review basic linear algebra, notably with the spectral theorem in its general form, and with the theory of the resultant and discriminant. Then we discuss the Jordan form and its basic applications to physics, and other advanced decomposition results for the matrices. We then go into positivity topics, involving matrices and bilinear forms, and with a look into curved space-time, and discrete Laplacians. Finally, we discuss the various groups of matrices, with a look at reflection groups, Lie groups, spin matrices, and random matrices.</description>

      <title>The coarse Baum-Connes conjecture with filtered coefficients and product metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the quantitative $K$-theory, in this paper, we introduce the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture with filtered coefficients which generalizes the original conjecture. There are two advantages for the conjecture with filtered coefficients. Firstly, the routes toward the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture also work for the conjecture with filtered coefficients. Secondly, the class of metric spaces that satisfy the conjecture with filtered coefficients is closed under products and yet it is unknown for the original conjecture. As an application, we discover some new examples of product metric spaces for the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We establish conditions under which an inclusion of finitely aligned left-cancellative small categories induces inclusions of twisted C*-algebras. We also present an example of an inclusion of finitely aligned left-cancellative monoids that does not induce a homomorphism even between (untwisted) Toeplitz algebras. We prove that the twisted C*-algebras of a jointly faithful self-similar action of a countable discrete amenable groupoid on a row-finite k-graph with no sources, with respect to homotopic cocycles, have isomorphic K-theory.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate heat semigroups on a quantum automorphism group ${\rm Aut}^+(B)$ of a finite dimensional C*-algebra $B$ and its Plancherel trace. We show ultracontractivity, hypercontractivity, and the spectral gap inequality of the heat semigroups on ${\rm Aut}^+(B)$. Furthermore, we obtain the sharpness of the Sobolev embedding property and the Hausdorff-Young inequality of ${\rm Aut}^+(B)$.</description>
