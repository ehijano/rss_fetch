      <title>Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Black-Box Distributive Expanded Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a finite set of finitary operation symbols. An $\Omega$-expanded group is a group (written additively and called the additive group of the $\Omega$-expanded group) with an $\Omega$-algebra structure. We use the black-box model of computation in $\Omega$-expanded groups. In this model, elements of a finite $\Omega$-expanded group $H$ are represented (not necessarily uniquely) by bit strings of the same length, say, $n$. Given representations of elements of $H$, equality testing and the fundamental operations of $H$ are performed by an oracle.
  Assume that $H$ is distributive, i.e., all its fundamental operations associated with nonnullary operation symbols in $\Omega$ are distributive over addition. Suppose $s=(s_1,\dots,s_m)$ is a generating system of $H$. In this paper, we present probabilistic polynomial-time black-box $\Omega$-expanded group algorithms for the following problems: (i) given $(1^n,s)$, construct a generating system of the additive group of $H$, (ii) given $(1^n,s,(t_1,\dots,t_k))$ with $t_1,\dots,t_k\in H$, find a generating system of the additive group of the ideal in $H$ generated by $\{t_1,\dots,t_k\}$, and (iii) given $(1^n,s)$, decide whether $H\in\mathfrak V$, where $\mathfrak V$ is an arbitrary finitely based variety of distributive $\Omega$-expanded groups with nilpotent additive groups. The error probability of these algorithms is exponentially small in $n$. In particular, this can be applied to groups, rings, $R$-modules, and $R$-algebras, where $R$ is a fixed finitely generated commutative associative ring with $1$. Rings and $R$-algebras may be here with or without $1$, where $1$ is considered as a nullary fundamental operation.</description>

      <title>Extended $\mathcal{O}$-operators, Novikov Yang-Baxter equations and post-Novikov algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the definition of extended $\mathcal{O}$-operators on a Novikov algebra $(A,\circ)$ associated to an $A$-bimodule Novikov algebra which is a generalization of the definition of $\mathcal{O}$-operators and show that there are new Novikov algebra structures on the $A$-bimodule Novikov algebra obtained from extended $\mathcal{O}$-operators. We also introduce the definition of post-Novikov algebras and show that there is a close relationship between post-Novikov algebras and $\mathcal{O}$-operators of weight $\lambda$. The tensor form of extended $\mathcal{O}$-operators is also investigated which leads to the definition of extended Novikov Yang-Baxter equations, which is a generalization of the notion of Novikov Yang-Baxter equations. The relationships between extended $\mathcal{O}$-operators, Novikov Yang-Baxter equations, extended Novikov Yang-Baxter equations and generalized Novikov Yang-Baxter equations are established.</description>

      <title>Cohomology, Homotopy, Extensions, and Automorphisms of Nijenhuis Lie Conformal Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores various algebraic and homotopical aspects of Nijenhuis Lie conformal algebras, including their cohomology theory, $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-structures, non-abelian extensions, and automorphism groups. We define the cohomology of a Nijenhuis Lie conformal algebra and relate it to the deformation theory of such structures. We also introduce $2$-term Nijenhuis $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-conformal algebras and establish their correspondence with crossed modules and $3$-cocycles in the cohomology of Nijenhuis Lie conformal algebras. Furthermore, we develop a classification theory for non-abelian extensions of Nijenhuis Lie conformal algebras via the second non-abelian cohomology group. Finally, we study the inducibility problem for automorphisms under such extensions, introducing a Wells-type map and deriving an associated exact sequence.</description>

      <title>The rank condition and strong rank conditions for Ore extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a ring, $\sigma:R\to R$ a ring endomorphism, and $\delta:R\to R$ a $\sigma$-derivation. We establish that the Ore extension $R[x;\sigma,\delta]$ satisfies the rank condition if and only if $R$ does. In addition, we prove analogous results for the right and left strong rank conditions. However, in the right case, the ``if" part requires the hypothesis that $\sigma$ is an automorphism, whereas, in the left case, this assumption is needed for the ``only if" part. Finally, we provide a new proof of an old result of Susan Montgomery stating that a skew power series ring is directly (respectively, stably) finite if and only if its coefficient ring is directly (respectively, stably) finite.</description>

      <title>Telescope conjecture for t-structures over noetherian path algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $RQ$ be the path algebra of a Dynkin quiver $Q$ over a commutative noetherian ring $R$. We show that any homotopically smashing t-structure in the derived category of $RQ$ is compactly generated. We also give a complete description of the compactly generated t-structures in terms of poset homomorphisms from the prime spectrum of the ring $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$ to the poset of filtrations of noncrossing partitions of the quiver $\mathrm{Filt}(\mathbf{Nc}(Q))$. In the case that $R$ is regular, we also get a complete description of the wide subcategories of the category $\mathrm{mod}(RQ)$.</description>
