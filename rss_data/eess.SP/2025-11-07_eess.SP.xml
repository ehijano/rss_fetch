      <title>Correlation and Temporal Consistency Analysis of Mono-static and Bi-static ISAC Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is critical for efficient spectrum and hardware utilization in future wireless networks like 6G. However, existing channel models lack comprehensive characterization of ISAC-specific dynamics, particularly the relationship between mono-static (co-located Tx/Rx) and bi-static (separated Tx/Rx) sensing configurations. Empirical measurements in dynamic urban microcell (UMi) environments using a 79-GHz FMCW channel sounder help bridge this gap. Two key findings are demonstrated: (1) mono-static and bi-static channels exhibit consistently low instantaneous correlation due to divergent propagation geometries; (2) despite low instantaneous correlation, both channels share unified temporal consistency, evolving predictably under environmental kinematics. These insights, validated across seven real-world scenarios with moving targets/transceivers, inform robust ISAC system design and future standardization.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Phase Shift Information Compression for IRS Systems: A Prompt Conditioned Variable Rate Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have become a vital technology for improving the spectrum and energy efficiency of forthcoming wireless networks. Nevertheless, practical implementation is obstructed by the excessive overhead associated with the frequent transmission of phase shift information (PSI) over bandwidth-constrained control lines. Current deep learning-based compression methods mitigate this problem but are constrained by elevated decoder complexity, inadequate flexibility to dynamic channels, and static compression ratios. This research presents a prompt-conditioned PSI compression system that integrates prompt learning inspired by large models into the PSI compression process to address these difficulties. A hybrid prompt technique that integrates soft prompt concatenation with feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) facilitates adaptive encoding across diverse signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), fading kinds, and compression ratios. Furthermore, a variable rate technique incorporates the compression ratio into the prompt embeddings through latent masking, enabling a singular model to adeptly balance reconstruction accuracy. Additionally, a lightweight depthwise convolutional gating (DWCG) decoder facilitates precise feature reconstruction with minimal complexity. Comprehensive simulations indicate that the proposed framework significantly reduces NMSE compared to traditional autoencoder baselines, while ensuring robustness across various channel circumstances and accommodating variable compression ratios within a single model. These findings underscore the framework's promise as a scalable and efficient solution for real-time IRS control in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Score-Based Quickest Change Detection and Fault Identification for Multi-Stream Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to multi-stream quickest change detection and fault isolation for unnormalized and score-based statistical models. Traditional optimal algorithms in the quickest change detection literature require explicit pre-change and post-change distributions to calculate the likelihood ratio of the observations, which can be computationally expensive for higher-dimensional data and sometimes even infeasible for complex machine learning models. To address these challenges, we propose the min-SCUSUM method, a Hyvarinen score-based algorithm that computes the difference of score functions in place of log-likelihood ratios. We provide a delay and false alarm analysis of the proposed algorithm, showing that its asymptotic performance depends on the Fisher divergence between the pre- and post-change distributions. Furthermore, we establish an upper bound on the probability of fault misidentification in distinguishing the affected stream from the unaffected ones.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Position Design for Movable Antenna Assisted LEO ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite-assisted integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems have been extensively studied to achieve ubiquitous connectivity. However, the severe signal attenuation and limited transmit power at LEO satellites can degrade ISAC performance. To address this issue, this paper investigated movable antenna (MA)-assisted LEO ISAC systems. We derive the communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the sensing squared position error bound (SPEB) for evaluating the ISAC performance. Then, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming and the MA positions to minimize the SPEB under the SINR constraints, total transmit power constraint, and several inherent physical constraints of the MA array. We first simplify the complex problem using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Then, we present a novel alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm to decouple the original problem into two subproblems, consequently convexified and solved. Simulations demonstrate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Better trade-off between communication and sensing performance, and at least 25% gain in sensing performance are achieved, compared to the benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Optimal RIS Placement in a Multi-User MISO System with User Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well established that the performance of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted systems critically depends on the optimal placement of the RIS. Previous works consider either simple coverage maximization or simultaneous optimization of the placement of the RIS along with the beamforming and reflection coefficients, most of which assume that the location of the RIS, base station (BS), and users are known. However, in practice, only the spatial variation of user density and obstacle configuration are likely to be known prior to deployment of the system. Thus, we formulate a non-convex problem that optimizes the position of the RIS over the expected minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the system with user randomness, assuming that the system employs joint beamforming after deployment. To solve this problem, we propose a recursive coarse-to-fine methodology that constructs a set of candidate locations for RIS placement based on the obstacle configuration and evaluates them over multiple instantiations from the user distribution. The search is recursively refined within the optimal region identified in each stage to determine the final optimal region for RIS deployment. Numerical results are presented to corroborate our findings.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Noise-Based Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of sixth-generation (6G) networks and the massive Internet of Things (IoT) demand wireless communication technologies that are ultra-low-power, secure, and covert. Noise-based communication has emerged as a transformative paradigm that meets these demands by encoding information directly into the statistical properties of noise, rather than using traditional deterministic carriers. This survey provides a comprehensive synthesis of this field, systematically exploring its fundamental principles and key methodologies, including thermal noise modulation (TherMod), noise modulation (NoiseMod) and its variants, and the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) secure key exchange. We address critical practical challenges such as channel estimation and hardware implementation, and highlight emerging applications in simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Our analysis confirms that noise-based systems offer unparalleled advantages in energy efficiency and covertness, and we conclude by outlining future research directions to realize their potential for enabling the next generation of autonomous and secure wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Tiny-WiFo: A Lightweight Wireless Foundation Model for Channel Prediction via Multi-Component Adaptive Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The massive scale of Wireless Foundation Models (FMs) hinders their real-time deployment on edge devices. This letter moves beyond standard knowledge distillation by introducing a novel Multi-Component Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (MCAKD) framework. Key innovations include a Cross-Attention-Based Knowledge Selection (CA-KS) module that selectively identifies critical features from the teacher model, and an Autonomous Learning-Passive Learning (AL-PL) strategy that balances knowledge transfer with independent learning to achieve high training efficiency at a manageable computational cost. When applied to the WiFo FM, the distilled Tiny-WiFo model, with only 5.5M parameters, achieves a 1.6 ms inference time on edge hardware while retaining over 98% of WiFo's performance and its crucial zero-shot generalization capability, making real-time FM deployment viable.</description>

      <title>Ambiguity Function Analysis of AFDM Under Pulse-Shaped Random ISAC Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the ambiguity function (AF) of the emerging affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) waveform for Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) signaling under a pulse shaping regime. Specifically, we first derive the closed-form expression of the average squared discrete period AF (DPAF) for AFDM waveform without pulse shaping, revealing that the AF depends on the parameter $c_1$ and the kurtosis of random communication data, while being independent of the parameter $c_2$. As a step further, we conduct a comprehensive analysis on the AFs of various waveforms, including AFDM, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and orthogonal chirp-division multiplexing (OCDM). Our results indicate that all three waveforms exhibit the same number of regular depressions in the sidelobes of their AFs, which incurs performance loss for detecting and estimating weak targets. However, the AFDM waveform can flexibly control the positions of depressions by adjusting the parameter $c_1$, which motivates a novel design approach of the AFDM parameters to mitigate the adverse impact of depressions of the strong target on the weak target. Furthermore, a closed-form expression of the average squared DPAF for pulse-shaped random AFDM waveform is derived, which demonstrates that the pulse shaping filter generates the shaped mainlobe along the delay axis and the rapid roll-off sidelobes along the Doppler axis. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of our theoretical analysis and proposed design methodology for the AFDM modulation.</description>

      <title>BTTDA: Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis for Brain-Computer Interfacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct communication between the brain and external devices, frequently using electroencephalography (EEG) to record neural activity. Dimensionality reduction and structured regularization are essential for effectively classifying task-related brain signals, including event-related potentials (ERPs) and motor imagery (MI) rhythms. Current tensor-based approaches, such as Tucker and PARAFAC decompositions, often lack the flexibility needed to fully capture the complexity of EEG data. This study introduces Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis (BTTDA): a novel tensor-based and supervised feature extraction method designed to enhance classification accuracy by providing flexible multilinear dimensionality reduction. Extending Higher Order Discriminant Analysis (HODA), BTTDA uses a novel and interpretable forward model for HODA combined with a deflation scheme to iteratively extract discriminant block terms, improving feature representation for classification. BTTDA and a sum-of-rank-1-terms variant PARAFACDA were evaluated on publicly available ERP (second-order tensors) and MI (third-order tensors) EEG datasets from the MOABB benchmarking framework. Benchmarking revealed that BTTDA and PARAFACDA significantly outperform the traditional HODA method in ERP decoding, resulting in state-of-the art performance (ROC-AUC = 91.25%). For MI, decoding results of HODA, BTTDA and PARAFACDA were subpar, but BTTDA still significantly outperformed HODA (64.52% &gt; 61.00%). The block-term structure of BTTDA enables interpretable and more efficient dimensionality reduction without compromising discriminative power. This offers a promising and adaptable approach for feature extraction in BCI and broader neuroimaging applications.</description>

      <title>RCMCL: A Unified Contrastive Learning Framework for Robust Multi-Modal (RGB-D, Skeleton, Point Cloud) Action Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human action recognition (HAR) with multi-modal inputs (RGB-D, skeleton, point cloud) can achieve high accuracy but typically relies on large labeled datasets and degrades sharply when sensors fail or are noisy. We present Robust Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning (RCMCL), a self-supervised framework that learns modality-invariant representations and remains reliable under modality dropout and corruption. RCMCL jointly optimizes (i) a cross-modal contrastive objective that aligns heterogeneous streams, (ii) an intra-modal self-distillation objective that improves view-invariance and reduces redundancy, and (iii) a degradation simulation objective that explicitly trains models to recover from masked or corrupted inputs. At inference, an Adaptive Modality Gating (AMG) network assigns data-driven reliability weights to each modality for robust fusion. On NTU RGB+D 120 (CS/CV) and UWA3D-II, RCMCL attains state-of-the-art accuracy in standard settings and exhibits markedly better robustness: under severe dual-modality dropout it shows only an 11.5% degradation, significantly outperforming strong supervised fusion baselines. These results indicate that self-supervised cross-modal alignment, coupled with explicit degradation modeling and adaptive fusion, is key to deployable multi-modal HAR.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Forest Mapping from L-Band Interferometric SAR Time Series using Deep Learning over Northern Spain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the potential of high-resolution forest mapping using L-band interferometric time series datasets and deep learning modeling. Our SAR data are represented by a time series of nine ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 dual-pol SAR images acquired at near-zero spatial baseline over a study site in Asturias, Northern Spain. Reference data are collected using airborne laser scanning. We examine the performance of several candidate deep learning models from UNet-family with various combinations of input polarimetric and interferometric features. In addition to basic Vanilla UNet, attention reinforced UNet model with squeeze-excitation blocks (SeU-Net) and advanced UNet model with nested structure and skip pathways are used. Studied features include dual pol interferometric observables additionally incorporating model-based derived measures. Results show that adding model-based inverted InSAR features or InSAR coherence layers improves retrieval accuracy compared to using backscatter intensity only. Use of attention mechanisms and nested connection fusion provides better predictions than using Vanilla UNet or traditional machine learning methods. Forest height retrieval accuracies range between 3.1-3.8 m (R2 = 0.45--0.55) at 20 m resolution when only intensity data are used, and improve to less than 2.8 m when both intensity and interferometric coherence features are included. At 40 m and 60 m resolution, retrieval performance further improves, primarily due to higher SNR in both the intensity and interferometric layers. When using intensity at 60 m resolution, best achieved RMSE is 2.2 m, while when using all suitable input features the achieved error is 1.95 m. We recommend this hybrid approach for L-band SAR retrievals also suitable for NISAR and future ROSE-L missions.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Framework for Integrated Sensing and Communications with RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have been recognized as a promising technology to enhance both communication and sensing performance in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems for future 6G networks. However, existing RIS optimization methods for improving ISAC performance are mainly based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) or iterative algorithms. The former suffers from high computational complexity and limited scalability, especially when the number of RIS elements becomes large, while the latter yields suboptimal solutions whose performance depends on initialization. In this work, we introduce a lightweight RIS phase design framework that provides a closed-form solution and explicitly accounts for the trade-off between communication and sensing, as well as proportional beam gain distribution toward multiple sensing targets. The key idea is to partition the RIS configuration into two parts: the first part is designed to maximize the communication performance, while the second introduces small perturbations to generate multiple beams for multi-target sensing. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and demonstrate that it achieves performance comparable to SDR but with significantly lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>An Area-Efficient 20-100-GHz Phase-Invariant Switch-Type Attenuator Achieving 0.1-dB Tuning Step in 65-nm CMOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a switch-type attenuator working from 20 to 100 GHz. The attenuator adopts a capacitive compensation technique to reduce phase error. The small resistors in this work are implemented with metal lines to reduce the intrinsic parasitic capacitance, which helps minimize the amplitude and phase errors over a wide frequency range. Moreover, the utilization of metal lines also reduces the chip area. In addition, a continuous tuning attenuation unit is employed to improve the overall attenuation accuracy of the attenuator. The passive attenuator is designed and fabricated in a standard 65nm CMOS. The measurement results reveal a relative attenuation range of 7.5 dB with a continuous tuning step within 20-100 GHz. The insertion loss is 1.6-3.8 dB within the operation band, while the return losses of all states are better than 11.5 dB. The RMS amplitude and phase errors are below 0.15 dB and 1.6{\deg}, respectively.</description>

      <title>A convolutional neural network deep learning method for model class selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The response-only model class selection capability of a novel deep convolutional neural network method is examined herein in a simple, yet effective, manner. Specifically, the responses from a unique degree of freedom along with their class information train and validate a one-dimensional convolutional neural network. In doing so, the network selects the model class of new and unlabeled signals without the need of the system input information, or full system identification. An optional physics-based algorithm enhancement is also examined using the Kalman filter to fuse the system response signals using the kinematics constraints of the acceleration and displacement data. Importantly, the method is shown to select the model class in slight signal variations attributed to the damping behavior or hysteresis behavior on both linear and nonlinear dynamic systems, as well as on a 3D building finite element model, providing a powerful tool for structural health monitoring applications.</description>

      <title>Conditional Score Learning for Quickest Change Detection in Markov Transition Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of quickest change detection in Markov processes with unknown transition kernels. The key idea is to learn the conditional score $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$ directly from sample pairs $( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where both $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are high-dimensional data generated by the same transition kernel. In this way, we avoid explicit likelihood evaluation and provide a practical way to learn the transition dynamics. Based on this estimation, we develop a score-based CUSUM procedure that uses conditional Hyvarinen score differences to detect changes in the kernel. To ensure bounded increments, we propose a truncated version of the statistic. With Hoeffding's inequality for uniformly ergodic Markov processes, we prove exponential lower bounds on the mean time to false alarm. We also prove asymptotic upper bounds on detection delay. These results give both theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility for score-based detection in high-dimensional Markov models.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Robust Biometric Authentication from Low-Frame-Rate PPG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency, scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Minimum-Volume Nonnegative Matrix Factorization under an Expanded Sufficiently Scattered Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimum-volume nonnegative matrix factorization (min-vol NMF) has been used successfully in many applications, such as hyperspectral imaging, chemical kinetics, spectroscopy, topic modeling, and audio source separation. However, its robustness to noise has been a long-standing open problem. In this paper, we prove that min-vol NMF identifies the groundtruth factors in the presence of noise under a condition referred to as the expanded sufficiently scattered condition which requires the data points to be sufficiently well scattered in the latent simplex generated by the basis vectors.</description>

      <title>Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing: From Communication to Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) has been proposed as an effective waveform for achieving the full diversity of doubly-dispersive (delay-Doppler) channels. While this property is closely related to range and velocity estimation in sensing, this article focuses on other AFDM features that are particularly relevant for addressing two challenges in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems: (1) maintaining receiver complexity and energy consumption at acceptable levels while supporting the large bandwidths required for high delay/range resolution, and (2) mitigating interference in multiradar environments. In monostatic sensing, where direct transmitter-receiver leakage is a major impairment, we show that AFDM-based ISAC receivers can address the first challenge through their compatibility with low-complexity self-interference cancellation (SIC) schemes and reduced sampling rates via analog dechirping. In bistatic sensing, where such analog solutions may not be feasible, we demonstrate that AFDM supports sub-Nyquist sampling without requiring hardware modifications while preserving delay resolution. Finally, we show that the second challenge can be addressed by leveraging the resource-assignment flexibility of the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) underlying the AFDM waveform.</description>

      <title>Age of Job Completion Minimization with Stable Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a time-slotted job-assignment system with a central server, N users and a machine which changes its state according to a Markov chain (hence called a Markov machine). The users submit their jobs to the central server according to a stochastic job arrival process. For each user, the server has a dedicated job queue. Upon receiving a job from a user, the server stores that job in the corresponding queue. When the machine is not working on a job assigned by the server, the machine can be either in internally busy or in free state, and the dynamics of these states follow a binary symmetric Markov chain. Upon sampling the state information of the machine, if the server identifies that the machine is in the free state, it schedules a user and submits a job to the machine from the job queue of the scheduled user. To maximize the number of jobs completed per unit time, we introduce a new metric, referred to as the age of job completion. To minimize the age of job completion and the sampling cost, we propose two policies and numerically evaluate their performance. For both of these policies, we find sufficient conditions under which the job queues will remain stable.</description>

      <title>Joint Discrete Antenna Positioning and Beamforming Optimization in Movable Antenna Enabled Full-Duplex ISAC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a full-duplex integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system enabled by a movable antenna (MA). By leveraging the characteristic of MA that can increase the spatial diversity gain, the performance of the system can be enhanced. We formulate a problem of minimizing the total transmit power consumption via jointly optimizing the discrete position of MA elements, beamforming vectors, sensing signal covariance matrix and user transmit power. Given the significant coupling of optimization variables, the formulated problem presents a non-convex optimization challenge that poses difficulties for direct resolution. To address this challenging issue, the discrete binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) algorithm framework is employed to solve the formulated problem. Specifically, the discrete positions of MA elements are first obtained by iteratively solving the fitness function. The difference-of-convex (DC) programming and successive convex approximation (SCA) are used to handle non-convex and rank-1 terms in the fitness function. Once the BPSO iteration is complete, the discrete positions of MA elements can be determined, and we can obtain the solutions for beamforming vectors, sensing signal covariance matrix and user transmit power. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system in reducing the total transmit power consumption compared with fixed antenna arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The movable antenna (MA)-enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system attracts widespread attention as an innovative framework. The ISAC system integrates sensing and communication functions, achieving resource sharing across various domains, significantly enhancing communication and sensing performance, and promoting the intelligent interconnection of everything. Meanwhile, MA utilizes the spatial variations of wireless channels by dynamically adjusting the positions of MA elements at the transmitter and receiver to improve the channel and further enhance the performance of the ISAC systems. In this paper, we first outline the fundamental principles of MA and introduce the application scenarios of MA-enabled ISAC systems. Then, we summarize the advantages of MA-enabled ISAC systems in enhancing spectral efficiency, achieving flexible and precise beamforming, and making the signal coverage range adjustable. Besides, a specific case is studied to show the performance gains in terms of transmit power that MA brings to ISAC systems. Finally, we discuss the challenges of MA-enabled ISAC and future research directions, aiming to provide insights for future research on MA-enabled ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>JaneEye: A 12-nm 2K-FPS 18.9-$\mu$J/Frame Event-based Eye Tracking Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eye tracking has become a key technology for gaze-based interactions in Extended Reality (XR). However, conventional frame-based eye-tracking systems often fall short of XR's stringent requirements for high accuracy, low latency, and energy efficiency. Event cameras present a compelling alternative, offering ultra-high temporal resolution and low power consumption. In this paper, we present JaneEye, an energy-efficient event-based eye-tracking hardware accelerator designed specifically for wearable devices, leveraging sparse, high-temporal-resolution event data. We introduce an ultra-lightweight neural network architecture featuring a novel ConvJANET layer, which simplifies the traditional ConvLSTM by retaining only the forget gate, thereby halving computational complexity without sacrificing temporal modeling capability. Our proposed model achieves high accuracy with a pixel error of 2.45 on the 3ET+ dataset, using only 17.6K parameters, with up to 1250 Hz event frame rate. To further enhance hardware efficiency, we employ custom linear approximations of activation functions (hardsigmoid and hardtanh) and fixed-point quantization. Through software-hardware co-design, our 12-nm ASIC implementation operates at 400 MHz, delivering an end-to-end latency of 0.5 ms (equivalent to 2000 Frames Per Second (FPS)) at an energy efficiency of 18.9 $\mu$J/frame. JaneEye sets a new benchmark in low-power, high-performance eye-tracking solutions suitable for integration into next-generation XR wearables.</description>

      <title>SolarCrossFormer: Improving day-ahead Solar Irradiance Forecasting by Integrating Satellite Imagery and Ground Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate day-ahead forecasts of solar irradiance are required for the large-scale integration of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems into the power grid. However, current forecasting solutions lack the temporal and spatial resolution required by system operators. In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon. The results are competitive with those achieved by a commercial numerical weather prediction service.</description>

      <title>Non-Convex Over-the-Air Heterogeneous Federated Learning: A Bias-Variance Trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming \emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous} wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured, time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL baselines.</description>

      <title>PrivyWave: Privacy-Aware Wireless Sensing of Heartbeat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wireless sensing technologies can now detect heartbeats using radio frequency and acoustic signals, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing privacy solutions either protect from all sensing systems indiscriminately preventing any utility or operate post-data collection, failing to enable selective access where authorized devices can monitor while unauthorized ones cannot. We present a key-based physical obfuscation system, PrivyWave, that addresses this challenge by generating controlled decoy heartbeat signals at cryptographically-determined frequencies. Unauthorized sensors receive a mixture of real and decoy signals that are indistinguishable without the secret key, while authorized sensors use the key to filter out decoys and recover accurate measurements. Our evaluation with 13 participants demonstrates effective protection across both sensing modalities: for mmWave radar, unauthorized sensors show 21.3 BPM mean absolute error while authorized sensors maintain a much smaller 5.8 BPM; for acoustic sensing, unauthorized error increases to 42.0 BPM while authorized sensors achieve 9.7 BPM. The system operates across multiple sensing modalities without per-modality customization and provides cryptographic obfuscation guarantees. Performance benchmarks show robust protection across different distances (30-150 cm), orientations (120{\deg} field of view), and diverse indoor environments, establishing physical-layer obfuscation as a viable approach for selective privacy in pervasive health monitoring.</description>
