      <title>Symmetric Gapped States and Symmetry-Enforced Gaplessness in 3-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a comprehensive framework for characterizing the infrared (IR) phases of a fermionic quantum theory in three spatial dimensions, based on its quantum anomalies associated with a finite symmetry. We uncover a fundamental dichotomy among these anomalies: the first class of anomalies can always be realized by symmetric gapped states, while the second class can never be realized by gapped states without breaking the given symmetry, establishing the phenomenon of symmetry-enforced gaplessness in these settings. Moreover, using the construction of symmetry extension, we construct the candidate gapped states that theories with the first class of anomalies can flow to in the IR. As an application, we provide concrete predictions of the candidate IR phases of (3+1)-dimensional gauge theories based on our results. Our results also suggest that systems with discrete chiral anomalies cannot be gapped out by adding arbitrary bosonic degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Magic and Wormholes in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any quantum state is fully specified by the expectation values of a complete set of Hermitian operators. For a system of Majorana fermions, such as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, this set of observables can be taken to be all possible strings of Majorana fermion operators. The expectation values of these fermion strings in a thermal state depend erratically on the microscopic couplings that specify the SYK Hamiltonian, and we study their statistical properties directly in the thermodynamic limit using path integral techniques. When the underlying SYK Hamiltonian is chaotic, we find that these expectation values are well-modeled as real Gaussian random variables with zero mean and a variance that we compute. In contrast, for the integrable variant of SYK, we find that the expectation values are actually non-Gaussian. We then use these results to study measures of magic in the SYK thermal state, including the robustness of magic and the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. We also show that our results can be quantitatively reproduced with a dual gravity calculation in the chaotic case at sufficiently low temperature. In this dual gravity model the variance of a given microscopic operator string is related to a wormhole geometry stabilized by a massive particle which is dual to the operator string. Our results thus provide a concrete and quantitative setting in which to study the relationship between randomness, wormholes, and closed universes as well as a holographic dual of quantum magic.</description>

      <title>Lifshitz critical points meet Zamolodchikov perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical points of classical and quantum lattice models are often described by scale-invariant Lifshitz theories which are anisotropic in the continuum limit, as characterized by a dynamical critical exponent $z\neq1$. This type of critical behavior can in principle be studied by deforming ordinary $z=1$ conformal field theories (CFTs) by relevant vector operators breaking the rotational/Lorentz symmetry. In this short note, we consider a two-dimensional system of coupled minimal model CFTs $\mathcal{M}_{m,m+1}$ which realizes this perspective in a controlled fashion via Zamolodchikov's large $m$ expansion. The model turns out to exhibit interesting properties, including a manifold of interacting Lifshitz fixed points and emergent rotational symmetry in the infrared.</description>

      <title>Lazarides-Shafi axion models as Dijkgraaf-Witten theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion models often face the domain wall problem, which threatens the standard big-bang cosmology. The Lazarides-Shafi mechanism attempts to resolve this by identifying degenerate vacua through a continuous gauge symmetry. We formulate a topological quantum field theory to isolate the essential structure of the mechanism and analyze its generalized symmetry structure, including higher-form symmetries and higher-group. This framework yields a master formula for computing the domain wall number and clarifies the higher-form symmetry conditions required for complete vacuum identification in a model independent way. Moreover, while a domain-wall-number-one scenario eliminates all higher-form global symmetries, the theory nevertheless exhibits a nontrivial four-group structure and realizes a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase.</description>

      <title>Boundary mutual information in double holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a composite system where AdS$_3$ gravity is coupled to a flat heat bath and investigate the mutual information between two subregions on the intersection of the AdS$_3$ and bath, referred to as the boundary mutual information (BMI). The corresponding entanglement entropy is captured via quantum extremal surfaces (QES), which holographically be computed by a surface optimization algorithm based on ``Surface Evolver''. We focus on both connected and disconnected configurations of the quantum entanglement wedge (Q-EW) in the AdS$_3$ bulk and analyze the finite corrections to the BMI. Our numerical results reveal a phase transition of the BMI as the separation between two subregions increases. Furthermore, we find that the BMI can naturally be decomposed into two distinct components: a geometric term arising from the areas of the quantum extremal surfaces, and a correction term resulting from bulk quantum fields within the Q-EW. Interestingly, the geometric contribution always exceeds the total BMI, indicating a negative correction from the bulk matter fields. This negativity can be understood as the result of subtracting a greater contribution from quantum fields in the connected Q-EW than in the disconnected one. We also reproduce the negative contribution of bulk quantum fields to BMI within a random tensor network (RTN) toy model of double holography. Modeling the bulk as a highly mixed state entangled with a large bath leads to a volume-law bulk entropy. In the large bond-dimension limit, the geometric part of the BMI remains non-negative, while the bulk entropy contribution becomes non-positive when the Q-EWs merge.</description>

      <title>3-Crossed Module Structure in the Five-Dimensional Topological Axion Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the higher-group symmetry structure of a five-dimensional topological theory, which is described by a 3-crossed module. The model is obtained by an five-dimensional extension of topological axion electrodynamics in four dimensions. To study the symmetry structure, we couple background gauge fields to the symmetry currents via Stueckelberg couplings. We show that background gauge invariance requires modified gauge transformation laws, indicating the existence of a higher-group structure. Furthermore, we identify the underlying mathematical structure as a 3-crossed module by regarding the modified Stueckelberg couplings as curvatures of a higher-group gauge theory. We demonstrate that the gauge transformation laws derived from this algebraic structure are consistent with the analysis based on the gauge invariance. While our previous work introduced the concept of a 3-crossed module motivated by higher-group symmetries, this work provides concrete verification that this framework correctly captures the symmetry structure of physical theories.</description>

      <title>The Open/Closed Gromov-Witten/Hurwitz Correspondence and Localized World Sheets for Completed Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the open/closed version of the Gromov-Witten/Hurwitz correspondence. The duality equates the relative Gromov-Witten invariants and the count of covers of the target space with prescribed holonomies at boundaries. We clarify the projective large N limit as well as the role of the completed versus the ordinary cycles associated to the bulk and the boundary vertex operators respectively. We provide an example check of both the correspondence and the fact that cycles dual to closed strings need to be completed. Moreover, we identify the connected world sheets that contribute to an equivariantly localized amplitude in the bulk that is solely due to a completion term. We also propose a picture for the completed cycle combinatorics that involves a localization diagram glued to a cut-and-join string interaction.</description>

      <title>Circular strings, magnons, plane waves and local quenches in BTZ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that string theory on the geometry $BTZ\times S^3\times M$ supported with either Neveu-Schwarz flux or Ramond flux admits states which obey identical dispersion relations to those of classical solutions like circular strings, giant magnons, or plane wave excitations in the geometry $ AdS_3 \times S^3 \times M$. Here, $M$ can be $T^4$, $K3$, or $S^3\times S^1$. This is made possible by the map, which takes the particle at the origin of $AdS_3$ with angular momentum along one of the angles of $S_3$ to a particle falling into the BTZ horizon. We use this map to construct circular strings, magnons, as well as plane waves in the BTZ geometry. We show that the $SL(2, R)$ charges of these states on $AdS_3$ and that of the corresponding states in the BTZ geometry are related by a boost. The dual description of these states in the BTZ geometry are local quench in the thermal CFT. These quenches carry energy density, $R$-charges, non-trivial expectation value of the marginal operator dual to the dilaton and move on the light cone in CFT. In general, the left and the right moving quenches are not symmetric.</description>

      <title>Massless spinning fields on the Light-Front: quartic vertices and amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the light-front approach in flat space, we study the closure of the Poincare algebra at the quartic order, specifically the nonholomorphic constraint involving both MHV and anti-MHV vertices. We first recover some well-established results: the existence of Yang-Mills theory and gravity, as well as the inconsistency of interacting multi-graviton theories. We explicitly construct several lower-derivative and lower-spin quartic vertices. We then turn to theories involving massless higher-spin fields. It becomes evident that the quartic constraint does not allow many cubic interactions to survive, in accordance with the well-known no-go results. Nevertheless, once higher-derivative cubic vertices are included, we find nontrivial solutions to the full quartic constraint and determine the corresponding quartic vertices. On this basis, we conjecture the complete set of quartic vertices that solve the light-cone consistency conditions. Exploiting this, we find all allowed unitary local higher-spin theories and identify new families of local quasi-chiral higher-spin theories. We then determine all local higher-spin four-point amplitudes using the spinor-helicity formalism together with locality. We conclude with a short discussion on non-locality and propose a ``local'' (at the amplitude level) higher-spin theory in flat space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal correlators in holographic CFTs on a sphere exhibit bulk-cone singularities at points connected by null geodesics in the bulk. The operator product expansion analysis of the stress-tensor sector of the correlator shows that there are analogous singularities at spacelike separation for thermal CFTs on a plane. We show that these are associated with complex null geodesics. There is a phase transition between the real and complex spacelike geodesics underpinning this picture. We also provide a phase-shift calculation of the position of these generalised bulk-cone singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these lecture notes, a group-theoretical introduction to BMS symmetries is provided in a self-contained manner. More precisely, all definitions and structures are purely based on geometrical and group-theoretical notions defined at null infinity and valid in any dimension, in a way that circumvents its traditional bulk realisation as asymptotic symmetries. The topics which are reviewed are: the definition of BMS transformations as conformal Carrollian isometries of null infinity, the semidirect structure of the BMS group, the holographic reconstruction of Minkowski spacetime in terms of good cuts, the one-to-one correspondence between good cut subspaces and Poincar\'e subgroups (aka vacua), as well as a basic introduction to unitary representations of the BMS group.</description>

      <title>Deconfinement from Thermal Tensor Networks: Universal CFT signature in (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor networks offer a sign-problem-free approach to study lattice gauge theories, but extracting precise universal information associated with the deconfinement transition remains challenging. In this work, we study the deconfinement transition of (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories at finite temperature using a thermal tensor network approach, where the partition functions at finite temperature are formulated as three-dimensional tensor networks. These tensor networks are first contracted in the temporal direction, and the subsequent coarse-graining in the spatial directions yields a renormalized transfer matrix, the spectrum of which directly encodes the universal conformal field theory data. In particular, by numerically extracting the central charge and scaling dimensions, we verify that the universality class of the thermal deconfinement transition matches the prediction of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture for $N=2,3,5$. Moreover, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_5$ theory at finite temperature exhibits an intermediate phase with an emergent U(1) symmetry. Critical couplings are determined via Gu-Wen ratios and agree with existing Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, extrapolating these critical couplings at finite temperature enables us to determine the deconfinement transition points for $N=2,3$ at zero temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Codimension-two vortex solutions are important solitonic objects in both quantum field theory and gravity. In this paper, we construct a class of codimension-two Alice-vortex solutions in axio-dilaton gravity, in which monodromy around the vortex enacts the axion transformation $C_0 \mapsto -C_0$. In IIB supergravity, this furnishes a class of R7-brane backgrounds of the sort predicted by the Swampland Cobordism Conjecture. Such configurations generically carry an intrinsic dipole moment. We extract additional properties of such branes from scattering probes. These results provide further evidence that the worldvolume theory of an R7-brane is an 8D non-supersymmetric interacting quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Effective dynamics and defect expansions for polynomial PDEs on thin annuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a geometric and analytic framework for polynomial partial differential equations posed on thin annuli in the plane. Using renormalized Sobolev inner products, we construct Sobolev orthogonal polynomial bases adapted to the thin geometry and use them to define stable Galerkin approximations.
  We prove a general dimension-reduction theorem for polynomial Hamiltonian and dissipative PDEs, showing that solutions converge to effective one-dimensional dynamics on the limiting circle. Beyond the leading-order limit, we identify transverse defect correctors and derive cell problems describing anisotropic dispersive and homogenized effects.
  Our framework applies uniformly to integrable models (KdV, modified KdV, nonlinear Schr\"odinger, sine--Gordon), anisotropic dispersive systems such as Zakharov--Kuznetsov, and non-integrable perturbations including dissipation, forcing, and rapidly oscillating coefficients. We establish stability of the effective dynamics under changes of Sobolev order and of polynomial Hilbert geometry, and show robustness of the associated Galerkin schemes.
  The results provide a unified geometric perspective on dimension reduction, homogenization, and integrability in thin geometries, and introduce Sobolev orthogonal polynomial methods as a constructive tool for multiscale PDE analysis.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach to the Nirenberg Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces the Nirenberg Neural Network: a numerical approach to the Nirenberg problem of prescribing Gaussian curvature on $S^2$ for metrics that are pointwise conformal to the round metric. Our mesh-free physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach directly parametrises the conformal factor globally and is trained with a geometry-aware loss enforcing the curvature equation. Additional consistency checks were performed via the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and spherical-harmonic expansions were fit to the learnt models to provide interpretability.
  For prescribed curvatures with known realisability, the neural network achieves very low losses ($10^{-7} - 10^{-10}$), while unrealisable curvatures yield significantly higher losses. This distinction enables the assessment of unknown cases, separating likely realisable functions from non-realisable ones. The current capabilities of the Nirenberg Neural Network demonstrate that neural solvers can serve as exploratory tools in geometric analysis, offering a quantitative computational perspective on longstanding existence questions.</description>

      <title>Neural and numerical methods for $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures on contact Calabi-Yau 7-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A numerical framework for approximating $\mathrm{G}_2$-structure 3-forms on contact Calabi-Yau manifolds is presented. The approach proceeds in three stages: first, existing neural network models are employed to compute an approximate Ricci-flat metric on a Calabi-Yau threefold. Second, using this metric and the explicit construction of a $\mathrm{G}_2$-structure on the associated 7-dimensional Calabi-Yau link in the 9-sphere, numerical approximations of the 3-form are generated on a large set of sampled points. Finally, a dedicated neural architecture is trained to learn the 3-form and its induced Riemannian metric directly from data, validating the learned structure and its torsion via a numerical implementation of the exterior derivative, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Using the Wilson Dirac operator in lattice gauge theory with a domain-wall mass term, we construct a discretization of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index for domains with compact boundary in a flat torus. We prove that, for sufficiently small lattice spacings, this discretization correctly captures the continuum Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We survey the recent progress in defining open enumerative theories for Landau-Ginzburg models. We illustrate the ideas required to develop these new foundations. In particular, we describe how to define the open enumerative invariants as integrals of multisections of certain vector bundles over a moduli space that is a real orbifold with corners, after prescribing boundary conditions for the multisections. We then explain the known situations where the open invariants satisfy certain forms of topological recursion relations, integrable hierarchies, or mirror symmetry. We end with a list of open questions and problems.</description>

      <title>New Horizons in Effective Field Theory?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the most general parity symmetric effective scalar tensor theory in four dimensions containing terms up to fourth derivative order in the Lagrangian. It has been shown [H.S. Reall, Phys. Rev. D 103 (2021), 084027] that this theory has three polarizations generically goverened by different (nested) propagation cones, neither of which in general coincides with the lightcone as defined by the metric. Consequently, the notion of black hole horizon must be defined relative to the widest propagation cone, and not with respect to the metric. We provide two theorems stating that, nevertheless, the horizon of a \emph{stationary} black hole is null with respect to the metric, and that, in fact, all three propagation cones touch on the horizon. The conditions in these theorems allow for rotating black holes. Our theorems thereby suggest that the notion of Killing horizon, central in most discussions of black hole thermodynamics, retains its fundamental status, and that certain thermodynamic paradoxes associated with multiple propagation cones are evaded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an interacting Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator with a Landau-Ginzburg type interaction term and analyse its classical dynamics from a geometric and numerical point of view. We show that the resulting fourth-order equation of motion admits a conformal bi-Hamiltonian formulation, possesses a non-trivial set of Lie symmetries and we demonstrate the existence of bounded and regular trajectories in representative parameter regimes. By establishing an explicit correspondence with an integrable generalised H\'enon-Heiles system, we show that the interacting higher-derivative dynamics inherits the integrability properties of the latter. This connection allows us to construct a second conserved Hamiltonian, to clarify the geometric origin of separability, and to obtain explicit classical solutions in terms of elliptic functions. Our results provide a concrete example of an interacting higher-derivative system for which integrability and periodic classical solutions can be established in a fully explicit manner.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Structure of Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian truncation for the two-dimensional $\lambda\phi^4$ theory within the framework of Hamiltonian truncation effective theory, where truncation artifacts are mitigated through a systematic inclusion of corrective terms organized in inverse powers of the ultraviolet energy cut-off $E_{\rm max}$. Building on the leading-order matching program, we develop two complementary extensions. First, we derive compact all-order expressions for the local matching corrections to the mass and quartic coupling by resumming infinite classes of diagrams sharing fixed topologies within the local approximation. Second, we extend the non-local sector by computing the next-to-next-to-local corrections contributing at $\mathcal{O}(E_{\rm max}^{-4})$, following a continuum-first matching procedure, in which the effective corrections are computed in infinite volume and the spatial direction is subsequently re-compactified to obtain a separable Hilbert-space basis on which the truncated operator construction is implemented. Our results show that an increasingly rich operator basis is necessary to describe the theory beyond leading order.</description>

      <title>Rotating Synchrotron Radiation (RoSyRa): photon emission from magnetized and rotating quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the production of non-prompt photons originating from rotating synchrotron radiation (RoSyRa), specifically the emission of photons by a rigidly rotating quark-gluon plasma in thermal equilibrium, in the presence of an external magnetic field. We compute the non-prompt photon spectrum and its elliptic flow ($v_2$) at mid-rapidity. In particular, we investigate the finite volume effects. We find that at low transverse momentum, the magnetic field induces a significant $v_2$, while the plasma rotation boosts the synchrotron radiation of negatively charged quarks. These effects account for both the observed excess of direct photons and their elliptic flow, contributing to the resolution of the "direct photon puzzle".</description>

Abstract: We present a general method for the perturbative calculation of the entanglement entropy between two interacting quantum fields. Previous attempts at calculating this quantity perturbatively have encountered a seemingly pathological divergence; we explain why this divergence is a result of improperly truncating a series expansion and give a prescription for avoiding this problem. We then apply our method to a simple example of two mass-mixing scalar fields.</description>

Abstract: Classification of cluster variables in cluster algebras (in particular, Grassmannian cluster algebras) is an important problem, which has direct application to computations of scattering amplitudes in physics. In this paper, we apply the tableaux method to classify cluster variables in Grassmannian cluster algebras $\mathbb{C}[Gr(k,n)]$ up to $(k,n)=(3,12), (4,10)$, or $(4,12)$ up to a certain number of columns of tableaux, using HPC clusters. These datasets are made available on GitHub. Supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods are used to analyse this data and identify structures associated to tableaux corresponding to cluster variables. Conjectures are raised associated to the enumeration of tableaux at each rank and the tableaux structure which creates a cluster variable, with the aid of machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this review (written in Chinese), we introduce the computation of the minimal surface area in the scattering amplitude/Wilson loop duality, where the minimal surface ends on a light-like polygonal Wilson loop at the boundary of anti-de Sitter space (AdS). Due to its nonlinearity and the complexity of the boundary conditions, directly solving the equations of motion to compute the area is highly challenging. This paper reviews an alternative approach that bypasses the direct solution of the equations of motion and instead uses integrable systems to compute the area. We will provide boundary conditions for the Hitchin system, which is equivalent to the equations of motion, to describe the light-like polygonal boundary of the minimal surface. Starting from the solution of the Hitchin system, we will further derive the Y-system and the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) equations, whose free energy provides the nontrivial part of the minimal surface area. Finally, we will discuss recent developments in this field and provide an outlook for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bulk-boundary correspondence predicts the existence of boundary modes localized at the edges of topologically nontrivial systems. The wavefunctions of hermitian boundary modes can be obtained as the eigenmodes of a modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation. The bulk-boundary correspondence has also been extended to nonhermitian systems, which describe physical phenomena such as gain and loss in open and non-equilibrium systems. Nonhermitian energy spectra can be complex-valued and exhibit point gaps or line gaps in the complex plane, whether the gaps can be continuously deformed into points or lines, respectively. Specifically, line-gapped nonhermitian systems can be continuously deformed into hermitian gapped spectra. Here, we find the analytical form of the wavefunctions of nonhermitian boundary modes with zero energy localized at smooth domain boundaries between topologically distinct phases by solving the generalized Jackiw-Rebbi equation in the nonhermitian regime. Moreover, we unveil a universal relation between the scalar fields and the decay rate and oscillation wavelength of the boundary modes. This relation quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in nonhermitian line-gapped systems through physical quantities that are experimentally measurable. Furthermore, this relation is not affected by the specific spatial variations of the scalar fields. These results offer new insights into the localization properties of boundary modes in nonhermitian and topologically nontrivial states of matter.</description>

      <title>Higgs Field as Architect of a Geodesically Complete Universe and Agent for New Physics in Interiors of Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Higgs boson is often compared to a small ripple on a vast, calm ocean. This "ocean" is the universal Higgs vacuum expectation value, about 246 GeV, permeating all space and generating particle masses. Its remarkable uniformity reflects the large-scale nature of the universe. Here I argue that the Higgs field plays a far deeper role. In regions of extreme gravity near singularities, it becomes a non-perturbative, space-time-dependent field that creates new space-time domains beyond gravitational singularities -- new regions governed by antigravity. This mechanism produces dramatic dynamics inside black holes and in the earliest universe, including restoration of the electroweak symmetry SU(2)xU(1) at singularities. The adjoining gravity and antigravity regions form a geodesically complete space-time bridged by traversable singularities -- absent in the Standard Model coupled to general relativity or its extensions such as string theory. In such a framework, the black hole information paradox admits a new, manifestly unitary resolution. Details of computations are developed in the companion paper [1]; here, only a brief outline is given.</description>

Abstract: We extend the results of Lagrangian formulations study to construct gauge-invariant Lagrangians for (ir)reducible integer higher-spin massless and massive representations of the Poincare group with a Young tableau $Y[\hat{s}_1,\hat{s}_2,\hat{s}_3]$ in $d$-dimensional flat space-time (as the probable candidates to describe the Dark Matter problem beyond the SM). These particles are described within a metric-like formulation by tensor fields with 3 groups of antisymmetric Lorentz indices $\Phi_{\mu^1[{\hat{s}_1}],\mu^2[{\hat{s}_2}], \mu^3[{\hat{s}_3}]}$ on a basis of the
  BRST method with complete, $Q$, and incomplete, $Q_c$, BRST operators. We found unconstrained (with $Q$) and constrained (with $Q_c$ and off-shell BRST invariant holonomic constraints) gauge Lagrangian formulations with different configuration spaces and reducibility stages. The deformation procedure to construct interacting gauge model with mixed-antisymmetric fields is proposed.</description>

Abstract: The thermodynamics of black holes provides a profound link between gravity, quantum theory and statistical mechanics. It serves as a useful tool for testing theories beyond Einstein's gravity. In this work of ours, we investigate the newly found restricted phase space thermodynamics (RPST) of charged static and charged rotating black holes in $f(R)$ gravity. Unlike the extended phase space (EPST) approach, RPST keeps the cosmological constant fixed and introduces the central charge $C$ along with its conjugate chemical potential $\mu$, thereby allowing the black hole mass to be consistently interpreted as internal energy. Within this framework, we derive the relevant thermodynamic quantities and analyse the temperature-entropy $(T-S)$ and Helmholtz free energy-temperature $(F-T)$ behaviours. Our results reveal characteristic features of first-order phase transitions through non-monotonic $T-S$ curves along with the swallow-tail structures in $F-T$ plots, while second-order transitions appear at critical points. To further validate these findings, we employ the formalism of geometrothermodynamics (GTD), which provides a Legendre-invariant geometric description of thermodynamic geometry. We demonstrate that the curvature singularities of the GTD scalar curvature coincides exactly with that of the divergences in the specific heat capacity curves, thereby establishing a geometric correspondence for phase transitions. This study facilitates the first systematic exploration of RPST within $f(R)$ gravity and highlights the universality of RPST in capturing black hole criticality in modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>The electromagnetic field in Poisson gauge theory: the groupoidal approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of defining the field strength of abelian potentials when the spacetime is a Poisson manifold, within the groupoidal approach. The natural definition in terms of gauge invariant momenta is proved to be equivalent to covariant and invariant tensors of a local symplectic groupoid representing a symplectic realization of the Poisson manifold. A Poisson Chern-Simons model is then proposed and its equations of motion are shortly discussed.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy and Complexity in Dyonic Quantum Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) and holographic complexity (HC) for three-dimensional dyonic quantum black holes, incorporating corrections arising from bulk quantum fields in the setup of double holography. We investigate the holographic entanglement entropy through the holographic Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) prescription and the island prescription. Using RT extremization, we evaluate HEE for connected and disconnected (island) surfaces and show islands emerge when RT surfaces intersect the brane; entanglement entropy grows with subregion size and ultimately saturates for quantum black holes as well as dressed defects. For complexity, we analyze both CV (perturbative) and CA (exact, all-orders) prescriptions: the leading quantum corrections feature universal behavior and the late-time growth can be expressed in thermodynamic variables, obeying generalized Lloyd-type bounds. In contrast, quantum dressed defects exhibit vanishing late-time growth. The CA prescription proves to be more tractable nonperturbatively and yields a thermodynamic interpretation of complexity growth.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Bethe ansatz and wall crossing for deformed supersymmetric quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the deformed supersymmetric quantum mechanics with a polynomial superpotential with $\hbar$ correction. In the minimal chamber, where all turning points are real and distinct, it was shown that the exact Wentzel--Kramers--Brillouin periods obey the ${\mathbb Z}_4$-extended thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) equations of the undeformed potential. By changing the energy parameter above/below the critical points, the turning points become complex, and the moduli are outside of the minimal chamber. We study the wall crossing of the ${\mathbb Z}_4$-extended TBA equations by this change of moduli and show that the ${\mathbb Z}_4$ structure is preserved after the wall crossing. In particular, the TBA equations for the cubic superpotential are studied in detail, where there are two chambers (minimal and maximal). At the maximally symmetric point in the maximal chamber, the TBA system becomes the two sets of the $D_3$-type TBA equations, which are regarded as the ${\mathbb Z}_4$ extension of the $A_3/{\mathbb Z}_2$-type TBA equation.</description>

      <title>A new web of dualities from Majorana Fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore new infrared dualities in $(2+1)$-dimensional quantum field theories involving Majorana fermions. Building on the recently proposed operator-deformation approach to bosonization dualities, we incorporate the bosonization of neutral fermions into the established web of Dirac dualities. Starting from the decomposition of a Dirac fermion into two Majorana components, we derive a hierarchy of dual bosonic descriptions based on orthogonal Chern-Simons-matter theories. This construction leads to novel boson-boson dualities, including an explicit correspondence between an $SO(N)$ theory with two real scalars and a $U(1)$ theory with one complex scalar, and their generalizations to arbitrary numbers of Majorana flavours. We analyze boundary conditions preserving chirality and demonstrate their role in matching gravitational anomalies and chiral central charges. Additional deformations yield orthogonal analogues of Ising-Gross-Neveu and pairing transitions. The resulting framework provides a unified Majorana-based extension of the three-dimensional duality web and clarifies the infrared structure of non-Abelian bosonization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct entanglement surfaces for rotating cylindrical black holes in a double holographic setup, extending previous results to the case of stationary backgrounds. We analyze both the 5d braneworld construction as well as the embedding in 10d type IIB string theory. We couple the rotating cylindrical black hole to a non-gravitating bath, and study island and Hartman-Maldacena surfaces. Properties of island surfaces are characterized by three regimes, bounded by two critical parameters. In addition to the critical value known for the static case, we find that a new one emerges, related to the extremal limit of the rotating black hole. This behaviour is present both for the bottom-up as well as the top-down models, for which we find qualitative agreement.</description>

      <title>Note on Pure D-brane (non-)BPS Black Hole Microstate Counting in Type IIA Superstring Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we explore computational algebraic geometry techniques to compute $14^{th}$ Helicity Trace Index of 4-charge, $\frac{1}{8}$-BPS, $\mathcal{N}=8$ pure D-brane configurations dual to D1-D5-P-KK monopole dyonic black holes. We extend the analysis of our previous work to higher values of charges and address subtleties involving compatible gauge choices for $(1,1,1,N)$ charge configurations. For explicit SUSY state counting, we use a parametric monodromy method for the 4-charge $(1,1,1,5)$ and $(1,1,1,6)$ configurations and find that the results match the U-dual picture. By a different choice of the R-symmetry representations, it is possible to explicitly break all supersymmetry and study related (non-)abelian versions as 4-charge non-BPS pure D-brane systems. Using analytical Gr\"{o}bner bases, we show that the potential has no zero energy configuration. The higher end of the spectrum asymptotes towards the Coulomb branch local minima submanifold representing unbounded D-brane configurations, and the Mixed branch local minima represent bound states at parametrically lower values of the potential. In between, there are several marginally bound stabilizer submanifolds representing partially bounded D-brane configurations. We developed physics-inspired computational techniques to deform the potentials and lift flat directions, thereby cataloging the energy landscape and counting the low-energy stable states with degeneracy.</description>

      <title>The Static Heavy Quark-Antiquark Potential within String Theory in Arbitrary Stationary Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a static open string in a general stationary spacetime, which can represent a heavy quark-antiquark pair within the holographic framework or effective theory. We establish that for a simple U-shaped string with only radial dependence on the space string coordinate the string is generally not symmetric with respect to the turning point, and the symmetry restores only for backgrounds with $h_{pr}=G_{00}G_{pr}-G_{0p}G_{0r}=0$. Such asymmetric strings may probe a possibility of the parity violation in the quark-antiquark interaction. Nevertheless, we identify a wide family of metrics for which the symmetry is preserved, enabling a direct isolation of the linear-in-distance term in the static interquark potential for simple symmetric string configurations, even in non-diagonal backgrounds. Then, we apply our formulas to the AdS/CFT at finite-temperature, formulated in terms of the $N$ coincident $D3$-branes in large-$N$ limit dual to the finite-temperature $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma. We find that the separation distance between quarks, $L$, is given in terms of a hypergeometric function, while the potential, $V$, consists of two contributions: a term linear in the separation and its derivative by temperature. Small-$T_H$ expansion for $L$ and $V$ are organized as power series of $L_0 T_H$, where $L_0$ is the conformal limit at Hawking temperature $T_H=0$. Further, applying our formulas to the Rindler-AdS spacetime dual to an accelerated $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma, we obtain expressions for $L$ and $V$ in terms of the elliptic integrals, which in the large acceleration limit come to the conformal results. We show that the distance between quarks decreases, the potential increases, and the critical temperature, $T_c=(\pi/3)T_H=a_c/6$, increases with an acceleration, $a_c$. However, we observe that $a_cV$ as a function of $a_cL$ does not depend on the certain value of $a_c$.</description>

Abstract: The Euclidean Gravitational Path Integral has proven remarkably effective in the quantum regime of black hole physics. In this work, we examine the applicability of the Kontsevich-Segal-Witten (KSW) criterion for admissible complex metrics in the context of the Euclidean Gravitational Path Integral. We find that, for the super-conformal index of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM with unequal angular momenta, the black hole saddle points violate the KSW criterion precisely where the statistical description of the index breaks down. The corresponding critical point coincides with a phase transition into two-component ``grey galaxy'' configurations in the micro-canonical ensemble.</description>

      <title>Disturbing news about the $d=2+\epsilon$ expansion II. Assessing the recombination scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [De Cesare, Rychkov (2025)], we revisited the $d=2+\epsilon$ expansion in the $O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM), emphasizing the existence of a protected operator which is a closed form with $N-1$ indices. The scaling dimension of this operator stays exactly equal to $N-1$, independently of $\epsilon$. Its existence is problematic for the identification of the NLSM fixed point in $d=2+\epsilon$ with the Wilson-Fisher fixed point family obtained by analytically continuing from near $d=4$, which does not possess such a protected operator. Multiplet recombination is one scenario discussed in [De Cesare, Rychkov (2025)], which could allow to connect the two families continuously (although not analytically). In this scenario, the protected dimension is lifted at some critical value of $\epsilon$, thanks to the short conformal multiplet of scaling dimension $N-1$ eating a long conformal multiplet of higher scaling dimension. In this followup work, we assess this scenario for the cases $N=3$ and $N=4$. We identify the lowest candidates for the long multiplet which could be eaten, and compute their one-loop anomalous dimensions. We find that at one loop, scaling dimensions of these candidates grow with $\epsilon$, while it should decrease down to $N$ for the recombination to occur. We conclude that multiplet recombination is unlikely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalization for the quantum information retrieval protocol recently illustrated by Verlinde and van der Heijden for evaporating black holes is provided to inclusions of type III von Neumann factors. The physical interest of such scenario arises in Quantum Field Theory, where local algebras are type III von Neumann algebras. The formula obtained can be easily interpreted in terms of the statistical dimension of superselection sectors in the case of black holes undergoing charge evaporation, thanks to the index-statistics theorem, leading to a thermodynamic interpretation. A constraint on the values of the index leads to a final remark about the quantization of the charge emitted by the black hole during the evaporation process.</description>

Abstract: We present an analytical solution for the evolution of parton distributions incorporating mixed-order QCD $\otimes$ QED corrections, addressing both polarized and unpolarized cases. Using the Altarelli-Parisi kernels extended to mixed order, we solve the DGLAP equations exactly in Mellin $N$-space and derive the associated Wilson coefficients for the polarized structure function $g_1$. Our analytical approach improves computational efficiency and enhances the precision of theoretical predictions in observables sensitive to QED corrections, with relevance for current and future phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmological principle on gigaparsec scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observational analyses have suggested possible evidence of hemisphere asymmetry in cosmological datasets. Parameterizations of this kind place observers in a privileged position-specifically on the plane that divides the two hemispheres. To quantify potential deviations from the cosmological principle without presuming a special location, we develop a stochastic framework that parametrizes departures from statistical homogeneity and isotropy. The near-uniform temperature of the cosmic microwave background indicates that anisotropy is negligible (at the $\lesssim 10^{-5}$ level) on the last scattering surface. This serves as a zero boundary condition, enabling the construction of an orthogonal basis of functions below the recombination redshift. Within this basis, we expand the relative deviation from the Hubble diagram of isotropic models (such as $\Lambda$CDM or $w_0w_a$CDM) in a hierarchy of increasing resolution. Applying this approach, we test the cosmological principle using Type Ia supernovae, strong lensing time delays, and gravitational-wave standard sirens. For the class of large-scale anisotropies and low-order radial variations described by this framework, the current datasets are found to be consistent with statistical homogeneity and isotropy on gigaparsec scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20040v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct static, spherically symmetric, charged traversable wormhole solutions to the Einstein--Maxwell equations, supported by bidirectional (ingoing and outgoing) null dust with negative energy, and discuss a scenario for their dynamical formation from a black hole. Our solution contains a traversable throat, where the areal radius takes a minimum, although the spacetime is not asymptotically flat. In our formation scenario, the spacetime evolves sequentially from a black hole to Vaidya regions and finally to a wormhole, with each transition mediated by an impulsive null shell. We find that the radius of the wormhole throat is determined by the mass and charge of the initial black hole as well as those of the injected shell.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how a natural neutrino mass hierarchy with large lepton mixing angles may be achieved in a theory of gauge flavour deconstruction. Hitherto it has been shown that neutrino anarchy may result from such theories, but here we show that this need not necessarily be the case. In particular we consider the minimal tri-hypercharge theory, and show that the decomposition of the family hypercharges into the corresponding $B-L$ gauge groups, together with the charged lepton mass hierarchy, implies the sequential dominance conditions for a neutrino mass hierarchy, where lepton mixing originates from both the neutrino and charged lepton sectors. We present novel and model-independent sequential dominance results applicable to this case, but also useful more generally. We also show how natural quark mass and mixing are included in such a framework.</description>

Abstract: We study the universal properties of the Lanczos algorithm applied to finite-size many-body quantum systems. Focusing on autocorrelation functions of local operators and on their infinite-time behaviour at finite size, we conjecture that in the large $n$ limit, the ratios between consecutive Lanczos coefficients should have specific scalings with the size of the lattice that we make precise and that depend on the hydrodynamic tail of the autocorrelation function. The scaling associated with strong or approximate zero-modes is also discussed. We support our conjecture with a numerical study of different models.</description>

      <title>Finite-Width Neural Tangent Kernels from Feynman Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural tangent kernels (NTKs) are a powerful tool for analyzing deep, non-linear neural networks. In the infinite-width limit, NTKs can easily be computed for most common architectures, yielding full analytic control over the training dynamics. However, at infinite width, important properties of training such as NTK evolution or feature learning are absent. Nevertheless, finite width effects can be included by computing corrections to the Gaussian statistics at infinite width. We introduce Feynman diagrams for computing finite-width corrections to NTK statistics. These dramatically simplify the necessary algebraic manipulations and enable the computation of layer-wise recursion relations for arbitrary statistics involving preactivations, NTKs and certain higher-derivative tensors (dNTK and ddNTK) required to predict the training dynamics at leading order. We demonstrate the feasibility of our framework by extending stability results for deep networks from preactivations to NTKs and proving the absence of finite-width corrections for scale-invariant nonlinearities such as ReLU on the diagonal of the Gram matrix of the NTK. We numerically implement the complete set of equations necessary to compute the first-order corrections for arbitrary inputs and demonstrate that the results follow the statistics of sampled neural networks for widths $n\gtrsim 20$.</description>

      <title>Trace anomaly contributions to semi-classical wormhole geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate wormhole solutions within the framework of the semi-classical Einstein equations in the presence of the conformal anomaly (or trace anomaly). These solutions are sourced by a stress-energy tensor (SET) derived from the trace anomaly, and depend on two positive coefficients, $\alpha$ and $\lambda$, determined by the matter content of the theory and on the degrees of freedom of the involved quantum fields. For a Type B anomaly ($\alpha=0$), we obtain wormhole geometries assuming a constant redshift function and show that the SET components increase with the parameter $\lambda$. In the case of a Type A anomaly ($\lambda=0$), we generalize previously known solutions, yielding a family of geometries that includes Lorentzian wormholes, naked singularities, and the Schwarzschild black hole. Using isotropic coordinates, we identify parameter choices that produce traversable wormhole solutions. Extending to the full trace-anomaly contribution, we solve the differential equation near the throat to obtain the redshift function and demonstrate that both the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars remain finite at the throat. We further analyze the trajectories of null and timelike particles, showing that the height and width of the effective potential for null geodesics increase monotonically with $\alpha$, while the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius also grows with larger $\alpha$. These results illustrate the rich interplay between trace anomaly effects and the structure and dynamics of wormhole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Neglected solutions in quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on several previously overlooked families of static spherically symmetric solutions in quadratic gravity. Our main result concerns the existence of solutions whose leading exponents depend on the ratio ${\omega=\alpha/(3\beta)}$ of the four-derivative couplings. We demonstrate that the space of models with ${\omega &gt;1}$ contains a dense set that admits non-Frobenius solutions ${(s_*, 2 - 3 s_*)_0}$ (in standard Schwarzschild coordinates), with certain rational numbers $s_*(\omega)$. These solutions correspond to a singular core at ${\bar{r}=0}$. Another related non-Frobenius family, $(s_*, 2 - 3 s_*)_\infty$, exists for a dense set of models with ${1/4 &lt; \omega &lt; 1}$, describing a singular boundary at ${\bar{r}\to\infty}$. Both families are uncovered by recasting the metric into special coordinates in which the solutions become Frobenius. Additionally, for models with real ratios ${\omega\neq 1}$ we identify six novel families of non-Frobenius solutions around points ${\bar{r}=\bar{r}_0} \neq 0$, describing horizons and wormhole throats. Finally, we re-derive and summarize all known families of solutions in modified as well as in the standard Schwarzschild coordinates.</description>

      <title>Photon rings and shadows of Kerr black holes immersed in a swirling universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss photon rings around as well as shadows of Kerr black holes immersed in a swirling spacetime (KBHSU). We find that the spin-spin interaction between the angular momentum of the black hole and the swirling of the background leads to new interesting effects as it breaks the symmetry between the upper and lower hemispheres. We find that a pair of light rings exists for all values of the parameter space. Using a topological argument, we prove that there should be, indeed, two light rings and that, additionally, these light rings are unstable. In comparison to the Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a swirling universe, the light rings typically all possess different radii. Interestingly, as the value of the swirling parameter is increased at fixed angular momentum of the black hole the two disconnected patches of the ergoregions eventually merge. The light ring at this merger possesses no angular velocity (as measured by an observer at infinity) and is called a \textit{light point}. To our knowledge, this is the first time the existence of such a light point in a black hole space-time is reported. Finally, we also present the shadows of KBHSU for various parameter values and observe that, due to the presence of the swirling background, the shadows are twisted.</description>

      <title>Thermal nature of confining strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum statistical properties of the confining string connecting a static fermion-antifermion pair in the massive Schwinger model. By analyzing the reduced density matrix of the subsystem located in between the fermion and antifermion, we demonstrate that as the interfermion separation approaches the string-breaking distance, the overlap between the microscopic density matrix and an effective thermal density matrix exhibits a pronounced, narrow peak, approaching unity at the onset of string breaking. This behavior reveals that the confining flux tube evolves toward a genuinely thermal state as the separation between the charges grows, even in the absence of an external heat bath. In other words, one cannot tell whether a reduced state of the subsystem arises from a surrounding heat bath or from entanglement with the rest of the system. The entanglement spectrum near the critical string-breaking distance exhibits a rapid transition from the dominance of a single state describing the confining electric string towards a strongly entangled state containing virtual fermion-antifermion pairs. Our findings establish a quantitative link between confinement, entanglement, and emergent thermality, and suggest that string breaking corresponds to a microscopic thermalization transition within the flux tube.</description>

      <title>Light Vector Dark Matter via a Magnetic Dipole Portal: Bridging Direct Detection and Fixed-Target Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a model featuring sub-GeV vector dark matter by augmenting the Standard Model with a new non-Abelian dark $SU(2)_D$, spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation values of a scalar doublet and a triplet. Interactions between the dark and visible sectors arise through a dimension-5 non-Abelian \textit{avatar} of kinetic mixing portal, inducing effective magnetic dipole couplings of the dark matter, with the photon and Z boson. The resulting spectrum of the dark gauge bosons naturally exhibits an inverse mass hierarchy between the dark matter and the $Z^\prime$, leading to interesting phenomenology at fixed-target experiments such as LDMX through dark off-shell bremsstrahlung, dark Higgs-strahlung, invisible vector meson decay, and visible decays. We compute the thermal relic abundance across sub-GeV dark matter masses, with regions of freeze-out proceeding via forbidden annihilation into dark sector states or direct annihilation into Standard Model states. Bounds from a broad set of laboratory probes, along with cosmological and astrophysical observations, are incorporated in our analysis. Among them, the most restrictive bounds originate from direct detection experiments, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, collider searches, and the CMB. Our results demonstrate that a sizeable region of parameter space remains consistent with the observed relic abundance and current experimental constraints, and that fixed-target searches should be considered in tandem with direct detection and cosmological probes for an effective and comprehensive search strategy, especially in the off-shell regime.</description>

      <title>Linear realization of SU(3) parity doublet model for octet baryons with bad diquark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a linear $SU(3)_L \times SU(3)_R$ parity doublet model for octet baryons. Our model employs the $(3,\bar{3}) + (\bar{3},3)$ and $(3,6) + (6,3)$ chiral representations while excluding the $(8,1) + (1,8)$ representation. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate that the $(3,6) + (6,3)$ representation containing symmetric ``bad'' diquarks, despite being energetically disfavored, is essential for reproducing the correct baryon mass hierarchy, particularly the $\Sigma$$\Xi$ mass ordering. The model incorporates both spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking, with the latter implemented through bare quark mass terms that properly account for $SU(3)$ flavor breaking effects. Our numerical analysis successfully reproduces the ground-state octet baryon masses and predicts the spectrum of excited states up to 2.5 GeV. For the experimentally challenging $\Xi$ sector, we provide specific predictions for spin-parity assignments: identifying $\Xi(1950)$ as the first positive-parity excitation. The analysis reveals that ground states are dominated by the $(3,\bar{3}) + (\bar{3},3)$ representation, consistent with the preference for ``good'' diquark configurations, while the $(3,6) + (6,3)$ contribution remains crucial for the mass spectrum.</description>

Abstract: Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the suggestion of P. W. Anderson, there were early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations:
  (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and
  (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_\Delta$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)).
  These notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to ultracold atom experiments on the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor. The ALM also leads to a wavefunction for the FL* state of the Hubbard model, which agrees with ultracold atom observations.</description>
