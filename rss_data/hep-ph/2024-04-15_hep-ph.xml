      <title>A Mass Ordering Sum Rule for the Neutrino Disappearance Channels in T2K, NOvA and JUNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a method for determining the neutrino mass ordering by using precision measurements of the atmospheric $\Delta m^2$'s in both electron neutrino and muon neutrino disappearance channels, proposed by the authors in 2005 (hep-ph/0503283). The mass ordering is a very important outstanding question for our understanding of the elusive neutrino and determination of the mass ordering has consequences for other neutrino experiments. The JUNO reactor experiment will start data taking this year, and the precision of the atmospheric $\Delta m^2$'s from electron anti-neutrino measurements will improve by a factor of three from Daya Bay's 2.4 % to 0.8 % within a year. This measurement, when combined with the atmospheric $\Delta m^2$'s measurements from T2K and NOvA for muon neutrino disappearance, will contribute substantially to the $\Delta \chi^2$ between the two remaining neutrino mass orderings. In this paper we derive a mass ordering sum rule that can be used to address the possibility that JUNO's atmospheric $\Delta m^2$'s measurement, when combined with other experiments in particular T2K and NOvA, can determine the neutrino mass ordering at the 3 $\sigma$ confidence level within one year of operation. For a confidence level of 5 $\sigma$ in a single experiment we will have to wait until the middle of the next decade when the DUNE experiment is operating.</description>

      <title>Hard Thermal Loop -- theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, we present the most key aspects of modern thermal perturbation theory based on hard thermal loop (HTL) approximation including its theoretical foundations and discuss some applications within quantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum chromodynamics (QCD) plasma. To maintain conciseness, our discussion is confined to thermal equilibrium scenarios, but consider a variety of different quantities and settings. Specifically, we discuss both bulk thermodynamic properties and real-time observables, spanning the domain of high temperatures, relevant for heavy-ion physics.</description>

      <title>A complete analysis of the Landau-gauge three-gluon vertex from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several continuum and lattice investigations of the QCD three-gluon vertex have recently exposed its key properties, some intimately connected with the low-momentum behavior of the two-point gluon Green's function and specially relevant for the emergence of a mass scale in this latter, via the Schwinger mechanism. In the present study, we report on a lattice determination of the Landau-gauge, transversely projected three-gluon vertex, particularly scrutinizing an outstanding one of these properties, termed planar degeneracy, exploring its implications and capitalizing on it to gain further insight on the low-momentum running of both the three-gluon vertex and its associated strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Hidden BPS states of electroweak monopole and a new bound estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the BPS Lagrangian method, we obtain a distinct set of Bogomolny equations for the Cho-Maison monopoles from the bosonic sector of a regularized electroweak theory. In the limit of $n\rightarrow\infty$ of the permittivity regulator, $\epsilon\left(\rho^n\right)$, the mass of the monopole can be estimated to be $M_W\sim3.56$ TeV. This value is within the latest theoretical window, 2.98 TeV - 3.75 TeV. We also discuss some possible regularization mechanisms of electroweak monopole in the Yang-Mills sector and the existence of its BPS state.</description>

      <title>Study of transport properties of a hot and dense QCD matter using a novel approximation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the charge and heat transport properties of a hot and dense QCD matter using a novel approximation method within the quasiparticle model. Utilizing a novel collision integral for both the relaxation time approximation (RTA) and the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) models, we have solved the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation to estimate the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity. We have investigated the temperature dependence of these transport coefficients. We have also provided a comparison between our findings and those of the standard RTA and BGK models. Further, we have explored the temperature dependence of the thermal diffusion constant and the Lorenz number using the novel approaches of the aforesaid models.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the L3 BEC at Z$^0$-pole -- Comparison of the conventional formula against the $\tau$-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The L3 Collaboration reported data on 2-jet and 3-jet Bose-Einstein correlations (BECs) with the results obtained through the $\tau$-model in 2011. In this study, we analyze these correlations using the conventional formula with the Gaussian long-range correlation (${\rm CF\times LRC_{(Gauss)}}$). The estimated ranges of interactions for 2-jet and 3-jet, $R_{\rm 2-jet}$ and $R_{\rm 3-jet}$, have almost the same magnitude as those by $\tau$-model: $R_{\rm 2-jet}=0.83\pm 0.05$ fm and $R_{\rm 3-jet}=1.09\pm 0.04$ fm. The anticorrelation in BEC (less than 1.0) observed by the L3 Collaboration is related to the partially negative density profile ($\rho_{\rm \tau, BE}(\xi)$ in $\xi$ space) in the $\tau$-model and the ${\rm LRC_{(Gauss)}}=1/(1+\alpha e^{-\beta Q^2})$ in ${\rm CF_I\times LRC_{(Gauss)}}$, respectively. Remarkably, the probability $P_{\tau}(\xi)$ calculated from the Levy canonical form exhibits partially negative behavior.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading-order relativistic and QCD corrections to prompt $\boldsymbol{J/\psi}$ pair photoproduction at future $\boldsymbol{e^+e^-}$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of nonrelativistic-QCD factorization, we calculate both the next-to-leading-order relativistic and QCD corrections to prompt $J/\psi$ pair production, with feeddown from $\psi(2S)$ mesons, via photon-photon collisions at future $e^+e^-$ colliders including the Future Circular Lepton Collider (FCC-ee), the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), and the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC). We present total cross sections and distributions in single $J/\psi$ transverse momentum and rapidity, and in $J/\psi$ pair invariant mass. The relativistic and QCD corrections both turn out to be large and negative. Yet, the production rates are large enough for useful experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Mass spectrum of fully charmed $[cc][\bar c\bar c]$ tetraquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are three $S$ and seven $P$ fully charmed $[cc][\bar c\bar c]$ tetraquarks, the mass spectrum from $1S$ to $2P$ excitations is calculated in a non-relativistic quark potential model. In the calculation, the interactions among four internal quarks/antiquark are approximated as a dominant color interaction between a diquark and an antidiquark, and a residual interaction responsible for the diquark/antidiquark cluster effect. The color interaction between the diquark and the antidiquark is characterized by the conventional Cornell potential, while the residual interaction is modeled as the Yukawa-type scalar $\sigma$ and vector $\omega$ boson exchange potentials. In the numerical results, though the scalar $\sigma$ and vector $\omega$ boson exchange interactions reduce the masses of $S-$wave $[cc][\bar c\bar c]$ tetraquarks $40-50$ MeV, they contribute to the masses of other $[cc][\bar c\bar c]$ tetraquarks small. The mass splittings of $[cc][\bar c\bar c]$ tetraquarks between different multiplets and within the same multiplet are smaller than those in charmonium, and the splittings are affected by the scalar $\sigma$ or vector $\omega$ boson exchange interactions small. Our calculations suggest that the observed $X(6600)$, $X(6900)$ and $X(7300)$ should be different radial excitations of $[cc][\bar c\bar c]$. The measurements of the $J^{PC}$ quantum numbers and the mass splittings will be helpful to identify and understand of the $[cc][\bar c\bar c]$ candidates.</description>

      <title>QCD sum rules for positive and negative parity heavy baryons at next-to-leading order in $\alpha_s$-expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QCD sum rules for positive and negative parity heavy baryons in the heavy quark limit are formulated. We apply the method to $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma$ channels. We include the next-to-leading order corrections in $\alpha_s$-expansion to dimension 0 and 3 terms in the operator product expansion. The corrections lead to the considerable reduction of the predicted masses and significantly improves the stability with respect to the Borel parameter, especially for negative parity states. It is also found that in the heavy quark limit chiral odd condensates do not contribute to the negative parity states.</description>

      <title>Is Doublet-Triplet Splitting Necessary?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that it is not necessary to substantially break the mass degeneracy between the Standard Model Higgs boson doublet and the corresponding scalar leptoquark, where these two fields comprise a single five-dimensional $SU(5)$ representation. More precisely, we show that the experimental data on partial proton decay lifetimes cannot place any meaningful bound on the mass of the scalar leptoquark, a.k.a.\ the color triplet, if one includes effects of higher-dimensional operators within the Georgi-Glashow model. We also point out that the complete suppression of proton decay via the scalar leptoquark mediation is compatible with the partial suppression of the gauge mediated two-body proton decay signatures. Finally, we derive a proper limit on the cutoff scale of the aforementioned higher-dimensional operators and outline how this scenario could be tested.</description>

      <title>Review on Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This proceedings' contribution explores the rationale behind the axion as a resolution to the strong CP puzzle. It outlines various benchmark axion models and examines their implications, focusing on two key aspects: (i) the axion's interactions with the Standard Model particles, and (ii) its potential role as dark matter. Additionally, it provides an overview of the discovery prospects associated with ongoing and future axion experiments. These efforts span from laboratory-based endeavors aimed at directly producing and detecting axions to searches for solar axions, and finally, to the direct detection of axion dark matter.</description>

      <title>Heavy Particle Towers and Nonlocal QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of gravitation-motivated theories, as well as theories with new coloured fermions predict heavy particle towers with spectral densities $\rho(m^2)$ growing faster than $e^{m}$, a characteristic of nonlocalizable theories. It is shown that if a light scalar, like the Higgs boson, interacts strongly with a heavy scalar particle tower with exponentially rising degeneracy, then the local low-energy theory is equivalent to an effective nonlocal scalar QFT. For energies approaching the nonlocality scale $p^2\simeq\Lambda_{NL}^2$, the scalar propagator and scattering amplitudes are modified by nonlocal factors of the form $e^{p^2/\Lambda^2_{NL}}$. The double-Higgs production measurement at the LHC is proposed as a highly sensitive probe of nonlocality at the electroweak scale.</description>

      <title>Light single-gluon hybrid states with various (exotic) quantum numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the QCD sum rule method to study the light single-gluon hybrid states with various (exotic) quantum numbers. We construct twenty-four single-gluon hybrid currents, and use eighteen of them to calculate the masses of forty-four single-gluon hybrid states with the quark-gluon contents $\bar q q g$ ($q=u/d$) and $\bar s s g$. We concentrate on the hybrid states with the exotic quantum number $J^{PC} = 1^{-+}$, whose masses and widths are calculated to be $M_{|\bar q q g;1^-1^{-+}\rangle} =1.67^{+0.15}_{-0.17}$ GeV, $\Gamma_{|\bar q q g;1^-1^{-+}\rangle} = 530^{+540}_{-330}$ MeV, $M_{|\bar q q g;0^+1^{-+}\rangle} = 1.67^{+0.15}_{-0.17}$ GeV, $\Gamma_{|\bar q q g;0^+1^{-+}\rangle} = 120^{+160}_{-110}$ MeV, $M_{|\bar s s g;0^+1^{-+}\rangle} = 1.84^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$ GeV, and $\Gamma_{|\bar s s g;0^+1^{-+}\rangle} = 100^{+110}_{-~80}$ MeV. Our results support the interpretations of the $\pi_1(1600)$ and $\eta_1(1855)$ as the hybrid states $|\bar q q g;1^-1^{-+}\rangle$ and $|\bar s s g;0^+1^{-+}\rangle$, respectively. Considering the uncertainties, our results suggest that the $\pi_1(1600)$ and $\eta_1(1855)$ may also be interpreted as the hybrid states $|\bar q q g;1^-1^{-+}\rangle$ and $|\bar q q g;0^+1^{-+}\rangle$, respectively. To differentiate these two assignments and to verify whether they are hybrid states or not, we propose to examine the $a_1(1260) \pi$ decay channel in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Refined TMD gluon density in a proton from the HERA and LHC data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We update the phenomenological parameters of the Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD, or unintegrated) gluon density in a proton proposed in our previous studies. This analysis is based on the analytical expression for starting gluon distribution which provides a self-consistent simultaneous description of HERA data on proton structure function $F_2(x,Q^2)$, reduced cross section for the electron-proton deep inelastic scattering at low $Q^2$ and soft hadron production in $pp$ collisions at the LHC conditions. We extend it to the whole kinematical region using the Catani-Ciafaloni-Fiorani-Marchesini (CCFM) evolution equation. Exploiting our previous results on a number of semihard QCD processes, we performed a combined fit to an extended set of LHC and HERA data, comprising a total of $509$ points from $16$ data sets. We illustrate our fit by applying the derived TMD gluon density in a proton to inclusive prompt photon photoproduction at HERA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenology of $d=6$ dipole portal operators connecting active and sterile neutrinos at a futuristic muon collider. These operators can be the dominant portal between the Standard Model and the New Physics sector in scenarios in which the active-sterile mixing is suppressed. We identify two production modes for sterile neutrinos: one proceeding through the exchange of an $s-$channel electroweak boson and one arising from the fusion of an electroweak boson with a Standard Model lepton. We study the expected reach on the operators suppression scale for these different production mechanisms, showing that the latter offers the best sensitivity and allowing to test a New Physics scale in the $\sim 10\;$TeV range.</description>

      <title>Indirect constraints on third generation baryon number violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-observation of baryon number violation suggests that the scale of baryon-number violating interactions at zero temperature is comparable to the GUT scale. However, the pertinent measurements involve hadrons made of the first-generation quarks, such as protons and neutrons. One may therefore entertain the idea that new flavour physics breaks baryon number at a much lower scale, but only in the coupling to a third generation quark, leading to observable baryon-number violating $b$-hadron decay rates. In this paper we show that indirect constraints on the new physics scale $\Lambda_{\rm BNV}$ from the existing bounds on the proton lifetime do not allow for this possibility. For this purpose we consider the three dominant proton decay channels $p \to \ell^+ \nu_\ell \bar{\nu}$, $p \to \pi^+ \bar{\nu}$ and $p \to \pi^0 \ell^+$ mediated by a virtual bottom quark.</description>

      <title>Four-loop splitting functions in QCD -- The quark-to-gluon case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the even-N moments N =&lt; 20 of the fourth-order (N^3LO) contribution P_{gq}^(3)(x) to the quark-to-gluon splitting function in perturbative QCD. These moments, obtained by analytically computing off-shell operator matrix elements for a general gauge group, agree with all known results, in particular with the moments N =&lt; 10 derived before from structure functions in deep-inelastic scattering. Using the new moments and the available endpoint constraints, we construct approximations for P_{gq}^(3)(x) which improve upon those obtained from the lowest five even moments. The remaining uncertainties of this function are now practically irrelevant at momentum fractions x &gt; 0.1. The resulting errors of the convolution of P_{gq} at N^3LO with a typical quark distribution are small at x &gt;~ 10^{-3} and exceed 1% only at x ~&lt; 10^{-4} for a strong coupling alpha_s = 0.2. The present results for P_{gq}^(3)(x) should thus be sufficient for most collider-physics applications.</description>

      <title>Nuclear spatial resolution in near-encounter UPC dijet photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present next-to-leading order perturbative QCD predictions for inclusive dijet photoproduction in ultra-peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions (UPCs) within the impact-parameter dependent equivalent photon approximation. Taking into account the finite size of both the photon-emitting and the target nucleus, we show that this process is sensitive to the transverse-plane geometry of the UPC events. We show that this leads to a sizeable, 20-40% effect for large values of the $z_\gamma$ variable in the dijet photoproduction cross section in lead-lead UPCs at 5.02 TeV compared to the widely-used pointlike approximation where the nuclear radius is accounted only as a sharp cut-off in the photon flux calculation. This resolution of the spatial degrees of freedom is a result of having high-transverse-momentum jets in the final state, which at the large-$z_\gamma$ kinematics requires a highly energetic photon in the initial state, thus biasing the collisions to small impact-parameter ''near-encounter'' configurations. We further discuss the role of the forward-neutron event-class selection in isolating the photonuclear cross section in the nucleus-nucleus collisions, and employ the needed electromagnetic breakup survival factor in our predictions.</description>

      <title>Electrical conductivity of QGP with quasiparticle quarks and Gribov gluon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electrical conductivity of a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium using non-perturbative resummation via Gribov gluon propagator. To calculate the electrical conductivity, we utilize the relativistic Boltzmann's kinetic equation, within the relaxation-time approximation (RTA). The relaxation times are obtained by computing the microscopic two-body scattering amplitude. We adopt the quasiparticle approach, which allows us to comprehend the transport properties in both the weak and strong coupling regimes. Above the transition temperature, we estimate the electrical conductivity of the quark-gluon plasma using the Gribov prescription and compare our findings with lattice results and various phenomenological models. We find our results in close agreement with the lattice data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A global interpretation of several significant indications of scalar resonances observed at LHC is achieved using the Georgi Machacek model. Among many other consequences, one predicts large cross sections for the processes ggFH(320)-&gt;h(125)h(125) and A(151)A(151) and ggF-&gt;A(420)-&gt;H(320)Z, where H(320) has been observed in A(420)-&gt;H(320)Z-&gt;bbbbl+l- and where A(151) is observed into two photons accompanied by a b jet, a lepton or missing transverse energy. We predict that ggF-&gt;H(320) has a cross section of about 2000 fb with a BR into h(125)(125) of 17% and into A(151)A(151) of 45%. Henceforth we predict that ggF-&gt;H(320)-&gt;hh will dominate over the SM process h*-&gt;hh, where h is the SM h(125) scalar. One expects that H(320)-&gt;A(151)A(151) can be observed into bbbb, becoming one of the most significant BSM phenomena identified so far.</description>

      <title>A machine learning-based study of open-charm hadrons in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions, the study of charm hadrons plays a pivotal role in understanding the QCD medium and provides an undisputed testing ground for the theory of strong interaction, as they are mostly produced in the early stages of collisions via hard partonic interactions. The lightest open-charm, $D^{0}$ meson ($c\bar{u}$), can originate from two separate sources. The prompt $D^{0}$ originates from direct charm production or decay of excited open charm states, and the nonprompt stems from the decay of beauty hadrons. In this paper, using different machine learning (ML) algorithms such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forest, an attempt has been made to segregate the prompt and nonprompt production modes of $D^{0}$ meson signal from its background. The ML models are trained using the invariant mass ($M_{\pi K}$) through its hadronic decay channel, i.e., $D^{0}\rightarrow\pi^{+} K^{-}$, pseudoproper time ($t_{z}$), pseudoproper decay length ($c\tau$), and distance of closest approach of $D^{0}$ meson, using PYTHIA8 simulated $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\rm{TeV}$. The ML models used in this analysis are found to retain the pseudorapidity, transverse momentum, and collision energy dependence. In addition, we report the ratio of nonprompt to prompt $D^{0}$ yield, the self-normalized yield of prompt and nonprompt $D^{0}$ and explore the charmonium, $J/\psi$ to open-charm, $D^{0}$ yield ratio as a function of transverse momenta and normalized multiplicity. The observables studied in this manuscript are well predicted by all the ML models compared to the simulation.</description>

      <title>Matching Hadronization and Perturbative Evolution: The Cluster Model in Light of Infrared Shower Cutoff Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of Monte Carlo (MC) generators with parton showers that have next-to-leading-logarithmic (NLL) precision, the cutoff $Q_0$ terminating the shower evolution should be viewed as an infrared factorization scale so that parameters or non-perturbative effects of the MC generator may have a field theoretic interpretation with a controllable scheme dependence. This implies that the generator's parton level should be carefully defined within QCD perturbation theory with subleading order precision. Furthermore, it entails that the shower cut $Q_0$ is not treated as one of the generator's tuning parameters, but that the tuning can be carried out reliably for a range of $Q_0$ values and that the hadron level description is $Q_0$-invariant. This in turn imposes non-trival constraints on the behavior of the generator's hadronization model, so that its parameters can adapt accordingly when the $Q_0$ value is changed. We investigate these features using the angular ordered parton shower and the cluster hadronization model implemented in the Herwig~7.2 MC generator focusing in particular on the $e^+e^-$ 2-jettiness distribution, where the shower is known to be NLL precise and where QCD factorization imposes stringent constraints on the hadronization corrections. We show that the Herwig default cluster hadronization model does not exhibit these features or consistency with QCD factorization with a satisfying precision. We design a modification of the cluster hadronization model, where some dynamical parton shower aspects are added that are missing in the default model. For this novel dynamical cluster hadronization model these features and consistency with QCD factorization are realized much more accurately.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarized semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) is a key process in the quest for a resolution of the proton spin puzzle. We present the complete results for the polarized SIDIS process at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics. Our analytical results include all partonic channels for the scattering of polarized leptons off hadrons and a spin-averaged hadron identified in the final state. A numerical analysis of the NNLO corrections illustrates their significance and the reduced residual scale dependence in the kinematic range probed by the future Electron-Ion-Collider EIC.</description>

      <title>Testing the standardizability of, and deriving cosmological constraints from, a new Amati-correlated gamma-ray burst data compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using gamma-ray burst (GRB) data to simultaneously constrain Amati correlation parameters and cosmological parameters in six spatially-flat and nonflat dark energy cosmological models, we show that an updated 220 GRB version of the Jia et al. [Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 516, 2575 (2022)] GRB data compilation are standardizable through the Amati correlation and so can be used for cosmological analyses. However, the resulting GRB data constraints on the current value of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter, $\Omega_{m0}$, are in $&gt;2\sigma$ tension with those from a joint analysis of better-established Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data for most of the cosmological models we consider, indicating that these GRB data cannot be jointly used with better-established $H(z)$ + BAO data to constrain cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Enumerating 6D supergravities with $T\leq 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space of 6D supergravities with minimal supersymmetry is greatly constrained by anomaly cancellation. Nevertheless, a large number of models satisfy all low-energy consistency conditions and in this work we make progress towards exhaustively enumerating all anomaly-free models with at most one tensor multiplet. Generalizing previous techniques, we describe a general algorithm using multi-hypergraphs and simplicial complexes to systematically enumerate anomaly-free models with gauge groups of any number of simple factors and with hypermultiplets falling into any representations. Using these new ideas, we obtain a \emph{complete} list of anomaly-free models for $T\leq 1$, the only simplifying assumption being that the gauge group contains no $\operatorname{U}(1)$, $\operatorname{SU}(2)$, $\operatorname{SU}(3)$ or $\operatorname{Sp}(2)$ factors. We also study how many/which models in this ensemble satisfy several UV and swampland bounds which have been proposed and previously utilized to great effect, finding that none are ruled out for $T=0$ and $\approx\!50\%$ are inconsistent with quantum gravity for $T=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To describe the dark side of the Universe, we adopt a novel approach where dark energy is explained as an electrically charged majority of dark matter. Dark energy, as such, does not exist. The Friedmann equation at the present time coincides with that in a conventional approach, although the cosmological "constant" in the Electromagnetic Accelerating Universe (EAU) Model shares a time dependence with the matter component. Its equation of state is $\omega \equiv P/\rho \equiv -1$ within observational accuracy.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript we examine the Unruh-thermalized CERN-NA63 radiation reaction data set from the point of view of a diphoton Rindler bath. Under the assumption that these Hawking-Unruh diphoton pairs are microscopic trans-Planckian black holes, we find the resultant heat capacity describes the measured energy spectrum and is thus a dual description of the data set. Then, employing an n-dimensional Stefan-Boltzmann analysis, we find the power radiated by a black hole in the standard 3+1 spacetime dimensions in complete agreement with the data. Finally, we utilize this power spectrum to directly measure Newtons constant of gravitation.</description>

      <title>Linear stability of vector Horndeski black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Horndeski's vector-tensor (HVT) gravity is described by a Lagrangian in which the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}=\partial_{\mu} A_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu} A_{\mu}$ of a vector field $A_{\mu}$ interacts with a double dual Riemann tensor $L^{\mu \nu \alpha \beta}$ in the form $\beta L^{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} F_{\mu \nu} F_{\alpha \beta}$, where $\beta$ is a constant. In Einstein-Maxwell-HVT theory, there are static and spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solutions with electric or magnetic charges, whose metric components are modified from those in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om geometry. The electric-magnetic duality of solutions is broken even at the background level by the nonvanishing coupling constant $\beta$. We compute a second-order action of BH perturbations containing both the odd- and even-parity modes and show that there are four dynamical perturbations arising from the gravitational and vector-field sectors. We derive all the linear stability conditions associated with the absence of ghosts and radial/angular Laplacian instabilities for both the electric and magnetic BHs. These conditions exhibit the difference between the electrically and magnetically charged cases by reflecting the breaking of electric-magnetic duality at the level of perturbations. In particular, the four angular propagation speeds in the large-multipole limit are different from each other for both the electric and magnetic BHs. This suggests the breaking of eikonal correspondence between the peak position of at least one of the potentials of dynamical perturbations and the radius of photon sphere. For the electrically and magnetically charged cases, we elucidate parameter spaces of the HVT coupling and the BH charge in which the BHs without naked singularities are linearly stable.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Correlators with Double Massive Exchanges: Bootstrap Equation and Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the recently developed cosmological bootstrap method, we compute the exact analytical solution for the seed integral appearing in cosmological correlators with double massive scalar exchanges. The result is explicit, valid in any kinematic configuration, and free from spurious divergences. It is applicable to any number of fields' species with any masses. With an appropriate choice of variables, the results contain only single-layer summations. We also propose simple approximate formulas valid in different limits, enabling direct and instantaneous evaluation.Supported by exact numerical results using CosmoFlow, we explore the phenomenology of double massive exchange diagrams. Contrary to single-exchange diagrams with ubiquitous Lorentz-covariant interactions, the size of the cubic coupling constant can be large while respecting perturbativity bounds. Because of this property, the primordial bispectrum from double-exchange diagrams can be as large as, coincidentally, current observational constraints. In addition to being sizable on equilateral configurations, we show that the primordial bispectrum exhibits a large cosmological collider signal in the squeezed limit, making the double massive exchanges interesting channels for the detection of massive primordial fields. We propose to decisively disentangle double-exchange channels from single-exchange ones with cosmological observations by exploiting the phase information of the cosmological collider signal, the inflationary flavor oscillations from multiple fields' species exchanges and the double soft limit in the primordial trispectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of nuclear structure has garnered considerable attention in the high-energy nuclear physics community in recent years. This work focuses on studying the potential nuclear cluster structure in $^{16}\text{O}$ nuclei using anisotropic flow observables in $\rm O+O$ collisions at 200 GeV. Employing an improved AMPT model with various cluster structure configurations, we find that an extended effective parton formation time is necessary to align with the recent STAR experimental data. In addition, we reveal that the presented flow observables serve as sensitive probes for differentiating configurations of $\alpha$-clustering of $^{16}\text{O}$ nuclei. The systematic AMPT calculations presented in this paper, along with comprehensive comparisons to forthcoming experimental measurements at RHIC and the LHC, pave the way for a novel approach to investigate the $\alpha$-clustering structure of $^{16}\text{O}$ nuclei using $\rm O+O$ collisions at the ultra-relativistic energies.</description>

Abstract: We present the first results of the search for sub-MeV fermionic dark matter absorbed by electron targets of Germanium using the 205.4~kg$\cdot$day data collected by the CDEX-10 experiment, with the analysis threshold of 160~eVee. No significant dark matter (DM) signals over the background are observed. Results are presented as limits on the cross section of DM--electron interaction. We present new constraints of cross section in the DM range of 0.1--10 keV/$c^2$ for vector and axial-vector interaction. The upper limit on the cross section is set to be $\rm 5.5\times10^{-46}~cm^2$ for vector interaction, and $\rm 1.8\times10^{-46}~cm^2$ for axial-vector interaction at DM mass of 5 keV/$c^2$.</description>

Abstract: Analyses for the NICER data indicate that there is no significant variation of the compact star radii within the mass range of 1.4 to 2.0 solar masses. Yamamoto et al. [Phys. Rev. C 108, 035811 (2023)] concluded recently that ``this feature cannot be reproduced by the hadronic matter due to the softening of the equation of state (EoS) by hyperon mixing, suggesting the possible existence of quark phases in neutron-star interiors.'' Using a collection of 162 purely nucleonic, hyperonic, and quarkish EoSs from CompOSE database and some other works, we verify that hyperons indeed lead to a significant difference in radii of stars of 1.4 and 2.0 solar masses, which diminishes in the presence of quarks. We compare the shapes of the mass-radius curves and show that hyperons and quarks in the neutron star cores prefer a particular curve shape with backbending. It is argued that the shape {is controlled by the density dependence} of the nuclear symmetry energy. We draw attention to the existence of a class of purely hadronic relativistic mean-field EoSs with scalar-field dependent hadron masses and coupling constants that satisfy the known constraints on the EoSs including the analyses of the new NICER data and the above requirement of no significant variation of the neutron star radii.</description>

      <title>Effects of Superradiance in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spinning supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the core of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) provides room for the elusive ultra-light scalar particles (ULSP) to be produced through a phenomenon called \textit{superradiance}. As a result of this phenomenon, a cloud of scalar particles forms around the black hole by draining the spin angular momentum of the SMBH. In this work, we present a study of the superradiant instability due to a scalar field in the vicinity of the central SMBH in an AGN. We begin by showing that the time-evolution of the gravitational coupling $\alpha$ in a realistic ambiance created by the accretion disk around the SMBH in AGN leads to interesting consequences such as the amplified growth of the scalar cloud, enhancement of the gravitational wave emission rate, and appearance of higher modes of superradiance within the age of the Universe ($\sim 10^{10}$ years). We then explore the consequence of superradiance on the characteristics of the AGN. Using the Novikov-Thorne model for an accretion disk, we divide the full spectrum into three distinct wavelength bands- X-ray ($10^{-4}-10^{-2}~\mu$m), UV (0.010-0.4~$\mu$m), and Vis-IR (0.4~$\mu$m-100~$\mu$m) and observe sudden drops in the time-variations of the luminosities across these bands and Eddington ratio ($f_{\textrm{Edd}}$) with a characteristic timescale of superradiance. Using a uniform distribution of spin and mass of the SMBHs in AGNs, we demonstrate the appearance of depleted regions and accumulations along the boundaries of these regions in the planes of different band-luminosities and $f_{\textrm{Edd}}$. Finally, we discuss some possible signatures of superradiance that can be drawn from the observed time-variation of the AGN luminosities.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from a scotogenic two-loop neutrino mass model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01964v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework to account for neutrino masses at the two-loop level. This mechanism introduces new scalars and Majorana fermions to the Standard Model. It is assumed the existence of a global $\mathrm{U(1)\times \mathcal{Z}_2}$ symmetry which after partial breaking provides the stability of the dark matter candidates of the theory. The rich structure of the potential allows for the possibility of first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in the early Universe which can lead to the generation of primordial gravitational waves as one of the potentially observable signatures of this model. Taking into account relevant constraints from lepton flavour violation, neutrino physics as well as the trilinear Higgs couplings at next-to-leading order accuracy, we have found a wide range of possible FOPTs which are strong enough to be probed at the proposed gravitational-wave interferometer experiments such as LISA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the quark mass dependence - light and heavy - of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ properties, such as, mass, coupling to $DK$, scattering lengths and compositeness, from a global analysis of $DK$ energy levels from LQCD. In particular, we analyze the HSC energy levels for $DK$ scattering in $I=0$ for different boosts and two pion masses. The formalism is based in the local hidden-gauge interaction of Weinberg-Tomozawa type which respects chiral and heavy quark spin symmetries, supplemented by a term that takes into account the $D^{(*)}K$ coupling to a bare $c\bar{s}$ component. The isospin violating decay of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)\to D_{s}^+\pi^0$ is also evaluated.</description>

      <title>Four-loop splitting functions in QCD -- The gluon-to-quark case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have computed the even-$N$ moments $N \leq 20$ of the gluon-to-quark splitting function $P_{\rm qg}$ at the fourth order of perturbative QCD via the renormalization of off-shell operator matrix elements. Our results, derived analytically for a general gauge group, agree with all results obtained for this function so far, in particular with the lowest five moments obtained via physical cross sections. Using our new moments and all available endpoint constraints, we construct approximations for the four-loop $P_{\rm qg}(x)$ that should be sufficient for a wide range of collider-physics applications. The N$^3$LO corrections resulting from these and the corresponding quark-quark splitting functions lead to a marked improvement of the perturbative accuracy for the scale derivative of the singlet quark distribution, with effects of 1% or less at $x \gtrsim 10^{\,-4}$ at a standard reference scale with $\alpha_s = 0.2$.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mixing sum rules and the Littlest Seesaw</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13895v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the neutrino mixing sum rules arising from discrete symmetries, and the class of Littlest Seesaw (LS) neutrino models. These symmetry based approaches all offer predictions for the cosine of the leptonic CP phase $\cos \delta$ in terms of the mixing angles, $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{23}$, while the LS models also predict the sine of the leptonic CP phase $\sin \delta$ as well as making other predictions. In particular we study the \textit{solar} neutrino mixing sum rules, arising from charged lepton corrections to Tri-bimaximal (TB), Bi-maximal (BM), Golden Ratios (GRs) and Hexagonal (HEX) neutrino mixing, and \textit{atmospheric} neutrino mixing sum rules, arising from preserving one of the columns of these types of mixing, for example the first or second column of the TB mixing matrix (TM1 or TM2), and confront them with an up-to-date global fit of the neutrino oscillation data. We show that some mixing sum rules, for example an \textit{atmospheric} neutrino mixing sum rule arising from a version of neutrino Golden Ratio mixing (GRa1), are already excluded at 3$\sigma$, and determine the remaining models allowed by the data. We also consider the more predictive LS models (which obey the TM1 sum rules and offer further predictions) based on constrained sequential dominance CSD($n$) with $n\approx 3$. We compare for the first time the three cases $n=2.5$, $n=3$ and $n=1+\sqrt{6}\approx 3.45$ which are favoured by theoretical models, using a new type of analysis to accurately predict the observables $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{23}$ and $\delta$. We study all the above approaches, \textit{solar} and \textit{atmospheric} mixing sum rules and LS models, together so that they may be compared, and to give an up to date analysis of the predictions of all of these possibilities, when confronted with the most recent global fits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can be naturally lighter than the electroweak scale. We consider an ALP that couples to the Standard Model Higgs to achieve the strong first-order electroweak phase transition. We discuss the two-field dynamics of the phase transition and the associated computation in detail and identify the viable parameter space. The ALP mass can be from the MeV to GeV scale. Baryon asymmetry can be explained by local baryogenesis without violating the current electron and atom electric dipole moment bound in most of the viable parameter space. The viable parameter space can be probed through Higgs exotic decay, rare kaon decay, the electron and atomic electric dipole moment, and the effective number of neutrinos in the cosmic microwave background in the future. The gravitational-wave signal is too weak to be detected.</description>

      <title>Correcting for cutoff dependence in backward evolution of QCD parton showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monte Carlo event generators for hard hadronic collisions depend on the evolution of parton showers backwards from a high-scale subprocess to the hadronization scale. The evolution is treated as a branching process with a sequence of resolvable parton emissions. The criterion of resolvability involves cutoffs that determine the no-emission probability (NEP) for a given range of the evolution scale. Existing event generators neglect cutoff-dependent terms in the NEP that, although formally power-suppressed, can have significant phenomenological effects. We compute such terms and study their consequences. One important result is that it is not possible for the backward shower to faithfully reproduce the cutoff-independent parton distribution functions (PDFs) used to generate it. We show that the computed NEP corrections mitigate but do not eliminate this problem. An alternative approach is to use cutoff-dependent PDFs that are consistent with the uncorrected NEP. Then one must apply cutoff-dependent corrections to hard subprocess matrix elements. We compute those corrections to the first nontrivial order for the Drell-Yan process and for Higgs production by gluon fusion.</description>

      <title>Vortex Effects in Merging Black Holes and Saturons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vorticity has recently been suggested to be a property of highly-spinning black holes. The connection between vorticity and limiting spin represents a universal feature shared by objects of maximal microstate entropy, so-called saturons. Using $Q$-ball-like saturons as a laboratory for black holes, we study the collision of two such objects and find that vorticity can have a large impact on the emitted radiation as well as on the charge and angular momentum of the final configuration. As black holes belong to the class of saturons, we expect that the formation of vortices can cause similar effects in black hole mergers, leading to macroscopic deviations in gravitational radiation. This could leave unique signatures detectable with upcoming gravitational-wave searches, which can thereby serve as a portal to macroscopic quantum effects in black holes.</description>

Abstract: Strong transient magnetic fields are generated in non-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions. These fields induce anisotropy within the strongly interacting medium that, in principle, can affect the thermodynamic properties of the medium. We use the Polyakov loop extended Nambu Jona-Lasinio model to study the quark matter subjected to an external magnetic field at vanishing baryon chemical potential ($\mu_{B}$). We have estimated the degree of anisotropy in the speed of sound and isothermal compressibility within the magnetized quark matter as a function of temperature ($T$) and magnetic field ($eB$). This study helps us to understand the extent of directionality generated in the initial stages of non-central collisions while giving us useful information about the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the nucleon and the baryon octet, decomposed into their flavor components, utilizing a pion mean-field approach grounded in the large $N_c$ limit of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Our focus is on the contributions from the twist-2 operators to the flavor-triplet and octet GFFs, and we decompose the mass, angular momentum, and $D$-term form factors of the nucleon into their respective flavors. The strange quark contributions are found to be relatively mild for the mass and angular momentum form factors, while providing significant corrections to the $D$-term form factor. In the course of examining the flavor decomposition of the GFFs, we uncover that the effects of twist-4 operators play a crucial role. While the gluonic contributions are suppressed by the packing fraction of the instanton vacuum in the twist-2 case, contributions from twist-4 operators are of order unity, necessitating its explicit consideration.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze (using a chiral effective Lagrangian model) the scalar and pseudoscalar meson mass spectrum of QCD at finite temperature, above the chiral transition at $T_c$, in the realistic case with $N_f = 2 + 1$ light quark flavors (that is, with $m_{u,d} \to 0$ and $m_s \neq 0$), looking, in particular, for signatures of the breaking of the $U(1)$ axial symmetry above $T_c$. A critical comparison with the corresponding results obtained (in a previous study) in the two limit cases $N_f = 2$ and $N_f = 3$ and with the available lattice results is performed, together with a discussion on the limits of validity of a description in terms of a chiral effective Lagrangian model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive calculation of the $K_L\to\gamma^*\gamma^*$ form factor in dispersion theory, using input from the leptonic decays $K_L\to\ell^+\ell^-\gamma$, $K_L\to \ell_1^+\ell_1^-\ell_2^+\ell_2^-$, the hadronic mode $K_L\to \pi^+\pi^-\gamma$, the normalization $K_L\to\gamma\gamma$, and the matching to asymptotic constraints. As key result we obtain an improved determination of the long-distance contribution to $K_L\to\ell^+\ell^-$, leading to the Standard-Model predictions $\text{Br}[K_L\to\mu^+\mu^-]=7.44^{+0.41}_{-0.34}\times 10^{-9}$, $\text{Br}[K_L\to e^+e^-]=8.46(37)\times 10^{-12}$, and more stringent limits on physics beyond the Standard Model. We provide a detailed breakdown of the current uncertainty, and delineate how future experiments and the interplay with lattice QCD could help further improve the precision.</description>

Abstract: I discuss the thermodynamics-based derivation of the formula for the entanglement entropy of a system of gluons. The derivation is based on an approach where saturation and the Unruh effect were used to obtain and discuss the entropy of gluons. The formula agrees, in the high-energy limit, up to a numerical factor, with more recent results, where arguments based on the density matrix and bipartition of the proton were used to obtain the formula. I also discuss the relation of entropy as obtained in BFKL in DLL approximation and with the application of the BK equation.</description>

Abstract: We study the photoproduction process of dileptons in heavy ion collision at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energys. The equivalent photon approximation, which equates the electromagnetic field of high-energy charged particles to the virtual photon flux, is used to calculate the processes of dileptons production. The numerical results demonstrate that the experimental study of dileptons in ultra-peripheral collisions is feasible at RHIC and LHC energies.</description>

Abstract: An important goal of ongoing and future experiments is to explore spectra and transition form factors of baryons with non-zero strangeness. Of particular interest is the transition form factor$\gamma^{(*)} \Sigma^0 \rightarrow \Lambda$ in the time-like momentum region that can be extracted from Dalitz decays. On the road towards a theoretical description of these form factors we extend a covariant dynamical quark-diquark model for the baryon Faddeev equation to the strange-quark sector. Based on an excellent description of the mass spectrum of selected baryon octet and decuplet states and reasonable results for the nucleon form factors we determine the elastic electromagnetic form factors of $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^+, \Sigma^0, \Sigma^-$ hyperons in the space-like region as well as the ones for the octet transition $\gamma^{(*)} \Sigma^0 \rightarrow \Lambda$.
  We discuss qualitative and quantitative features of the diquark-quark picture and compare systematically with previous results from a three-body Faddeev approach and lattice data where available.</description>

      <title>Exploring CP violation in $H \to \tau^+ \tau^- \gamma$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method of measuring the CP-odd part of the Yukawa interaction of Higgs boson and $\tau$ leptons by observing the forward-backward asymmetry in the decay $H \to \tau^+ \, \tau^- \, \gamma$. The source of such asymmetry is the interference of the CP-even loop-level contribution coming from $H \to Z \, \gamma \to \tau^+ \, \tau^- \, \gamma$ decay channel with the contribution from tree-level CP-odd Yukawa interaction. We find that the CP violating effect is maximum when the invariant mass of the $\tau^+ \, \tau^-$ pair is equal to the mass of the $Z$ boson. We propose and utilise various Dalitz plot asymmetries to quantify the maximal size of the asymmetry and perform Monte Carlo simulations to study the feasibility of measuring it in the high luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC).</description>

      <title>Contribution of coherent electron production to measurements of heavy-flavor decayed electrons in heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy quarks, produced at early stages of heavy-ion collisions, are an excellent probe of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) also created in these collisions. Electrons from open heavy-flavor hadron decays (HFE) are good proxies for heavy quarks, and have been measured extensively in the last two decades to study QGP properties. These measurements are traditionally carried out by subtracting all known background sources from the inclusive electron sample. More recently, a significant enhancement of $e^+e^-$ pair production at very low transverse momenta was observed in peripheral heavy-ion collisions. The production characteristics is consistent with coherent photon-photon interactions, which should also constitute a background source to the HFE measurements. In this article, we provide theoretical predictions for the contribution of coherent electron production to HFE as a function of transverse momentum, centrality and collision energy in Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions.</description>

      <title>Masses and Magnetic Moments of Doubly Heavy Tetraquarks via Diffusion Monte Carlo Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present mass spectrum and magnetic moments of the $\bar{n}\bar{n}QQ$ states, where $n=u,d,s$ and $Q=c,b$. We solve four-body Schr\"odinger equation with a quark potential model by using diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method. The quark potential is based on the Coulomb, confinement and spin-spin interaction terms. We find mass and magnetic moment of the $T_{cc}^+$ state as $M_{T_{cc}^+}=3892 ~\text{MeV}$ and $\mu=0.28 \mu_N$, respectively. We also find the mass and magnetic moment of $T_{bb}^-$ as $M_{T_{bb}^-}=10338 ~\text{MeV}$ and $\mu=-0.32 \mu_N$, respectively. We find some bound state candidates of doubly heavy tetraquark systems with $I(J^P)=0(1)^+$ $nn \bar b \bar b$, $I(J^P)=0(0)^+$ $nn \bar c \bar b$, $I(J^P)=0(1)^+$ $nn \bar c \bar b$, and $I(J^P)=1/2(1)^+$ $ns \bar b \bar b$. We compare our results with other approaches in the literature.</description>

      <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Small-$x$ Evolution: Exact Results in the Large-$N_c$ Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an exact solution to the revised small-$x$ orbital angular momentum (OAM) evolution equations derived recently, based on an earlier work. These equations are derived in the double logarithmic approximation (summing powers of $\alpha_s \ln^2(1/x)$ with $\alpha_s$ the strong coupling constant and $x$ the Bjorken $x$ variable) and the large-$N_c$ limit, with $N_c$ the number of quark colors. From our solution, we extract the small-$x$, large-$N_c$ expressions of the quark and gluon OAM distributions. Additionally, we determine the large-$N_c$ small-$x$ asymptotics of the OAM distributions to be
  \begin{align}
  \notag
  L_{q+\bar{q}}(x,Q^2) \sim L_G(x,Q^2) \sim \Delta \Sigma (x,Q^2) \sim \Delta G(x,Q^2) \sim \left(\frac{1}{x} \right)^{\alpha_h},
  \end{align}
with the intercept $\alpha_h$ the same as obtained in the small-$x$ helicity evolution, which can be approximated as $\alpha_h \approx 3.66074 \sqrt{\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{2\pi}}$. This result is in complete agreement with the literature. Additionally, we calculate the ratio of the quark and gluon OAM distributions to the flavor-singlet quark and gluon helicity parton distribution functions respectively in the small-$x$ region.</description>

      <title>Direct production of SM-singlet scalars at the muon collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work proposes a minimal extension of the Standard Model~(SM) where a gauge-singlet scalar~($\phi$) can be directly produced at the muon colliders without relying on its mixing with any other doublet state present in the theory. The New Physics~(NP) interactions include a TeV-scale scalar leptoquark of electromagnetic charge 1/3 arising naturally in a grand unifying gauge formulation. Within the proposed framework, the SM-singlet scalar can effectively couple to various SM fields at the one-loop level, out of which the $\bar{\mu}\mu\phi$ and $\gamma\gamma\phi$ couplings are crucial to produce it at the future muon colliders. Assuming $\mathcal{O}(1)$ NP couplings, the decay widths and production cross-section of the singlet scalar have been discussed in detail over the considered parameter space. Depending on the resonance scale, di-lepton and/or di-gluon channels can be significant to test/falsify the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility that threshold photoproduction of $\eta_{c,b}$ may be sensitive to the pseudovector $1^{+-}$ glueball exchange. We use the holographic construction to identify the pseudovector glueball with the Kalb-Ramond field, minimally coupled to bulk Dirac fermions. We derive the holographic C-odd form factor and its respective charge radius. Using the pertinent Witten diagrams, we derive and analyze the differential photoproduction cross section for $\eta_{c,b}$ in the threshold regime, including the interference from the dual bulk photon exchange with manifest vector dominance. The possibility of measuring this process at current and future electron facilities is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the vector and the pseudovector glueball in the top-down holographic model of large-$N_c$ QCD of Witten and their decays into ordinary mesons described by the D8 brane construction due to Sakai and Sugimoto. At leading order, the relevant interactions are determined exclusively by the Chern-Simons action of the D8 branes and are thus rigidly connected to the chiral anomaly and the Wess-Zumino-Witten terms. As found in a previous study of the pseudovector glueball, which we revisit and complete, the resulting decay widths are surprisingly large, implying that both the pseudovector and the vector glueball are very broad resonances, with a conspicuous dominance of decays into $a_1\rho$ and $K_1(1400) K^*$ in the case of the vector glueball. We also obtain a certain weak mixing of vector glueballs with ordinary vector mesons, but we conclude that it does not provide an explanation for the so-called $\rho\pi$ puzzle in charmonium decays.</description>

Abstract: We propose the stringy description of the system consisting of two heavy and four light quarks in the case of two light flavors of equal mass. As an application, we consider the three low-lying Born-Oppenheimer potentials as a function of the heavy quark separation. Our analysis shows that the ground state potential is described in terms of both hadro-quarkonia and hadronic molecules. A connected string configuration makes the dominant contribution to the potential of an excited state at small separations, and for separations larger than $0.1\,\text{fm}$, it exhibits the diquark-diquark-diquark structure $[Qq][Qq][qq]$. For better understanding the quark organization inside the system, we introduce several critical separations related to the processes of string reconnection, breaking and junction annihilation. We also discuss the simplest string configurations including the five-string junctions and their implications for the system, in particular the emergence of composite quark objects different from diquarks and the process of junction fusion.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter semi-annihilation is a process through which two dark matter candidates annihilate to a single dark matter particle and a non-dark matter particle. Such processes are common when the symmetry stabilizing the dark matter differs from $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and can lead to qualitatively different phenomenology. In this work, we study the viability of semi-annihilation models including one or two inert multiplets. For one multiplet, we show that there does not exist any viable model in which semi-annihilation is efficient. For two multiplets, semi-annihilation can be efficient, but the number of viable and technically natural models is limited. We then perform a detailed study of the most promising model, showing that the correct relic abundance can be obtained for a wide range of masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent report of $e^+ e^- \to D\bar D$ events by the BESIII Collaboration suggests the presence of a structure $R$ at 3900~MeV\@. We argue that this structure, called $G(3900)$ in the past, is not in fact due to a new $c\bar c$ resonance, but rather naturally emerges as a threshold enhancement due to the opening of the $D^*\bar D$ channel. We further find that the appearance of this structure does not require suppression because of a radial node in the $\psi(4040)$ wave function, although a node improves fit quality. The measured $e^+ e^-$ coupling of $\psi(4040)$ is found to be substantially smaller than previously estimated. In addition, we report new corrections to the measured cross section $\sigma(e^+ e^- \to D\bar D)$ at energies near $\psi(3770)$.</description>

      <title>On the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Debye shielding cannot be employed to constrain the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles, contrary to what is stated in the previous literature. Current model-independent bounds on the monopole abundance are then revisited for unit Dirac magnetic charge. We find that the Andromeda Parker bound can be employed to set an upper limit on the monopole flux at the level of $F_M\lesssim 5.3\times 10^{-19}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}\text{sr}^{-1}$ for a monopole mass $10^{13}\,\text{GeV}/c^2\lesssim m\lesssim 10^{16}\,\text{GeV}/c^2$, which is more stringent than the MACRO direct search limit by two orders of magnitude. This translates into stringent constraints on the monopole density parameter $\Omega_M$ at the level of $10^{-7}-10^{-4}$ depending on the mass. For larger monopole masses the scenarios in which magnetic monopoles account for all or the majority of dark matter are disfavored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purely gravitational evidence supporting the need for dark matter (DM) particles is compelling and based on Galactic to cosmological scale observations. Thus far, the promising weakly interacting massive particles scenarios have eluded detection, motivating alternative models for DM. We consider the scenarios involving the superheavy dark matter (SHDM) that potentially can be emitted by primordial black holes (PBHs) and can decay or annihilate into ultrahigh-energy (UHE) neutrinos and photons. The observation of a population of photons with energies $E\ge 10^{11}$ GeV would imply the existence of completely new physical phenomena, or shed some light on DM models. Only the ultra-high energy cosmic ray observatories have the capabilities to detect such UHE decay products via the measurements of UHE photon induced extensive air showers. Using the upper bound on the flux of UHE cosmic rays beyond $10^{11.3}$ GeV implying $J(&gt;10^{11.3}~{\rm{GeV}})&lt; 3.6\times 10^{-5}$ km$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$y$^{-1}$, at the $90\%$ C.L. reported by the Pierre Auger Observatory, we obtain global limits on the lifetime of the DM particles with masses $10^{15}\le M_{X} \le 10^{17}$ GeV. The constraints derived here are new and cover a region of the parameter space not yet explored. We compare our results with the projected constraints from future POEMMA and JEM-EUSO experiments, in order to quantify the improvement that will be obtained by these missions.
  Moreover, assuming that an epoch of early PBHs domination introduces a unique spectral break, $f_{\ast}$, in the gravitational wave spectrum, the frequency of which is related to the SHDM mass, we map potential probes and limits of the DM particles masses on the $f_{\ast}-M_{X}$ parameter space.</description>

      <title>Efficient solver of relativistic hydrodynamics with implicit Runge-Kutta method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to solve the relativistic hydrodynamic equations based on implicit Runge-Kutta methods with a locally optimized fixed-point iterative solver. For numerical demonstration, we implement our idea for ideal hydrodynamics using the one-stage Gauss-Legendre method as an implicit method. The accuracy and computational cost of our new method are compared with those of explicit ones for the (1+1)-dimensional Riemann problem, as well as the (2+1)-dimensional Gubser flow and event-by-event initial conditions for heavy-ion collisions generated by TrENTo. We demonstrate that the solver converges with only one iteration in most cases, and as a result, the implicit method requires a smaller computational cost than the explicit one at the same accuracy in these cases, while it may not converge with an unrealistically large $\Delta t$. By showing a relationship between the one-stage Gauss-Legendre method with the iterative solver and the two-step Adams-Bashforth method, we argue that our method benefits from both the stability of the former and the efficiency of the latter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that it is generally nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian states (NSLG) rather than the Landau ones that appropriately describe electrons with orbital angular momentum both in their dynamics at a hard-edge boundary between a solenoid and vacuum and inside the magnetic field. It is shown that the r.m.s. radius of the NSLG state oscillates in time and its period-averaged value can significantly exceed the r.m.s. radius of the Landau state, even far from the boundary. We propose to study the unconventional features of quantum dynamics inside a solenoid in several experimental scenarios with vortex electrons described by the NSLG states. Relevance for processes in scanning and transmission electron microscopes, as well as for particle accelerators with relativistic beams is emphasized.</description>

      <title>Do Neutrinos Become Flavor Unstable Due to Collisions with Matter in the Supernova Decoupling Region?</title>

Abstract: In core-collapse supernovae, the neutrino density is so large that neutrino flavor instabilities, leading to flavor conversion, can be triggered by the forward scattering of neutrinos among each other, if a crossing between the angular distributions of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos exists (fast instability in the limit of vanishing vacuum frequency) or in the presence of perturbations induced by the neutrino vacuum frequency (slow instability). Recently, it has been advanced the conjecture that neutrino collisions with the medium could be another mean to kickstart flavor change (collisional instability). Inspired by a spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova model with mass $18.6\ M_\odot$, we compute the neutrino angular distributions solving the kinetic equations for an average energy mode and investigate the occurrence of flavor instabilities at different post-bounce times, ranging from the accretion phase to the early cooling phase. We find that fast and slow flavor instabilities largely dominate over the collisional ones in the decoupling region for all post-bounce times. While more work is needed to assess the relevance of collisional instabilities in neutrino-dense environments, our findings suggest that neutrino collisions with matter affect the flavor evolution in the decoupling region, but are not responsible for triggering flavor conversion, if crossings in the neutrino lepton number angular distribution exist.</description>

      <title>Optimal Inflationary Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inflation is a highly favoured theory for the early Universe. It is compatible with current observations of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure and is a driver in the quest to detect primordial gravitational waves. It is also, given the current quality of the data, highly under-determined with a large number of candidate implementations. We use a new method in symbolic regression to generate all possible simple scalar field potentials for one of two possible basis sets of operators. Treating these as single-field, slow-roll inflationary models we then score them with an information-theoretic metric ("minimum description length") that quantifies their efficiency in compressing the information in current data. We explore two possible priors on the parameter space of potentials, one related to the functions' structural complexity and one that uses a Katz back-off language model to prefer functions that may be theoretically motivated. This enables us to identify the inflaton potentials that optimally balance simplicity with accuracy at explaining current data, which may subsequently find theoretical motivation. Our exploratory study opens the door to extraction of fundamental physics directly from data, and may be augmented with more refined theoretical priors in the quest for a complete understanding of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Relaxing cosmological constraints on current neutrino masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a mass-varying neutrino model driven by scalar field dark energy relaxes the existing upper bound on the current neutrino mass to ${\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.72}$ eV. We extend the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model by introducing two parameters: the rate of change of the scalar field with the number of $e$-folds and the coupling between neutrinos and the field. We investigate how they affect the matter power spectrum, the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and its lensing potential. The model is tested against Planck observations of temperature, polarization, and lensing, combined with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements that constrain the background evolution. The results indicate that small couplings favor a cosmological constant, while larger couplings favor a dynamical dark energy, weakening the upper bound on current neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>Can we distinguish black holes with electric and magnetic charges from quasinormal modes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the quasinormal modes of static and spherically symmetric black holes (BHs) with electric and magnetic charges. For the electrically charged case, the dynamics of perturbations separates into the odd- and even-parity sectors with two coupled differential equations in each sector. In the presence of both electric and magnetic charges, the differential equations of four dynamical degrees of freedom are coupled with each other between odd- and even-parity perturbations. Despite this notable modification, we show that, for a given total charge and mass, a BH with mixed electric and magnetic charges gives rise to the same quasinormal frequencies for fundamental modes. This includes the case in which two BHs have equal electric and magnetic charges for each of them. Thus, the gravitational-wave observations of quasinormal modes during the ringdown phase alone do not distinguish between electrically and magnetically charged BHs.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Collins-Soper Kernel from Chiral Quarks with Physical Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the rapidity anomalous dimension of quark transverse-momentum-dependent distributions, i.e., the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel, up to transverse separations of about 1 fm. This unitary lattice calculation is conducted, for the first time, employing the chiral-symmetry-preserving domain wall fermion discretization and physical values of light and strange quark masses. The CS kernel is extracted from the ratios of pion quasi-transverse-momentum-dependent wave functions (quasi-TMDWFs) at next-to-leading logarithmic perturbative accuracy. Also for the first time, we utilize the recently proposed Coulomb-gauge-fixed quasi-TMDWF correlator without a Wilson line. We observe significantly slower signal decay with increasing quark separations compared to the established gauge-invariant method with a staple-shaped Wilson line. This enables us to determine the CS kernel at large nonperturbative transverse separations and find its near-linear dependence on the latter. Our result is consistent with the recent lattice calculation using gauge-invariant quasi-TMDWFs, and agrees with various recent phenomenological parametrizations of experimental data.</description>

      <title>Understanding gravitationally induced decoherence parameters in neutrino oscillations using a microscopic quantum mechanical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, a microscopic quantum mechanical model for gravitationally induced decoherence introduced by Blencowe and Xu is investigated in the context of neutrino oscillations. The focus is on the comparison with existing phenomenological models and the physical interpretation of the decoherence parameters in such models. The results show that for neutrino oscillations in vacuum gravitationally induced decoherence can be matched with phenomenological models with decoherence parameters of the form $\Gamma_{ij}\sim \Delta m^4_{ij}E^{-2}$. When matter effects are included, the decoherence parameters show a dependence on matter effects, which vary in the different layers of the Earth, that can be explained with the form of the coupling between neutrinos and the gravitational wave environment inspired by linearised gravity. Consequently, in the case of neutrino oscillations in matter, the microscopic model does not agree with many existing phenomenological models that assume constant decoherence parameters in matter, and their existing bounds cannot be used to further constrain the model considered here. The probabilities for neutrino oscillations with constant and varying decoherence parameters are compared and it is shown that the deviations can be up to 10%. On a theoretical level, these different models can be characterised by a different choice of Lindblad operators, with the model with decoherence parameters that do not include matter effects being less suitable from the point of view of linearised gravity.</description>

Abstract: We present a superfluid dark star model consisting of relativistic dark bosons with two-body self-interaction. The obtained masses, radii, and tidal deformability depend in a simple way on the boson mass and interaction strength. We report first results on binary mergers: the distinctive amplitude and frequency of the emitted gravitational waves are well within reach of terrestrial interferometers.</description>

      <title>Muon Ring and FCC-ee / CEPC Based Antimuon-Electron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the construction of an antimuon-electron collider, {\mu}TRISTAN, at KEK has been proposed. We argue that the construction of a similar muon ring tangential to FCC-ee and CEPC will give an opportunity to realize antimuon-electron collisions at higher center-of-mass energies. Moreover, the same ring may be used later to realize energy-frontier antimuon-proton colliders based on FCC-pp and SppC. Similarly, changing of electron ring in {\mu}TRISTAN project into proton ring will give opportunity to investigate lepton-hadron collisions at ~2 TeV center-of-mass energies. In this paper the main parameters of proposed colliders have been studied. It is shown that sufficiently high luminosities can be achieved for all proposals under consideration.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Curvature Perturbation and Primordial Black Hole Formation in Two-stage Inflation with a break</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a model of $R^2$-gravity with a non-minimally coupled scalar field that gives rise to two-stage inflation with a break, that is, with an intermediate stage where inflation momentarily halts. We find that the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation is significantly enhanced at the break scale, which can account for the primordial black hole (PBH) formation, without affecting the CMB constraint on large scales. The behavior of the curvature perturbation is carefully analyzed and we find a few notable new features in the spectrum. In particular, we find that the $k^3$ growth of the spectrum of toward the end of the first stage of inflation. We argue that this is a universal feature common to all two-stage models where the field dominating the second stage is heavy during the first stage. By appropriately tuning the model parameters, we find that our model can realize the scenario of PBHs as the cold dark matter of the Universe. We also find that we can choose the parameters so that the spectrum of the induced gravitational waves from the enhanced curvature perturbation fits the NANOGrav-15yr data of pulsar timing array observation.</description>

      <title>Revised bounds on local cosmic strings from NANOGrav observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, the NANOGrav collaboration studied new physics explanations of the observed pulsar timing residuals consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), including cosmic strings in the Nambu-Goto (NG) approximation. Analysing one of current models for the loop distribution, it was found that the cosmic string model is disfavored compared to other sources, for example, super massive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). When both SMBHB and cosmic string models are included in the analysis, an upper bound on a string tension $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-10}$ was derived. However, the analysis did not accommodate results from cosmic string simulations in an underlying field theory, which indicate that at most a small fraction of string loops survive long enough to emit GW. Following and extending our previous study, we suppose that a fraction $f_{\rm NG}$ of string loops follow NG dynamics and emit only GWs, and study the three different models of the loop distribution discussed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration analyses. We re-analyze the NANOGrav 15yrs data with our signal models by using the NANOGrav $\texttt{ENTERPRISE}$ analysis code via the wrapper $\texttt{PTArcade}$. We find that loop distributions similar to LVK Model B and C yield higher Bayes factor than Model A analyzed in the NANOGrav paper, as they can more easily accommodate a blue-tilted spectrum of the observed amplitude. Furthermore, because of the degeneracy of $G\mu$ and $f_{\rm NG}$ in determining the signal amplitude, our posterior distribution extends to higher values of $G\mu$, and in some cases the uppermost value of credible intervals is close to the Cosmic Microwave Background limit $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-7}$. Hence, in addition to the pulsar timing array data, further information about the fraction of long-lived loops in a cosmic string network is required to constrain the string tension.</description>

      <title>Falsifying Anthropics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using fuzzy axion dark matter to test the anthropic principle. A very light axion can be directly detectable, at least by black hole superradiance effects. The idea then is that gravitational and astrophysical observations can discover a light axion in the regime where it must be all of dark matter with abundance which must be set up by the anthropic principle, due to excessive primordial misalignment induced by inflation. Yet it may turn out that dark matter is something else instead of this axion. Since axion misalignment must be induced by Brownian drift in (quasi)de Sitter space, this could invalidate the anthropic prediction of the dark matter abundance.</description>
