      <title>Symbolic and User-friendly Geometric Algebra Routines (SUGAR) for Computations in Matlab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric algebra (GA) is a mathematical tool for geometric computing, providing a framework that allows a unified and compact approach to geometric relations which in other mathematical systems are typically described using different more complicated elements. This fact has led to an increasing adoption of GA in applied mathematics and engineering problems. However, the scarcity of symbolic implementations of GA and its inherent complexity, requiring a specific mathematical background, make it challenging and less intuitive for engineers to work with. This prevents wider adoption among more applied professionals. To address this challenge, this paper introduces SUGAR (Symbolic and User-friendly Geometric Algebra Routines), an open-source toolbox designed for Matlab and licensed under the MIT License. SUGAR facilitates the translation of GA concepts into Matlab and provides a collection of user-friendly functions tailored for GA computations, including support for symbolic operations. It supports both numeric and symbolic computations in high-dimensional GAs. Specifically tailored for applied mathematics and engineering applications, SUGAR has been meticulously engineered to represent geometric elements and transformations within two and three-dimensional projective and conformal geometric algebras, aligning with established computational methodologies in the literature. Furthermore, SUGAR efficiently handles functions of multivectors, such as exponential, logarithmic, sinusoidal, and cosine functions, enhancing its applicability across various engineering domains, including robotics, control systems, and power electronics. Finally, this work includes four distinct validation examples, demonstrating SUGAR's capabilities across the above-mentioned fields and its practical utility in addressing real-world applied mathematics and engineering problems.</description>

      <title>GeoFlood: Computational model for overland flooding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents GeoFlood, a new open-source software package for solving shallow water equations (SWE) on a quadtree hierarchy of mapped, logically Cartesian grids managed by the parallel, adaptive library ForestClaw (Calhoun and Burstedde, 2017). The GeoFlood model is validated using standard benchmark tests from Neelz and Pender (2013) and against George (2011) results obtained from the GeoClaw software (Clawpack Development Team, 2020) for the historical Malpasset dam failure problem. The benchmark test results are compared against GeoClaw and software package HEC-RAS (Hydraulic Engineering Center - River Analysis System, Army Corp of Engineers) results (Brunner, 2018). This comparison demonstrates the capability of GeoFlood to accurately and efficiently predict flood wave propagation on complex terrain. The results from comparisons with the Malpasset dam break show good agreement with the GeoClaw results and are consistent with the historical records of the event.</description>

      <title>FlowFPX: Nimble Tools for Debugging Floating-Point Exceptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable numerical computations are central to scientific computing, but the floating-point arithmetic that enables large-scale models is error-prone. Numeric exceptions are a common occurrence and can propagate through code, leading to flawed results. This paper presents FlowFPX, a toolkit for systematically debugging floating-point exceptions by recording their flow, coalescing exception contexts, and fuzzing in select locations. These tools help scientists discover when exceptions happen and track down their origin, smoothing the way to a reliable codebase.</description>
