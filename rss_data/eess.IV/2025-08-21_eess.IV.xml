      <title>Pixels Under Pressure: Exploring Fine-Tuning Paradigms for Foundation Models in High-Resolution Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in diffusion-based foundation models have improved text-to-image generation, yet most efforts have been limited to low-resolution settings. As high-resolution image synthesis becomes increasingly essential for various applications, particularly in medical imaging domains, fine-tuning emerges as a crucial mechanism for adapting these powerful pre-trained models to task-specific requirements and data distributions. In this work, we present a systematic study, examining the impact of various fine-tuning techniques on image generation quality when scaling to high resolution 512x512 pixels. We benchmark a diverse set of fine-tuning methods, including full fine-tuning strategies and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We dissect how different fine-tuning methods influence key quality metrics, including Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), Vendi score, and prompt-image alignment. We also evaluate the utility of generated images in a downstream classification task under data-scarce conditions, demonstrating that specific fine-tuning strategies improve both generation fidelity and downstream performance when synthetic images are used for classifier training and evaluation on real images. Our code is accessible through the project website - https://tehraninasab.github.io/PixelUPressure/.</description>

      <title>TOM: An Open-Source Tongue Segmentation Method with Multi-Teacher Distillation and Task-Specific Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tongue imaging serves as a valuable diagnostic tool, particularly in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The quality of tongue surface segmentation significantly affects the accuracy of tongue image classification and subsequent diagnosis in intelligent tongue diagnosis systems. However, existing research on tongue image segmentation faces notable limitations, and there is a lack of robust and user-friendly segmentation tools. This paper proposes a tongue image segmentation model (TOM) based on multi-teacher knowledge distillation. By incorporating a novel diffusion-based data augmentation method, we enhanced the generalization ability of the segmentation model while reducing its parameter size. Notably, after reducing the parameter count by 96.6% compared to the teacher models, the student model still achieves an impressive segmentation performance of 95.22% mIoU. Furthermore, we packaged and deployed the trained model as both an online and offline segmentation tool (available at https://itongue.cn/), allowing TCM practitioners and researchers to use it without any programming experience. We also present a case study on TCM constitution classification using segmented tongue patches. Experimental results demonstrate that training with tongue patches yields higher classification performance and better interpretability than original tongue images. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source and freely available tongue image segmentation tool.</description>

      <title>Potential and challenges of generative adversarial networks for super-resolution in 4D Flow MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (4D Flow MRI) enables non-invasive quantification of blood flow and hemodynamic parameters. However, its clinical application is limited by low spatial resolution and noise, particularly affecting near-wall velocity measurements. Machine learning-based super-resolution has shown promise in addressing these limitations, but challenges remain, not least in recovering near-wall velocities. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) offer a compelling solution, having demonstrated strong capabilities in restoring sharp boundaries in non-medical super-resolution tasks. Yet, their application in 4D Flow MRI remains unexplored, with implementation challenged by known issues such as training instability and non-convergence. In this study, we investigate GAN-based super-resolution in 4D Flow MRI. Training and validation were conducted using patient-specific cerebrovascular in-silico models, converted into synthetic images via an MR-true reconstruction pipeline. A dedicated GAN architecture was implemented and evaluated across three adversarial loss functions: Vanilla, Relativistic, and Wasserstein. Our results demonstrate that the proposed GAN improved near-wall velocity recovery compared to a non-adversarial reference (vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 9.6%); however, that implementation specifics are critical for stable network training. While Vanilla and Relativistic GANs proved unstable compared to generator-only training (vNRMSE: 8.1% and 7.8% vs. 7.2%), a Wasserstein GAN demonstrated optimal stability and incremental improvement (vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 7.2%). The Wasserstein GAN further outperformed the generator-only baseline at low SNR (vNRMSE: 8.7% vs. 10.7%). These findings highlight the potential of GAN-based super-resolution in enhancing 4D Flow MRI, particularly in challenging cerebrovascular regions, while emphasizing the need for careful selection of adversarial strategies.</description>

      <title>CUTE-MRI: Conformalized Uncertainty-based framework for Time-adaptivE MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers unparalleled soft-tissue contrast but is fundamentally limited by long acquisition times. While deep learning-based accelerated MRI can dramatically shorten scan times, the reconstruction from undersampled data introduces ambiguity resulting from an ill-posed problem with infinitely many possible solutions that propagates to downstream clinical tasks. This uncertainty is usually ignored during the acquisition process as acceleration factors are often fixed a priori, resulting in scans that are either unnecessarily long or of insufficient quality for a given clinical endpoint. This work introduces a dynamic, uncertainty-aware acquisition framework that adjusts scan time on a per-subject basis. Our method leverages a probabilistic reconstruction model to estimate image uncertainty, which is then propagated through a full analysis pipeline to a quantitative metric of interest (e.g., patellar cartilage volume or cardiac ejection fraction). We use conformal prediction to transform this uncertainty into a rigorous, calibrated confidence interval for the metric. During acquisition, the system iteratively samples k-space, updates the reconstruction, and evaluates the confidence interval. The scan terminates automatically once the uncertainty meets a user-predefined precision target. We validate our framework on both knee and cardiac MRI datasets. Our results demonstrate that this adaptive approach reduces scan times compared to fixed protocols while providing formal statistical guarantees on the precision of the final image. This framework moves beyond fixed acceleration factors, enabling patient-specific acquisitions that balance scan efficiency with diagnostic confidence, a critical step towards personalized and resource-efficient MRI.</description>

      <title>Scalable Event-Based Video Streaming for Machines with MoQ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lossy compression and rate-adaptive streaming are a mainstay in traditional video steams. However, a new class of neuromorphic ``event'' sensors records video with asynchronous pixel samples rather than image frames. These sensors are designed for computer vision applications, rather than human video consumption. Until now, researchers have focused their efforts primarily on application development, ignoring the crucial problem of data transmission. We survey the landscape of event-based video systems, discuss the technical issues with our recent scalable event streaming work, and propose a new low-latency event streaming format based on the latest additions to the Media Over QUIC protocol draft.</description>

      <title>Systematic Evaluation of Wavelet-Based Denoising for MRI Brain Images: Optimal Configurations and Performance Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical imaging modalities including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound are essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning in modern healthcare. However, noise contamination during image acquisition and processing frequently degrades image quality, obscuring critical diagnostic details and compromising clinical decision-making. Additionally, enhancement techniques such as histogram equalization may inadvertently amplify existing noise artifacts, including salt-and-pepper distortions. This study investigates wavelet transform-based denoising methods for effective noise mitigation in medical images, with the primary objective of identifying optimal combinations of threshold values, decomposition levels, and wavelet types to achieve superior denoising performance and enhanced diagnostic accuracy. Through systematic evaluation across various noise conditions, the research demonstrates that the bior6.8 biorthogonal wavelet with universal thresholding at decomposition levels 2-3 consistently achieves optimal denoising performance, providing significant noise reduction while preserving essential anatomical structures and diagnostic features critical for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>SPIRiT Regularization: Parallel MRI with a Combination of Sensitivity Encoding and Linear Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) permits high quality images from fewer samples that can be collected with a faster scan. Two established methods for accelerating MRI include parallel imaging and compressed sensing. Two types of parallel imaging include linear predictability, which assumes that the Fourier samples are linearly related, and sensitivity encoding, which incorporates a priori knowledge of the sensitivity maps. In this work, we combine compressed sensing with both types of parallel imaging using a novel regularization term: SPIRiT regularization. When combined, the reconstructed images are improved. We demonstrate results on data of a brain, a knee, and an ankle.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot Volumetric CT Super-Resolution using 3D Gaussian Splatting with Upsampled 2D X-ray Projection Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in clinical diagnosis, but acquiring high-resolution (HR) CT is limited by radiation exposure risks. Deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been studied to reconstruct HR from low-resolution (LR) inputs. While supervised SR approaches have shown promising results, they require large-scale paired LR-HR volume datasets that are often unavailable. In contrast, zero-shot methods alleviate the need for paired data by using only a single LR input, but typically struggle to recover fine anatomical details due to limited internal information. To overcome these, we propose a novel zero-shot 3D CT SR framework that leverages upsampled 2D X-ray projection priors generated by a diffusion model. Exploiting the abundance of HR 2D X-ray data, we train a diffusion model on large-scale 2D X-ray projection and introduce a per-projection adaptive sampling strategy. It selects the generative process for each projection, thus providing HR projections as strong external priors for 3D CT reconstruction. These projections serve as inputs to 3D Gaussian splatting for reconstructing a 3D CT volume. Furthermore, we propose negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) that allows negative values in Gaussian density representation. NAB-GS enables residual learning between LR and diffusion-based projections, thereby enhancing high-frequency structure reconstruction. Experiments on two datasets show that our method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results for 3D CT SR.</description>

      <title>Pathology-Informed Latent Diffusion Model for Anomaly Detection in Lymph Node Metastasis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection is an emerging approach in digital pathology for its ability to efficiently and effectively utilize data for disease diagnosis. While supervised learning approaches deliver high accuracy, they rely on extensively annotated datasets, suffering from data scarcity in digital pathology. Unsupervised anomaly detection, however, offers a viable alternative by identifying deviations from normal tissue distributions without requiring exhaustive annotations. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have gained popularity in unsupervised anomaly detection, achieving promising performance in both natural and medical imaging datasets. Building on this, we incorporate a vision-language model with a diffusion model for unsupervised anomaly detection in digital pathology, utilizing histopathology prompts during reconstruction. Our approach employs a set of pathology-related keywords associated with normal tissues to guide the reconstruction process, facilitating the differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a gastric lymph node dataset from a local hospital and assess its generalization ability under domain shift using a public breast lymph node dataset. The experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method for unsupervised anomaly detection across various organs in digital pathology.

      <title>Explainable Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study comprehensively explores knowledge distillation frameworks for COVID-19 and lung cancer classification using chest X-ray (CXR) images. We employ high-capacity teacher models, including VGG19 and lightweight Vision Transformers (Visformer-S and AutoFormer-V2-T), to guide the training of a compact, hardware-aware student model derived from the OFA-595 supernet. Our approach leverages hybrid supervision, combining ground-truth labels with teacher models' soft targets to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. We validate our models on two benchmark datasets: COVID-QU-Ex and LCS25000, covering multiple classes, including COVID-19, healthy, non-COVID pneumonia, lung, and colon cancer. To interpret the spatial focus of the models, we employ Score-CAM-based visualizations, which provide insight into the reasoning process of both teacher and student networks. The results demonstrate that the distilled student model maintains high classification performance with significantly reduced parameters and inference time, making it an optimal choice in resource-constrained clinical environments. Our work underscores the importance of combining model efficiency with explainability for practical, trustworthy medical AI solutions.</description>

      <title>Bladder Cancer Diagnosis with Deep Learning: A Multi-Task Framework and Online Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical cystoscopy, the current standard for bladder cancer diagnosis, suffers from significant reliance on physician expertise, leading to variability and subjectivity in diagnostic outcomes. There is an urgent need for objective, accurate, and efficient computational approaches to improve bladder cancer diagnostics.
  Leveraging recent advancements in deep learning, this study proposes an integrated multi-task deep learning framework specifically designed for bladder cancer diagnosis from cystoscopic images. Our framework includes a robust classification model using EfficientNet-B0 enhanced with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), an advanced segmentation model based on ResNet34-UNet++ architecture with self-attention mechanisms and attention gating, and molecular subtyping using ConvNeXt-Tiny to classify molecular markers such as HER-2 and Ki-67. Additionally, we introduce a Gradio-based online diagnostic platform integrating all developed models, providing intuitive features including multi-format image uploads, bilingual interfaces, and dynamic threshold adjustments.
  Extensive experimentation demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods, achieving outstanding accuracy (93.28%), F1-score (82.05%), and AUC (96.41%) for classification tasks, and exceptional segmentation performance indicated by a Dice coefficient of 0.9091. The online platform significantly improved the accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility of clinical bladder cancer diagnostics, enabling practical and user-friendly deployment. The code is publicly available.
  Our multi-task framework and integrated online tool collectively advance the field of intelligent bladder cancer diagnosis by improving clinical reliability, supporting early tumor detection, and enabling real-time diagnostic feedback. These contributions mark a significant step toward AI-assisted decision-making in urology.</description>

      <title>DoSReMC: Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification using Batch Normalization Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous deep learning-based solutions have been developed for the automatic recognition of breast cancer using mammography images. However, their performance often declines when applied to data from different domains, primarily due to domain shift - the variation in data distributions between source and target domains. This performance drop limits the safe and equitable deployment of AI in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we present DoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batch normalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domain generalization without retraining the entire model. Using three large-scale full-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets - including HCTP, a newly introduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset - we conduct a systematic cross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our results demonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domain dependence: they perform effectively when training and testing occur within the same domain, and they significantly impair model generalization under domain shift. DoSReMC addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully connected (FC) layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. We further integrate this targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme, yielding additional improvements in cross-domain generalizability. DoSReMC can be readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines and applied across diverse clinical environments, providing a practical pathway toward more robust and generalizable mammography classification systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Equilibrium Convolutional Sparse Coding for Hyperspectral Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) play a crucial role in remote sensing but are often degraded by complex noise patterns. Ensuring the physical property of the denoised HSIs is vital for robust HSI denoising, giving the rise of deep unfolding-based methods. However, these methods map the optimization of a physical model to a learnable network with a predefined depth, which lacks convergence guarantees. In contrast, Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models treat the hidden layers of deep networks as the solution to a fixed-point problem and models them as infinite-depth networks, naturally consistent with the optimization. Under the framework of DEQ, we propose a Deep Equilibrium Convolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework that unifies local spatial-spectral correlations, nonlocal spatial self-similarities, and global spatial consistency for robust HSI denoising. Within the convolutional sparse coding (CSC) framework, we enforce shared 2D convolutional sparse representation to ensure global spatial consistency across bands, while unshared 3D convolutional sparse representation captures local spatial-spectral details. To further exploit nonlocal self-similarities, a transformer block is embedded after the 2D CSC. Additionally, a detail enhancement module is integrated with the 3D CSC to promote image detail preservation. We formulate the proximal gradient descent of the CSC model as a fixed-point problem and transform the iterative updates into a learnable network architecture within the framework of DEQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our DECSC method achieves superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Are Virtual DES Images a Valid Alternative to the Real Ones?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an imaging modality that provides two types of images, commonly known as low-energy (LE) and dual-energy subtracted (DES) images. In many domains, particularly in medicine, the emergence of image-to-image translation techniques has enabled the artificial generation of images using other images as input. Within CESM, applying such techniques to generate DES images from LE images could be highly beneficial, potentially reducing patient exposure to radiation associated with high-energy image acquisition. In this study, we investigated three models for the artificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a U-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a series of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the classification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant categories. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of virtual DES images on CESM lesion classification. The results demonstrate that the best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an F1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with the real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional diagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential for virtual DES image generation is considerable and future advancements may narrow this performance gap to a level where exclusive reliance on virtual DES images becomes clinically viable.</description>

      <title>Label Uncertainty for Ultrasound Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In medical imaging, inter-observer variability among radiologists often introduces label uncertainty, particularly in modalities where visual interpretation is subjective. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it frequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly discernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for experienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both labeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence values. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a data annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in each labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in real-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence values during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More importantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into better performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically, estimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and predicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many methods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a simple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%) confidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better than a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very confident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates the impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only segmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results suggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly leveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI in medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Hessian-based lightweight neural network for brain vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of blood vessels in brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is essential for successful surgical procedures, such as aneurysm repair or bypass surgery. Currently, annotation is primarily performed through manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter, which often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful tools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on well-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight neural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex structures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is a Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on the CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural networks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset reaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually annotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset (annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the supervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides high accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the most complex important cases. The dataset is available at https://git.scinalytics.com/terilat/VesselDatasetPartly.</description>

      <title>Scalable FPGA Framework for Real-Time Denoising in High-Throughput Imaging: A DRAM-Optimized Pipeline using High-Level Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-throughput imaging workflows, such as Parallel Rapid Imaging with Spectroscopic Mapping (PRISM), generate data at rates that exceed conventional real-time processing capabilities. We present a scalable FPGA-based preprocessing pipeline for real-time denoising, implemented via High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and optimized for DRAM-backed buffering. Our architecture performs frame subtraction and averaging directly on streamed image data, minimizing latency through burst-mode AXI4 interfaces. The resulting kernel operates below the inter-frame interval, enabling inline denoising and reducing dataset size for downstream CPU/GPU analysis. Validated under PRISM-scale acquisition, this modular FPGA framework offers a practical solution for latency-sensitive imaging workflows in spectroscopy and microscopy.</description>

      <title>Fusing Structural Phenotypes with Functional Data for Early Prediction of Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma Progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To classify eyes as slow or fast glaucoma progressors in patients with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) using an integrated approach combining optic nerve head (ONH) structural features and sector-based visual field (VF) functional parameters. Methods: PACG patients with &gt;5 reliable VF tests over &gt;5 years were included. Progression was assessed in Zeiss Forum, with baseline VF within six months of OCT. Fast progression was VFI decline &lt;-2.0% per year; slow progression &gt;-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were AI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test defined five regions per hemifield, aligned with RNFL distribution. Mean sensitivity per region was combined with structural parameters to train ML classifiers. Multiple models were tested, and SHAP identified key predictors. Main outcome measures: Classification of slow versus fast progressors using combined structural and functional data. Results: We analyzed 451 eyes from 299 patients. Mean VFI progression was -0.92% per year; 369 eyes progressed slowly and 82 rapidly. The Random Forest model combining structural and functional features achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.87, 2000 Monte Carlo iterations). SHAP identified six key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior and inferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal VF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only structural or functional features performed worse with AUC of 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. Conclusions: Combining ONH structural and VF functional parameters significantly improves classification of progression risk in PACG. Inferior ONH features, MRW and RNFL thickness, were the most predictive, highlighting the critical role of ONH morphology in monitoring disease progression.</description>

      <title>Holo-Artisan: A Personalized Multi-User Holographic Experience for Virtual Museums on the Edge Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Holo-Artisan, a novel system architecture enabling immersive multi-user experiences in virtual museums through true holographic displays and personalized edge intelligence. In our design, local edge computing nodes process real-time user data -- including pose, facial expression, and voice -- for multiple visitors concurrently. Generative AI models then drive digital artworks (e.g., a volumetric Mona Lisa) to respond uniquely to each viewer. For instance, the Mona Lisa can return a smile to one visitor while engaging in a spoken Q\&amp;A with another, all in real time. A cloud-assisted collaboration platform composes these interactions in a shared scene using a universal scene description, and employs ray tracing to render high-fidelity, personalized views with a direct pipeline to glasses-free holographic displays. To preserve user privacy and continuously improve personalization, we integrate federated learning (FL) -- edge devices locally fine-tune AI models and share only model updates for aggregation. This edge-centric approach minimizes latency and bandwidth usage, ensuring a synchronized shared experience with individual customization. Through Holo-Artisan, static museum exhibits are transformed into dynamic, living artworks that engage each visitor in a personal dialogue, heralding a new paradigm of cultural heritage interaction.</description>

      <title>\textit{adder-viz}: Real-Time Visualization Software for Transcoding Event Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have brought about a surge in neuromorphic ``event'' video research, primarily targeting computer vision applications. Event video eschews video frames in favor of asynchronous, per-pixel intensity samples. While much work has focused on a handful of representations for specific event cameras, these representations have shown limitations in flexibility, speed, and compressibility. We previously proposed the unified AD{\Delta}ER representation to address these concerns. This paper introduces numerous improvements to the \textit{adder-viz} software for visualizing real-time event transcode processes and applications in-the-loop. The MIT-licensed software is available from a centralized repository at \href{https://github.com/ac-freeman/adder-codec-rs}{https://github.com/ac-freeman/adder-codec-rs}.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised physics-informed generative networks for phase retrieval from a single X-ray hologram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray phase contrast imaging significantly improves the visualization of structures with weak or uniform absorption, broadening its applications across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Propagation-based phase contrast is particularly suitable for time- or dose-critical in vivo/in situ/operando (tomography) experiments because it requires only a single intensity measurement. However, the phase information of the wave field is lost during the measurement and must be recovered. Conventional algebraic and iterative methods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may not be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require manual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less adaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning approach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field regime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A physics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both the phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane from a single hologram. Unlike most deep learning approaches for phase retrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated training data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach, as acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due to the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations. The algorithm demonstrates robust and consistent performance across diverse imaging conditions and sample types, delivering quantitative, high-quality reconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets acquired at beamline P05 at PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg), operated by Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon. Furthermore, it enables the simultaneous retrieval of both phase and absorption information.</description>

      <title>CM2LoD3: Reconstructing LoD3 Building Models Using Semantic Conflict Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins, and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2 building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution, CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis. Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling.

Abstract: \hspace{2mm} Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) of the brain offers unique capabilities including noninvasive probing of tissue microstructure and structural connectivity. It is widely used for clinical assessment of disease and injury, and for neuroscience research. Analyzing the dMRI data to extract useful information for medical and scientific purposes can be challenging. The dMRI measurements may suffer from strong noise and artifacts, and may exhibit high inter-session and inter-scanner variability in the data, as well as inter-subject heterogeneity in brain structure. Moreover, the relationship between measurements and the phenomena of interest can be highly complex. Recent years have witnessed increasing use of machine learning methods for dMRI analysis. This manuscript aims to assess these efforts, with a focus on methods that have addressed data preprocessing and harmonization, microstructure mapping, tractography, and white matter tract analysis. We study the main findings, strengths, and weaknesses of the existing methods and suggest topics for future research. We find that machine learning may be exceptionally suited to tackle some of the difficult tasks in dMRI analysis. However, for this to happen, several shortcomings of existing methods and critical unresolved issues need to be addressed. There is a pressing need to improve evaluation practices, to increase the availability of rich training datasets and validation benchmarks, as well as model generalizability, reliability, and explainability concerns.</description>

      <title>Fast-DDPM: Fast Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Medical Image-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved unprecedented success in computer vision. However, they remain underutilized in medical imaging, a field crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. This is primarily due to the high computational cost associated with (1) the use of large number of time steps (e.g., 1,000) in diffusion processes and (2) the increased dimensionality of medical images, which are often 3D or 4D. Training a diffusion model on medical images typically takes days to weeks, while sampling each image volume takes minutes to hours. To address this challenge, we introduce Fast-DDPM, a simple yet effective approach capable of improving training speed, sampling speed, and generation quality simultaneously. Unlike DDPM, which trains the image denoiser across 1,000 time steps, Fast-DDPM trains and samples using only 10 time steps. The key to our method lies in aligning the training and sampling procedures to optimize time-step utilization. Specifically, we introduced two efficient noise schedulers with 10 time steps: one with uniform time step sampling and another with non-uniform sampling. We evaluated Fast-DDPM across three medical image-to-image generation tasks: multi-image super-resolution, image denoising, and image-to-image translation. Fast-DDPM outperformed DDPM and current state-of-the-art methods based on convolutional networks and generative adversarial networks in all tasks. Additionally, Fast-DDPM reduced the training time to 0.2x and the sampling time to 0.01x compared to DDPM. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/mirthAI/Fast-DDPM.</description>

      <title>NucleiMix: Realistic Data Augmentation for Nuclei Instance Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation is an essential task in pathology image analysis, serving as the foundation for many downstream applications. The release of several public datasets has significantly advanced research in this area, yet many existing methods struggle with data imbalance issues. To address this challenge, this study introduces a data augmentation method, called NucleiMix, which is designed to balance the distribution of nuclei types by increasing the number of rare-type nuclei within datasets. NucleiMix operates in two phases. In the first phase, it identifies candidate locations similar to the surroundings of rare-type nuclei and inserts rare-type nuclei into the candidate locations. In the second phase, it employs a progressive inpainting strategy using a pre-trained diffusion model to seamlessly integrate rare-type nuclei into their new environments in replacement of major-type nuclei or background locations. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of NucleiMix on three public datasets using two popular nuclei instance segmentation models. The results demonstrate the superior ability of NucleiMix to synthesize realistic rare-type nuclei and to enhance the quality of nuclei segmentation and classification in an accurate and robust manner.</description>

      <title>Physics-Driven Autoregressive State Space Models for Medical Image Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image reconstruction from undersampled acquisitions is an ill-posed inverse problem requiring accurate recovery of anatomical structures from incomplete measurements. Physics-driven (PD) network models have gained prominence for this task by integrating data-consistency mechanisms with learned priors, enabling improved performance over purely data-driven approaches. However, reconstruction quality still hinges on the network's ability to disentangle artifacts from true anatomical signals-both of which exhibit complex, multi-scale contextual structure. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture local correlations but often struggle with non-local dependencies. While transformers aim to alleviate this limitation, practical implementations involve design compromises to reduce computational cost by balancing local and non-local sensitivity, occasionally resulting in performance comparable to CNNs. To address these challenges, we propose MambaRoll, a novel physics-driven autoregressive state space model (SSM) for high-fidelity and efficient image reconstruction. MambaRoll employs an unrolled architecture where each cascade autoregressively predicts finer-scale feature maps conditioned on coarser-scale representations, enabling consistent multi-scale context propagation. Each stage is built on a hierarchy of scale-specific PD-SSM modules that capture spatial dependencies while enforcing data consistency through residual correction. To further improve scale-aware learning, we introduce a Deep Multi-Scale Decoding (DMSD) loss, which provides supervision at intermediate spatial scales in alignment with the autoregressive design. Demonstrations on accelerated MRI and sparse-view CT reconstructions show that MambaRoll consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-, transformer-, and SSM-based methods.</description>

      <title>Inverse Problem Sampling in Latent Space Using Sequential Monte Carlo</title>

Abstract: In image processing, solving inverse problems is the task of finding plausible reconstructions of an image that was corrupted by some (usually known) degradation operator. Commonly, this process is done using a generative image model that can guide the reconstruction towards solutions that appear natural. The success of diffusion models over the last few years has made them a leading candidate for this task. However, the sequential nature of diffusion models makes this conditional sampling process challenging. Furthermore, since diffusion models are often defined in the latent space of an autoencoder, the encoder-decoder transformations introduce additional difficulties. To address these challenges, we suggest a novel sampling method based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) in the latent space of diffusion models. We name our method LD-SMC. We define a generative model for the data using additional auxiliary observations and perform posterior inference with SMC sampling based on a reverse diffusion process. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet and FFHQ show the benefits of LD-SMC over competing methods in various inverse problem tasks and especially in challenging inpainting tasks.</description>

Abstract: Three-Dimensional Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown substantial promise in the field of computer vision, but remains unexplored in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This study explores its potential for the reconstruction of isotropic resolution 3D MRI from undersampled k-space data. We introduce a novel framework termed 3D Gaussian MRI (3DGSMR), which employs 3D Gaussian distributions as an explicit representation for MR volumes. Experimental evaluations indicate that this method can effectively reconstruct voxelized MR images, achieving a quality on par with that of well-established 3D MRI reconstruction techniques found in the literature. Notably, the 3DGSMR scheme operates under a self-supervised framework, obviating the need for extensive training datasets or prior model training. This approach introduces significant innovations to the domain, notably the adaptation of 3DGS to MRI reconstruction and the novel application of the existing 3DGS methodology to decompose MR signals, which are presented in a complex-valued format.</description>

      <title>Discriminating Distal Ischemic Stroke from Seizure-Induced Stroke Mimics Using Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MRI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distinguishing acute ischemic strokes (AIS) from stroke mimics (SMs), particularly in cases involving medium and small vessel occlusions, remains a significant diagnostic challenge. While computed tomography (CT) based protocols are commonly used in emergency settings, their sensitivity for detecting distal occlusions is limited. This study explores the potential of magnetic resonance perfusion (MRP) imaging as a tool for differentiating distal AIS from epileptic seizures, a prevalent SM. Using a retrospective dataset of 162 patients (129 AIS, 33 seizures), we extracted region-wise perfusion map descriptors (PMDs) from dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) images. Statistical analyses identified several brain regions, located mainly in the temporal and occipital lobe, exhibiting significant group differences in certain PMDs. Hemispheric asymmetry analyses further highlighted these regions as discriminative. A logistic regression model trained on PMDs achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.90, and an area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.74, with a specificity of 92% and a sensitivity of 73%, suggesting strong performance in distinguishing distal AIS from seizures. These findings support further exploration of MRP-based PMDs as interpretable features for distinguishing true strokes from various mimics.

      <title>A Novel Vascular Risk Scoring Framework for Quantifying Sex-Specific Cerebral Perfusion from 3D pCASL MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The influence of sex and age on cerebral perfusion is recognized, but the specific impacts on regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) and vascular risk remain to be fully characterized. In this study, 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) MRI was used to identify sex and age related CBF patterns, and a vascular risk score (VRS) was developed based on normative perfusion profiles. Perfusion data from 186 cognitively healthy participants (89 males, 97 females; aged 8 to 92 years), obtained from a publicly available dataset, were analyzed. An extension of the 3D Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) supervoxel algorithm was applied to CBF maps to group neighboring voxels with similar intensities into anatomically meaningful regions. Regional CBF features were extracted and used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for sex classification and perfusion pattern analysis. Global, age related CBF changes were also assessed. Participant specific VRS was computed by comparing individual CBF profiles to age and sex specific normative data to quantify perfusion deficits. A 95 percent accuracy in sex classification was achieved using the proposed supervoxel based method, and distinct perfusion signatures were identified. Higher CBF was observed in females in medial Brodmann areas 6 and 10, area V5, occipital polar cortex, and insular regions. A global decline in CBF with age was observed in both sexes. Individual perfusion deficits were quantified using VRS, providing a personalized biomarker for early hypoperfusion. Sex and age specific CBF patterns were identified, and a personalized vascular risk biomarker was proposed, contributing to advancements in precision neurology.</description>

      <title>Latent Interpolation Learning Using Diffusion Models for Cardiac Volume Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is a critical tool for diagnosing and managing cardiovascular disease, yet its utility is often limited by the sparse acquisition of 2D short-axis slices, resulting in incomplete volumetric information. Accurate 3D reconstruction from these sparse slices is essential for comprehensive cardiac assessment, but existing methods face challenges, including reliance on predefined interpolation schemes (e.g., linear or spherical), computational inefficiency, and dependence on additional semantic inputs such as segmentation labels or motion data. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Cardiac Latent Interpolation Diffusion (CaLID) framework that introduces three key innovations. First, we present a data-driven interpolation scheme based on diffusion models, which can capture complex, non-linear relationships between sparse slices and improves reconstruction accuracy. Second, we design a computationally efficient method that operates in the latent space and speeds up 3D whole-heart upsampling time by a factor of 24, reducing computational overhead compared to previous methods. Third, with only sparse 2D CMR images as input, our method achieves SOTA performance against baseline methods, eliminating the need for auxiliary input such as morphological guidance, thus simplifying workflows. We further extend our method to 2D+T data, enabling the effective modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics and ensuring temporal coherence. Extensive volumetric evaluations and downstream segmentation tasks demonstrate that CaLID achieves superior reconstruction quality and efficiency. By addressing the fundamental limitations of existing approaches, our framework advances the state of the art for spatio and spatiotemporal whole-heart reconstruction, offering a robust and clinically practical solution for cardiovascular imaging.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Study of Deep Learning Models and xAI Methods for Region-of-Interest Detection in MRI Scans</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an essential diagnostic tool for assessing knee injuries. However, manual interpretation of MRI slices remains time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. This study presents a systematic evaluation of various deep learning architectures combined with explainable AI (xAI) techniques for automated region of interest (ROI) detection in knee MRI scans. We investigate both supervised and self-supervised approaches, including ResNet50, InceptionV3, Vision Transformers (ViT), and multiple U-Net variants augmented with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifiers. To enhance interpretability and clinical relevance, we integrate xAI methods such as Grad-CAM and Saliency Maps. Model performance is assessed using AUC for classification and PSNR/SSIM for reconstruction quality, along with qualitative ROI visualizations. Our results demonstrate that ResNet50 consistently excels in classification and ROI identification, outperforming transformer-based models under the constraints of the MRNet dataset. While hybrid U-Net + MLP approaches show potential for leveraging spatial features in reconstruction and interpretability, their classification performance remains lower. Grad-CAM consistently provided the most clinically meaningful explanations across architectures. Overall, CNN-based transfer learning emerges as the most effective approach for this dataset, while future work with larger-scale pretraining may better unlock the potential of transformer models.</description>

      <title>Capturing Stable HDR Videos Using a Dual-Camera System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) video acquisition using the alternating exposure (AE) paradigm has garnered significant attention due to its cost-effectiveness with a single consumer camera. However, despite progress driven by deep neural networks, these methods remain prone to temporal flicker in real-world applications due to inter-frame exposure inconsistencies. To address this challenge while maintaining the cost-effectiveness of the AE paradigm, we propose a novel learning-based HDR video generation solution. Specifically, we propose a dual-stream HDR video generation paradigm that decouples temporal luminance anchoring from exposure-variant detail reconstruction, overcoming the inherent limitations of the AE paradigm. To support this, we design an asynchronous dual-camera system (DCS), which enables independent exposure control across two cameras, eliminating the need for synchronization typically required in traditional multi-camera setups. Furthermore, an exposure-adaptive fusion network (EAFNet) is formulated for the DCS system. EAFNet integrates a pre-alignment subnetwork that aligns features across varying exposures, ensuring robust feature extraction for subsequent fusion, an asymmetric cross-feature fusion subnetwork that emphasizes reference-based attention to effectively merge these features across exposures, and a reconstruction subnetwork to mitigate ghosting artifacts and preserve fine details. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, showing the remarkable potential of our solution in HDR video reconstruction. The codes and data captured by DCS will be available at https://zqqqyu.github.io/DCS-HDR/.</description>
