      <title>Parameterized Complexity of Vehicle Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a popular generalization of the Traveling Salesperson Problem. Instead of one salesperson traversing the entire weighted, undirected graph $G$, there are $k$ vehicles available to jointly cover the set of clients $C \subseteq V(G)$. Every vehicle must start at one of the depot vertices $D \subseteq V(G)$ and return to its start. Capacitated Vehicle Routing (CVRP) additionally restricts the route of each vehicle by limiting the number of clients it can cover, the distance it can travel, or both.
  In this work, we study the complexity of VRP and the three variants of CVRP for several parameterizations, in particular focusing on the treewidth of $G$. We present an FPT algorithm for VRP parameterized by treewidth. For CVRP, we prove paraNP- and $W[\cdot]$-hardness for various parameterizations, including treewidth, thereby rendering the existence of FPT algorithms unlikely. In turn, we provide an XP algorithm for CVRP when parameterized by both treewidth and the vehicle capacity.</description>

      <title>Nearly optimal algorithms to learn sparse quantum Hamiltonians in physically motivated distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning Hamiltonians $H$ that are $s$-sparse in the Pauli basis, given access to their time evolution. Although Hamiltonian learning has been extensively investigated, two issues recur in much of the existing literature: the absence of matching lower bounds and the use of mathematically convenient but physically opaque error measures.
  We address both challenges by introducing two physically motivated distances between Hamiltonians and designing a nearly optimal algorithm with respect to one of these metrics. The first, time-constrained distance, quantifies distinguishability through dynamical evolution up to a bounded time. The second, temperature-constrained distance, captures distinguishability through thermal states at bounded inverse temperatures.
  We show that $s$-sparse Hamiltonians with bounded operator norm can be learned in both distances with $O(s \log(1/\epsilon))$ experiments and $O(s^2/\epsilon)$ evolution time. For the time-constrained distance, we further establish lower bounds of $\Omega((s/n)\log(1/\epsilon) + s)$ experiments and $\Omega(\sqrt{s}/\epsilon)$ evolution time, demonstrating near-optimality in the number of experiments.
  As an intermediate result, we obtain an algorithm that learns every Pauli coefficient of $s$-sparse Hamiltonians up to error $\epsilon$ in $O(s\log(1/\epsilon))$ experiments and $O(s/\epsilon)$ evolution time, improving upon several recent results.
  The source of this improvement is a new isolation technique, inspired by the Valiant-Vazirani theorem (STOC'85), which shows that NP is as easy as detecting unique solutions. This isolation technique allows us to query the time evolution of a single Pauli coefficient of a sparse Hamiltonian--even when the Pauli support of the Hamiltonian is unknown--ultimately enabling us to recover the Pauli support itself.</description>

      <title>Improved Quantum Lifting by Coherent Measure-and-Reprogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a tighter lifting theorem for security games in the quantum random oracle model. At the core of our main result lies a novel measure-and-reprogram framework that we call coherent reprogramming. This framework gives a tighter lifting theorem for query complexity problems, that only requires purely classical reasoning. As direct applications of our lifting theorem, we first provide a quantum direct product theorem in the average case - i.e., an enabling tool to determine the hardness of solving multi-instance security games. This allows us to derive in a straightforward manner the hardness of various security games, for example (i) the non-uniform hardness of salted games, (ii) the hardness of specific cryptographic tasks such as the multiple instance version of one-wayness and collision-resistance, and (iii) uniform or non-uniform hardness of many other games.</description>

      <title>NISQ Security and Complexity via Simple Classical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give novel lifting theorems for security games in the quantum random oracle model (QROM) in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) settings such as the hybrid query model, the noisy oracle and the bounded-depth models. We provide, for the first time, a hybrid lifting theorem for hybrid algorithms that can perform both quantum and classical queries, as well as a lifting theorem for quantum algorithms with access to noisy oracles or bounded quantum depth.
  At the core of our results lies a novel measure-and-reprogram framework, called hybrid coherent measure-and-reprogramming, tailored specifically for hybrid algorithms. Equipped with the lifting theorem, we are able to prove directly NISQ security and complexity results by calculating a single combinatorial quantity, relying solely on classical reasoning.
  As applications, we derive the first direct product theorems in the average case, in the hybrid setting-i.e., an enabling tool to determine the hybrid hardness of solving multi-instance security games. This allows us to derive in a straightforward manner the NISQ hardness of various security games, such as (i) the non-uniform hardness of salted games, (ii) the hardness of specific cryptographic tasks such as the multiple instance version of one-wayness and collision-resistance, and (iii) uniform or non-uniform hardness of many other games.</description>

      <title>Constant Time with Minimal Preprocessing, a Robust and Extensive Complexity Class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the class $\mathtt{cstPP}$ of operations $\mathtt{op}: \mathbb{N}^k\to\mathbb{N}$, of any fixed arity $k\ge 1$, satisfying the following property: for each fixed integer $d\ge 1$, there exists an algorithm for a RAM machine which, for any input integer $N\ge 2$, - pre-computes some tables in $O(N)$ time, - then reads $k$ operands $x_1,\ldots,x_k&lt;N^d$ and computes $\mathtt{op}(x_1,\dots,x_k)$ in constant time.
  We show that the $\mathtt{cstPP}$ class is robust and extensive and satisfies several closure properties. It is invariant depending on whether the set of primitive operations of the RAM is $\{+\}$, or $\{+,-,\times,\mathtt{div},\mathtt{mod}\}$, or any set of operations in $\mathtt{cstPP}$ provided it includes $+$. We prove that the $\mathtt{cstPP}$ class is closed under composition and, for fast-growing functions, is closed under inverse. We also show that in the definition of $\mathtt{cstPP}$ the constant-time procedure can be reduced to a single return instruction. Finally, we establish that linear preprocessing time is not essential in the definition of the $\mathtt{cstPP}$ class: this class is not modified if the preprocessing time is increased to $O(N^c)$, for any fixed $c&gt;1$, or conversely, is reduced to $N^{\varepsilon}$, for any positive $\varepsilon&lt;1$ (provided the set of primitive operation includes $+$, $\mathtt{div}$ and $\mathtt{mod}$). To complete the picture, we demonstrate that the $\mathtt{cstPP}$ class degenerates if the preprocessing time reduces to $N^{o(1)}$.</description>

      <title>Certifying and learning quantum Ising Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the problems of certifying and learning quantum Ising Hamiltonians. Our main contributions are as follows:
  Certification of Ising Hamiltonians. We show that certifying an Ising Hamiltonian in normalized Frobenius norm via access to its time-evolution operator requires only $\widetilde O(1/\varepsilon)$ time evolution. This matches the Heisenberg-scaling lower bound of $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$ up to logarithmic factors. To our knowledge, this is the first nearly-optimal algorithm for testing a Hamiltonian property. A key ingredient in our analysis is the Bonami Lemma from Fourier analysis.
  Learning Ising Gibbs states. We design an algorithm for learning Ising Gibbs states in trace norm that is sample-efficient in all parameters. In contrast, previous approaches learned the underlying Hamiltonian (which implies learning the Gibbs state) but suffered from exponential sample complexity in the inverse temperature.
  Certification of Ising Gibbs states. We give an algorithm for certifying Ising Gibbs states in trace norm that is both sample and time-efficient, thereby solving a question posed by Anshu (Harvard Data Science Review, 2022).
  Finally, we extend our results on learning and certification of Gibbs states to general $k$-local Hamiltonians for any constant $k$.</description>

      <title>Structural Parameterizations for Induced and Acyclic Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the (structurally) parameterized complexity of Induced Matching and Acyclic Matching, two problems where we seek to find a maximum independent set of edges whose endpoints induce, respectively, a matching and a forest. Chaudhary and Zehavi [WG '23] recently studied these problems parameterized by treewidth, denoted by $\mathrm{tw}$. We resolve several of the problems left open in their work and extend their results as follows: (i) for Acyclic Matching, Chaudhary and Zehavi gave an algorithm of running time $6^{\mathrm{tw}}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ and a lower bound of $(3-\varepsilon)^{\mathrm{tw}}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ (under the SETH); we close this gap by, on the one hand giving a more careful analysis of their algorithm showing that its complexity is actually $5^{\mathrm{tw}} n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, and on the other giving a pw-SETH-based lower bound showing that this running time cannot be improved (even for pathwidth), (ii) for Induced Matching we show that their $3^{\mathrm{tw}} n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ algorithm is optimal under the pw-SETH (in fact improving over this for pathwidth or even for cutwidth is equivalent to falsifying the pw-SETH) by adapting a recent reduction for Bounded Degree Vertex Deletion, (iii) for both problems we give FPT algorithms with single-exponential dependence when parameterized by clique-width and in particular for Induced Matching our algorithm has running time $3^{\mathrm{cw}} n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, which is optimal under the pw-SETH from our previous result.</description>

      <title>Directed Temporal Tree Realization for Periodic Public Transport: Easy and Hard Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of the directed periodic temporal graph realization problem. This work is motivated by the design of periodic schedules in public transport with constraints on the quality of service. Namely, we require that the fastest path between (important) pairs of vertices is upper bounded by a specified maximum duration, encoded in an upper distance matrix $D$. While previous work has considered the undirected version of the problem, the application in public transport schedule design requires the flexibility to assign different departure times to the two directions of an edge. A problem instance can only be feasible if all values of the distance matrix are at least shortest path distances. However, the task of realizing exact fastest path distances in a periodic temporal graph is often too restrictive. Therefore, we introduce a minimum slack parameter $k$ that describes a lower bound on the maximum allowed waiting time on each path. We concentrate on tree topologies and provide a full characterization of the complexity landscape with respect to the period $\Delta$ and the minimum slack parameter $k$, showing a sharp threshold between NP-complete cases and cases which are always realizable. We also provide hardness results for the special case of period $\Delta = 2$ for general directed and undirected graphs.</description>
