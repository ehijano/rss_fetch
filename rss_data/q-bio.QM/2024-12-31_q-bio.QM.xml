      <title>Identifying Cocoa Pollinators: A Deep Learning Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cocoa is a multi-billion-dollar industry but research on improving yields through pollination remains limited. New embedded hardware and AI-based data analysis is advancing information on cocoa flower visitors, their identity and implications for yields. We present the first cocoa flower visitor dataset containing 5,792 images of Ceratopogonidae, Formicidae, Aphididae, Araneae, and Encyrtidae, and 1,082 background cocoa flower images. This dataset was curated from 23 million images collected over two years by embedded cameras in cocoa plantations in Hainan province, China. We exemplify the use of the dataset with different sizes of YOLOv8 models and by progressively increasing the background image ratio in the training set to identify the best-performing model. The medium-sized YOLOv8 model achieved the best results with 8% background images (F1 Score of 0.71, mAP50 of 0.70). Overall, this dataset is useful to compare the performance of deep learning model architectures on images with low contrast images and difficult detection targets. The data can support future efforts to advance sustainable cocoa production through pollination monitoring projects.</description>

      <title>Validation of Subject-Specific Knee Models from In Vivo Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calibration to experimental data is vital when developing subject-specific models towards developing digital twins. Yet, to date, subject-specific models are largely based on cadaveric testing, as in vivo data to calibrate against has been difficult to obtain until recently. To support our overall goal of building subject-specific models of the living knee, we aimed to show that subject-specific computational models built and calibrated using in vivo measurements would have accuracy comparable to models built using in vitro measurements. Two knee specimens were imaged using a combination of computed tomography (CT), and surface scans. Knee laxity measurements were made with a custom apparatus used for the living knee and from a robotic knee simulator. Models of the knees were built using the CT geometry and surface scans, and then calibrated with either laxity data from the robotic knee simulator or from the knee laxity apparatus. Model performance was compared by simulation of passive flexion, knee laxity and a clinically relevant pivot shift. Performance was similar with differences during simulated anterior-posterior laxity tests of less than 2.5 mm. Additionally, model predictions of a pivot shift were similar with differences less than 3 deg or 3 mm for rotations and translations, respectively. Still, differences in the predicted ligament loads and calibrated material properties emerged, highlighting a need for methods to include ligament load as part of the underlying calibration process. Overall, the results showed that currently available methods of measuring knee laxity in vivo are sufficient to calibrate models comparable with existing in vitro techniques, and the workflows described here may provide a basis for modeling the living knee. The models, data, and code are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Enabled Multidimensional Data Utilization in Multi-resonance Biosensors: A Pathway to Enhanced Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel framework is proposed that combines multi-resonance biosensors with machine learning (ML) to significantly enhance the accuracy of parameter prediction in biosensing. Unlike traditional single-resonance systems, which are limited to one-dimensional datasets, this approach leverages multi-dimensional data generated by a custom-designed nanostructure, a periodic array of silicon nanorods with a triangular cross-section over an aluminum reflector. High bulk sensitivity values are achieved for this multi-resonant structure, with certain resonant peaks reaching up to 1706 nm/RIU. The predictive power of multiple resonant peaks from transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) polarizations is evaluated using Ridge Regression modeling. Systematic analysis reveals that incorporating multiple resonances yields up to three orders of magnitude improvement in refractive index detection precision compared to single-peak analyses. This precision enhancement is achieved without modifications to the biosensor hardware, highlighting the potential of data-centric strategies in biosensing. The findings establish a new paradigm in biosensing, demonstrating that the synergy between multi-resonance data acquisition and ML-based analysis can significantly enhance detection accuracy. This study provides a scalable pathway for advancing high-precision biosensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Considering experimental frame rates and robust segmentation analysis of piecewise-linear microparticle trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The movement of intracellular cargo transported by molecular motors is commonly marked by switches between directed motion and stationary pauses. The predominant measure for assessing movement is effective diffusivity, which predicts the mean-squared displacement of particles over long time scales. In this work, we consider an alternative analysis regime that focuses on shorter time scales and relies on automated segmentation of paths. Due to intrinsic uncertainty in changepoint analysis, we highlight the importance of statistical summaries that are robust with respect to the performance of segmentation algorithms. In contrast to effective diffusivity, which averages over multiple behaviors, we emphasize tools that highlight the different motor-cargo states, with an eye toward identifying biophysical mechanisms that determine emergent whole-cell transport properties. By developing a Markov chain model for noisy, continuous, piecewise-linear microparticle movement, and associated mathematical analysis, we provide insight into a common question posed by experimentalists: how does the choice of observational frame rate affect what is inferred about transport properties?</description>

      <title>Pharmacometrics Modeling via Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Integrating Time-Variant Absorption Rates and Fractional Calculus for Enhancing Prediction Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method to improve pharmacokinetics modeling, an essential step of drug development. Conventional models frequently fail to fully represent the intricacies of drug absorption and distribution, which limits their predictive abilities required for personalized treatment strategies. Our methodology introduces two innovations to enhance modeling accuracy: 1. Time-varying parameters: this approach is designed to accommodate the dynamic nature of drug absorption rates. 2. Fractional calculus in representing delayed drug response. This approach effectively captures anomalous diffusion phenomena, surpassing traditional models in describing drug delayed response without the need for extensive compartmentalization.</description>

      <title>A Standardized Framework for Sensor Placement in Human Motion Capture and Wearable Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of wearable sensors and monitoring technologies has created an urgent need for standardized sensor placement protocols. While existing standards like SENIAM address specific applications, no comprehensive framework spans different sensing modalities and applications. We present a unified sensor placement standard that ensures the reproducibility and transferability of human movement and physiological data across various systems and research domains. Our framework provides precise anatomical landmarks, coordinate systems, and placement protocols with defined precision levels, compatible with existing data-sharing standards such as the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) and Heirechciacal Event Descriptors (HED). This framework aims to enhance data quality, reproducibility, and interoperability in applications ranging from lab-based clinical biomechanics to continuous health monitoring in everyday life.</description>

      <title>Self-Calibrated Dual Contrasting for Annotation-Efficient Bacteria Raman Spectroscopy Clustering and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Raman scattering is based on molecular vibration spectroscopy and provides a powerful technology for pathogenic bacteria diagnosis using the unique molecular fingerprint information of a substance. The integration of deep learning technology has significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of intelligent Raman spectroscopy (RS) recognition. However, the current RS recognition methods based on deep neural networks still require the annotation of a large amount of spectral data, which is labor-intensive. This paper presents a novel annotation-efficient Self-Calibrated Dual Contrasting (SCDC) method for RS recognition that operates effectively with few or no annotation. Our core motivation is to represent the spectrum from two different perspectives in two distinct subspaces: embedding and category. The embedding perspective captures instance-level information, while the category perspective reflects category-level information. Accordingly, we have implemented a dual contrastive learning approach from two perspectives to obtain discriminative representations, which are applicable for Raman spectroscopy recognition under both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning conditions. Furthermore, a self-calibration mechanism is proposed to enhance robustness. Validation of the identification task on three large-scale bacterial Raman spectroscopy datasets demonstrates that our SCDC method achieves robust recognition performance with very few (5$\%$ or 10$\%$) or no annotations, highlighting the potential of the proposed method for biospectral identification in annotation-efficient clinical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Derivations of Animal Movement Models with Explicit Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly evolved animals continuously update their knowledge of social factors, refining movement decisions based on both historical and real-time observations. Despite its significance, research on the underlying mechanisms remains limited. In this study, we explore how the use of explicit memory shapes different mathematical models across various ecological dispersal scenarios. Specifically, we investigate three memory-based dispersal scenarios: gradient-based movement, where individuals respond to environmental gradients; environment matching, which promotes uniform distribution within a population; and location-based movement, where decisions rely solely on local suitability. These scenarios correspond to diffusion advection, Fickian diffusion, and Fokker-Planck diffusion models, respectively. We focus on the derivation of these memory-based movement models using three approaches: spatial and temporal discretization, patch models in continuous time, and discrete-velocity jump process. These derivations highlight how different ways of using memory lead to distinct mathematical models. Numerical simulations reveal that the three dispersal scenarios exhibit distinct behaviors under memory-induced repulsive and attractive conditions. The diffusion advection and Fokker-Planck models display wiggle patterns and aggregation phenomena, while simulations of the Fickian diffusion model consistently stabilize to uniform constant states.</description>

      <title>Accurate RNA 3D structure prediction using a language model-based deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of RNA three-dimensional (3D) structure remains an unsolved challenge. Determining RNA 3D structures is crucial for understanding their functions and informing RNA-targeting drug development and synthetic biology design. The structural flexibility of RNA, which leads to scarcity of experimentally determined data, complicates computational prediction efforts. Here, we present RhoFold+, an RNA language model-based deep learning method that accurately predicts 3D structures of single-chain RNAs from sequences. By integrating an RNA language model pre-trained on ~23.7 million RNA sequences and leveraging techniques to address data scarcity, RhoFold+ offers a fully automated end-to-end pipeline for RNA 3D structure prediction. Retrospective evaluations on RNA-Puzzles and CASP15 natural RNA targets demonstrate RhoFold+'s superiority over existing methods, including human expert groups. Its efficacy and generalizability are further validated through cross-family and cross-type assessments, as well as time-censored benchmarks. Additionally, RhoFold+ predicts RNA secondary structures and inter-helical angles, providing empirically verifiable features that broaden its applicability to RNA structure and function studies.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based Inference for Cardiovascular Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decades, hemodynamics simulators have steadily evolved and have become tools of choice for studying cardiovascular systems in-silico. While such tools are routinely used to simulate whole-body hemodynamics from physiological parameters, solving the corresponding inverse problem of mapping waveforms back to plausible physiological parameters remains both promising and challenging. Motivated by advances in simulation-based inference (SBI), we cast this inverse problem as statistical inference. In contrast to alternative approaches, SBI provides \textit{posterior distributions} for the parameters of interest, providing a \textit{multi-dimensional} representation of uncertainty for \textit{individual} measurements. We showcase this ability by performing an in-silico uncertainty analysis of five biomarkers of clinical interest comparing several measurement modalities. Beyond the corroboration of known facts, such as the feasibility of estimating heart rate, our study highlights the potential of estimating new biomarkers from standard-of-care measurements. SBI reveals practically relevant findings that cannot be captured by standard sensitivity analyses, such as the existence of sub-populations for which parameter estimation exhibits distinct uncertainty regimes. Finally, we study the gap between in-vivo and in-silico with the MIMIC-III waveform database and critically discuss how cardiovascular simulations can inform real-world data analysis.</description>
