      <title>Statistics for the triangle density in ERGM and its mean-field approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the edge-triangle model (or Strauss model), and focus on the asymptotic behavior of the triangle density when the size of the graph increases to infinity. This random graph belongs to the class of exponential random graphs, which follows the statistical mechanics approach of introducing a Hamiltonian to weigh the probability measure on the state space of graphs. In the analyticity region of the free energy, we prove a law of large numbers for the triangle density. Along the critical curve, where analyticity breaks down, we show that the triangle density concentrates with high probability in a neighborhood of its typical value. A predominant part of our work is devoted to the study of a mean-field approximation of the edge-triangle model, where explicit computations are possible. In this setting we can go further, and additionally prove a standard and non-standard central limit theorem at the critical point, together with many concentration results obtained via large deviations and statistical mechanics techniques. Despite a rigorous comparison between these two models is still lacking, we believe that they are asymptotically equivalent in many respects, therefore we formulate conjectures on the edge-triangle model, partially supported by simulations, based on the mean-field investigation.</description>

      <title>On Markov-dependent reflected autoregressive processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study Markov-dependent reflected autoregressive processes. In queueing terms, such processes describe the workload just before a customer arrival, which makes obsolete a fraction of the work already present, and where the interarrival time and the service time depend on a common discrete time Markov chain. Among others, we consider the case where given the state of the underlying Markov chain, the interarrival time and the service time are independent, as well as the case where there is also additional dependence based on the Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern copula, the case where the service time depends on the waiting time of the customer, and the modulated shot-noise queue where server's speed is workload proportional. The Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the steady-state workload is derived via a recursive approach. Moreover, we further consider a Markov-modulated version of the reflected autoregressive process with more general structure and obtain the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the transient distribution of the workload.</description>

      <title>Problem of eigenvalues of stochastic Hamiltonian systems with boundary conditions and Markov chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the eigenvalue problem of stochastic Hamiltonian system driven by Brownian motion and Markov chain with boundary conditions and time-dependent coefficients. For any dimensional case, the existence of the first eigenvalue is proven and the corresponding eigenfunctions are constructed by virtue of dual transformation and generalized Riccati equation system. Furthermore, we have more finely characterized the existence of all eigenvalues and constructed the related eigenfunctions for one-dimensional Hamiltonian system. Moreover, the increasing order of these eigenvalues have also been given.</description>

Abstract: In this paper three unrelated problems will be discussed. What connects them is the rich methodology of classical probability theory. In the first two problems we have a complete answer to the problems raised; in the third case, what we call the Hungarian roulette problem, we only have a conjecture with heuristic justification.</description>

      <title>Polynomial interacting particle systems and non-linear SPDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the robustness of the capital distribution curves, we study the behavior of a certain polynomial equity market model as the number of companies goes to infinity. More precisely, we extend volatility-stabilized market models introduced by Fernholz et al. by allowing for a common noise term such that the models remain polynomial. As the number of companies approaches infinity, we show that the limit of the empirical measure of the $N$-company system converges to the unique solution of a degenerate, non-linear SPDE. The obtained limit also has a representation as the conditional probability of the solution to a certain McKean-Vlasov SDE. Together with its conditional, this is again a polynomial process for which we can prove pathwise uniqueness as well as regularity properties for the marginal densities. We also provide conditional propagation of chaos results and numerical implementations of the particle system as well as its limiting equations.</description>

      <title>Node Similarities under Random Projections: Limits and Pathological Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random Projections have been widely used to generate embeddings for various graph tasks due to their computational efficiency. The majority of applications have been justified through the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma. In this paper, we take a step further and investigate how well dot product and cosine similarity are preserved by Random Projections. Our analysis provides new theoretical results, identifies pathological cases, and tests them with numerical experiments. We find that, for nodes of lower or higher degrees, the method produces especially unreliable embeddings for the dot product, regardless of whether the adjacency or the (normalized version) transition is used. With respect to the statistical noise introduced by Random Projections, we show that cosine similarity produces remarkably more precise approximations.</description>

      <title>A bridge between spatial and first-passage properties of continuous and discrete time stochastic processes: from hard walls to absorbing boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a generic one-dimensional stochastic process $x(t)$, or a random walk $X_n$, which describes the position of a particle evolving inside an interval $[a,b]$, with absorbing walls located at $a$ and $b$. In continuous time, $x(t)$ is driven by some equilibrium process $\mathbf{\theta}(t)$, while in discrete time, the jumps of $X_n$ follow a stationary process that obeys a time reversal property. An important observable to characterize its behaviour is the exit probability $E_b(x,t)$, which is the probability for the particle to be absorbed first at the wall $b$, before or at time $t$, given its initial position $x$. In this paper we show that the derivation of this quantity can be tackled by studying a dual process $y(t)$ very similar to $x(t)$ but with hard walls at $a$ and $b$. More precisely, we show that the quantity $E_b(x,t)$ for the process $x(t)$ is equal to the probability $\tilde \Phi(x,t|b)$ of finding the dual process inside the interval $[a,x]$ at time $t$, with $y(0) =b$. We show that this duality applies to various processes which are of interest in physics, including models of active particles, diffusing diffusivity models, a large class of discrete and continuous time random walks, and even processes subjected to stochastic resetting. For all these cases, we provide an explicit construction of the dual process. We also give simple derivations of this identity both in the continuous and in the discrete time setting, as well as numerical tests for a large number of models of interest. Finally, we use simulations to show that the duality is also likely to hold for more complex processes such as fractional Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Gradient contractivity of a rescaled resolvent on domains in Wiener spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an abstract Wiener space $(X,\gamma,H)$, we consider an open set $O\subseteq X$ which satisfies certain smoothness and mean-curvature conditions. We prove that the rescaled resolvent operator associated to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on $O$ is gradient contractive in $L^p(X,\gamma)$ for every $p\in(1,\infty)$. This is the Gaussian counterpart of an analogous result for the rescaled resolvent operator associated to the Laplace operator $\Delta$ in $L^p$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure, $p\in[1,\infty)$, with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on a bounded convex open set $O\subseteq \mathbb R^n$.</description>

      <title>Laplace-HDC: Understanding the geometry of binary hyperdimensional computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the geometry of binary hyperdimensional computing (HDC), a computational scheme in which data are encoded using high-dimensional binary vectors. We establish a result about the similarity structure induced by the HDC binding operator and show that the Laplace kernel naturally arises in this setting, motivating our new encoding method Laplace-HDC, which improves upon previous methods. We describe how our results indicate limitations of binary HDC in encoding spatial information from images and discuss potential solutions, including using Haar convolutional features and the definition of a translation-equivariant HDC encoding. Several numerical experiments highlighting the improved accuracy of Laplace-HDC in contrast to alternative methods are presented. We also numerically study other aspects of the proposed framework such as robustness and the underlying translation-equivariant encoding.</description>

      <title>Localization of a one-dimensional simple random walk among power-law renewal obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional simple random walk killed by quenched soft obstacles. The position of the obstacles is drawn according to a renewal process with a power-law increment distribution. In a previous work, we computed the large-time asymptotics of the quenched survival probability. In the present work we continue our study by describing the behaviour of the random walk conditioned to survive. We prove that with large probability, the walk quickly reaches a unique time-dependent optimal gap that is free from obstacle and gets localized there. We actually establish a dichotomy. If the renewal tail exponent is smaller than one then the walk hits the optimal gap and spends all of its remaining time inside, up to finitely many visits to the bottom of the gap.  If the renewal tail exponent is larger than one then the random walk spends most of its time inside of the optimal gap but also performs short outward excursions, for which we provide matching upper and lower bounds on their length and cardinality. Our key tools include a Markov renewal interpretation of the survival probability as well as various comparison arguments for obstacle environments. Our results may also be rephrased in terms of localization properties for a directed polymer among multiple repulsive interfaces.</description>

Abstract: The present paper is devoted to the well-posedness of a type of multi-dimensional backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with a diagonally quadratic generator. We give a new priori estimate, and prove that the BSDE admits a unique solution on a given interval when the generator has a sufficiently small growth of the off-diagonal elements (i.e., for each $i$, the $i$-th component of the generator has a small growth of the $j$-th row $z^j$ of the variable $z$ for each $j \neq i$). Finally, we give a solvability result when the diagonally quadratic generator is triangular.</description>

      <title>Cluster-size decay in supercritical long-range percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cluster-size distribution of supercritical long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, where two vertices $x,y\in\mathbb{Z}^d$ are connected by an edge with probability $\mathrm{p}(\|x-y\|):=p\min(1,\beta\|x-y\|)^{-d\alpha}$ for parameters $p\in(0, 1]$, $\alpha&gt;1$, and $\beta&gt;0$. We show that when $\alpha&gt;1+1/d$, and either $\beta$ or $p$ is sufficiently large, the probability that the origin is in a finite cluster of size at least $k$ decays as $\exp\big(-\Theta(k^{(d-1)/d})\big)$. This corresponds to classical results for nearest-neighbor Bernoulli percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, but is in contrast to long-range percolation with $\alpha&lt;1+1/d$, when the exponent of the stretched exponential decay changes to $2-\alpha$. This result, together with our accompanying paper, establishes the phase diagram of long-range percolation with respect to cluster-size decay. Our proofs rely on combinatorial methods that show that large delocalized components are unlikely to occur. As a side result we determine the asymptotic growth of the second-largest connected component when the graph is restricted to a finite box.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a topology under which the pair empirical measure of a large class of random walks satisfies a strong Large Deviation principle. The definition of the topology is inspired by the recent article by Mukherjee and Varadhan [16]. This topology is natural for translation-invariant problems such as the downward deviations of the volume of a Wiener sausage or simple random walk, known as the Swiss cheese model [18]. We also adapt our result to some rescaled random walks and provide a contraction principle to the single empirical measure despite a lack of continuity from the projection map, using the notion of diagonal tightness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the initial work by Robbins, we rigorously present an extended theory of nonnegative supermartingales, requiring neither integrability nor finiteness. In particular, we derive a key maximal inequality foreshadowed by Robbins, which we call the extended Ville's inequality, that strengthens the classical Ville's inequality (for integrable nonnegative supermartingales), and also applies to our nonintegrable setting. We derive an extension of the method of mixtures, which applies to $\sigma$-finite mixtures of our extended nonnegative supermartingales. We present some implications of our theory for sequential statistics, such as the use of improper mixtures (priors) in deriving nonparametric confidence sequences and (extended) e-processes.</description>

      <title>Weak well-posedness by transport noise for a class of 2D fluid dynamics equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental open problem in fluid dynamics is whether solutions to $2$D Euler equations with $(L^1_x\cap L^p_x)$-valued vorticity are unique, for some $p\in [1,\infty)$. A related question, more probabilistic in flavour, is whether one can find a physically relevant noise regularizing the PDE. We present some substantial advances towards a resolution of the latter, by establishing well-posedness in law for solutions with $(L^1_x\cap L^2_x)$-valued vorticity and finite kinetic energy, for a general class of stochastic 2D fluid dynamical equations; the noise is spatially rough and of Kraichnan type and we allow the presence of a deterministic forcing $f$. This class includes as primary examples logarithmically regularized 2D Euler and hypodissipative 2D Navier-Stokes equations. In the first case, our result solves the open problem posed by Flandoli. In the latter case, for well-chosen forcing $f$, the corresponding deterministic PDE without noise has recently been shown by Albritton and Colombo to be ill-posed; consequently, the addition of noise truly improves the solution theory for such PDE.</description>

      <title>A geometric approach to conjugation-invariant random permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to conjugation-invariant random permutations. Namely, we explain how to construct uniform permutations in given conjugacy classes from certain point processes in the plane. This enables the use of geometric tools to study various statistics of such permutations. For their longest decreasing subsequences, we prove universality of the $2\sqrt n$ asymptotic. For Robinson--Schensted shapes, we prove universality of the Vershik--Kerov--Logan--Shepp limit curve, thus solving a conjecture of Kammoun. For the number of records, we establish a phase transition phenomenon as the number of fixed points grows. For pattern counts, we obtain an asymptotic normality result, partially answering a conjecture of Hamaker and Rhoades.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any Bayesian game (\'a la Aumann) with a general state space, compact metric action spaces, and nested information admits a Harsanyi $\varepsilon$-equilibrium for every $\varepsilon&gt; 0$. When, in addition, the action spaces and the payoffs are discrete, there is a Bayesian $\varepsilon$-equilibrium. To this end, we develop a new finite approximation of information structures, which has independent interest. We also put forth several open problems, including the existence of a $0$-equilibrium (Harsanyi or Bayesian) in Bayesian games with nested information, the existence of a Harsanyi $\varepsilon$-equilibrium in multi-stage Bayesian games with nested information, and the canonical structure of the universal belief space when the information structure is nested.</description>

      <title>Genealogies of records of stochastic processes with stationary increments as unimodular trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a stationary sequence $X=(X_n)$ of integer-valued random variables with mean $m \in [-\infty, \infty]$. Let $S=(S_n)$ be the stochastic process with increments $X$ and such that $S_0=0$. For each time $i$, draw an edge from $(i,S_i)$ to $(j,S_j)$, where $j&gt;i$ is the smallest integer such that $S_j \geq S_i$, if such a $j$ exists. This defines the record graph of $X$.
  It is shown that if $X$ is ergodic, then its record graph exhibits the following phase transitions when $m$ ranges from $-\infty$ to $\infty$. For $m&lt;0$, the record graph has infinitely many connected components which are all finite trees. At $m=0$, it is either a one-ended tree or a two-ended tree. For $m&gt;0$, it is a two-ended tree.
  The distribution of the component of $0$ in the record graph is analyzed when $X$ is an i.i.d. sequence of random variables whose common distribution is supported on $\{-1,0,1,\ldots\}$, making $S$ a skip-free to the left random walk. For this random walk, if $m&lt;0$, then the component of $0$ is a unimodular typically re-rooted Galton-Watson Tree. If $m=0$, then the record graph rooted at $0$ is a one-ended unimodular random tree, specifically, it is a unimodular Eternal Galton-Watson Tree. If $m&gt;0$, then the record graph rooted at $0$ is a unimodularised bi-variate Eternal Kesten Tree.
  A unimodular random directed tree is said to be record representable if it is the component of $0$ in the record graph of some stationary sequence. It is shown that every infinite unimodular ordered directed tree with a unique succession line is record representable. In particular, every one-ended unimodular ordered directed tree has a unique succession line and is thus record representable.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of heavy tailed nearly unstable cumulative INAR($\infty$) processes and rough fractional diffusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11773v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigated the scaling limit of heavy-tailed unstable cumulative INAR($\infty$) processes. These processes exhibit a power law tail of the form $n^{-(1+\alpha)}$, with $\alpha \in (\frac{1}{2}, 1)$, where the $\ell^1$ norm of the kernel vector is close to $1$. The result is in contrast to scaling limit of the continuous-time heavy tailed unstable Hawkes processes and the one of INAR($p$) processes. We show that the discrete-time scaling limit also has long-memory property and can also be seen as an integrated fractional Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process.</description>

      <title>Disorder Chaos in Short-Range, Diluted, and L\'evy Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough [arXiv:2301.04112], Chatterjee proved site disorder chaos in the Edwards-Anderson (EA) short-range spin glass model utilizing the Hermite spectral method. In this paper, we demonstrate the further usefulness of this Hermite spectral approach by extending the validity of site disorder chaos in three related spin glass models.
  The first, called the mixed even $p$-spin short-range model, is a generalization of the EA model where the underlying graph is a deterministic bounded degree hypergraph consisting of hyperedges with even number of vertices. The second model is the diluted mixed $p$-spin model, which is allowed to have hyperedges with both odd and even number of vertices. For both models, our results hold under general symmetric disorder distributions. The main novelty of our argument is played by an elementary algebraic equation for the Fourier-Hermite series coefficients for the two-spin correlation functions. It allows us to deduce necessary geometric conditions to determine the contributing coefficients in the overlap function, which in spirit is the same as the crucial Lemma 1 in [arXiv:2301.04112]. Finally, we also establish disorder chaos in the L\'evy model with stable index $\alpha \in (1, 2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.13776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the nonparametric diffusion model, we develop a multiple test to infer about similarity of an unknown drift $b$ to some reference drift $b_0$: At prescribed significance, we simultaneously identify those regions where violation from similiarity occurs, without a priori knowledge of their number, size and location. This test is shown to be minimax-optimal and adaptive. At the same time, the procedure is robust under small deviation from Brownian motion as the driving noise process. A detailed investigation for fractional driving noise, which is neither a semimartingale nor a Markov process, is provided for Hurst indices close to the Brownian motion case.</description>

Abstract: Richard Arnold Epstein (1927-2016) published the first edition of "The Theory of Gambling and Statistical Logic" in 1967. He introduced some material on round-robin tournaments (complete oriented graphs) with n labeled vertices in Chapter 9; in particular, he stated, without proof, that the probability that there is a unique vertex with the maximum score tends to 1 as n tends to infinity. Our object here is to give a proof of this result along with some historical remarks and comments.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Graph Datasets for Node Classification: Homophily-Heterophily Dichotomy and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06177v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homophily is a graph property describing the tendency of edges to connect similar nodes; the opposite is called heterophily. It is often believed that heterophilous graphs are challenging for standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs), and much effort has been put into developing efficient methods for this setting. However, there is no universally agreed-upon measure of homophily in the literature. In this work, we show that commonly used homophily measures have critical drawbacks preventing the comparison of homophily levels across different datasets. For this, we formalize desirable properties for a proper homophily measure and verify which measures satisfy which properties. In particular, we show that a measure that we call adjusted homophily satisfies more desirable properties than other popular homophily measures while being rarely used in graph machine learning literature. Then, we go beyond the homophily-heterophily dichotomy and propose a new characteristic that allows one to further distinguish different sorts of heterophily. The proposed label informativeness (LI) characterizes how much information a neighbor's label provides about a node's label. We prove that this measure satisfies important desirable properties. We also observe empirically that LI better agrees with GNN performance compared to homophily measures, which confirms that it is a useful characteristic of the graph structure.</description>

      <title>A random matrix model for random approximate $t$-designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a Haar random set $\mathcal{S}\subset U(d)$ of quantum gates we consider the uniform measure $\nu_\mathcal{S}$ whose support is given by $\mathcal{S}$. The measure $\nu_\mathcal{S}$ can be regarded as a $\delta(\nu_\mathcal{S},t)$-approximate $t$-design, $t\in\mathbb{Z}_+$. We propose a random matrix model that aims to describe the probability distribution of $\delta(\nu_\mathcal{S},t)$ for any $t$. Our model is given by a block diagonal matrix whose blocks are independent, given by Gaussian or Ginibre ensembles, and their number, size and type is determined by $t$. We prove that, the operator norm of this matrix, $\delta({t})$, is the random variable to which $\sqrt{|\mathcal{S}|}\delta(\nu_\mathcal{S},t)$ converges in distribution when the number of elements in $\mathcal{S}$ grows to infinity. Moreover, we characterize our model giving explicit bounds on the tail probabilities $\mathbb{P}(\delta(t)&gt;2+\epsilon)$, for any $\epsilon&gt;0$. We also show that our model satisfies the so-called spectral gap conjecture, i.e. we prove that with the probability $1$ there is $t\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ such that $\sup_{k\in\mathbb{Z}_{+}}\delta(k)=\delta(t)$. Numerical simulations give convincing evidence that the proposed model is actually almost exact for any cardinality of $\mathcal{S}$. The heuristic explanation of this phenomenon, that we provide, leads us to conjecture that the tail probabilities $\mathbb{P}(\sqrt{\mathcal{S}}\delta(\nu_\mathcal{S},t)&gt;2+\epsilon)$ are bounded from above by the tail probabilities $\mathbb{P}(\delta(t)&gt;2+\epsilon)$ of our random matrix model. In particular our conjecture implies that a Haar random set $\mathcal{S}\subset U(d)$ satisfies the spectral gap conjecture with the probability $1$.</description>

      <title>Growth factors of orthogonal matrices and local behavior of Gaussian elimination with partial and complete pivoting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian elimination (GE) is the most used dense linear solver. Error analysis of GE with selected pivoting strategies on well-conditioned systems can focus on studying the behavior of growth factors. Although exponential growth is possible with GE with partial pivoting (GEPP), growth tends to stay much smaller in practice. Support for this behavior was provided recently by Huang and Tikhomirov's average-case analysis of GEPP, which showed GEPP growth factors for Gaussian matrices stay at most polynomial with very high probability. GE with complete pivoting (GECP) has also seen a lot of recent interest, with improvements to both lower and upper bounds on worst-case GECP growth provided by Bisain, Edelman and Urschel in 2023. We are interested in studying how GEPP and GECP behave on the same linear systems as well as studying large growth on particular subclasses of matrices, including orthogonal matrices. Moreover, as a means to better address the question of why large growth is rarely encountered, we further study matrices with a large difference in growth between using GEPP and GECP, and we explore how the smaller growth strategy dominates behavior in a small neighborhood of the initial matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A(\ell,n,k)$ denote the number of $\ell$-tuples of commuting permutations of $n$ elements whose permutation action results in exactly $k$ orbits or connected components. We provide a new proof of an explicit formula for $A(\ell,n,k)$ which is essentially due to Bryan and Fulman, in their work on orbifold higher equivariant Euler characteristics. Our proof is self-contained, elementary, and relies on the construction of an explicit bijection, in order to perform the $\ell+1\rightarrow \ell$ reduction. We also investigate a conjecture by the first author, regarding the log-concavity of $A(\ell,n,k)$ with respect to $k$. The conjecture generalizes a previous one by Heim and Neuhauser related to the Nekrasov-Okounkov formula.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to measuring the scope of patent claims based on probabilities obtained from (large) language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10003v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes to measure the scope of a patent claim as the reciprocal of self-information contained in this claim. Self-information is calculated based on a probability of occurrence of the claim, where this probability is obtained from a language model. Grounded in information theory, this approach is based on the assumption that an unlikely concept is more informative than a usual concept, insofar as it is more surprising. In turn, the more surprising the information required to define the claim, the narrower its scope. Seven language models are considered, ranging from simplest models (each word or character has an identical probability) to intermediate models (based on average word or character frequencies), to large language models (LLMs) such as GPT2 and davinci-002. Remarkably, when using the simplest language models to compute the probabilities, the scope becomes proportional to the reciprocal of the number of words or characters involved in the claim, a metric already used in previous works. Application is made to multiple series of patent claims directed to distinct inventions, where each series consists of claims devised to have a gradually decreasing scope. The performance of the language models is then assessed through several ad hoc tests. The LLMs outperform models based on word and character frequencies, which themselves outdo the simplest models based on word or character counts. Interestingly, however, the character count appears to be a more reliable indicator than the word count.</description>

      <title>An $L_{q}(L_{p})$-regularity theory for parabolic equations with integro-differential operators having low intensity kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions to parabolic equations with non-local operators $$ \partial_{t}u(t,x) = \mathcal{L}^{a}u(t,x) + f(t,x), \quad t&gt;0 $$ in $L_{q}(L_{p})$ spaces. Our spatial operator $\mathcal{L}^{a}$ is an integro-differential operator of the form $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d}} \left( u(x+y)-u(x) -\nabla u(x) \cdot y \mathrm{1}_{|y|\leq 1} \right) a(t,y) j_{d}(|y|)dy. $$ Here, $a(t,y)$ is a merely bounded measurable coefficient, and we employed the theory of additive process to handle it. We investigate conditions on $j_{d}(r)$ which yield $L_{q}(L_{p})$-regularity of solutions. Our assumptions on $j_d$ are general so that $j_d(r)$ may be comparable to $r^{-d}\ell(r^{-1})$ for a function $\ell$ which is slowly varying at infinity. For example, we can take $\ell(r)=\log{(1+r^{\alpha})}$ or $\ell(r) = \min{\{r^{\alpha},1\}}$ ($\alpha\in(0,2)$). Indeed, our result covers the operators whose Fourier multiplier $\psi(\xi)$ does not have any scaling condition for $|\xi|\geq 1$. Furthermore, we give some examples of operators, which cannot be covered by previous results where smoothness or scaling conditions on $\psi$ are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we give a combinatorial formula for a certain class of Koornwinder polynomials, also known as Macdonald polynomials of type $\tilde{C}$. In particular, we give a combinatorial formula for the Koornwinder polynomials $K_{\lambda} = K_{\lambda}(z_1,\dots,z_N; a,b,c,d; q,t)$, where $\lambda = (1,\dots,1,0,\dots,0)$. We also give combinatorial formulas for all ``open boundary ASEP polynomials'' $F_{\mu}$, where $\mu$ is a composition in $\{-1,0,1\}^N$; these polynomials are related to the nonsymmetric Koornwinder polynomials $E_{\mu}$ up to a triangular change of basis. Our formulas are in terms of rhombic staircase tableaux, certain tableaux that we introduced in previous work to give a formula for the stationary distribution of the two-species asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on a line with open boundaries.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diameter of the Cayley graph of the Rubik's Cube group is the fewest number of turns needed to solve the Cube from any initial configurations. For the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube, the diameter is 11 in the half-turn metric, 14 in the quarter-turn metric, 19 in the semi-quarter-turn metric, and 10 in the bi-quarter-turn metric. For the 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cube, the diameter was determined by Rikicki et al. to be 20 in the half-turn metric and 26 in the quarter-turn metric. This study shows that a modified version of the coupon collector's problem in probabilistic theory can predict the diameters correctly for both 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes insofar as the quarter-turn metric is adopted. In the half-turn metric, the diameters are overestimated by one and two, respectively, for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes, whereas for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube in the semi-quarter-turn and bi-quarter-turn metrics, they are overestimated by two and underestimated by one, respectively. Invoking the same probabilistic logic, the diameters of the 4$\times$4$\times$4 and 5$\times$5$\times$5 Cubes are predicted to be 48 (41) and 68 (58) in the quarter-turn (half-turn) metric, whose precise determinations are far beyond reach of classical supercomputing. It is shown that the probabilistically estimated diameter is approximated by $\ln N / \ln r + \ln N / r$, where $N$ is the number of configurations and $r$ is the branching ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-term dynamics of particles involved in an incompressible flow with a small viscosity ($\epsilon&gt;0$) and slow chemical reactions, is depicted by a class of stochastic reaction-diffusion-advection (RDA) equations with a fast advection term of magnitude $1/\epsilon$. It has been shown in [7] the fast advection asymptotics of stochastic RDA equation in $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be characterized through a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) on the graph associated with certain Hamiltonian. To simulate such fast advection asymptotics, we introduce and study an asymptotic-preserving (AP) exponential Euler approximation for the multiscale stochastic RDA equation. There are three key ingredients in proving asymptotic-preserving property of the proposed approximation. First, a strong error estimate, which depends on $1/\epsilon$ linearly, is obtained via a variational argument. Second, we prove the consistency of exponential Euler approximations on the fast advection asymptotics between the original problem and the SPDE on graph. Last, a graph weighted space is introduced to quantify the approximation error for SPDE on graph, which avoids the possible singularity near the vertices. Numerical experiments are carried out to support the theoretical results.</description>
