      <title>Quantum Geometric Injection and Shift Optical Forces Drive Coherent Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify {\em injection} and {\em shift} rectified Raman forces, which are phononic counterparts of the photogalvanic effect, that drive lattice vibrations and trigger transient emergent properties. These forces are governed by the {\em quantum geometric tensor}, a {\em phononic shift vector}, and interband asymmetries in the electron-phonon coupling. The injection force acts displacively, while -- unlike conventional impulsive mechanisms -- the shift force emerges impulsively in the resonant interband absorbing regime when time-reversal symmetry is broken. Using the bilayer Haldane model, we quantify the injection and shift forces acting on interlayer shear phonons through both analytical and numerical methods. Strikingly, we reveal strong tunability, both in magnitude and direction, of the rectified forces by varying the driving frequency and magnetic flux, uncovering a distinct quantum geometric mechanism for ultrafast and coherent manipulation of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Higher Chern bands in helical homotrilayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose helically twisted homotrilayer transition metal dichalcogenides as a platform for realizing correlated topological phases of matter with higher and tunable Chern numbers. We show that a clear separation of scales emerges for small twist angles, allowing us to derive a low-energy continuum model that captures the physics within moir\'e-scale domains. We identify regimes of twist angle and displacement field for which the highest-lying hole band is isolated from other bands and is topological with $K$-valley Chern number $C=-2$. We demonstrate that varying the displacement field can induce a transition from $C=-2$ to $C=-1$, as well as from a topologically trivial band to a $C=-1$ band. We derive an effective tight-binding description for a high-symmetry stacking domain which is valid for a wide range of twist angles, and we show that the $C=-2$ band can remain stable at filling fraction $\nu=-1$ in the presence of interactions in Hartree-Fock calculations.</description>

      <title>Extending exciton and trion lifetimes in MoSe$_{2}$ with a nanoscale plasmonic cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have extremely short, picosecond-scale lifetimes which hinders exciton thermalization, limits the emergence of collective coherence, and reduces exciton transport in optoelectronic devices. In this work, we explore an all-optical pathway to extend exciton lifetimes by placing MoSe$_2$ in a deep-subwavelength Fabry-Perot silver cavity. The cavity structure is designed to suppress radiative recombination from in-plane optical dipoles, such as bright excitons and trions. We observe a consistent decrease in photoluminescence (PL) linewidths of excitons and trions (~1 nm), along with a corresponding lifetime increase (~10 ps). We confirm the experimental observations arise purely from exciton-cavity interactions-etching back the top silver layer returns the PL linewidth and lifetimes return to their original values. Our study offers a pathway to engineer excited state lifetimes in 2D materials which can be utilized for studies of optically dark excitons and have potential applications for novel optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Multipole order in two-dimensional altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the magnetic-multipole orders in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets, focusing on two representative models: a generic minimal three-site model, and a four-site model representative of monolayer FeSe. We construct low-energy effective Hamiltonians for both systems and calculate their respective multipole indicators to characterize the underlying magnetic order. Our analysis reveals an intriguing contrast between the two systems. We find that the generic minimal model exhibits the expected non-zero magnetic-octupole order. In the monolayer-FeSe model, however, the magnetic-octupole order vanishes globally, and a magnetic-hexadecapole order is present instead. The emergence of altermagnetic splitting in the band structure then arises via the interplay with a sublattice-isospin degree of freedom. Our work demonstrates how the classification and comprehensive understanding of 2D altermagnetic materials transcends bulk descriptions.</description>

      <title>Topological Layer-Spin Filter in Screw Dislocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the quantum spin Hall effect leverages two-dimensional topological states to manipulate spin without dissipation, layertonics extends this paradigm to three dimension by enabling control over the layer degree of freedom. Topological materials incorporating screw dislocations exhibit the capability for simultaneous manipulation of both electronic spin and layer degrees of freedom. In this work, the electronic transport properties of a multilayer Kane-Mele model with screw dislocations is studied theoretically. Numerical simulations of a screw dislocation reveal that dissipationless quantum spin Hall edge states propagate not only at the outer boundaries of the structure but also along the screw dislocation itself, working as layer-spin filter. In detail, 1) the spin-up and spin-down carriers starting from the same source layer flow to different drain layers along the topological channels, respectively. 2) The spin of carriers flowing into a given drain layer is determined by the input source layer. Moreover, we found that the transmission coefficient and spin polarization remain robust against Anderson disorder. Under magnetic disorder, spin flip and backscattering occur, suppressing the transmission coefficient while maintaining nearly unchanged spin polarization. Finally, the layer- and spin-resolved transport properties in a device with two screw dislocations are investigated as well. We have developed an innovative methodology to modulate electron transport with simultaneous layer and spin resolution.</description>

      <title>Dislocation-Driven Nucleation Type Switching Across Repeated Ultrafast Magnetostructural Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling magnetic order on ultrafast timescales, driven by spintronic and recording applications, is one of the main directions of current research in magnetism. Despite major advances in understanding the temporal evolution of magnetic order upon its emergence or quenching, experimental demonstration of the local link between microstructure and dynamic nucleation is missing. Here, taking advantage of the high structural and magnetic resolution of in situ transmission electron microscopy, we observe that cumulative laser irradiation significantly alters the nucleation pathway of the first-order antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition of FeRh thin films, causing the transition to switch from homogeneous to heterogeneous nucleation. This leads to a decrease of 20 K in transition temperature and the emergence of sub-micron magnetic vortices as preferential nucleation motifs. These vortices are pinned in the film by underlying dislocation networks. We observe that the dislocation networks are formed and rearranged upon repeated crossing of the phase transition using femtosecond and picosecond laser pulses. Our results establish a direct link between defect formation, nucleation energetics, and the microscopic morphology of the nucleated ferromagnetic phase, with broad implications for ultrafast stroboscopic experiments and defect-mediated phase transitions in functional materials.</description>

      <title>Quasicrystalline Altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a recently discovered class of magnetic materials that combine a collinear, zero-magnetization spin structure, characteristic of antiferromagnets, with spin-split electronic bands, a hallmark of ferromagnets. This unique behavior arises from the breaking of combined time-reversal and spatial symmetries (such as inversion or lattice translation), which are preserved in conventional antiferromagnets. To date, research has focused on altermagnetic phases in periodic crystals, where the order is linked to specific crystallographic rotation symmetries. In this work, we demonstrate that quasicrystals, which possess rotational symmetries forbidden in periodic lattices, can host exotic altermagnetic orders. Using symmetry analysis and self-consistent mean-field theory, we predict stable $g$-wave and $i$-wave altermagnetism in octagonal and dodecagonal quasicrystals, respectively. These novel phases are characterized by global $C_8T$ and $C_{12}T$ symmetries and manifest as unique anisotropic spin-splittings in their spectral functions and spin conductance, featuring characteristic eight- and twelve-fold nodal structures that serve as unambiguous experimental fingerprints. Our findings establish quasicrystals as a versatile platform for realizing unconventional altermagnetic orders beyond the constraints of crystallographic symmetry.</description>

      <title>Local Hall Conductivity in Disordered Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the expression for the local Hall conductivity for systems that lack translation symmetry and use it to study the local fluctuations of the Hall signal around disordered patches in magnetic insulators. We find that the regime in parameter space over which the system is a Chern insulating state increases upon inclusion of non-magnetic potential disorder. In addition, the phase space over which the topological Anderson insulator exists can be enhanced by breaking up a single disordered patch into multiple smaller patches with the same total amount of disorder. We expect our results will motivate the next generation of local scanning and local impedance spectroscopy experiments to visualize Hall currents around patches in the bulk of a disordered topological insulator.</description>

      <title>Symmetry driven spin anisotropic magnetotransport in quantum spin Hall insulator WTe2 1T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive magnetotransport analysis of monolayer 1T WTe2, highlighting the role of nonsymmorphic symmetries in governing edge-state spin behavior. By comparing the electronic transmission in nanoribbons with edges along the crystallographic y and x directions, our analysis reveals a pronounced anisotropy in the magnetic field response. The y-edge ribbon exhibits significant spin splitting of edge-state bands in both energy and momentum space, along with a strong angular dependence of the conductance. The observed magnetotransport response indicates a spin quantization axis that aligns with the out-of-plane spin quantization axis reported in previous experimental studies. In contrast, the x edge ribbon shows negligible spin splitting under magnetic fields, which is attributed to nonsymmorphic symmetries such as glide mirror and screw rotation, that protects degeneracies along the Gamma X direction, even when time-reversal symmetry is broken. The energy-resolved current density and angular transmission analyses confirm that this anisotropy originates from edge states, while bulk states remain largely insensitive to the field orientation. Our results establish direct transport-spectroscopy based evidence of nonsymmorphic-symmetry-protected spin degeneracy in the 1T WTe2, and underscores its promise for spintronic devices that leverage symmetry-protected and directionally selective transport channels.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast coherent magnon spin currents in antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating coherent magnon spin currents with the highest frequencies and shortest wavelengths is a key challenge in ultrafast spintronics and magnonics. A promising route is to excite counter-propagating magnon pairs. In antiferromagnets, such pairs can be accessed in the ultrafast regime, where coherent dynamics are dominated by magnons at the edge of the Brillouin zone. However, it has seemed impossible to generate a net spin current from coherent magnon pairs. Here we show that a coherent superposition of multiple magnon-pair modes can produce such a current in parity-time symmetric antiferromagnets. The ultrafast coherent spin currents are excited with linearly polarized light, with the light polarization steering the current direction. Finally, by superposing two orthogonal spin currents, circular spin currents can be generated, which have not been discussed for steady-state currents.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from dual-surface carriers in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic rhombohedral graphene hosts an unusual low-energy electronic wavefunction, predominantly localized at its outer crystal faces with negligible presence in the bulk. Increasing the number of graphene layers amplifies the density of states near charge neutrality, greatly enhancing the susceptibility to symmetry-breaking phases. Here, we report superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene arising from an unusual charge-delocalized semimetallic normal state, characterized by coexisting valence- and conduction-band Fermi pockets split to opposite crystal surfaces. In octalayer graphene, the superconductivity appears in five apparently distinct pockets for each sign of an external electric displacement field ($D$). In a moir\'e superlattice sample where heptalayer graphene is aligned on one side to hexagonal boron nitride, two pockets of superconductivity emerge from a single sharp resistive feature. At higher $D$ the same resistive feature additionally induces an $h/e^{2}$-quantized anomalous Hall state at dopings near one electron per moir\'e unit cell. Our findings reveal a novel superconducting regime in multilayer graphene and create opportunities for coupling to nearby topological states.</description>

      <title>Proximity-induced flat bands and topological properties in a decorated diamond chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present study, we propose a unique scheme to generate and control multiple flat bands in a decorated diamond chain by using a strain-induced proximity effect between the diagonal sites of each diamond plaquette. This is in complete contrast to the conventional diamond chain, in which the interplay between the lattice topology and an external magnetic flux leads to an extreme localization of the single-particle states, producing the flat bands in the energy spectrum. Such a strain-induced proximity effect will enable us to systematically control one of the diagonal hoppings in the decorated diamond chain, which will lead to the formation of both gapless and gapped flat bands in the energy spectrum. These gapless or gapped flat bands have been corroborated by the computation of the compact localized states amplitude distribution as well as the density of states of the system using a real space calculation. We have also shown that these flat bands are robust against the introduction of small amounts of random onsite disorder in the system. In addition to this, we have also classified the nontrivial topological properties of the system by calculating the winding numbers and edge states for the gapped energy spectrum. These findings could be easily realized experimentally using the laser-induced photonic lattice platforms.</description>

      <title>Sb2S3 and GaAs Absorber Layer-based Quantum Dot Solar Cells with Cadmium Telluride-based HTL: A Comparative Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum dot solar cells (QDSC) are widely acknowledged to be one of the best solar energy harvesting devices in the present world. Absorber layer is a core component of a QDSC with a strong influence on its operational efficiency. Hence, we choose to undertake a comparative study of two QDSC having different QD absorber layers: Sb2S3 and GaAs with the motive to identify the better absorber layer material. The numerical analysis has been carried out using SCAPS-1D (Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator-1D). The structure of the QDSCs under study are: FTO/TiO2/CdS/Sb2S3/CuI/C and FTO/TiO2/CdS/GaAs/CuI/C. Critical parameters, including temperature, back contact work function, series and shunt resistances, were meticulously adjusted in the simulations, demonstrating that the maximum efficiency attained by Sb2S3 and GaAs absorber layer based QDSC is 15.94% and 26.95% respectively indicating GaAs-QD to be a better absorber layer material for a QDSC.</description>

      <title>Out-of-plane ferroelectricity, magnetoelectric coupling and persistent spin texture in two-dimensional multiferroics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two dimensional multiferroics with out of plane ferroelectricity hold significant promise for miniaturized magnetoelectric spin-orbit transistors, yet systems combining robust ferroelectricity and strong magnetoelectric coupling are exceedingly rare. Here, we demonstrate that epitaxial strain stabilizes out of plane ferroelectricity in exfoliated two dimensional Ruddlesden Popper derivatives. The hybrid improper ferroelectric Pc phase transitions to a competing P21 phase with purely in plane polarization upon switching, accompanied by a 90 degree rotation of weak ferromagnetism. Crucially, the Pc phase exhibits altermagnetism, while P21 displays full Brillouin zone band splitting, with persistent spin textures rotating 90 degree at the phase boundary. This work establishes a pathway to engineer two dimensional multiferroics that integrate vertical polarization, magnetoelectric coupling, and switchable spin textures, key features for next generation spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic Kagome semimetals have attracted tremendous attentions for their potential application in antiferromagnetic topological spintronics. Effectively manipulating Kagome antiferromagnetic states could reveal abundant physical phenomena induced from quantum interactions between topology, spin, and correlation. Here, we achieved tunable spin textures of FeSn thin films via introducing interfacial Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction from heavy-metal Pt overlayer. With increasing FeSn thickness, the variable spin textures result in gradual change in Hall resistivity and magnetoresistance. Importantly, an unconventional damped oscillatory-like behavior of magnetoresistance at relatively low magnetic field can be observed in thin FeSn-Pt samples. This oscillatory like magnetoresistance feature was confirmed to be related to the special topological spin textures revealed by magnetic force microscopy measurements. The formation of rich variety of topological spin textures in association with exotic magneto-transport properties in antiferromagnetic Kagome FeSn heterostructures offers new perspectives for understanding the novel emergent phenomena in Kagome antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Observation of period doubling and higher multiplicities in a driven single-spin system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the prime features of quantum systems strongly driven by external time-periodic fields is the subharmonic response with integer multiples of the drive period $k\, T_d$. Here we demonstrate experimentally based on a careful theoretical analysis period doubling and higher multiplicities ($k=2,\ldots 5$) for one of the most fundamental systems, namely, an individual spin-$1/2$. Realized as a nitrogen vacancy center in diamond, the particular coherence properties under ambient conditions, strong field sensitivity, and optical addressability allow to monitor coherent $k$-tupling oscillations over a broad set of driving parameters in the vicinity of the ideal manifolds. We verify an enhanced sensitivity within this domain which provides new means for improved sensing protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-memristors are a class of materials that can store memories through the control of spins, potentially leading to novel technologies that address the constraints of standard silicon electronics, thereby facilitating the advancement of more intelligent and energy-efficient computing systems. In this work, we present a spin-memristor based on antiferromagnetic materials that exhibit Hall-memresistance. Moreover, the nonlinear Edelstein effect acts as both a writer and eraser of memory registers. We provide a generic symmetry-based analysis that supports the viability of the effect. To achieve a concrete realization of these ideas, we focus on CuMnAs, which has been shown to have a controllable nonlinear Hall effect. Our results extend the two-terminal spin-memristor setting, which is customarily the standard type of device in this context, to a four-terminal device.</description>

      <title>Efficient $GW$ band structure calculations using Gaussian basis functions and application to atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a $GW$ space-time algorithm for periodic systems in a Gaussian basis including spin-orbit coupling. We employ lattice summation to compute the irreducible density response and the self-energy, while we employ $k$-point sampling for computing the screened Coulomb interaction. Our algorithm enables accurate and computationally efficient quasiparticle band structure calculations for atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides. For monolayer MoS$_\text{2}$, MoSe$_\text{2}$, WS$_\text{2}$, and WSe$_\text{2}$, computed $GW$ band gaps agree on average within 50~meV with plane-wave-based reference calculations. $G_0W_0$ band structures are obtained in less than two days on a laptop (Intel i5, 192 GB RAM) or in less than 30 minutes using 1024 cores. Overall, our work provides an efficient and scalable framework for $GW$ calculations on atomically thin materials.</description>

      <title>Toda lattice formed in nonequilibrium steady states of SWCNT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Toda lattice or FPUT chain-like dynamics have been regarded as the prerequisite condition to explain the length dependency of high thermal conductivity of low-dimensional systems at the nanoscale. In this paper, a hypothetical condition is introduced that establishes a theoretical connection between the thermal conductivity of a nanoscale low-dimensional system in nonequilibrium steady states(NESS) and the canonical motion of the equation in the Toda lattice in equilibrium. The hypothesis relies on a numerically driven coarse grained molecular dynamics system acquired from the trajectory data of nonequilibrium molecular dynamics(NEMD) simulation. It models the macroscopic motion from longitudinal and flexural modulation observed in NEMD as a separate Hamiltonian in CGMD with a perturbation term governed by an overdamping process, which is assumed to be dominant during heat transfer. The Smoluchowski equation for the perturbation, which is derived from the cross correlated states between two degrees of freedom, suggests that the potential energy function induced from NESS is identical to that of Toda Lattice under the specific condition in the partition function for CG particles. The restrictions derived from the model are well confirmed by the data from the numerically driven CG model.</description>

      <title>Far-field directionality control of coupled InP nanowire lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanowire (NW) lasers hold great promise as compact, coherent on-chip light sources that are crucial for next-generation optical communication and imaging technologies. However, controlling their emission directionality has been hindered by the complexities of lasing mode engineering and fabrication. Here, we demonstrate spatially-engineered far-field emission from vertically emitting InP NW lasers by establishing precise control over the optical coupling between site-selective NWs, without relying on post-epitaxy transfer and alignment processes. Leveraging this process capability, we design and grow NW pairs and triplets that lase in the TE01 waveguide mode. We then demonstrate the ability to modify their far-field emission profiles from the signature doughnut-like emission to a double-lobed emission profile by changing their optical coupling gap, evidenced by closely matching simulation and experimental profiles. Moreover, through numerical simulations, we show further enhancement in the far-field directionality by arranging the NW laser pairs in a periodic array, demonstrating the feasibility of a directional lasing metasurface. Our results provide a foundation for efficient integration of coherent light generation and beam steering in on-chip light sources.</description>

      <title>Low-power switching of memristors exhibiting fractional-order dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this conference contribution, we present some initial results on switching memristive devices exhibiting fractional-order behavior using current pulses. In our model, it is assumed that the evolution of a state variable follows a fractional-order differential equation involving a Caputo-type derivative. A study of Joule losses demonstrates that the best switching strategy minimizing these losses depends on the fractional derivative's order and the power exponent in the equation of motion. It is found that when the order of the fractional derivative exceeds half of the power exponent, the best approach is to employ a wide pulse. Conversely, when this condition is not met, Joule losses are minimized by applying a zero current followed by a narrow current pulse of the highest allowable amplitude. These findings are explored further in the context of multi-pulse control. Our research lays the foundation for the advancement of the next generation of energy-efficient neuromorphic computing architectures that more closely mimic their biological counterparts.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of ionic currents in dilute electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the exponentially rare fluctuations of the ionic current for a dilute electrolyte by means of macroscopic fluctuation theory. We consider the fluctuating hydrodynamics of a fluid electrolyte described by a stochastic Poisson-Nernst-Planck equation. We derive the Euler-Lagrange equations that dictate the optimal concentration profiles of ions conditioned on exhibiting a given current, whose form determines the likelihood of that current in the long-time limit. For a symmetric electrolyte under small applied voltages, number density fluctuations are small, and ionic current fluctuations are Gaussian with a variance determined by the Nernst-Einstein conductivity. Under large applied potentials, where number densities vary, the ionic current distribution is generically non-Gaussian. Its structure is constrained thermodynamically by Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry and the thermodynamic uncertainty principle.</description>

Abstract: How much current does a sliding electron crystal carry? The answer to this simple question has important implications for the dynamic properties of the crystal, such as the frequency of its cyclotron motion, and its phonon spectrum. In this work we introduce a precise definition of a sliding crystal and compute the corresponding current $\mathbf{j}_c$ for topological electron crystals in the presence of magnetic field. Our result is fully non-perturbative, does not rely on Galilean invariance, and applies equally to Wigner crystals and (anomalous) Hall crystals. In terms of the electron density $\rho$ and magnetic flux density $\phi$, we find that $\mathbf{j}_c = e(\rho-C\phi)\mathbf{v}$. Surprisingly, the current receives a contribution from the many-body Chern number $C$ of the crystal. When $\rho = C\phi$, sliding crystals therefore carry zero current. The crystalline current fixes the Lorentz force felt by the sliding crystal and the dispersion of low-energy phonons of such crystals. This gives us a simple counting rule for the number of gapless phonons: if a sliding crystal carries nonzero current in a magnetic field, there is a single gapless mode, while otherwise there are two gapless modes. This result can also be understood from anomaly-matching of emanant discrete translation symmetries -- an idea that is also applicable to the dispersion of skyrmion crystals. Our results lead to novel experimental implications and invite further conceptual developments for electron crystals.</description>

      <title>Pauli spin blockade at room temperature in double-quantum-dot tunneling through individual deep dopants in silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pauli spin blockade (PSB) is a spin-dependent charge transport process that typically appears in double quantum dot (QD) devices and is employed in fundamental research on single spins in nanostructures to read out semiconductor qubits. The operating temperature of PSB is limited by that of the QDs and remains below 10 K, limiting wide application development. Herein, we confirm that a single deep dopant in the channel of a silicon field effect transistor functions as a room-temperature QD; consequently, transport through two different deep dopants exhibits PSB up to room temperature. The characteristic magnetoconductance provides a means to identify PSB and enables the PSB device to function as a magnetic sensor with a sensitivity below geomagnetic field. Lifting in PSB caused by magnetic resonance (50 K) and Rabi oscillations (10 K) are also observed. Further development of this unique system may lead to room-temperature quantum technologies based on silicon technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-dimensional Coulomb drag has been an essential tool to probe the physics of interacting Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids. To date, most experimental work has focused on the linear regime while the predictions for Luttinger liquids beyond the linear response theory remain largely untested. In this letter, we report measurements of momentum transfer induced Coulomb drag between vertically-coupled quasi-one-dimensional quantum wires in the nonlinear regime. Measurements were performed at ultra-low temperatures between wires only 15 nm apart. Our results reveal a nonlinear dependence of the drag voltage as a function of the drive current superimposed with an oscillatory contribution, in agreement with theoretical predictions for Coulomb drag between Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids. Additionally, the observed current-voltage ($I$-$V$) characteristics exhibit a nonmonotonic temperature dependence, further corroborating the presence of non-Fermi-liquid behavior in our system. These findings are observed both in the single and in the multiple subband regimes and in the presence of disorder, extending the onset of this behavior beyond the clean single channel Tomonaga-Luttinger regime where the predictions were originally formulated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the complex frequency fingerprint (CFF), an experimentally accessible method for detecting the complex frequency Green's function (GF). Unlike the real frequency GF, where $\omega$ is real, this complex frequency GF is shown to play a necessary role in both non-Hermitian and quantum many-body systems. For non-Hermitian systems, we will prove that our method detects complex energy spectra, eigenstates, and complex frequency GFs throughout the complex plane, providing necessary identification of the non-Hermitian skin effect. For quantum many-body systems, our method reveals quasiparticle peaks across the complex plane and intuitively illustrates interaction effects. This information is difficult to obtain with real frequency detection. Our method paves the way for exploring exotic phenomena in both non-Hermitian and quantum many-body systems, bridging theory and experiment across diverse physical areas.</description>

Abstract: We address weak-coupling frictional sliding with phononic dissipation by means of analytic many-body techniques.
  Our model consists of a particle (the "slider") moving through a two- or three-dimensional crystal and interacting weakly with its atoms, and therefore exciting phonons.
  By means of linear-response theory we obtain explicit expressions for the friction force slowing down the slider as a function of its speed, and compare them to the friction obtained by simulations, demonstrating a remarkable accord.</description>

      <title>Circular currents in a magnetic ring with zero net magnetization in presence of a side-coupled one-dimensional chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate persistent charge and spin currents in a magnetic quantum ring threaded by an Aharonov-Bohm flux, in the presence of a side-coupled one-dimensional non-magnetic chain. The neighboring magnetic moments in the ring are arranged in an antiparallel configuration. In the absence of the chain, the spin circular current vanishes exactly due to the symmetry between the up and down spin sub-Hamiltonians. Modeling the system within a tight-binding framework, we compute the currents using a second-quantized approach. Both charge and spin currents can be selectively tuned by adjusting the ring-chain coupling strength. Temperature plays a crucial role in modulating the currents, and interestingly, we find that they increase significantly with rising temperature--contrary to conventional expectations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the temperature-dependent (4.2 - 300 K) electron transport properties (current-voltage) of photo-switchable two-dimensional arrays of gold nanoparticles (10 nm in diameter) functionalized by azobenzene derivatives. Under UV-light irradiation at 4.2 K, the azobenzene moieties are switched from the trans to cis isomers, leading to an increase of the current. In both conformations, at low temperature (&lt; 77 K) and low voltage (&lt; 1 V) the voltage- and temperature-dependent current behaviors show that electron cotunneling is the dominant transport mechanism. The number of cotunneling events Ncot slightly increases from ca. 1. 4 to 1.7 upon trans-to-cis isomerization of the azobenzenes. The nanoparticle Coulomb charging energy is not significantly modified (ca. 15 meV) by the azobenzene isomerization. This weak increase of Ncot is explained by the modest cis/trans current ratio (&lt; 10) and the limited numbers of nanoparticle-molecule-nanoparticle junctions inserted between the two nanoscale electrodes (&lt; 50 nm apart) connecting the network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments observing femtosecond laser pulse (fsLP) exciting magnons in two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AF) semiconductors -- such as CrSBr, NiPS$_3$, and MnPS$_3$, or their van der Waals heterostructures -- suggest exciton-mediation of such an effect. However, its microscopic details remain obscure, as resonant coupling of magnons, living in the sub-meV energy range, to excitons, living in the \mbox{$\sim 1$ eV} range, can hardly be operative. Here, we develop a quantum transport theory of this effect, in which time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's functions (TDNEF) for electrons driven by fsLP are coupled self-consistently to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation describing classical dynamics of localized magnetic moments (LMMs) within 2D AF semiconductors. This theory explains how fsLP, of central frequency above the semiconductor gap, generates a photocurrent that subsequently exerts spin-transfer torque (STT) onto LMMs as a {\em nonequilibrium spintronic mechanism}. The collective motion of LMMs analyzed by windowed Fast Fourier transform (FFT) decodes frequencies of excited magnons, as well as their lifetime governed by {\em nonlocal} damping with the LLG equation due to, explicitly included via TDNEGF, electronic bath. The TDNEGF part of the loop is also used to include excitons via mean-field treatment, utilizing off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, of Coulomb interaction binding conduction-band electrons and valence-band holes. Finally, our theory predicts how excited magnons will {\em pump} time-dependent charge currents into the attached electrodes, or locally within AF semiconductor that will then emit electromagnetic radiation. The windowed FFT of these signals contains imprints of excited magnons, as well as their interaction with excitons, which could be exploited as a novel probe in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime</title>

Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, $S$-duality, topological invariants, flat bands, and topologically quantized current in the incommensurate regimes. In essence, this work unveils an unexpected link between gravity and gauge fields, opens new avenues for studying analog gravity, e.g., the Unruh effect and universe expansions/contractions, suggests the existence of an $S$-duality of spacetime curvatures, and hints at novel pathways to quantized gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Phase transition in quasi-flat band superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate superconductivity in a two-dimensional material described by a two-band heavy-fermion model, where hybridization between a dispersive band and a flat band introduces a quasi-flat dispersion to the otherwise localized flat-band electrons. The enhanced density of states in the quasi-flat band raises the crossover temperature for an inhomogeneous preformed Cooper pair state. The superconducting phase stiffness and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature are governed by the Fermi surface contribution induced by hybridization. We compute the crossover and BKT temperatures, revealing a dome-like dependence on doping. When the pairing amplitude exceeds the energy width of the quasi-flat band, superconductivity is suppressed, and the inhomogeneous pairing regime expands linearly with increasing interaction strength. However, in the opposite case, the BKT temperature reaches a maximum value that is only numerically less than the energy width of the quasi-flat band. We also discuss our results in the context of superconductivity in graphene-based systems.</description>

      <title>Step-by-step design guide of a cryogenic three-axis vector magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A tunable magnetic field at low temperatures is essential for numerous applications, including spintronics, magnetic resonance imaging, and condensed matter physics. While commercial superconducting vector magnets are available, they are complex, expensive, and often not adaptable to specific experimental needs. As a result, simple in-house designs are often being used in research environments. However, no comprehensive step-by-step guide for their construction currently exists. In this work, we provide a detailed manual for designing and building a cryogenically compatible three-axis vector magnet. The system is tested at the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator at temperatures ranging from 15 mK to 4 K, with no significant increase in base temperature. Safety measures are implemented to mitigate heating from quenching. The coils are successfully driven with DC currents as high as 3 A, generating magnetic fields of up to 2.5 T in the bobbin's bore and 0.4 T at the sample position. Magnetic field measurements using Hall sensors demonstrate good agreement with the predictions of the designed performance.</description>

      <title>Four-terminal Josephson junctions: diode effects, anomalous currents and transverse currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19376v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a multi-terminal Josephson junction consisting of a central spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) region with an in-plane Zeeman field connected to four superconducting terminals. This setup allows for the simultaneous measurement of both longitudinal and transverse Josephson currents in response to a phase bias and provides a platform to probe the planar Hall effect in superconducting transport. We find that the system exhibits anomalous Josephson effect (AJE) and Josephson diode effect (JDE) when the symmetry between opposite momentum modes is broken in SOC region. Specifically, breaking the symmetry between $k_x$ and $-k_x$ results in JDE and AJE in the longitudinal Josephson current, while breaking the symmetry between $k_y$ and $-k_y$ leads to a finite transverse Josephson current that also exhibits JDE and AJE. Transverse Josephson diode effect coefficient attains values as large as $500\%$ for realistic set of parameters. Furthermore, for specific parameter choices, the current-phase relation in the transverse direction supports unidirectional transport, highlighting its potential for superconducting circuit applications. Our setup offers a new route to engineering nonreciprocal superconducting transport.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Memory Effects in the Dynamics of Two-Level System Defect Ensembles Using Broadband, Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-level system (TLS) defects in dielectrics are a major source of decoherence in superconducting circuits, yet their atomistic origin, frequency distribution, and dipole moments remain poorly understood. Current probes, which are predominantly based on qubits or resonators, require complex fabrication and only measure defects within a narrow frequency band and limited mode volume, hindering direct insight into TLS defect behaviour in isolated materials and interfaces. Here, we introduce a broadband 3D waveguide spectroscopy technique that enables cryogenic probing of ensembles of TLS defects that we call Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS). Complementary to the dielectric dipper method, this approach probes a broader spectrum and reveals interference of drive-induced sidebands of the ensembles of TLS defects. The broadband and power-tunable nature of BCTDS makes it especially well-suited to the study of dressed-state physics in driven ensembles of TLS defects, including multi-photon processes and sideband-resolved dynamics. Additionally, BCTDS enables the identification of eigenmode frequencies of the undriven ensembles of TLS defects through characteristic V-shaped features obtained via Fourier analysis of time-domain signals, and shows evidence of memory effects arising from interactions and the broadband nature of our approach. Crucially, our method is modular and can be applied throughout the device fabrication process, informing mitigation strategies and advancing the design of low-loss materials with broad implications for quantum technologies and materials science.</description>

      <title>Berry Monopole Scattering in the Synthetic Momentum Space of a Bilayer Photonic Crystal Slab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Berry monopoles-quantized sources of Berry curvature-are fundamental to topological phases, yet their scattering remains unexplored. Here, we report for the first time the adiabatic scattering of Berry monopoles in a bilayer photonic crystal slab combining one genuine and one synthetic momentum. Two monopoles approach, collide, and scatter within this hybrid parameter space. The process is described by an effective coupled-mode model and confirmed by full-wave simulations. We further propose an experimental scheme using chiral edge states, opening a route to probe monopole interactions in synthetic photonic systems.</description>
