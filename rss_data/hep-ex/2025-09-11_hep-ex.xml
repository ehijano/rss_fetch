      <title>Constraining Effective Field Theories for dark matter candidates annihilating into gamma-ray lines with CTAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray lines constitute a smoking gun signature for annihilating dark matter particles. Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes and satellites have searched for such signals but null results have been reported thus far. We take advantage of the expected gamma-ray flux sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) toward the direction of the Galactic Centre and Dwarf Galaxies and its exquisite energy resolution to derive upper limits on fermionic and scalar dark matter annihilations into gamma-ray lines. We consider the lowest-order effective operators for scalar and fermion dark matter, and derive limits on the energy scale using the recent CTAO projected sensitivity. Putting our findings into perspective with existing limits from direct and indirect detection experiments, we conclude that CTAO will either play a complementary role or be a discovery channel for dark matter signals.</description>

      <title>Flavor physics at high-energy muon colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flavor-breaking interactions due to heavy new physics can be probed at a 10 TeV muon collider in the high-energy production of quarks and leptons. The high collision energy mitigates the suppression of the new interactions, offering sensitivity to interaction scales well above 100 TeV both in the lepton and in the quark sector. We investigate all possible deformations of the Standard Model that produce quadratic growth with energy of the four-fermion scattering amplitudes at the muon collider, and we derive sensitivity projections. Electroweak radiation emission gives access to new observable final states like for instance the production of a charged pair of fermions by the emission of at least one $W$ boson. This, combined with jet flavor tagging, improves the sensitivity and the ability to disentangle different interactions. Currently, the best probes of flavor-breaking new physics are high-intensity low-energy measurements of lepton or hadron decays or oscillations. The high-energy probes of the same interactions at the muon collider are often competitive with current bounds and strongly superior for some class of transitions. The sensitivity extends to operators involving the top quark that cannot be tested at low energy. In addition, muon collider probes are generically less exposed to experimental or theoretical mismodeling uncertainties as they do not target the observation of extremely rare phenomena, nor they rely on extremely accurate measurements and theoretical predictions: the energy enhancement makes the putative effects relatively easy to observe. Muon collider measurements offer a novel pathway towards the exploration of flavor physics at the energy rather than at the intensity frontier.</description>

      <title>Spatial resolution studies with the BabyIAXO Micromegas prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial resolution of the Micromegas prototype developed for the BabyIAXO experiment was evaluated using a low-energy X-ray beam at the SOLEIL synchrotron facility. BabyIAXO, currently under construction, aims to search for hypothetical solar axions. A key component of the experiment is a low-background X-ray detector with high efficiency in the 1-10 keV energy range and stringent background rejection capabilities. Achieving a spatial resolution on the order of, or better than, 1 mm is critical for accurately reconstructing signal shapes and positions, and for effectively discriminating between signal and background events. Therefore, a precise characterization of the detector's spatial resolution is essential to validate its suitability for the experiment. This study involved scanning the IAXO-D1 Micromegas detector under various beam energies, positions, and drift field configurations to evaluate their influence on spatial resolution. A resolution of approximately 100 $\mu$m at 6 keV was achieved, confirming the strong potential of this technology for application in the final BabyIAXO setup.</description>

      <title>Simplified Analytical Models for Temperature-Dependent Characteristics of Ultra-Fast Avalanche Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-fast detectors have advanced the time resolution of semiconductor sensors to tens of picoseconds, while avalanche-type detectors, with internal gain, enable the detection of weak signals. In this work, we investigate the temperature dependence of ultra-fast avalanche detectors. Building on semiconductor theory and some empirical formulations, we establish a set of models to characterize key electrical properties and performance metrics such as gain and time resolution, and validate them through dedicated experiments. The results show good agreement between model predictions and experimental data, demonstrating the validity of the proposed models. This approach provides an efficient and physics-based method for rapid detector optimization and design.</description>

      <title>Adapting Vision-Language Models for Neutrino Event Classification in High-Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08461v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa 3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events. Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance, interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.</description>

      <title>Agents of Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The substantial data volumes encountered in modern particle physics and other domains of fundamental physics research allow (and require) the use of increasingly complex data analysis tools and workflows. While the use of machine learning (ML) tools for data analysis has recently proliferated, these tools are typically special-purpose algorithms that rely, for example, on encoded physics knowledge to reach optimal performance. In this work, we investigate a new and orthogonal direction: Using recent progress in large language models (LLMs) to create a team of agents -- instances of LLMs with specific subtasks -- that jointly solve data analysis-based research problems in a way similar to how a human researcher might: by creating code to operate standard tools and libraries (including ML systems) and by building on results of previous iterations. If successful, such agent-based systems could be deployed to automate routine analysis components to counteract the increasing complexity of modern tool chains. To investigate the capabilities of current-generation commercial LLMs, we consider the task of anomaly detection via the publicly available and highly-studied LHC Olympics dataset. Several current models by OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5) are investigated and their stability tested. Overall, we observe the capacity of the agent-based system to solve this data analysis problem. The best agent-created solutions mirror the performance of human state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>Enhanced water Cherenkov detector for soil moisture detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work evaluates the ability of a water Cherenkov detector to measure thermal neutrons and explores its application to soil-moisture monitoring. We study a NaCl-doped detector and model its response to (i) monochromatic thermal neutrons and (ii) the natural thermal-neutron flux expected from dry soil at the elevation of Bucaramanga, Colombia. The ambient flux is estimated with the ARTI framework, and the detector response is simulated with MEIGA in Geant4. Doping with NaCl introduces additional capture channels on $^{35,37}\mathrm{Cl}$ and $^{23}\mathrm{Na}$; in particular, $^{35}\mathrm{Cl}$ has a thermal-neutron absorption cross section up to two orders of magnitude larger than hydrogen, boosting the capture signal. Our results indicate that water Cherenkov detectors can detect thermal neutrons with practical sensitivity under field conditions, enabling their integration into precision agriculture networks for soil moisture sensing. More broadly, this approach extends the cosmic-ray detection range of Cherenkov detectors using non-toxic, low-cost materials.</description>

      <title>Measurement of D$^0$ meson photoproduction in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Letter reports the first measurement of photonuclear D$^0$ meson production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions. The study is performed using lead-lead collision data, with an integrated luminosity of 1.38 nb$^{-1}$, collected by the CMS experiment at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.36 TeV. Photonuclear events, where one of the colliding nuclei breaks up and the other remains intact, are selected based on breakup neutron emissions and by requiring no particle activity in a large rapidity interval in the direction of the photon-emitting nucleus. The D$^0$ mesons are reconstructed via the D$^0$ $\to$ K$^-$$\pi^+$ decay channel, with the cross section measured as a function of D$^0$ meson transverse momentum and rapidity. The results are compared with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations that employ recent parametrizations of the lead nuclear parton distribution functions, as well as with predictions based on the color glass condensate framework. This measurement is the first photonuclear collision study characterizing parton distribution functions of lead nuclei for parton fractional momenta $x$ (relative to the nucleon) ranging approximately from a few 10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-2}$ for different hard energy scale $Q^2$ selections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As part of the upgrade of the Pierre Auger Observatory, known as AugerPrime, the Underground Muon Detector is being installed in the low-energy extension of the Surface Detector, allowing for a direct measurement of the muonic component of air showers produced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with energies between 10^{16.8} and 10^{19} eV. The detector consists of an array of 30 m2 plastic scintillator detectors buried 2.3 m underground near a water-Cherenkov detector. Two modes of operation are implemented to achieve an extended dynamic range: the binary mode, conceived for low muon densities, and the calorimetric mode, designed for high muon densities. In this contribution, we present the current status and improvements in the reconstruction and performance of this component of AugerPrime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A calculation of the two-particle two-hole contribution to the semi-inclusive $(\nu_\mu,\mu^-N)$ cross section on carbon is performed in the framework of the relativistic Fermi gas model. The process is driven by meson-exchange currents encompassing all contributions involving the exchange of a single pion and the excitation of a $\Delta$ resonance. The calculation is validated against the inclusive $(\nu_\mu,\mu^-)$ response functions already existing in the literature, and then extended for the first time to the semi-inclusive channel. Results are presented both at fixed neutrino energy and folded with the T2K neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>A precise measurement of the jet energy scale derived from single-particle measurements and in situ techniques in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The jet energy calibration and its uncertainties are derived from measurements of the calorimeter response to single particles in both data and Monte Carlo simulation using proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV collected with the ATLAS detector during Run 2 at the Large Hadron Collider. The jet calibration uncertainty for anti-k$_t$ jets with a jet radius parameter of $R = 0.4$ and in the central jet rapidity region is about 2.5% for transverse momenta ($p_T$) of 20 GeV, about 0.5% for $p_T = 300$ GeV and 0.7% for $p_T = 4$ TeV. Excellent agreement is found with earlier determinations obtained from $p_T$-balance based in situ methods ($Z/\gamma$+jets). The combination of these two independent methods results in the most precise jet energy measurement achieved so far with the ATLAS detector with a relative uncertainty of 0.3% at $p_T = 300$ GeV and 0.6% at $4$ TeV.
  The jet energy calibration is also derived with the single-particle calorimeter response measurements separately for quark- and gluon-induced jets and furthermore for jets with $R$ varying from 0.2 to 1.0 retaining the correlations between these measurements. Differences between inclusive jets and jets from boosted top-quark decays, with and without grooming the soft jet constituents, are also studied.</description>

Abstract: We present here measurements and characterizations of several dichroic filters, which are being used more commonly in nuclear and particle physics for photon-detection. The measurements were performed on filters immersed in several media: air, water, and LAB-based liquid scintillator. Measurements of transmission and reflection properties were made at various angles of incidence, and the data presented here can be used to develop detailed optical models for detector simulations. We find a modified Bragg's Law is a good model for the shift in transmission edge as a function of angle of incidence, across the various media.</description>

      <title>Benchmarks and applications of the nuclear deexcitation event generator NucDeEx</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron multiplicity is a key observable in recent neutrino experiments that can enhance the sensitivity of various neutrino physics searches. Nuclear deexcitation plays a significant role in neutron emissions associated with neutrino-nucleus interactions; therefore, precise prediction of this process is eessential. To address this need, a general-purpose nuclear deexcitation event generator \textsc{NucDeEx} was developed and released as an open-source package. The treatment of low-lying discrete excited states was updated to better reproduce experimental data. Benchmarks were conducted using existing nuclear deexcitation event generators and experimental data. Application to other simulators, neutrino event generator \textsc{NEUT} and general particle simulation tool \textsc{Geant4}, are also presented.</description>

      <title>RINO: Renormalization Group Invariance with No Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common challenge with supervised machine learning (ML) in high energy physics (HEP) is the reliance on simulations for labeled data, which can often mismodel the underlying collision or detector response. To help mitigate this problem of domain shift, we propose RINO (Renormalization Group Invariance with No Labels), a self-supervised learning approach that can instead pretrain models directly on collision data, learning embeddings invariant to renormalization group flow scales. In this work, we pretrain a transformer-based model on jets originating from quantum chromodynamic (QCD) interactions from the JetClass dataset, emulating real QCD-dominated experimental data, and then finetune on the JetNet dataset -- emulating simulations -- for the task of identifying jets originating from top quark decays. RINO demonstrates improved generalization from the JetNet training data to JetClass data compared to supervised training on JetNet from scratch, demonstrating the potential for RINO pretraining on real collision data followed by fine-tuning on small, high-quality MC datasets, to improve the robustness of ML models in HEP.</description>

      <title>SMEFT effects on gravitational wave spectrum from electroweak phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future gravitational wave observations are potentially sensitive to new physics corrections to the Higgs potential once the first-order electroweak phase transition arises. We study the SMEFT dimension-six operator effects on the Higgs potential, where three types of effects are taken into account: (i) SMEFT tree level effect on $\varphi^6$ operator, (ii) SMEFT tree level effect on the wave function renormalization of the Higgs field, and (iii) SMEFT top-quark one-loop level effect. The sensitivity of future gravitational wave observations to these effects is numerically calculated by performing a Fisher matrix analysis. We find that the future gravitational wave observations can be sensitive to (ii) and (iii) once the first-order electroweak phase transition arises from (i). The dimension-eight $\varphi^8$ operator effects on the first-order electroweak phase transition are also discussed. The sensitivities of the future gravitational wave observations are also compared with those of future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal anisotropies of charged particles with high transverse momentum in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_\text{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A measurement is presented of elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$) azimuthal anisotropy coefficients for charged particles produced in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_\text{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV using a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $0.44$ nb$^{-1}$ collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2018. The values of $v_2$ and $v_3$ are measured for charged particles over a wide range of transverse momentum ($p_\text{T}$), 1-400 GeV, and Pb+Pb collision centrality, 0-60%, using the scalar product and multiparticle cumulant methods. These methods are sensitive to event-by-event fluctuations and nonflow effects in the measurements of azimuthal anisotropies. Positive values of $v_2$ are observed up to a $p_{\text{T}}$ of approximately 100 GeV from both methods across all centrality intervals. Positive values of $v_3$ are observed up to approximately 25 GeV using both methods, though the application of the three-subevent technique to the multiparticle cumulant method leads to significant changes at the highest $p_{\text{T}}$. At high $p_{\text{T}}$ ($p_{\text{T}} \gtrapprox 10$ GeV), charged particles are dominantly from jet fragmentation. These jets, and hence the measurements presented here, are sensitive to the path-length dependence of parton energy loss in the quark-gluon plasma produced in Pb+Pb collisions.</description>

      <title>Quantum tomography beyond the leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum tomography, as a tool to probe foundational aspects of quantum mechanics, relies on extracting spin information from angular distributions. This is inherently a leading-order technique, ill-defined when higher-order corrections are significant. For those cases, we propose to treat higher-order corrections as a background, to be modeled and subtracted from data in the same way as other backgrounds are. We illustrate this procedure for Higgs decays $H \to ZZ \to e^+ e^- \mu^+ \mu^-$, which is of high interest for upcoming qutrit entanglement tests at the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <title>RGE effects on new physics searches via gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13074v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations offer a promising probe of new physics associated with a first-order electroweak phase transition. Precision studies of the Higgs potential, including Fisher matrix analyses, have been extensively conducted in this context. However, significant theoretical uncertainties in the GW spectrum, particularly those due to renormalization scale dependence in the conventional daisy-resummed approach, have cast doubt on the reliability of such precision measurements. These uncertainties have been highlighted using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) as a benchmark. To address these issues, we revisit Fisher matrix analyses based on the daisy-resummed approach, explicitly incorporating renormalization scale uncertainties. We then reassess the prospects for precise new physics measurements using GW observations. Adopting the SMEFT as a benchmark, we study the effects of one-loop RGE running of dimension-six operators on the Higgs effective potential via the Higgs self-couplings, top Yukawa coupling, and gauge couplings, in addition to the SMEFT tree-level effects. We find that future GW observations can remain sensitive to various dimension-six SMEFT effects, even in the presence of renormalization scale uncertainties, provided that the SMEFT $(H^{\dagger}H)^3$ operator is precisely measured, e.g., by future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>$b \to c$ semileptonic sum rule: Extension to angular observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lepton flavor universality is a key prediction of the Standard Model of particle physics and any violation of it immediately indicates the existence of new physics. Given the recent more than $4\sigma$ discrepancy in charged current semileptonic B meson decays and the absence of evident signals at the large hadron collider, independent cross-checks become invaluable. In this context, $b \to c$ semileptonic sum rules based on heavy quark symmetry are interesting since they allow us to check the consistency of experimental results. In this paper, we report newly found sum rules among angular observables of mesonic and baryonic $b\to c l \overline{\nu}$ decays holding exactly in the large mass limit of heavy quarks. Moreover, we investigate corrections to the sum rule in realistic situations and discuss phenomenological implications.</description>

      <title>Toward Axion Signal Extraction in Semiconductor Spin Qubits Via Spectral Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum sensing and computational technologies indicate the possibility of improving the precision of measurements aimed at detecting cosmological particles and weakly interacting massive particles using various qubit platforms. While recent progress has been made, mitigating environmental noise remains a challenge in extracting particle parameters with high fidelity. Addressing these challenges requires efforts on two levels. At the device level, the qubit and its array acting as a probe, must be isolated from electrical and magnetic noise through optimized device geometry. At the signal-processing level, it is necessary to develop filtering methods targeting specific noise spectra based on different qubit architectures. In this work, we explore the possibility of using semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits as a platform to search for quantum chromodynamics axions and, more broadly, axion like particles (ALPs). Starting by deriving an effective Hamiltonian for electron-axion interactions, we identify an axion-induced effective magnetic field and determine the characteristic axion oscillation frequency. To suppress charge noise in the devices and environmental noise, we first analyze the charge noise spectrum and then develop a dedicated filtering and noise-reduction protocol, paving the way for exploring feasible axion mass ranges. Our preliminary study holds promise for enhancing the screening of various axion signals using quantum technologies. We expect that our analysis and filtering protocol can help advance the use of semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit arrays in axion detection.</description>
