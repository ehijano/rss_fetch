      <title>The category of propositional deductive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the category $\mathcal{QM}$ of quantales and their modules and prove the existence of coproducts, and the one of pushout and amalgamated coproducts under certain conditions. Then we define the non-full subcategory $\mathcal{DS}_0$, of propositional deductive systems, show that it is equivalent to the one of ``real'' propositional logics whose morphisms are interpretations (modulo a language translation, when needed), and prove that the coproduct in $\mathcal{DS}_0$ is precisely the deductive system called ``logical coproduct'' in [Russo,2022]. Last, we discuss amalgamation in $\mathcal{DS}_0$.</description>

      <title>Definable Galois theory for bimeromorphic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outlines of a "Galois theory" for bimeromorphic geometry is here developed, via the study of model-theoretic definable binding groups in the theory CCM of compact complex spaces. As an application, a structure theorem about principal meromorphic bundles with algebraic structure group, and admitting no horizontal subvarieties, is deduced. Examples of algebraic groups arising as binding groups are provided, as is a characterisation of when they are linear. Using binding groups in CCM it is shown that, in contrast to the situation in differentially closed fields, there are many algebraic groups which admit nontrivial definable torsors over acl-closed sets in the theory DCCM of existentially closed differential CCM-structures. A self-contained exposition of the binding group theorem in totally transcendental theories, that emphasises the bitorsorial nature of the construction, is also included.</description>

      <title>An extension of Priestley duality to fuzzy topologies and positive MV-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Priestley Duality to suitable categories of fuzzy topological spaces and ordered algebraic structures that generalize bounded distributive lattices. The duality we prove extends not only classical Priestley Duality between Priestley Spaces and bounded distributive lattices, but also the duality between limit cut complete MV-algebras and Stone MV-topological spaces (proved by the second author in a previous paper) which, on its turn, is an extension of classical Stone Duality.</description>

      <title>Polynomial fingerprinting for trees and formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To cater to the needs of (Zero Knowledge) proofs for (mathematical) proofs, we describe a method to transform formal sentences in 2x2 - matrices over multivariate polynomials with integer coefficients, such that usual proof-steps like modus-ponens or the substitution are easy to compute from the matrices corresponding to the terms or formulas used as arguments. By evaluating the polynomial variables in random elements of a suitably chosen finite field, the proof is replaced by a numeric sequence. Only the values corresponding to the axioms have to be computed from scratch. The values corresponding to derived formulas are computed from the values corresponding to their ancestors by applying the homomorphic properties. On such sequences, various Zero Knowledge methods can be applied.</description>

      <title>Convex geometry over ordered hyperfields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of convex geometry over ordered hyperfields. We define convex sets and halfspaces over ordered hyperfields, presenting structure theorems over hyperfields arising as quotients of fields. We prove hyperfield analogues of Helly, Radon and Carath\'eodory theorems. We also show that arbitrary convex sets can be separated via hemispaces. Comparing with classical convexity, we begin classifying hyperfields for which halfspace separation holds. In the process, we demonstrate many properties of ordered hyperfields, including a classification of stringent ordered hyperfields.</description>

      <title>Sequential commutation in tracial von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06392v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recall that a unitary in a tracial von Neumann algebra is Haar if $\tau(u^n)=0$ for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$. We introduce and study a new Borel equivalence relation $\sim_N$ on the set of Haar unitaries in a diffuse tracial von Neumann algebra $N$. Two Haar unitaries $u,v$ in $\mathcal{U}(N)$ are related if there exists a finite path of sequentially commuting Haar unitaries in an ultrapower $N^\mathcal{U}$, beginning at $u$ and ending at $v$. We show that for any diffuse tracial von Neumann algebra $N$, the equivalence relation $\sim_N$ admits either 1 orbit or uncountably many orbits. We characterize property Gamma in terms of path length and number of orbits of $\sim_N$ and also show the existence of non-Gamma II$_1$ factors so that $\sim_N$ admits only 1 orbit. Examples where $\sim_N$ admits uncountably many orbits include $N$ having positive 1-bounded entropy: $h(N)&gt;0$. As a key example, we explicitly describe $\sim_{L(\mathbb{F}_t)}$ for the free group factors. Using these ideas we introduce a numerical invariant for diffuse tracial von Neumann algebras called the commutation diameter, with applications to elementary equivalence classification. We compute lower and upper bounds for the commutation diameter in various examples. Notably we obtain non-trivial lower bounds for the family of arbitrary graph products $N$ of diffuse tracial von Neumann algebras whose underlying graph is connected and has diameter at least 4, and distinguish them up to elementary equivalence from the [CIKE23] exotic factors, despite satisfying $h(N)\leq 0$.</description>

      <title>On computability of equilibrium states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equilibrium states are natural dynamical analogues of Gibbs states in thermodynamic formalism. This paper investigates their computability within the framework of Computable Analysis. We show that the unique equilibrium state for a computable, open, topologically exact, distance-expanding map $T\colon X\rightarrow X$ and a computable H\"older continuous potential $\varphi\colon X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is always computable. As an application, we establish the computability of equilibrium states for computable hyperbolic rational maps and their respective geometric potentials. Moreover, we develop a constructive method to exhibit the non-uniqueness of equilibrium states for some dynamical systems. We also present some computable dynamical systems whose equilibrium states are all non-computable.</description>

      <title>Strict comparison in reduced group $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06031v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every $n\geq 2$, the reduced group $C^*$-algebras of the countable free groups $C^*_r(\mathbb{F}_n)$ have strict comparison. Our method works in a general setting: for $G$ in a large family of non-amenable groups, including hyperbolic groups, free products, mapping class groups, right-angled Artin groups etc., we have $C^*_r(G)$ have strict comparison. This work also has several applications in the theory of $C^*$-algebras including: resolving Leonel Robert's selflessness problem for $C^*_r(G)$; uniqueness of embeddings of the Jiang-Su algebra $\mathcal{Z}$ up to approximate unitary equivalence into $C^*_r(G)$; full computations of the Cuntz semigroup of $C^*_r(G)$ and future directions in the $C^*$-classification program.</description>
