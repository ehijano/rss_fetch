      <title>Flexible heat pumps: must-have or nice to have in a power sector with renewables?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heat pumps are a key technology for reducing fossil fuel use in the heating sector. However, the transition to heat pumps implies an increase in electricity demand, especially in the cold winter months. Therefore, the flexible operation of heat pumps will be of high importance to the power sector. Using an open-source power sector model, we examine the power sector impacts of three different expansion scenarios of decentralized heat pumps in an interconnected Germany until 2030 and the role of buffer heat storage of different sizes. We quantify the required additional investments in renewable energy sources and the effects on firm capacity needs. If wind power expansion potentials are limited, the rollout of heat pumps can also be accompanied by solar PV with little additional costs. The expansion of heat pumps increases the need for firm capacities and battery storage, but even small heat buffer storage with an energy-to-power ratio of two hours can reduce these additional capacities. We further show that increasing the number of heat pumps from 1.7 to 10 million saves around 180 TWh of natural gas and 35 million tonnes of CO2eq emissions per year.</description>

      <title>Prediction of healthcare costs on consumer direct health plan in the Brazilian context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise in healthcare costs has led to the adoption of cost-sharing devices in health plans. This article explores this discussion by simulating Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) to cover medical and hospital expenses, supported by catastrophic insurance. Simulating 10 million lives, we evaluate the utilization of catastrophic insurance and the balances of HSAs at the end of working life. To estimate annual expenditures, a Markov Chains approach - distinct from the usual ones - was used based on recent past expenditures, age range, and gender. The results suggest that HSAs do not create inequalities, offering a viable method to sustain private healthcare financing for the elderly.</description>

      <title>Art-ificial Intelligence: The Effect of AI Disclosure on Evaluations of Creative Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of generative AI technologies, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot, has expanded the scope of tasks that AI tools can accomplish and enabled AI-generated creative content. In this study, we explore how disclosure regarding the use of AI in the creation of creative content affects human evaluation of such content. In a series of pre-registered experimental studies, we show that AI disclosure has no meaningful effect on evaluation either for creative or descriptive short stories, but that AI disclosure has a negative effect on evaluations for emotionally evocative poems written in the first person. We interpret this result to suggest that reactions to AI-generated content may be negative when the content is viewed as distinctly "human." We discuss the implications of this work and outline planned pathways of research to better understand whether and when AI disclosure may affect the evaluation of creative content.</description>
