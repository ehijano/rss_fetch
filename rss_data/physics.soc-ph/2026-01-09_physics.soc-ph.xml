      <title>Where do We Poop? City-Wide Simulation of Defecation Behavior for Wastewater-Based Epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wastewater surveillance, which regularly examines the pathogen biomarkers in wastewater samples, is a valuable tool for monitoring infectious diseases circulating in communities. Yet, most wastewater-based epidemiology methods, which use wastewater surveillance results for disease inferences, implicitly assume that individuals excrete only at their residential locations and that the population contribute to wastewater samples are static. These simplifying assumptions ignore daily mobility, social interactions, and heterogeneous toilet use behavior patterns, which can lead to biased interpretation of wastewater results, especially at upstream sampling locations such as neighborhoods, institutions, or buildings. Here, we introduce an agent-based geospatial simulation framework: Building on an established Patterns of Life model, we simulate daily human activities, mobility, and social contacts within a realistic urban environment and extend this agent-based framework with a physiologically motivated defecation cycle and toilet usage patterns. We couple this behavioral model with an infectious disease model to simulate transmissions through spatial and social interactions. When a defecation occurs for an infected agent, we use a pathogen shedding model to determine the amount of pathogen shed in the feces. Such a framework, integrating population mobility, disease transmission, toilet use behavior, and pathogen shedding models, is capable to simulate the Spatial-temporal dynamics of wastewater signals for a city. Using a case study of 10,000 simulated agents in Fulton County, Georgia, we examine how varying infection rates alter epidemic trajectories, pathogen loads in wastewater, and the spatial distribution of contamination across time.</description>

      <title>Information Theoretic Optimal Surveillance for Epidemic Prevalence in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the true prevalence of an epidemic outbreak is a key public health problem. This is challenging because surveillance is usually resource intensive and biased. In the network setting, prior work on cost sensitive disease surveillance has focused on choosing a subset of individuals (or nodes) to minimize objectives such as probability of outbreak detection. Such methods do not give insights into the outbreak size distribution which, despite being complex and multi-modal, is very useful in public health planning. We introduce TESTPREV, a problem of choosing a subset of nodes which maximizes the mutual information with disease prevalence, which directly provides information about the outbreak size distribution. We show that, under the independent cascade (IC) model, solutions computed by all prior disease surveillance approaches are highly sub-optimal for TESTPREV in general. We also show that TESTPREV is hard to even approximate. While this mutual information objective is computationally challenging for general networks, we show that it can be computed efficiently for various network classes. We present a greedy strategy, called GREEDYMI, that uses estimates of mutual information from cascade simulations and thus can be applied on any network and disease model. We find that GREEDYMI does better than natural baselines in terms of maximizing the mutual information as well as reducing the expected variance in outbreak size, under the IC model.</description>

      <title>Generalization to Political Beliefs from Fine-Tuning on Sports Team Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuned LLMs often exhibit unexpected behavior as a result of generalizing beyond the data they're shown. We present results in which an LLM fine-tuned to prefer either coastal sports teams or Southern sports teams adopt political beliefs that diverge significantly from those of the base model. While we hypothesized that the coastal model would become more liberal and the southern model would become more conservative, we find that their responses are usually similar to each other, without a clear-cut liberal or conservative bias. In addition to asking the models for numerical ratings of agreement with relevant political statements, we ask them to elaborate on their more radical answers, finding varying degrees of willingness to justify themselves. Further work is needed to understand the mechanisms by which fine-tuning on simple, narrow datasets leads to seemingly unrelated changes in model behavior.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing MSM Sexual Networks to Guide PrEP Distribution Strategies for HIV Prevention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Men who have sex with men (MSM) remain disproportionately affected by HIV, yet optimizing the distribution of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in this population remains a major public health challenge. Current PrEP eligibility guidelines and most modelling studies do not incorporate sociodemographic or network-level factors that shape transmission. We present a novel network reconstruction framework that generates MSM sexual contact networks from individual-level behavioral data, incorporating clustering and demographic assortativity by age, race, and sexual activity. Using data from 4667 MSM participants, we reconstructed networks with varying topological properties and simulated HIV transmission over 50 years. Network structure strongly influenced outcomes: assortative by degree networks showed 18% lower equilibrium prevalence (63% vs 80% in assortative by race networks) due to hub isolation within communities. Targeted PrEP strategies based on degree or k-shell centrality achieved similar reductions with 20 to 40% coverage, matching random allocation at 60 to 80% coverage, particularly in assortative by age and race networks where hubs bridge demographic groups. Empirical PrEP distribution was suboptimal, underperforming by up to 30% compared with network-based strategies. Our findings demonstrate that integrating demographic mixing patterns into network reconstruction fundamentally alters optimal intervention design, offering a practical framework for improving HIV prevention in MSM populations where complete contact data are unavailable.</description>

      <title>Towards a Sociology of Sociology: Inequality, Elitism, and Prestige in the Sociological Enterprise From 1970 to the Present</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a science of science and an informal economics of economics, but there is not a cohesive sociology of sociology. We turn the central findings and theoretical lenses of the sociological tradition and the sociological study of stratification inward on sociology itself to investigate how sociology has changed since the 1970s. We link two bibliometric databases to trace diachronic relationships between PhD training and publication outcomes, both of which are understudied in the science of science and sociology of science. All of sociology's top 3 journals remained biased against alum of less prestigious PhD programs, and while most forms of bias in elite sociological publishing have ameliorated over time, the house bias of the American Journal of Sociology in favor PhD alumnae of UChicago has intensified.</description>

      <title>Homeostasis Under Technological Transition: How High-Friction Universities Adapt Through Early Filtering Rather Than Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universities are widely expected to respond to technological transitions through rapid reconfiguration of programme demand and curricular supply. Using four decades of longitudinal administrative cohorts (1980-2019) from a large public university, we examine whether technological change is translated into observable shifts in programme hierarchy, or instead absorbed by institutional mechanisms that preserve structural stability. We show that programme rankings by entrant volume remain remarkably stable over time, while the translation of technological transitions into enrolment composition occurs with substantial delay. Short-run adjustment appears primarily in early persistence dynamics: attrition reacts sooner than choice, and "growth" in entrants can coexist with declining early survival - producing false winners in which expansion is decoupled from persistence. Macroeconomic volatility amplifies attrition and compresses between-programme differences, masking technological signals that would otherwise be interpreted as preference shifts. To explain why stability dominates responsiveness, we situate these patterns within nationally regulated constraints governing engineering education - minimum total hours and mandated practice intensity - which materially limit the speed of curricular adaptation (Ministerio de Educacion, 2021; Ley de Educacion Superior, 1995). National system metrics further support the plausibility of a high-friction equilibrium in which large inflows coexist with standardised outputs (Secretaria de Politicas Universitarias [SPU], 2022). These findings suggest that apparent rigidity is not an anomaly but the predictable outcome of a system optimised for stability over responsiveness.</description>

      <title>Reducibility of higher-order to pairwise interactions: Social impact models on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a general class of social impact models with higher-order interactions on hypergraphs can be exactly reduced to an equivalent model with pairwise interactions on a weighted projected network. This reduction is made by a mapping that preserves the microscopic probabilities of changing the state of the nodes. As a particular case, we introduce hypergraph-voter models, for which we compute the weights of the projected network both analytically and numerically across several hypergraph ensembles, and we characterize their ordering dynamics through simulations of both higher-order and reduced dynamics. For a linear social impact function (hypergraph-linear voter model) the weights of the projected network are static, allowing us to develop a pair approximation that describes with accuracy the time evolution of macroscopic observables, which turn out to be independent of those weights. The macroscopic dynamics is thus equivalent to that of the standard voter model on the unweighted projected network. For a power-law social impact function (hypergraph-nonlinear voter model) the weights of the projected network depend on the instantaneous system configuration. Nevertheless, the nonlinear voter model on the unweighted projected network still reproduces the main macroscopic trends for well connected hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Sustainable, Local Socio-Economic Development Through Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomy, often perceived as a distant or luxury science, holds immense potential as a driver for sustainable local socio-economic development. This paper explores how astronomy can create tangible benefits for communities through education, tourism, technology transfer, and capacity building. Using case studies from South Africa, Chile, Indonesia, and India, we demonstrate how astronomical facilities and initiatives have stimulated local economies, generated employment, supported small enterprises, and enhanced STEM participation, while simultaneously inspiring a sense of shared global heritage. The analysis identifies both successes and challenges, including unequal benefit distribution, limited local ownership, and sustainability gaps once external funding ends. Building on these lessons, we propose a practical framework/guidelines for designing, implementing, and evaluating astronomy-based community initiatives, rooted in participatory engagement and aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper positions astronomy as a catalyst for inclusive growth, demonstrating that investment in the cosmos can translate into grounded, measurable benefits for people and places on Earth.</description>

      <title>Graph energy as a measure of community detectability in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in network science is the detection of communities, which are sets of nodes in a network that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to the rest of the network. A fundamental result in community detection is the existence of a nontrivial threshold for community detectability on sparse graphs that are generated by the planted partition model (PPM). Below this so-called ``detectability limit'', no community-detection method can perform better than random chance. Spectral methods for community detection fail before this detectability limit because the eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenvectors that are relevant for community detection can be absorbed by the bulk of the spectrum. One can bypass the detectability problem by using special matrices, like the non-backtracking matrix, but this requires one to consider higher-dimensional matrices. In this paper, we show that the difference in graph energy between a PPM and an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi (ER) network has a distinct transition at the detectability threshold even for the adjacency matrices of the underlying networks. The graph energy is based on the full spectrum of an adjacency matrix, so our result suggests that standard graph matrices still allow one to separate the parameter regions with detectable and undetectable communities.</description>

      <title>Estimation of partial rankings from sparse, noisy comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02505v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ranking items based on pairwise comparisons is common, from using match outcomes to rank sports teams to using purchase or survey data to rank consumer products. Statistical inference-based methods such as the Bradley-Terry model, which extract rankings based on an underlying generative model, have emerged as flexible and powerful tools to tackle ranking in empirical data. In situations with limited and/or noisy comparisons, it is often challenging to confidently distinguish the performance of different items based on the evidence available in the data. However, most inference-based ranking methods choose to assign each item to a unique rank or score, suggesting a meaningful distinction when there is none. Here, we develop a principled nonparametric Bayesian method, adaptable to any statistical ranking method, for learning partial rankings (rankings with ties) that distinguishes among the ranks of different items only when there is sufficient evidence available in the data. We develop a fast agglomerative algorithm to perform Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference of partial rankings under our framework and examine the performance of our method on a variety of real and synthetic network datasets, finding that it frequently gives a more parsimonious summary of the data than traditional ranking, particularly when observations are sparse.</description>

      <title>Community-level Contagion among Diverse Financial Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As global financial markets become increasingly interconnected, financial contagion has developed into a major influencer of asset price dynamics. Motivated by this context, our study explores financial contagion both within and between asset communities. We contribute to the literature by examining the contagion phenomenon at the community level rather than among individual assets. Our experiments rely on high-frequency data comprising cryptocurrencies, stocks and US ETFs over the 4-year period from April 2019 to May 2023. Using the Louvain community detection algorithm, Vector Autoregression contagion detection model and Tracy-Widom random matrix theory for noise removal from financial assets, we present three main findings. Firstly, while the magnitude of contagion remains relatively stable over time, contagion density (the percentage of asset pairs exhibiting contagion within a financial system) increases. This suggests that market uncertainty is better characterized by the transmission of shocks more broadly than by the strength of any single spillover. Secondly, there is no significant difference between intra- and inter-community contagion, indicating that contagion is a system-wide phenomenon rather than being confined to specific asset groups. Lastly, certain communities themselves, especially those dominated by Information Technology assets, tend to act as major contagion transmitters in the financial network over the examined period, spreading shocks with high densities to many other communities. Our findings suggest that traditional risk management strategies such as portfolio diversification through investing in low-correlated assets or different types of investment vehicle might be insufficient due to widespread contagion.</description>

      <title>A new stochastic SIS-type modelling framework for analysing epidemic dynamics in continuous space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new stochastic epidemiological model defined in a continuous space of arbitrary dimension, based on SIS dynamics implemented in a spatial $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot (SLFV) process. The model can be described by as little as three parameters, and is dual to a spatial branching process with competition linked to genealogies of infected individuals. Therefore, it is a possible modelling framework to develop computationally tractable inference tools for epidemics in a continuous space using demographic and genetic data.We provide mathematical constructions of the process based on well-posed martingale problems as well as driving space-time Poisson point processes. With these devices and the duality relation in hand, we unveil some of the drivers of the transition between extinction and survival of the epidemic. In particular, we show that extinction is in large parts independent of the initial condition, and identify a strong candidate for the reproduction number R 0 of the epidemic in such a model.</description>

      <title>Limited Improvement of Connectivity in Scale-Free Networks by Increasing the Power-Law Exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been well-known that many real networks are scale-free (SF) but extremely vulnerable against attacks. We investigate the robustness of connectivity and the lengths of the shortest loops in randomized SF networks with realistic exponents $2.0 &lt; \gamma \leq 4.0$. We show that smaller variance of degree distributions leads to stronger robustness and longer average length of the shortest loops, which means the existing of large holes. These results will provide important insights toward enhancing the robustness by changing degree distributions.</description>
