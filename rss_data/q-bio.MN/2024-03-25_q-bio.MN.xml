      <title>Connectivity of Parameter Regions of Multistationarity for Multisite Phosphorylation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parameter region of multistationarity of a reaction network contains all the parameters for which the associated dynamical system exhibits multiple steady states. Describing this region is challenging and remains an active area of research. In this paper, we concentrate on two biologically relevant families of reaction networks that model multisite phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of a substrate at $n$ sites. For small values of $n$, it had previously been shown that the parameter region of multistationarity is connected. Here, we extend these results and provide a proof that applies to all values of $n$. Our techniques are based on the study of the critical polynomial associated with these reaction networks together with polyhedral geometric conditions of the signed support of this polynomial.</description>

      <title>Gene Regulatory Network Inference in the Presence of Dropouts: a Causal View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gene regulatory network inference (GRNI) is a challenging problem, particularly owing to the presence of zeros in single-cell RNA sequencing data: some are biological zeros representing no gene expression, while some others are technical zeros arising from the sequencing procedure (aka dropouts), which may bias GRNI by distorting the joint distribution of the measured gene expressions. Existing approaches typically handle dropout error via imputation, which may introduce spurious relations as the true joint distribution is generally unidentifiable. To tackle this issue, we introduce a causal graphical model to characterize the dropout mechanism, namely, Causal Dropout Model. We provide a simple yet effective theoretical result: interestingly, the conditional independence (CI) relations in the data with dropouts, after deleting the samples with zero values (regardless if technical or not) for the conditioned variables, are asymptotically identical to the CI relations in the original data without dropouts. This particular test-wise deletion procedure, in which we perform CI tests on the samples without zeros for the conditioned variables, can be seamlessly integrated with existing structure learning approaches including constraint-based and greedy score-based methods, thus giving rise to a principled framework for GRNI in the presence of dropouts. We further show that the causal dropout model can be validated from data, and many existing statistical models to handle dropouts fit into our model as specific parametric instances. Empirical evaluation on synthetic, curated, and real-world experimental transcriptomic data comprehensively demonstrate the efficacy of our method.</description>
