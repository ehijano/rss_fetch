      <title>On multiplier analogues of the algebra $C+H^\infty$ on weighted rearrangement-invariant sequence spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X(\mathbb{Z})$ be a reflexive rearrangement-invariant Banach sequence space with nontrivial Boyd indices $\alpha_X,\beta_X$ and let $w$ be a symmetric weight in the intersection of the Muckenhoupt classes $A_{1/\alpha_X}(\mathbb{Z})$ and $A_{1/\beta_X}(\mathbb{Z})$. Let $M_{X(\mathbb{Z},w)}$ denote the collection of all periodic distributions $a$ generating bounded Laurent operators $L(a)$ on the space $X(\mathbb{Z},w)=\{\varphi:\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{C}:\varphi w\in X(\mathbb{Z})\}$. We show that $M_{X(\mathbb{Z},w)}$ is a Banach algebra. Further, we consider the closure of trigonometric polynomials in $M_{X(\mathbb{Z},w)}$ denoted by $C_{X(\mathbb{Z},w)}$ and $H_{X(\mathbb{Z},w)}^{\infty,\pm}= \{a\in M_{X(\mathbb{Z},w)}:\widehat{a}(\pm n)=0 \mbox{ for }n&lt;0\}$. We prove that $C_{X(\mathbb{Z},w)}+H_{X(\mathbb{Z},w)}^{\infty,\pm}$ are closed subalgebras of $M_{X(\mathbb{Z},w)}$.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of upper frequently hypercyclic vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a continuous linear operator $T:X\to X$, where $X$ is a topological vector space, let $\mathrm{UFHC}(T)$ be the set of upper frequently hypercyclic vectors, that is, the set of vectors $x \in X$ such that $\{n \in \omega: T^nx \in U\}$ has positive upper asymptotic density for all nonempty open sets $U\subseteq X$. It is known that $\mathrm{UFHC}(T)$ is a $G_{\delta\sigma\delta}$-set which is either empty or contains a dense $G_{\delta}$-set. Using a purely topological proof, we improve it by showing that $\mathrm{UFHC}(T)$ is always a $G_{\delta\sigma}$-set.
  Bonilla and Grosse-Erdmann asked in [Rev. Mat. Complut. \textbf{31} (2018), 673--711] whether $\mathrm{UFHC}(T)$ is always a $G_{\delta}$-set. We answer such question in the negative, by showing that there exists a continuous linear operator $T$ for which $\mathrm{UFHC}(T)$ is not a $F_{\sigma\delta}$-set (hence not $G_\delta$). In addition, we study the [non-]equivalence between (the ideal versions of) upper frequently hypercyclicity in the product topology and upper frequently hypercyclicity in the norm topology.</description>

      <title>Relating insplittings of 2-graphs and of textile systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The graphical operation of insplitting is key to understanding conjugacy of shifts of finite type (SFTs) in both one and two dimensions. In this paper, we consider two approaches to studying 2-dimensional SFTs: textile systems and rank-2 graphs. Nasu's textile systems describe all two-sided 2D SFTs up to conjugacy, whereas the 2-graphs (higher-rank graphs of rank 2) introduced by Kumjian and Pask yield associated C*-algebras. Both models have a naturally-associated notion of insplitting. We show that these notions do not coincide, raising the question of whether insplitting a 2-graph induces a conjugacy of the associated one-sided 2-dimensional SFTs.
  Our first main result shows how to reconstruct 2-graph insplitting using textile-system insplits and inversions, and consequently proves that 2-graph insplitting induces a conjugacy of dynamical systems. We also present several other facets of the relationship between 2-graph insplitting and textile-system insplitting. Incorporating an insplit of the bottom graph of the textile system turns out to be key to this relationship. By articulating the connection between operator-algebraic and dynamical notions of insplitting in two dimensions, this article lays the groundwork for a C*-algebraic framework for classifying one-sided conjugacy in higher-dimensional SFTs.</description>

      <title>Trace Formulas in Noncommutative Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trace formulas appear in many forms in noncommutative geometry (NCG). In the first part of this thesis, we obtain results for asymptotic expansions of trace formulas like heat trace expansions by adapting the theory of Multiple Operator Integration to NCG. More broadly, this construction provides a natural language for operator integrals in NCG, which systematises and simplifies operator integral arguments throughout the literature. Towards this end, we construct a functional calculus for abstract pseudodifferential operators and generalise Peller's construction of multiple operator integrals to this abstract pseudodifferential calculus. In the process, we obtain a noncommutative Taylor formula.
  In the second part of this thesis, we shift our attention to Dixmier trace formulas. First, we provide an approximation of the noncommutative integral for spectrally truncated spectral triples in the Connes--Van Suijlekom paradigm of operator system spectral triples. Our approximation has a close link to Quantum Ergodicity, which we will use to state an NCG analogue of the fundamental result that ergodic geodesic flow implies quantum ergodicity. Furthermore, we provide a Szeg\H{o} limit theorem in NCG. Next, we provide a Dixmier trace formula for the density of states, a measure originating in solid state physics that can be associated with an operator on a geometric space. We first provide this formula in the setting of discrete metric spaces, and then in the setting of manifolds of bounded geometry. The latter leads to a Dixmier trace formula for Roe's index on open manifolds.</description>

      <title>The Condition Number in Phase Retrieval from Intensity Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stability of phase retrieval by analyzing the condition number of the nonlinear map $\Psi_{\boldsymbol{A}}(\boldsymbol{x}) = \bigl(\lvert \langle {\boldsymbol{a}}_j, \boldsymbol{x} \rangle \rvert^2 \bigr)_{1 \le j \le m}$, where $\boldsymbol{a}_j \in \mathbb{H}^n$ are known sensing vectors with $\mathbb{H} \in \{\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}\}$. For each $p \ge 1$, we define the condition number $\beta_{\Psi_{\boldsymbol{A}}}^{\ell_p}$ as the ratio of optimal upper and lower Lipschitz constants of $\Psi_{\boldsymbol{A}}$ measured in the $\ell_p$ norm, with respect to the metric $\mathrm {dist}_\mathbb{H}\left(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{y}\right) = \|\boldsymbol{x} \boldsymbol{x}^\ast - \boldsymbol{y} \boldsymbol{y}^\ast\|_*$. We establish universal lower bounds on $\beta_{\Psi_{\boldsymbol{A}}}^{\ell_p}$ for any sensing matrix $\boldsymbol{A} \in \mathbb{H}^{m \times d}$, proving that $\beta_{\Psi_{\boldsymbol{A}}}^{\ell_1} \ge \pi/2$ and $\beta_{\Psi_{\boldsymbol{A}}}^{\ell_2} \ge \sqrt{3}$ in the real case $(\mathbb{H} = \mathbb{R})$, and $\beta_{\Psi_{\boldsymbol{A}}}^{\ell_p} \ge 2$ for $p=1,2$ in the complex case $(\mathbb{H} = \mathbb{C})$. These bounds are shown to be asymptotically tight: both a deterministic harmonic frame $\boldsymbol{E}_m \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times 2}$ and Gaussian random matrices $\boldsymbol{A} \in \mathbb{H}^{m \times d}$ asymptotically attain them. Notably, the harmonic frame $\boldsymbol{E}_m \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times 2}$ achieves the optimal lower bound $\sqrt{3}$ for all $m \ge 3$ when $p=2$, thus serving as an optimal sensing matrix within $\boldsymbol{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times 2}$. Our results provide the first explicit uniform lower bounds on $\beta_{\Psi_{\boldsymbol{A}}}^{\ell_p}$ and offer insights into the fundamental stability limits of phase retrieval.</description>

      <title>Iterative Methods for the Projected Solutions of Quasi-equilibrium Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aussel et al. (J Optim Theory Appl 170 818-837 2016) introduced the concept of projected solutions for the quasi-variational inequalities with a non-self constraint map, that is, the case where the constraint map may take values outside the feasible set. This paper presents two iterative methods to determine the projected solutions for quasi-equilibrium problems (QEP). We prove the convergence of the sequence generated by iterative methods to a projected solution of the QEP under some suitable assumptions. Some encouraging numerical experiments are presented to show the performance of the proposed methods. As an application, we apply the proposed algorithms to solve an electricity market model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the norm-attainment of positive operators between Banach lattices. By considering an absolute version of James boundaries, we prove that: If $E$ is a reflexive Banach lattice whose order is given by a basis and $F$ is a Dedekind complete Banach lattice, then every positive operator from $E$ to $F$ is compact if and only if every positive operator from $E$ to $F$ attains its norm. An analogue result considering that $E$ is reflexive and the order in $F$ is continuous and given by a basis was proven. We applied our result to study a positive version of the weak maximizing property.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the class of functions positively associated with a linear operator. We describe these classes for several integral operators including the $q$-cosine transform and the spherical Radon transform. We show that positively associated functions control the comparison problem for linear operators generalizing the Busemann-Petty problem for convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Operators with the Kato property on Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of bounded linear operators between Banach spaces, which we call operators with the Kato property, that includes the family of strictly singular operators between those spaces. We show that if $T:E\to F$ is a dense-range operator with that property and $E$ has a separable quotient, then for each proper dense operator range $R\subset E$ there exists a closed subspace $X\subset E$ such that $E/X$ is separable, $T(X)$ is dense in $F$ and $R+X$ is infinite-codimensional. If $E^*$ is weak$^*$-separable, the subspace $X$ can be built so that, in addition to the former properties, $R\cap X = \{0\}$. Some applications to the geometry of Banach spaces are given. In particular, we provide the next extensions of well-known results of Johnson and Plichko: if $X$ and $Y$ are quasicomplemented but not complemented subspaces of a Banach space $E$ and $X$ has a separable quotient, then $X$ contains a closed subspace $X_1\subset X$ such that $\dim (X/X_1)= \infty$ and $X_1$ is a quasicomplement of $Y$, and that if $T:E\to F$ is an operator with non-closed range and $E$ has a separable quotient, then there exists a weak$^*$-closed subspace $Z\subset E^*$ such that $T^*(F^*)\cap Z = \{0\}$. Some refinements of these results, in the case that $E^*$ is weak$^*$-separable, are also given. Finally, we show that if $E$ is a Banach space with a separable quotient, then $E^*$ is weak$^*$-separable if, and only if, for every closed subspace $X\subset E$ and every proper dense operator range $R\subset E$ there exists a quasicomplement $Y$ of $X$ in $E$ such that $Y\cap R = \{0\}$.</description>

Abstract: Expansivity, Li-Yorke chaos and shadowing are popular and well-studied notions of dynamical systems. Several simple and useful characterizations of these notions within the setting of linear dynamics were obtained recently. We explore these three dynamical properties for composition operators $C_{\phi}f = f \circ \phi$ induced by affine self-maps $\phi$ of the right half-plane $\mathbb{C}_{+}$ on the Hardy-Hilbert space $H^{2}(\mathbb{C_{+}})$.</description>

      <title>Local convergence rates for Wasserstein gradient flows and McKean-Vlasov equations with multiple stationary solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15725v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-linear versions of log-Sobolev inequalities, that link a free energy to its dissipation along the corresponding Wasserstein gradient flow (i.e. corresponds to Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequalities in this context), are known to provide global exponential long-time convergence to the free energy minimizers, and have been shown to hold in various contexts. However they cannot hold when the free energy admits critical points which are not global minimizers, which is for instance the case of the granular media equation in a double-well potential with quadratic attractive interaction at low temperature. This work addresses such cases, extending the general arguments when a log-Sobolev inequality only holds locally and, as an example, establishing such local inequalities for the granular media equation with quadratic interaction either in the one-dimensional symmetric double-well case or in higher dimension in the low temperature regime. The method provides quantitative convergence rates for initial conditions in a Wasserstein ball around the stationary solutions. The same analysis is carried out for the kinetic counterpart of the gradient flow, i.e. the corresponding Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. The local exponential convergence to stationary solutions for the mean-field equations, both elliptic and kinetic, is shown to induce for the corresponding particle systems a fast (i.e. uniform in the number or particles) decay of the particle system free energy toward the level of the non-linear limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\sigma : \mathbb C^d \rightarrow \mathbb C^d$ be an affine-linear involution such that $J_\sigma = -1$ and let $U, V$ be two domains in $\mathbb C^d.$ Let $\phi : U \rightarrow V$ be a $\sigma$-invariant $2$-proper map such that $J_\phi$ is affine-linear and let $\mathscr H(U)$ be a $\sigma$-invariant reproducing kernel Hilbert space of complex-valued holomorphic functions on $U.$ It is shown that the space $\mathscr H_\phi(V):=\{f \in \mathrm{Hol}(V) : J_\phi \cdot f \circ \phi \in \mathscr H(U)\}$ endowed with the norm $\|f\|_\phi :=\|J_\phi \cdot f \circ \phi\|_{\mathscr H(U)}$ is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and the linear mapping $\varGamma_\phi$ defined by $ \varGamma_\phi(f) = J_\phi \cdot f \circ \phi,$ $f \in \mathrm{Hol}(V),$
  is a unitary from $\mathscr H_\phi(V)$ onto $\{f \in \mathscr H(U) : f = -f \circ \sigma\}.$ Moreover, a neat formula for the reproducing kernel $\kappa_{\phi}$ of $\mathscr H_\phi(V)$ in terms of the reproducing kernel of $\mathscr H(U)$ is given. The above scheme is applicable to symmetrized bidisc, tetrablock, $d$-dimensional fat Hartogs triangle and $d$-dimensional egg domain. Although some of these are known, this allows us to obtain an analog of von Neumann's inequality for contractive tuples naturally associated with these domains.</description>

      <title>Isomorphism Theorems between Models of Mixed Choice (Revised)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We relate the so-called powercone models of mixed non-deterministic and probabilistic choice proposed by Tix, Keimel, Plotkin, Mislove, Ouaknine, Worrell, Morgan, and McIver, to our own models of previsions. Under suitable topological assumptions, we show that they are isomorphic. We rely on Keimel's cone-theoretic variants of the classical Hahn-Banach separation theorems, using functional analytic methods, and on the Schr\"oder-Simpson Theorem. Lemma 3.4 in the original 2017 version, published at MSCS, had a wrong proof, and we prove a repaired, albeit slightly less general version here.</description>

      <title>Gram-like matrix preserving extensions and completions of noncommutative polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a positive noncommutative polynomial $f$, equivalently a sum of Hermitian squares (SOHS), there exists a positive semidefinite Gram matrix that encrypts all the structural essence of $f$. There are no available methods for extending a noncommutative polynomial to a SOHS keeping the Gram matrices unperturbed. As a remedy, we introduce an equally significant notion of Gram-like matrices and provide linear algebraic techniques to get the desired extensions. We further use positive semidefinite completion problem to get SOHS and provide criteria in terms of chordal graphs and 2-regular projective algebraic sets.</description>

      <title>Construction of graph-directed invariant sets of weak contractions on semi-metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a construction of graph-directed invariant sets of weak contractions in the sense of Matkowski-Rus on semi-metric spaces. We follow the approach by Bessenyei and P\'enzes, which applies the Kuratowski noncompactness measure without relying on Blascke's completeness theorem. We also establish a relationship between this approach and a generalized de Rham's functional equation indexed by a finite directed graph.</description>
