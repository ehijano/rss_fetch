      <title>Formal category theory in $\infty$-equipments II: Lax functors, monoidality and fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the framework of $\infty$-equipments which is designed to produce well-behaved theories for different generalizations of $\infty$-categories in a synthetic and uniform fashion. We consider notions of (lax) functors between these equipments, closed monoidal structures on these equipments, and fibrations internal to these equipments. As a main application, we will demonstrate that the foundations of internal $\infty$-category theory can be readily obtained using this formalism.</description>

      <title>Pushing Tree Decompositions Forward Along Graph Homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15184v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is folklore that tree-width is monotone under taking subgraphs (i.e. injective graph homomorphisms) and contractions (certain kinds of surjective graph homomorphisms). However, although tree-width is obviously not monotone under any surjective graph homomorphism, it is not clear whether contractions are canonically the only class of surjections with respect to which it is monotone. We prove that this is indeed the case: we show that - up to isomorphism - contractions are the only surjective graph homomorphisms that preserve tree decompositions and the shape of the decomposition tree. Furthermore, our results provide a framework for answering questions of this sort for many other kinds of combinatorial data structures (such as directed multigraphs, hypergraphs, Petri nets, circular port graphs, half-edge graphs, databases, simplicial complexes etc.) for which natural analogues of tree decompositions can be defined.</description>

      <title>Module categories, internal bimodules and Tambara modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the theory of Tambara modules to extend and generalize the reconstruction theorem for module categories over a rigid monoidal category to the non-rigid case. We show a biequivalence between the $2$-category of cyclic module categories over a monoidal category $\mathscr{C}$ and the bicategory of algebra and bimodule objects in the category of Tambara modules on $\mathscr{C}$. Using it, we prove that a cyclic module category can be reconstructed as the category of certain free module objects in the category of Tambara modules on $\mathscr{C}$, and give a sufficient condition for its reconstructability as module objects in $\mathscr{C}$. To that end, we extend the definition of the Cayley functor to the non-closed case, and show that Tambara modules give a proarrow equipment for $\mathscr{C}$-module categories, in which $\mathscr{C}$-module functors are characterized as $1$-morphisms admitting a right adjoint. Finally, we show that the $2$-category of all $\mathscr{C}$-module categories embeds into the $2$-category of categories enriched in Tambara modules on $\mathscr{C}$, giving an ''action via enrichment'' result.</description>

      <title>On topological groupoids that represent theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grothendieck toposes, and by extension, logical theories, can be represented by topological structures. Butz and Moerdijk showed that every topos with enough points can be represented as the topos of sheaves on an open topological groupoid. This paper tackles a follow-up question: we characterise, in model-theoretic terms, which open topological groupoids can represent the classifying topos of a theory. Intuitively, this characterises which groupoids of models contain enough information to reconstruct the theory. Our treatment subsumes many of the previous approaches found in the literature, such as that of Awodey, Forssell, Butz and Moerdijk.</description>

      <title>Identity in the presence of adjunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of adjunctions in semigroup categories, i.e. monoidal categories without a unit object. We show that a rigid semigroup category is promonoidal, and thus one can naturally adjoin a unit object to it. This extends the previous results of Houston in the symmetric case, and addresses a question of his. It also extends the results in the non-symmetric case with additional finiteness assumptions, obtained by Benson-Etingof-Ostrik, Coulembier and Ko-Mazorchuk-Zhang. We give an interpretation of these results using comonad cohomology, and, in the absence of finiteness conditions, using enriched traces of monoidal categories. As an application of our results, we give a characterization of finite tensor categories in terms of the finitary 2-representation theory of Mazorchuk-Miemietz.</description>

      <title>The local-to-global principle via topological properties of the tensor triangular support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08422v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the theory of tensor triangular support introduced by Sanders, which generalizes the Balmer-Favi support, we prove the local version of the result of Zou that the Balmer spectrum being Hochster weakly scattered implies the local-to-global principle.
  That is, given an object $t$ of a tensor triangulated category $\mathcal{T}$ we show that if the tensor triangular support $\text{Supp}(t)$ is a weakly scattered subset with respect to the inverse topology of the Balmer spectrum $\text{Spc}(\mathcal{T}^c)$, then the local-to-global principle holds for $t$.
  As immediate consequences, we have the analogue adaptations of the well-known statements that the Balmer spectrum being noetherian or Hausdorff scattered implies the local-to-global principle.
  We conclude with an application of the last result to the examination of the support of injective superdecomposable modules in the derived category of an absolutely flat ring which is not semi-artinian.</description>

      <title>Admissible weak factorization systems on extriangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extriangulated categories, introduced by Nakaoka and Palu, serve as a simultaneous generalization of exact and triangulated categories. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of admissible weak factorization systems and establish a bijection between cotorsion pairs and admissible weak factorization systems in extriangulated categories. Consequently, we give the equivalences between hereditary cotorsion pairs and compatible cotorsion pairs via admissible weak factorization systems under certain conditions in extriangulated categories, thereby generalizing a result by Di, Li, and Liang.</description>
