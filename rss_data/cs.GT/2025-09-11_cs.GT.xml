      <title>Efficiently Computing Equilibria in Budget-Aggregation Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08767v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Budget aggregation deals with the social choice problem of distributing an exogenously given budget among a set of public projects, given agents' preferences. Taking a game-theoretic perspective, we initialize the study of budget-aggregation games where each agent has virtual decision power over some fraction of the budget. This paper investigates the structure and shows efficient computability of Nash equilibria in this setting for various preference models. In particular, we show that Nash equilibria for Leontief utilities can be found in polynomial time, solving an open problem from Brandt et al. [2023].</description>

      <title>Exact conditions for evolutionary stability in indirect reciprocity under noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indirect reciprocity is a key mechanism for large-scale cooperation. This mechanism captures the insight that in part, people help others to build and maintain a good reputation. To enable such cooperation, appropriate social norms are essential. They specify how individuals should act based on each others' reputations, and how reputations are updated in response to individual actions. Although previous work has identified several norms that sustain cooperation, a complete analytical characterization of all evolutionarily stable norms remains lacking, especially when assessments or actions are noisy. In this study, we provide such a characterization for the public assessment regime. This characterization reproduces known results, such as the leading eight norms, but it extends to more general cases, allowing for various types of errors and additional actions including costly punishment. We also identify norms that impose a fixed payoff on any mutant strategy, analogous to the zero-determinant strategies in direct reciprocity. These results offer a rigorous foundation for understanding the evolution of cooperation through indirect reciprocity and the critical role of social norms.</description>

      <title>Finding a Multiple Follower Stackelberg Equilibrium: A Fully First-Order Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose the first fully first-order method to compute an epsilon stationary Stackelberg equilibrium with convergence guarantees. To achieve this, we first reframe the leader follower interaction as single level constrained optimization. Second, we define the Lagrangian and show that it can approximate the leaders gradient in response to the equilibrium reached by followers with only first-order gradient evaluations. These findings suggest a fully first order algorithm that alternates between (i) approximating followers best responses through gradient descent and (ii) updating the leaders strategy via approximating the gradient using Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Game-Theoretic Resilience Framework for Cyber-Physical Microgrids using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing reliance on cyber physical infrastructure in modern power systems has amplified the risk of targeted cyber attacks, necessitating robust and adaptive resilience strategies. This paper presents a mathematically rigorous game theoretic framework to evaluate and enhance microgrid resilience using a combination of quantitative resilience metrics Load Served Ratio LSR, Critical Load Resilience CLR, Topological Survivability Score TSS, and DER Resilience Score DRS. These are integrated into a unified payoff matrix using the Analytic Hierarchy Process AHP to assess attack defense interactions. The framework is formalized as a finite horizon Markov Decision Process MDP with formal convergence guarantees and computational complexity bounds. Three case studies are developed 1. static attacks analyzed via Nash equilibrium, 2. severe attacks incorporating high impact strategies, and 3. adaptive attacks using Stackelberg games, regret matching, softmax heuristics, and Multi Agent Q Learning. Rigorous theoretical analysis provides convergence proofs with explicit rates , PAC learning sample complexity bounds, and computational complexity analysis. The framework is tested on an enhanced IEEE 33bus distribution system with DERs and control switches, demonstrating the effectiveness of adaptive and strategic defenses in improving cyber physical resilience with statistically significant improvements of 18.7% 2.1% over static approaches.</description>
