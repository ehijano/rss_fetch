      <title>Knotted DNA Configurations in Bacteriophage Capsids: A Liquid Crystal Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, store their micron long DNA inside an icosahedral capsid with a typical diameter of 40 nm to 100 nm. Consistent with experimental observations, such confinement conditions induce an arrangement of DNA that corresponds to a hexagonal chromonic liquid-crystalline phase, and increase the topological complexity of the genome in the form of knots. A mathematical model that implements a chromonic liquid-crystalline phase and that captures the changes in topology has been lacking. We adopt a mathematical model that represents the viral DNA as a pair of a vector field and a line. The vector field is a minimizer of the total Oseen-Frank energy for nematic liquid crystals under chromonic constraints, while the line is identified with the tangent to the field at selected locations, representing the central axis of the DNA molecule. The fact that the Oseen-Frank functional assigns infinite energy to topological defects (point defects in two dimensions and line defects in three dimensions) precludes the presence of singularities and, in particular, of knot structures. To address this issue, we begin with the optimal vector field and helical line, and propose a new algorithm to introduce knots through stochastic perturbations associated with splay and twist deformations, modeled by means of a Langevin system. We conclude by comparing knot distributions generated by the model and by interpreting them in the context of previously published experimental results. Altogether, this work relies on the synergy of modeling, analysis and computation in the study of viral DNA organization in capsids.</description>

      <title>Beyond Ensembles: Simulating All-Atom Protein Dynamics in a Learned Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating the long-timescale dynamics of biomolecules is a central challenge in computational science. While enhanced sampling methods can accelerate these simulations, they rely on pre-defined collective variables that are often difficult to identify. A recent generative model, LD-FPG, demonstrated that this problem could be bypassed by learning to sample the static equilibrium ensemble as all-atom deformations from a reference structure, establishing a powerful method for all-atom ensemble generation. However, while this approach successfully captures a system's probable conformations, it does not model the temporal evolution between them. Here we extend LD-FPG with a temporal propagator that operates within the learned latent space and compare three classes: (i) score-guided Langevin dynamics, (ii) Koopman-based linear operators, and (iii) autoregressive neural networks. Within a unified encoder-propagator-decoder framework, we evaluate long-horizon stability, backbone and side-chain ensemble fidelity, and functional free-energy landscapes. Autoregressive neural networks deliver the most robust long rollouts; score-guided Langevin best recovers side-chain thermodynamics when the score is well learned; and Koopman provides an interpretable, lightweight baseline that tends to damp fluctuations. These results clarify the trade-offs among propagators and offer practical guidance for latent-space simulators of all-atom protein dynamics.</description>

      <title>Steering Protein Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs), pre-trained on extensive evolutionary data from natural proteins, have emerged as indispensable tools for protein design. While powerful, PLMs often struggle to produce proteins with precisely specified functionalities or properties due to inherent challenges in controlling their outputs. In this work, we investigate the potential of Activation Steering, a technique originally developed for controlling text generation in Large Language Models (LLMs), to direct PLMs toward generating protein sequences with targeted properties. We propose a simple yet effective method that employs activation editing to steer PLM outputs, and extend this approach to protein optimization through a novel editing site identification module. Through comprehensive experiments on lysozyme-like sequence generation and optimization, we demonstrate that our methods can be seamlessly integrated into both auto-encoding and autoregressive PLMs without requiring additional training. These results highlight a promising direction for precise protein engineering using foundation models.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary Discrminator Sequence Generative Adversarial Networks (ADSeqGAN) for Few Sample Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Auxiliary Discriminator Sequence Generative Adversarial Networks (ADSeqGAN), a novel approach for molecular generation in small-sample datasets. Traditional generative models often struggle with limited training data, particularly in drug discovery, where molecular datasets for specific therapeutic targets, such as nucleic acids binders and central nervous system (CNS) drugs, are scarce. ADSeqGAN addresses this challenge by integrating an auxiliary random forest classifier as an additional discriminator into the GAN framework, significantly improves molecular generation quality and class specificity. Our method incorporates pretrained generator and Wasserstein distance to enhance training stability and diversity. We evaluate ADSeqGAN across three representative cases. First, on nucleic acid- and protein-targeting molecules, ADSeqGAN shows superior capability in generating nucleic acid binders compared to baseline models. Second, through oversampling, it markedly improves CNS drug generation, achieving higher yields than traditional de novo models. Third, in cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) ligand design, ADSeqGAN generates novel druglike molecules, with 32.8\% predicted actives surpassing hit rates of CB1-focused and general-purpose libraries when assessed by a target-specific LRIP-SF scoring function. Overall, ADSeqGAN offers a versatile framework for molecular design in data-scarce scenarios, with demonstrated applications in nucleic acid binders, CNS drugs, and CB1 ligands.</description>
