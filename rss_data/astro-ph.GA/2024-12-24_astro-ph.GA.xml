      <title>A Probabilistic Model to Estimate Number Densities from Column Densities in Molecular Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraining the physical and chemical evolution of molecular clouds is essential to our understanding of star formation. These investigations often necessitate knowledge of some local representative number density of the gas along the line of sight. However, constraining the number density is a difficult endeavor. Robust constraints of the number density often require line observations of specific molecules along with radiation transfer modeling, which provides densities traced by that specific molecule. Column density maps of molecular clouds are more readily available, with many high-fidelity maps calculated from dust emission and extinction, in particular from surveys conducted with the Herschel Space Observatory. We introduce a new probabilistic model which is based on the assumption that the total hydrogen nuclei column density along a line of sight can be decomposed into a turbulent component and a gravitationally-dominated component. Therefore, for each pixel in a column density map, the line of sight is decomposed into characteristic diffuse (dubbed ``turbulent'') and dense (dubbed ``gravitational'') gas number densities from column density maps. The method thus exploits a physical model of turbulence to decouple the random turbulent column from gas in dense bound structures empirically using the observed column density maps. We find the model produces reasonable turbulent and gravitational densities in the Taurus L1495/B213 and Polaris Flare clouds. The model can also be used to infer an effective attenuating column density into the cloud, which is useful for astrochemical models of the clouds. We conclude by demonstrating an application of this method by predicting the emission of the [C II], [C I], and CO (J = 1-0) lines across the Taurus L1495/B213 region at the native resolution of the column density map utilizing a grid of photodissociation-region models.</description>

      <title>Coevolution of Dwarf Galaxies and Their Circumgalactic Medium Across Cosmic Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies are thought of as the building blocks of large galaxies such as our Milky Way. This paper presents new high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies and their intergalactic medium with the \texttt{GIZMO} code. Our simulations consider the key physical processes of galaxy evolution, such as gas cooling, chemistry, and stellar and black hole feedback. Unlike the previous work, the initial conditions of our simulations taking the dwarf galaxies of $2-5 \times 10^{10} \, M_\odot$ from the realistic cosmology simulations, \texttt{IllustrisTNG}. We further increase the original resolution of \texttt{IllustrisTNG} by a factor of $\sim 100$ via a particle splitting scheme. Our results show that the evolution of complex multiphase CGM and its metal content is sensitive to the redshift of dwarf galaxies. The accretion of CGM into dwarf galaxies plays a key role in providing $20 \% - 50 \%$ of the star-forming gas and replenishing $40 \% - 70 \%$ of the total mass in the galactic disk. Furthermore, the accretion history of supermassive black holes in the centers of high-$z$ dwarf galaxies shows episodic patterns with high-accreting states close to $\sim 10 \%$ of the Eddington mass accretion rate, implying the rapid growth of supermassive black holes in the early universe, which may be revealed by the coming observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).</description>

      <title>Global Thermal Instability in the Spherical Interstellar Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal instability (TI) is a trigger mechanism, which can explain the formation of small condensations through some regions of the interstellar clouds. The instability criterion for flat geometry approximations has been investigated in previous works. Here, we focus on spherical perturbations in the spherical clouds. Our goal here is to examine the conditions for the occurrence of TI through the thermally dominated (i.e., gravitationally stable) quasi-static spherical interstellar clouds. First, we obtain the profiles of density, temperature, pressure, and enclosed mass of a symmetric spherical cloud. Then, we use the perturbation method to investigate the linear regime of instability and find its growth rate. Considering spherical perturbations on the quasi-static spherical cloud, instead of a thermal and dynamical equilibrium flat cloud, changes the instability criterion so that we can conclude that sphericalness can increase the occurrence of TI. The results show that in the spherical clouds, perturbations with shorter wavelengths have more chance to grow via TI (i.e., greater growth rates).</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement, coherence and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the effect of quantum entanglement and coherence on the radiated intensity from a gas and its absorption capacity at thermal equilibrium or, more generally, under conditions where no population inversion exists. As was shown by Dicke (1954), although entangled states and coherence can lead to superradiance for specific modes of radiation, they can also bring subradiance through significant energy trapping in slow and dark states. While a finite separation between the atoms composing the gas will cause leaking of the trapped energy, we show how the combination of thermal equilibrium and quantum coherence mitigates this effect and leads to significantly reduced radiation intensity from the gas, rendering it dark and collision-less. Furthermore, we show how under the same conditions absorption of a radiation field incident on the gas can lead to higher attenuation levels than those predicted with Beer's law. Beer's law is recovered in the limit of complete decoherence. We apply our analysis to the atomic hydrogen 21 cm line and, considering the gas densities expected in Dark Matter halos, we find that quantum entanglement and coherence can potentially account for some of the Dark Matter known exist in these environments.</description>

      <title>An Asymptotic Matching Method for Analyzing Non-Planar Orbits in Disk Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the orbital dynamics of objects in galactic disks is crucial to understanding the stability and evolution of disk galaxies. While studies of galactic orbits are largely dominated by $N$-body simulations, perturbative analytical models offer a computationally inexpensive and conceptually insightful way of analyzing galactic dynamics. We utilize perturbation theory and the method of matched asymptotics to develop a technique by which the vertical motion of a point mass perpendicular to a thin axisymmetric disk galaxy can be computed analytically to high precision. The objective of this study is to provide an accurate model of non-planar dynamics that could be employed in galactic simulations to bypass computationally expensive integration. We construct a general solution for the dynamics at small $z$ displacements from the plane of the disk using perturbation theory. We solve for the dynamics at very large displacements from the plane of the disk and construct a function that interpolates the solutions at each length scale. To demonstrate the method's utility, we apply it to two commonly used models for the vertical structure of a galactic disk, the exponential model and the isothermal model. Finally, using the principle of adiabatic invariance, we analyze how to relate variations in radial motion to variations in the vertical motion and discuss possible applications of the model in numerical astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Solid and Gaseous Methane in IRAS 23385+6053 as seen with Open JWST Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new description of the 7.7~$\mu$m region towards the high-mass star-forming region IRAS 23385+6053 taken from open James Webb Space Telescope Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer (JWST MIRI/MRS) data. This area is commonly attributed to the $\nu_4$ deformation mode of methane ice. For the first time gaseous and solid methane were analyzed simultaneously in IRAS 23385+6053. The band at 7.58--7.8 $\mu$m (1320--1280 cm$^{-1}$) is interpreted as a wide solid absorption methane feature overlapped by the sharp features of the methane emission. We report the detection of gaseous methane and estimate its emitting area radius~$R$, temperature~$T$ and column density~$N$ as $R=2940$~au, $T=103^{+13}_{-11}$~K, and $N=0.78_{+6.18}^{-0.64}\times10^{17}$~cm$^{-2}$, correspondingly. The ice content was analyzed with the laboratory spectra dataset of methane in different molecular environments obtained on the Ice Spectroscopy Experimental Aggregate (ISEAge). We were able to describe the wide feature of solid methane with the following laboratory spectra: CH$_4$~:~CO$_2$~=~1~:~5 (at $27.4^{+6.0}_{-10.8}$~K) and CH$_4$~:~H$_2$O~=~1~:~10 (at $8.4^{+16.4}_{-1.7}$~K) deposited at 6.7~K and warmed up at a rate of 0.5 K per minute. The derived column densities are $N_{\text{CH}_4}$(CO$_2$)~=~$2.97^{+0.37}_{-0.57}\times10^{17}$~cm$^{-2}$ and $N_{\text{CH}_4}$(H$_2$O)~=~$1.02^{+0.46}_{-0.27}\times10^{17}$~cm$^{-2}$. According to the best fit solid methane is mostly surrounded by CO$_2$ rather than H$_2$O. The residuals analysis reveals the unassigned region at 1283--1297~cm$^{-1}$ (7.71--7.79~$\mu$m) which is tentatively assigned to nitrous oxide (N$_2$O) in various environments.</description>

      <title>A central tidal disruption event candidate in high redshift quasar SDSS J000118.70+003314.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a high-redshift ($z=1.404$) tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate in SDSS J000118.70+003314.0 (SDSS J0001), which is a quasar with apparent broad Mg~{\sc ii} emission line. The long-term variability in its nine-year photometric $ugriz$-band light curves, obtained from the SDSS Stripe82 and the PHOTOOBJALL databases, can be described by the conventional TDE model. Our results suggest that the TDE is a main-sequence star with mass of $1.905_{-0.009}^{+0.023}{\rm M_\odot}$ tidally disrupted by a black hole (BH) with mass {$6.5_{-2.6}^{+3.5}\times10^7{\rm M_\odot}$}. The BH mass is about 7.5 times smaller than the virial BH mass derived from the broad Mg~{\sc ii} emission line, which can be explained by non-virial dynamic properties of broad emission lines from TDEs debris. Furthermore, we examine the probability that the event results from intrinsic variability of quasars, which is about $0.009\%$, through applications of the DRW/CAR process. Alternative explanations for the event are also discussed, such as the scenarios of dust obscurations, microlensing and accretion. Our results provide clues to support that TDEs could be detectable in broad line quasars as well as in quiescent galaxies, and to indicate the variability of some active galactic nuclei may be partly attributed to central TDEs.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Star Formation Rates Using an Artificial Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we develop an artificial neural network to estimate the infrared (IR) luminosity and star formation rates (SFR) of galaxies. Our network is trained using 'true' IR luminosity values derived from modeling the IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of FIR-detected galaxies. We explore five different sets of input features, each incorporating optical, mid-infrared (MIR), near-infrared (NIR), ultraviolet (UV), and emission line data, along with spectroscopic redshifts and uncertainties. All feature sets yield similar IR luminosity predictions, but including all photometric data leads to slightly improved performance. This suggests that comprehensive photometric information enhances the accuracy of our predictions. Our network is applied to a sample of SDSS galaxies defined as unseen data, and the results are compared with three published catalogs of SFRs. Overall, our network demonstrates excellent performance for star-forming galaxies while we observe discrepancies in composite and AGN samples. These inconsistencies may stem from uncertainties inherent in the compared catalogs or potential limitations in the performance of our network.</description>

      <title>Signatures of simulated spiral arms on radial actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the various implications of the spiral arms, it has been observed in the Milky Way disc that the distribution of radial actions from the Gaia Data Release 3 exhibits structures that may be related to the spiral arms. Our goal is to investigate the relationship between regions of low radial action identified in simulated discs and the location of the spiral arms, such as that suggested in Palicio et al. (2023) for the Galaxy. For a sample of 23 simulated spiral galaxies, we modelled the axisymmetric component of their gravitational potential to compute the radial action of their stellar particles using the St\"ackel fudge. The spatial distribution of the radial action was then compared to the location of the spiral arms, identified as overdensities in the stellar surface density using a kernel density estimator. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the radial action distribution and the spiral arms in 18 of 23 simulated galaxies. However, notable discrepancies are observed in the remaining five, since they are profoundly out-of-equilibrium systems, such as galaxies influenced by external interactions or spiral arms still in the process of winding up. We have confirmed that, in general, there is a tendency of spatial correlation between spiral arms and stellar populations featuring low values of the radial action observed in Gaia DR3 data by Palicio et al. (2023). However, discrepancies between features in the radial action distribution and the spiral structure can be interpreted as signatures of recent disturbances, a scenario applicable to the Milky Way. Furthermore, populations at least as old as 3 Gyr trace the spiral arms with no significant misalignment across age bins. A linear relation between the maximum value of the radial action of the spiral arms and the vertical scale-length is found, which is also satisfied by the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Hydrogenation of acetaldehyde on interstellar ice analogs reveals limited destruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We sought to determine which are the main hydrogenation paths of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO). As a partially unsaturated molecule, CH3CHO can have links with more hydrogenated species, like ethanol (C2H5OH) or with more unsaturated ones, like ketene (H2CCO). We used highly accurate quantum chemical calculations to determine the reaction rate constants for the CH3CHO + H/D reaction. Our theoretical results are confronted against our experiments on the hydrogenation and deuteration of CH3CHO ice. We find that acetaldehyde resists hydrogenation, with only a 10\% of conversion to products different than CH3CHO. This is due to a predominance of H-abstraction at the HCO moiety, with reaction rate constants up to four orders of magnitude higher than the next possible reaction channel, that is hydrogenation at the aldehydic carbon. The formed CH3CO radical experiences barrierless or nearly barrierless reactions in all possible reaction positions, reforming CH3CHO and creating a closed loop that protects the molecule against hydrogenation. We constrain the branching ratios for the second reaction from experiments. Our experiments agree with the calculations and from the combination of both we can explain the presence of H2CCO, CO, CH4, C2H5OH, H2CO or CH3OH as minor products at the end of the reaction. We provide recommendations for future modeling efforts. Our results show limited destruction of acetaldehyde, reinforcing the vision of this molecule as an abundant and resilient COM. From the experiments, we are not able to observe the reactive desorption of this molecule. Our results align with other modeling works, showing that the link between CH3CHO and C2H5OH is not direct. Finally, our results can explain the excess of CH3CDO found in prestellar cores.</description>

      <title>Full disc [CII] mapping of nearby star-forming galaxies: SOFIA FIFI/LS observations of NGC 3627, NGC 4321, and NGC 6946</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a major cooling line of interstellar gas, the far-infrared 158 {\mu}m line from singly ionised carbon [CII] is an important tracer of various components of the interstellar medium in galaxies across all spatial and morphological scales. Yet, there is still not a strong constraint on the origins of [CII] emission. In this work, we derive the resolved [CII] star formation rate relation and aim to unravel the complexity of the origin of [CII]. We used the Field-Imaging Far-Infrared Line Spectrometer on board the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy to map [CII] in three nearby star-forming galaxies at sub-kiloparsec scales, namely, NGC 3627, NGC 4321, and NGC 6946, and we compared these [CII] observations to the galactic properties derived from complementary data from the literature. We find that the relationship between the [CII] fine structure line and star formation rate shows variations between the galaxies as well as between different environments within each galaxy. Our results show that the use of [CII] as a tracer for star formation is much more tangled than has previously been suggested within the extragalactic literature, which typically focuses on small regions of galaxies and/or uses large-aperture sampling of many different physical environments. As found within resolved observations of the Milky Way, the picture obtained from [CII] observations is complicated by its local interstellar medium conditions. Future studies will require a larger sample and additional observational tracers, obtained on spatial scales within galaxies, in order to accurately disentangle the origin of [CII] and calibrate its use as a star formation tracer.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Early Release Observations of diffuse stellar structures and globular clusters as probes of the mass assembly of galaxies in the Dorado group</title>

Abstract: Deep surveys reveal tidal debris and associated compact stellar systems. Euclid's unique combination of capabilities (spatial resolution, depth, and wide sky coverage) will make it a groundbreaking tool for galactic archaeology in the local Universe, bringing low surface brightness (LSB) science into the era of large-scale astronomical surveys. Euclid's Early Release Observations (ERO) demonstrate this potential with a field of view that includes several galaxies in the Dorado group. In this paper, we aim to derive from this image a mass assembly scenario for its main galaxies: NGC 1549, NGC 1553, and NGC 1546. We detect internal and external diffuse structures, and identify candidate globular clusters (GCs). By analysing the colours and distributions of the diffuse structures and candidate GCs, we can place constraints on the galaxies' mass assembly and merger histories. The results show that feature morphology, surface brightness, colours, and GC density profiles are consistent with galaxies that have undergone different merger scenarios. We classify NGC 1549 as a pure elliptical galaxy that has undergone a major merger. NGC 1553 appears to have recently transitioned from a late-type galaxy to early type, after a series of radial minor to intermediate mergers. NGC 1546 is a rare specimen of galaxy with an undisturbed disk and a prominent diffuse stellar halo, which we infer has been fed by minor mergers and then disturbed by the tidal effect from NGC 1553. Finally, we identify limitations specific to the observing conditions of this ERO, in particular stray light in the visible and persistence in the near-infrared bands. Once these issues are addressed and the extended emission from LSB objects is preserved by the data-processing pipeline, the Euclid Wide Survey will allow studies of the local Universe to be extended to statistical ensembles over a large part of the extragalactic sky.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Three: Magnetic Fields along the Orion Integral-Shaped Filament as Revealed by JCMT BISTRO survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the BISTRO survey, we present JCMT 850 $\mu$m polarimetric observations towards the Orion Integral-Shaped Filament (ISF) that covers three portions known as OMC-1, OMC-2, and OMC-3. The magnetic field threading the ISF seen in the JCMT POL-2 map appears as a tale of three: pinched for OMC-1, twisted for OMC-2, and nearly uniform for OMC-3. A multi-scale analysis shows that the magnetic field structure in OMC-3 is very consistent at all the scales, whereas the field structure in OMC-2 shows no correlation across different scales. In OMC-1, the field retains its mean orientation from large to small scales, but shows some deviations at small scales. Histograms of relative orientations between the magnetic field and filaments reveal a bimodal distribution for OMC-1, a relatively random distribution for OMC-2, and a distribution with a predominant peak at 90$^\circ$ for OMC-3. Furthermore, the magnetic fields in OMC-1 and OMC-3 both appear to be aligned perpendicular to the fibers, which are denser structures within the filament, but the field in OMC-2 is aligned along with the fibers. All these suggest that gravity, turbulence, and magnetic field are each playing a leading role in OMC-1, 2, and 3, respectively. While OMC-2 and 3 have almost the same gas mass, density, and non-thermal velocity dispersion, there are on average younger and fewer young stellar objects in OMC-3, providing evidence that a stronger magnetic field will induce slower and less efficient star formation in molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Bulge Oscillation Driven by Outflows of Active Galactic Nuclei. I. Fast Outflow Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17725v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing evidence for star formation inside outflows of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The formed stars are injected into bulges and give rise to perturbation of bulges. In this paper, we investigate the issues of non-rotating, spherically symmetric bulges under the perturbation of fast, massive outflows with stars formed inside. We show that the potential perturbation of outflows together with injection and dynamical friction of these stars could drive bulge oscillations. Still, we find non-zero radial velocity of bulges will be driven by the episodic outflows of AGNs and after the AGN quenched, the radial velocity will tend to zero within a timescale $\sim\tau_{\rm AGN}$, which is the AGN's lifetime. For some typical values of bulges and AGNs, we find the expansion and contraction velocities are of a few $10\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ for $10^{10}\,M_\odot$ bulges and mass outflowing rate $500\,M_\odot/\rm yr$, which would give observational signatures.</description>

      <title>Correlation between planet formation rate and gas surface density: an analog of Kennicutt Schmidt law for planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficiency of planet formation is a fundamental question in planetary science, gaining increasing significance as observational data from planet-forming disks accumulates. Here we derive from first principles a correlation between the planet formation rate (PFR) and the gas surface density, i.e. $\rm{PFR}\propto \Sigma_g^n$. This relation serves as an analog for the well-established Kennicutt-Schmidt law for star-forming galaxies. We study the different planet formation mechanisms and the density dependence in each one of them, to finally formulate a simple relation. We find that the powerlaw ranges between $n\approx 4/3-2$, depending on the type of the forming planet, when we carry out different analyses for the formation rates of terrestrial planets, gas giants, and also planets formed by gravitational instability. We then compare our results with the available observational data. The relation we derive here aims to shed more light on the interpretation of observational data as well as analytical models, and give a new perspective on the properties of planet formation and its connection to gas.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of the Dust Declines in R Coronae Borealis Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The R Coronae Borealis (RCB) variables are rare, hydrogen-deficient, carbon-rich supergiants known for large, erratic declines in brightness due to dust formation. Recently, the number of known RCB stars in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds has increased from $\sim$30 to 162. We use all-sky and targeted photometric surveys to create the longest possible light curves for all known RCB stars and systematically study their declines. Our study, the largest of its kind, includes measurements of decline activity levels, morphologies, and periodicities for nearly all RCB stars. We confirm previous predictions that cool RCB stars exhibit more declines than warm RCBs, supporting a relationship between dust formation and condensation temperatures. We also find evidence for two distinct dust production mechanisms. R CrB and SU Tau show decline onsets consistent with a Poisson process, suggesting their dust production is driven by stochastic processes, such as convection. In contrast, RY Sgr's declines correlate with its pulsation period, suggesting that its dust production is driven by pulsationally-induced shocks. Finally, we show that the dust properties of the related class of DY~Per variables differ from those of the RCB stars, suggesting differences in their evolutionary status.</description>

      <title>Photometric Stellar Parameters for 195,478 Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16930v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar atmospheric parameters and physical properties of stars in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) are of great significance for the study of exoplanets, stellar activity, and asteroseismology. However, despite extensive effort over the past decades, accurate spectroscopic estimates of these parameters are available for only about half of the stars in the full KIC catalog. In our work, by training relationships between photometric colors and spectroscopic stellar parameters from Gaia DR3, the Kepler Issac-Newton Survey, LAMOST DR10, and APOGEE DR17, we have obtained atmospheric-parameter estimates for over 195,000 stars, accounting for 97% of the total sample of KIC stars. We obtain 1{\sigma} uncertainties of 0.1 dex on metallicity [Fe/H], 100 K on effective temperature $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ , and 0.2 dex on surface gravity log $g$. In addition, based on these atmospheric parameters, we estimated the ages, masses, radii, and surface gravities of these stars using the commonly adopted isochrone-fitting approach. The resulting precisions are 20% for ages, 0.1 $M_{\odot}$ for masses, 0.01 $R_{\odot}$ for radii and 0.1 dex for surface gravities. These accurate parameters are expected to provide valuable insights for future studies on various fields.</description>

      <title>Searching for Galactic Red Supergiants with Gaia RVS Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red supergiants (RSGs) are essential to understanding the evolution and the contribution to the interstellar medium of massive stars. However, the number of identified RSGs within the Milky Way is still limited mainly due to the difficulty of measuring stellar extinction and distance. The release of approximately one million RVS spectra in Gaia DR3 presents new opportunity for identifying Galactic RSGs, because the equivalent width of the calcium triplet lines (EW(CaT)) in the spectra is an excellent indicator of stellar surface gravity. This work uses the RVS spectra with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 100 to search for the Galactic RSGs. The dwarf stars and red giants are removed and the RSG candidates are selected by the location in the EW(CaT) vs. BP-RP diagram. The early-type RSG candidates (K0-M2) are then identified by BP-RP &gt; 1.584 and EW(CaT) &gt; 1.1 nm. To identify late-type RSG candidates (after M2), the criteria of the average equivalent widths of TiO in the XP spectra (EW(TiO)) &gt; 10 nm, the color index K-W3 &lt; 0.5 and the period-amplitude sequence from Gaia DR3 LPV catalog are further applied to reduce the contamination of late-type red giants and asymptotic giant branch stars. This method yields 30 early-type (K0-M2) and 6196 late-type (after M2) RSG candidates, which is a significant increase to the present Galactic RSG sample. The application of this approach to the spectra with SNR &gt; 50 results in 48 early-type and 11,491 late-type RSG candidates. This preliminary analysis paves the way for more extensive research with Gaia DR4 when larger spectral datasets are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of Galactic RSG populations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic helicity fluxes in dynamos from rotating inhomogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze direct numerical simulations of large-scale dynamos in inhomogeneous nonhelically-driven rotating turbulence with and without shear. The forcing is modulated so that the turbulent intensity peaks in the middle of the computational box and drops to nearly zero at the two ends above and below the midplane. A large-scale dynamo is driven by an $\alpha$ effect of opposite signs between the two hemispheres. In the presence of shear, the hemispheric magnetic helicity flux from small-scale fields becomes important and can even overcompensate for the magnetic helicity transferred by the $\alpha$ effect between large and small scales. This effect has not previously been observed in non-shearing simulations. Our numerical simulations show that the hemispheric magnetic helicity fluxes are nearly independent of the magnetic Reynolds number, but those between large and small scales, and the consequent dynamo effect, are still found to decrease with increasing Reynolds number -- just like in nonshearing dynamos. However, in contrast to nonshearing dynamos, where the generated mean magnetic field declines with increasing magnetic Reynolds number, it is now found to remain independent of it. This suggests that catastrophic dynamo quenching is alleviated by the shear-induced hemispheric small-scale magnetic helicity fluxes that can even overcompensate the fluxes between large and small scales and thereby cause resistive contributions.</description>

      <title>Warped accretion disks and quasars with episodic periodicity of long-term variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17728v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been found that some quasars are undergoing quasi-periodic variations (most of them with damped amplitudes) in optical bands from long-term monitoring campaigns, but how to explain the origin of such light curve variations still remains an open question. In this paper, we use the warped accretion disks model to explain the quasi-periodical variations. This model employs a free-bending wave traveling in an accretion disk which causes the orientation of the central part of the disk to oscillate from the line of sight, resulting in a quasi-periodical variation. We numerically solve the governing equation of warp propagation and calculate the simulated R-band light curves, finding that the periodical light curves generated by this model have damped amplitudes. To compare with observations, we select SDSSJ134820.42+194831.5 as a preliminary example from a sample of periodic quasar candidates by combining CRTS with other public survey data, and fitted its light curve with different observational angles. Our result gives a reduced $\chi^{2}\simeq 2.4$, implying that the model might give insights to future application of warped disk model.</description>

      <title>NIHAO-RiNG: A Comparison of Simulated Disc Galaxies from GASOLINE and GIZMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize the public GIZMO code to simulate twelve disc galaxies from the NIHAO suite simulated with the GASOLINE code, then compare the corresponding galaxies in the two simulations. We find that while both codes with the same initial conditions and large-scale environments can successfully produce similar disc galaxies, significant differences are still seen in many properties of the galaxies, particularly in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) environment they reside. Specifically, the thermal feedback recipe used in GASOLINE results in ubiquitous long-lasting collimated outflows, primarily driven by high-density hot interstellar medium (ISM) from the galaxy center, and inflows of gas not aligned with the outflow cools rapidly and flows towards the galactic center. In contrast, galaxies from GIZMO code do not exhibit large-scale outflows at low redshifts, but instead display quasi-virialized hot gaseous halos that arise from the strong interaction between inflow of gas and feedback driven outflow. Therefore, the origins of mass and angular momentum of the cold disc in the two simulations are quite different, even though the final morphologies of corresponding galaxies are similar at $z\sim0$. The differences in the distribution of CGM gas are mainly due to different feedback models implemented in the two codes, thus future observations of CGM provide valuable insight into the physics governing the baryon cycle in disc galaxies.</description>

      <title>Model-independent Reconstruction of UV Luminosity Function and Reionization Epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a first comprehensive study of the Luminosity Function (LF) using a non-parametric approach. We use Gaussian Process to fit available luminosity data between redshifts $z \sim 2-8$. Our free-form LF in the non-parametric approach rules out the conventional Schechter function model to describe the abundance-magnitude relation at redshifts $z=3$ and $4$. Hints of deviation from the Schechter function are also noticed at redshifts 2, 7 and 8 at lower statistical significance. Significant deviation starts for brighter ionizing sources at $M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -21$. The UV luminosity density data at different redshifts are then derived by integrating the LFs obtained from both methods with a truncation magnitude of $-17$. In our analysis, we also include the first 90 arcmin$^2$ JWST/NIRCam data at $z \sim 9-12$. Since at larger magnitudes, we do not find major deviations from the Schechter function, the integrated luminosity density differs marginally between the two methods. Finally, we obtain the history of reionization from a joint analysis of UV luminosity density data along with the ionization fraction data and Planck observation of Cosmic Microwave Background. The history of reionization is not affected by the deviation of LFs from Schechter function at lower magnitudes. We derive reionization optical depth to be $\tau_{\rm re}=0.0494^{+0.0007}_{-0.0006}$ and the duration between 10$\%$ and 90$\% $completion of ionization process is found to be $\Delta z\sim 1.627^{+0.059}_{-0.071}$.</description>

      <title>Growth of Massive Black-Holes in FFB Galaxies at Cosmic Dawn</title>

Abstract: The scenario of feedback-free starbursts (FFB), which predicts excessively bright galaxies at cosmic dawn as observed using JWST, may provide a natural setting for black hole (BH) growth. This involves the formation of intermediate-mass seed BHs and their runaway mergers into super-massive BHs with high BH-to-stellar mass ratios and low AGN luminosities. We present a scenario of merger-driven BH growth in FFB galaxies and study its feasibility. BH seeds form within the building blocks of the FFB galaxies, namely, thousands of compact star clusters, each starbursting in a free-fall time of a few Myr before the onset of stellar and supernova feedback. The BH seeds form by rapid core collapse in the FFB clusters, in a few free-fall times, sped up by the migration of massive stars due to the young, broad stellar mass function and stimulated by a `gravo-gyro' instability due to internal cluster rotation and flattening. BHs of $10^4 M_\odot$ are expected in $10^6 M_\odot$ FFB clusters within sub-kpc galactic disks at $z \sim 10$. The BHs then migrate to the galaxy center by dynamical friction, hastened by the compact FFB stellar galactic disk configuration. Efficient mergers of the BH seeds will produce $10^{6-8} M_\odot$ BHs with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio $\sim 0.01$ by $z \sim 4-7$, as observed. The growth of the central BH by mergers can overcome the bottleneck introduced by gravitational wave recoils if the BHs inspiral within a relatively cold disk or if the escape velocity from the galaxy is boosted by a wet compaction event. Such events, common in massive galaxies at high redshifts, can also help by speeding up the inward BH migration and by providing central gas to assist with the final parsec problem. The cold disk version of the FFB scenario provides a feasible route for the formation of supermassive BHs.</description>

      <title>Photometry and kinematics of dwarf galaxies from the Apertif HI survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Understanding the dwarf galaxy population in low density environments is crucial for testing the LCDM cosmological model. The increase in diversity towards low mass galaxies is seen as an increase in the scatter of scaling relations such as the stellar mass-size and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR), and is also demonstrated by recent in-depth studies of an extreme subclass of dwarf galaxies of low surface brightness, but large physical sizes, called ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). Aims. We select galaxies from the Apertif HI survey, and apply a constraint on their i-band absolute magnitude to exclude high mass systems. The sample consists of 24 galaxies, and span HI mass ranges of 8.6 &lt; log ($M_{HI}/M_{Sun}$) &lt; 9.7 and stellar mass range of 8.0 &lt; log ($M_*/M_{Sun}$) &lt; 9.7 (with only three galaxies having log ($M_*/M_{Sun}$) &gt; 9). Methods. We determine the geometrical parameters of the HI and stellar discs, build kinematic models from the HI data using 3DBarolo, and extract surface brightness profiles in g-, r- and i-band from the Pan-STARRS 1 photometric survey. Results. We find that, at fixed stellar mass, our HI selected dwarfs have larger optical effective radii than isolated, optically-selected dwarfs from the literature. We find misalignments between the optical and HI morphologies for some of our sample. For most of our galaxies, we use the HI morphology to determine their kinematics, and we stress that deep optical observations are needed to trace the underlying stellar discs. Standard dwarfs in our sample follow the same BTFR of high-mass galaxies, whereas UDGs are slightly offset towards lower rotational velocities, in qualitative agreement with results from previous studies. Finally, our sample features a fraction (25%) of dwarf galaxies in pairs that is significantly larger with respect to previous estimates based on optical spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>Galaxy evolution in the post-merger regime. II -- Post-merger quenching peaks within 500 Myr of coalescence</title>

Abstract: (Abridged) Mechanisms for quenching star formation in galaxies remain hotly debated, with galaxy mergers an oft-proposed pathway. In Ellison et al. (2022) we tested this scenario by quantifying the fraction of recently and rapidly quenched post-starbursts (PSBs) in a sample of post-merger galaxies identified in the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS). With our recent development of the Multi-Model Merger Identifier (MUMMI) neural network ensemble (Ferreira et al. 2024a,b), we are now additionally able to predict the time since coalescence (T_PM) for the UNIONS post-merger galaxies up to T_PM = 1.8 Gyr, allowing us to further dissect the merger sequence and measure more precisely when quenching occurs. Based on a sample of 5927 z&lt;0.3 post-mergers identified in UNIONS, we find that the post-coalescence population evolves from one dominated by star-forming (and starbursting) galaxies at 0 &lt; T_PM &lt; 0.16 Gyr, through to a population that is dominated by quenched galaxies by T_PM ~ 1.5 Gyr. We find a PSB excess throughout the post-merger regime, but with a clear peak at 0.16 &lt; T_PM &lt; 0.48 Gyr. In this post-merger time range PSBs are more common than in control galaxies by factors of 30-100, an excess that drops sharply at longer times since merger. We also quantify the fraction of PSBs that are mergers and find that the majority (75%) of classically selected E+A are identified as mergers, with a lower merger fraction (60%) amongst PCA selected PSBs. Our results demonstrate that 1) galaxy-galaxy interactions can lead to rapid post-merger quenching within 0.5 Gyr of coalescence, 2) the majority of (but not all) PSBs at low z are linked to mergers and 3) quenching pathways are diverse, with different PSB selection techniques likely identifying galaxies quenched by different physical processes with an additional dependence on stellar mass.</description>

      <title>Blowing star formation away in AGN Hosts (BAH) -- II. Investigating the origin of the H2 emission excess in nearby galaxies with JWST MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) observations of 3C 293 (UGC 8782), CGCG 012-070 and NGC 3884 to investigate the origin of the H$_2$ emission. These three nearby Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) hosts are known to present H$_2$ emission excess relative to star-forming galaxies, as traced by the H$_2$ S(3)/PAH$_{\rm 11.3\mu m}$ line ratio. We define the kinematically disturbed region (KDR) by the AGN and the virially dominated region (VDR) based on the H$_2$ line widths, using the $W{\rm 80}$ parameter. From the correlations between $W{\rm 80}$ and H$_2$ S(3)/PAH${\rm 11.3\mu m}$, as well as the higher H$2$ S(5)/H$2$ S(3) and [Fe II]${\rm 5.34 \mu m}$/PAH${\rm 11.3\mu m}$ ratios and flatter power-law temperature distributions observed in the KDR, we conclude that the H$_2$ emission in the KDR is primarily driven by shock-heated gas. For 3C 293, the KDR is co-spatial with the radio core, indicating that the origin of the shocks is the interaction of the radio jet with the interstellar medium, which is also responsible for the observed molecular and ionized gas outflows in this source. The other galaxies are weak radio sources; however, due to the lack of high-resolution radio images, we cannot rule out low-power jets as the origin of the shock-heated H$_2$. Our results indicate that the excess H$_2$ emission excess is associated to shock heating of the gas, generated by outflows or by the interaction of the radio jet with the ambient gas.</description>

      <title>The physical and chemical structure of Sagittarius B2, VIII. Full molecular line survey of hot cores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The giant molecular cloud complex Sagittarius B2 (Sgr~B2) in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy hosts several high-mass star formation sites, with Sgr~B2(M) and Sgr~B2(N) being the main centers of activity. This analysis aims to comprehensively model each core spectrum, considering molecular lines, dust attenuation, and free-free emission interactions. We describe the molecular content analysis of each hot core and identify the chemical composition of detected sources. Using ALMA's high sensitivity, we aim to characterize the hot core population in Sgr~B2(M) and N, gaining a better understanding of the different evolutionary phases of star formation processes in this complex. We conducted an unbiased ALMA spectral line survey of 47 sources in band 6 (211-275 GHz). Chemical composition and column densities were derived using XCLASS, assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium. Quantitative descriptions for each molecule were determined, considering all emission and absorption features across the spectral range. Temperature and velocity distributions were analyzed, and derived abundances were compared with other spectral line surveys. We identified 65 isotopologs from 41 different molecules, ranging from light molecules to complex organic compounds, originating from various environments. Most sources in the Sgr~B2 complex were assigned different evolutionary phases of high-mass star formation. Sgr~B2(N) hot cores show more complex molecules such as CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$OCHO, and CH$_3$OCH$_3$, while M cores contain lighter molecules such as SO$_2$, SO, and NO. Some sulfur-bearing molecules are more abundant in N than in M. The derived molecular abundances can be used for comparison and to constrain astrochemical models. Inner sources in both regions were generally more developed than outer sources, with some exceptions.</description>

      <title>A grand-design spiral galaxy 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a large ($\sim 10$ kpc diameter), massive ($\log(M_\star/M_\odot) = 10.15^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$), grand-design spiral galaxy with photometric redshift $z_{\text{phot}} = 4.03$ in the UNCOVER and Medium Band Mega Science surveys with JWST. This is the highest redshift spiral galaxy discovered with JWST so far. In the rest-frame near-UV and far-UV, we clearly see the beads-on-a-string pattern of star formation; in the rest-frame visible bands, each string appears as an arm. Spectral energy distribution modeling using the Bagpipes code is strongly constrained by detections and flux measurements in 21 JWST and HST filters. The stellar mass-weighted age is 228 Myr, implying that 50% of the stars in the galaxy formed after $z \sim 4.5$. This is a highly star-forming galaxy with a star formation rate (SFR) of $57.57^{+1.80}_{-1.90} \, M_\odot\, \text{yr}^{-1}$. We detect strong H-$\alpha$ + [NII] emission from the entire disk. The detection of a spiral galaxy at $z \sim 4$ indicates that massive and large spiral galaxies and disks were already in place merely 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang.</description>

Abstract: Dense, cold gas is the key ingredient for star formation. Over the last two decades, HCN(1-0) emission has been utilised as the most accessible dense gas tracer to study external galaxies. We present new measurements tracing the relationship between dense gas tracers, bulk molecular gas tracers, and star formation in the ALMA ALMOND survey, the largest sample of resolved (1-2 kpc resolution) HCN maps of galaxies in the local universe (d &lt; 25 Mpc). We measure HCN/CO, a line ratio sensitive to the physical density distribution, and SFR/HCN, a proxy for the dense gas star formation efficiency, as a function of molecular gas surface density, stellar mass surface density, and dynamical equilibrium pressure across 31 galaxies, increasing the number of galaxies by a factor of &gt; 3 over the previous largest such study (EMPIRE). HCN/CO increases (slope of ~ 0.5 and scatter of ~ 0.2 dex), while SFR/HCN decreases (slope of ~ -0.6 and scatter of ~ 0.4 dex) with increasing molecular gas surface density, stellar mass surface density and pressure. Galaxy centres with high stellar mass surface density show a factor of a few higher HCN/CO and lower SFR/HCN compared to the disc average, but both environments follow the same average trend. Our results emphasise that molecular gas properties vary systematically with the galactic environment and demonstrate that the scatter in the Gao-Solomon relation (SFR against HCN) is of physical origin.</description>

Abstract: The Cosmic Dark Ages mark a pivotal era of the universe's evolution, transitioning from a neutral, opaque medium to the emergence of the first stars and galaxies that initiated cosmic reionization. This study examines the thermodynamics of the intergalactic medium (IGM), molecular hydrogen cooling, and gravitational collapse that led to structure formation. Key emission lines, such as Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha $) and [C II] 158 $\mu m$, are analyzed as tracers of star formation, metallicity, and IGM conditions. Simulations highlight Ly$\alpha $ scattering profiles and [C II] emission as critical diagnostics of early galaxy evolution. The findings provide a theoretical framework to interpret high-redshift observations, advancing our understanding of the universe's transition from darkness to illumination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence simulations require understanding numerical dissipation. We quantify numerical viscosity and resistivity in subsonic (M=0.1) and supersonic (M=10) turbulence regimes. The hydrodynamic (Re) and magnetic Reynolds numbers (Rm) on the turbulence driving scale l_turb in a cubic domain of side length L with N^3 resolution elements are well-described by Re=[2(N/N_Re)(l_turb/L)]^p_Re and Rm=[2(N/N_Rm)(l_turb/L)]^p_Rm. We provide two sets of fit values of (N_Re,p_Re,N_Rm,p_Rm): one with p_Re &amp; p_Rm fixed at their theoretical values, and the other one allowing all 4 parameters to vary. The sets for M=0.1 are (1.57_{-0.12}^{+0.10},4/3,1.55_{-0.14}^{+0.45},4/3) and (0.83_{-0.08}^{+0.09},1.20_{-0.02}^{+0.02},4.19_{-4.05}^{+2.95},1.60_{-0.33}^{+0.18}), respectively. For M=10, they are (3.55_{-0.56}^{+0.78},3/2,1.03_{-0.11}^{+0.12},3/2) and (10.46_{-0.85}^{+0.96},1.90_{-0.04}^{+0.04},0.44_{-0.23}^{+0.61},1.32_{-0.09}^{+0.17}). The resulting magnetic Prandtl numbers (Pm=Rm/Re) are consistent with constant values of 1.0_{-0.2}^{+0.3} for M=0.1, and 6.2_{-4.8}^{+5.6} for M=10. These apply when the magnetic energy (E_mag) is &lt;10% of the kinetic energy (E_kin). When E_mag/E_kin~0.1-1, Rm is reduced by a factor~3 (increase in N_Rm by a factor~2) for M=0.1, while Rm for M=10 and Re (for any M) remain largely unaffected. We compare our Re-N relation with 14 other simulations from the literature, employing various numerical methods (with &amp; without Riemann solvers, different reconstruction schemes &amp; orders, and smoothed particle hydrodynamics), and find agreement within a factor of 3. Additionally, we compare these results to target Re and Rm values from simulations with explicit dissipation. These comparisons and our relations help users determine the Re and Rm achievable at a given N, ensuring physical dissipation dominates over numerical dissipation.</description>

      <title>Single and merger soliton dynamics in scalar field dark matter with and without self-interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (abridged)Scalar field dark matter (SFDM) made of bosons has become a popular alternative to the CDM paradigm, especially for its potential to cure the so-called "small-scale problems" of CDM. Cosmological simulations have determined that SFDM halos exhibit a core-envelope structure, but they are computationally expensive. Halo cores have been found to be well approximated by "solitons". The study of single soliton and multiple soliton merger dynamics constitutes a more feasible approach to investigate in detail the genuine quantum dynamics of SFDM and its interplay with self-gravity for a multitude of free boson parameters. In this paper, we present dedicated simulations of single solitons and binary soliton mergers, for models without and with a 2-boson, repulsive, weak to intermediate self-interaction (SI), as well as multiple soliton mergers without SI. We adapt the open-source code Pyultralight to simulate solitons with SI and make our amended code public. We derive numerical scaling relations between the central density and mass of solitons for several values of SI and find deviations from the monotonic relations known from fuzzy dark matter (no SI), or the strongly repulsive Thomas-Fermi regime. Solitons with SI exemplify larger cores and lower central densities, compared to solitons without SI. Using our simulations, we extract numerical density profiles for solitons and postmerger objects, and fit them to analytical functions of previous literature. We find a mild preference for Gaussian cores for objects with SI, while the envelopes of postmergers can be fit to NFW profiles albeit with some caution as we discuss. Similar to previous work, we find global, persistent oscillations for solitons as well as postmergers, confirming that self-gravitating SFDM has very long relaxation times, although objects with SI exhibit oscillations of comparatively smaller amplitude.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Radial Acceleration Relation of Dwarf Galaxies with Emergent Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine whether the radial acceleration relation (RAR) of dwarf galaxies can be explained by Verlinde's emergent gravity. This is the extension of arXiv:2206.11685v3, which examines the RAR of typical spiral galaxies, to less massive systems. To do this, we compile the line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles of 30 dwarf galaxies in the Local Group from the literature. We then calculate the expected gravitational acceleration from the stellar component in the framework of the emergent gravity, and compare it with that from observations. The calculated acceleration with the emergent gravity under the assumption of a quasi-de Sitter universe agrees with the observed one within the uncertainty. Our results suggest that the emergent gravity can explain the kinematics of galaxies without introducing dark matter, even for less massive galaxies where dark matter is expected to dominate. This sharply contrasts with MOND, where a new interpolating function has to be introduced for dwarf galaxies to explain their kinematics without dark matter.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the astrophysical consequences of black holes in quadratic gravity, characterized by the parameters $S_0$, $S_2$, $m_0$ and $m_2$, in addition to the black hole mass $M$. To evaluate the physical validity of the fundamental quadratic gravity black hole solutions, we analyze their gravitational lensing properties in the strong field regime. Specifically, we examine the shadow cast by the quadratic gravity black hole and constrain its parameters using observational data from the $M87^*$ and $Sgr A^*$ supermassive black holes. Our analysis reveals that, within the $1\sigma$ confidence level, a significant portion of the parameter space for quadratic gravity black holes is consistent with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of $M87^*$ and $Sgr A^*$. This suggests that these black holes are plausible candidates for describing astrophysical black holes. As an additional observational test, we perform a detailed investigation of the strong gravitational lensing properties of these black holes. We explore the fundamental strong lensing observables in detail, including the angular positions and separations of the lensed images, the relative magnifications, the radius of the outermost Einstein ring and the relativistic time delay between images. We compare the predictions of the quadratic gravity black hole for each observable with those of the classical Schwarzschild solution using realistic astrophysical data. Our findings provide a pathway for testing quadratic gravity at the galactic and extragalactic scales, offering new insights into the observational properties of black hole solutions within this framework.</description>

      <title>X-ray properties of coronal emission in radio quiet Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11321</link>

Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powerful sources of panchromatic radiation. All AGN emit in X-rays, contributing around $\sim 5-10\%$ of the AGN bolometric luminosity. The X-ray emitting region, popularly known as the corona, is geometrically and radiatively compact with a size typically $\lesssim 10 \, R_{\rm G}$ (gravitational radii). The rapid and extreme variability in X-rays also suggest that the corona must be a dynamic structure. Decades of X-ray studies have shed much light on the topic, but the nature and origin of AGN corona are still not clearly understood. This is mostly due to the complexities involved in several physical processes at play in the high-gravity, high-density and high-temperature region in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH). It is still not clear how exactly the corona is energetically and physically sustained near a SMBH. The ubiquity of coronal emission in AGN points to their fundamental role in black hole accretion processes. In this review we discuss the X-ray observational properties of corona in radio quiet AGN.</description>
