      <title>A Formalization of Co-Transcriptional Splicing as an Operation on Formal Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RNA co-transcriptionality is the process where RNA sequences are spliced while being transcribed from DNA templates. This process holds potential as a key tool for molecular programming. Co-transcriptional folding has been shown to be programmable for assembling nano-scale RNA structures, and recent advances have proven its Turing universality. While post-transcriptional splicing has been extensively studied, co-transcriptional splicing is gaining attention for its potential to save resources and space in molecular systems. However, its unpredictability has limited its practical applications. In this paper, we focus on engineering co-transcriptional splicing, moving beyond natural occurrences to program RNA sequences that produce specific target sequences through DNA templates. We introduce a formal model of co-transcriptional splicing, defined by constant-, linear-, and logarithmic-bounded hairpin deletion operations, as well as an unbounded hairpin deletion operation. We examine the complexity of the template constructability problem associated with these operations and study the closure properties of the languages they generate, providing insights for RNA template design in molecular programming systems.</description>

      <title>Effective Computation of Generalized Abelian Complexity for Pisot Type Substitutive Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized abelian equivalence compares words by their factors up to a certain bounded length. The associated complexity function counts the equivalence classes for factors of a given size of an infinite sequence. How practical is this notion? When can these equivalence relations and complexity functions be computed efficiently? We study the fixed points of substitution of Pisot type. Each of their $k$-abelian complexities is bounded and the Parikh vectors of their length-$n$ prefixes form synchronized sequences in the associated Dumont--Thomas numeration system. Therefore, the $k$-abelian complexity of Pisot substitution fixed points is automatic in the same numeration system. Two effective generic construction approaches are investigated using the \texttt{Walnut} theorem prover and are applied to several examples. We obtain new properties of the Tribonacci sequence, such as a uniform bound for its factor balancedness together with a two-dimensional linear representation of its generalized abelian complexity functions.</description>

      <title>The complexity of reachability problems in strongly connected finite automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several reachability problems in finite automata, such as completeness of NFAs and synchronisation of total DFAs, correspond to fundamental properties of sets of nonnegative matrices. In particular, the two mentioned properties correspond to matrix mortality and ergodicity, which ask whether there exists a product of the input matrices that is equal to, respectively, the zero matrix and a matrix with a column of strictly positive entries only. The case where the input automaton is strongly connected (that is, the corresponding set of nonnegative matrices is irreducible) frequently appears in applications and often admits better properties than the general case. In this paper, we address the existence of such properties from the computational complexity point of view, and develop a versatile technique to show that several NL-complete problems remain NL-complete in the strongly connected case. Namely, we show that deciding if a binary total DFA is synchronising is NL-complete even if it is promised to be strongly connected, and that deciding completeness of a binary unambiguous NFA with very limited nondeterminism is NL-complete under the same promise.</description>

      <title>A Recursive Block Pillar Structure in the Kolakoski Sequence K(1,3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kolakoski sequence K(a,b) over {a, b} is the unique sequence starting with a that equals its own run-length encoding. While the classical case K(1,2) remains deeply enigmatic, generalizations exhibit markedly different behaviors depending on the parity of a and b. The sequence K(1,3), a same-parity case over the alphabet {1,3}, is known to possess regular structure and a calculable symbol frequency. This paper reveals a complementary structural property: a nested block-pillar recursion of the form B_{n+1} = B_n + P_n + B_n, and P_{n+1} = G(P_n, 3), where each B_n is a prefix of K(1,3), and G is a generation operator based on run-length encoding. We show that B_{n+1} = G(B_n, 1), leading to a self-replicating description of K(1,3). This structure allows derivation of exact recurrences for length, symbol counts, and density, proving exponential growth and convergence to the known limit d = (5 - sqrt(5)) / 10. Our analysis highlights the structured nature of same-parity Kolakoski sequences and offers a constructive alternative to morphic generation.</description>

      <title>Probability and Angelic Nondeterminism with Multiset Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a version of probabilistic Kleene algebra with angelic nondeterminism and a corresponding class of automata. Our approach implements semantics via distributions over multisets in order to overcome theoretical barriers arising from the lack of a distributive law between the powerset and Giry monads. We produce a full Kleene theorem and a coalgebraic theory, as well as both operational and denotational semantics and equational reasoning principles.</description>
