      <title>Neural Network-Guided Symbolic Regression for Interpretable Descriptor Discovery in Perovskite Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the activity of oxide perovskite catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires descriptors that are both accurate and physically interpretable. While symbolic regression (SR) offers a path to discover such formulas, its performance degrades with high-dimensional inputs and small datasets. We present a two-phase framework that combines neural networks (NN), feature importance analysis, and symbolic regression (SR) to discover interpretable descriptors for OER activity in oxide perovskites. In Phase I, using a small dataset and seven structural features, we reproduce and improve the known {\mu}/t descriptor by engineering composite features and applying symbolic regression, achieving training and validation MAEs of 22.8 and 20.8 meV, respectively. In Phase II, we expand to 164 features, reduce dimensionality, and identify LUMO energy as a key electronic descriptor. A final formula using {\mu}/t, {\mu}/RA, and LUMO energy achieves improved accuracy (training and validation MAEs of 22.1 and 20.6 meV) with strong physical interpretability. Our results demonstrate that NN-guided symbolic regression enables accurate, interpretable, and physically meaningful descriptor discovery in data-scarce regimes, indicating interpretability need not sacrifice accuracy for materials informatics.</description>

      <title>AMBER: Algorithm for Multiplexing spectrometer Background Estimation with Rotation-independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the art neutron spectrometers enable simultaneous measurements of high-dimensional datasets, allowing for a large collection rate of dynamic material properties. In this paper, we present the Algorithm for Multiplexing spectrometer Background Estimation with Rotation-independence (AMBER), which is a segmentation algorithm designed to decompose measured neutron scattering data into model-agnostic foreground and background contributions. The method takes advantage of the fact that background and foreground signals are measured simultaneously during the data collection process, relying on rotational independence of background contributions. The algorithm, initially developed for multiplexing neutron spectrometers, aims to strongly reduce time consuming expert input, therefore promoting full data set usage while minimizing the source of systematic errors.</description>

      <title>Robust Causal Discovery in Real-World Time Series with Power-Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring causal relationships in stochastic time series is a challenging yet crucial task with a vast range of applications, including finance, economics, neuroscience, and climate science. Many algorithms for Causal Discovery (CD) have been proposed, but they often exhibit a high sensitivity to noise, resulting in misleading causal inferences when applied to real data. In this paper, we observe that the frequency spectra of typical real-world time series follow a power-law distribution, notably due to an inherent self-organizing behavior. Leveraging this insight, we build a robust CD method based on the extraction of power -law spectral features that amplify genuine causal signals. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets with known causal structures, demonstrating its robustness and practical relevance.</description>

      <title>Active Deep Kernel Learning of Molecular Properties: Realizing Dynamic Structural Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As vast databases of chemical identities become increasingly available, the challenge shifts to how we effectively explore and leverage these resources to study molecular properties. This paper presents an active learning approach for molecular discovery using Deep Kernel Learning (DKL), demonstrated on the QM9 dataset. DKL links structural embeddings directly to properties, creating organized latent spaces that prioritize relevant property information. By iteratively recalculating embedding vectors in alignment with target properties, DKL uncovers concentrated maxima representing key molecular properties and reveals unexplored regions with potential for innovation. This approach underscores DKL's potential in advancing molecular research and discovery.</description>

      <title>Phase analysis of Ising machines and their implications on optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ising machines, which are dynamical systems designed to operate in a parallel and iterative manner, have emerged as a new paradigm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Despite computational advantages, the quality of solutions depends heavily on the form of dynamics and tuning of parameters, which are in general set heuristically due to the lack of systematic insights. Here, we focus on optimal Ising machine design by analyzing phase diagrams of spin distributions in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. We find that that the ground state can be achieved in the phase where the spin distribution becomes binary, and optimal solutions are produced where the binary phase and gapless phase coexist. Our analysis shows that such coexistence phase region can be expanded by carefully placing a digitization operation, giving rise to a family of superior Ising machines, as illustrated by the proposed algorithm digCIM.</description>
