      <title>Towards an Interpretation of the First Measurements of Energy Correlators in the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy correlators have recently been proposed as a class of jet substructure observables that directly link experimental measurements of the asymptotic energy flux with the field theoretic description of the underlying microscopic dynamics. This link holds particular promise in heavy-ion physics, where both experimental measurements and theoretical interpretations are inherently complex. With recent measurements of energy correlators in proton-proton collisions, the first measurement of these observables on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions underscores the importance of a theoretical understanding of their behavior in this complex environment. In this manuscript, we extend our previous calculations to account for several effects necessary for a qualitative understanding of the behavior of energy correlators on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions. Through a semi-analytic approach implemented in a hydrodynamically expanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP), we account for medium-induced radiation with leading broadening effects, selection biases arising from energy loss, and a description of the confinement transition. Our results represent a crucial first step towards interpreting the measurements of energy correlators on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions, which marks a significant milestone in connecting heavy-ion experiment and fundamental quantum field theory, in the quest to disentangle the microscopic dynamics of the QGP.</description>

      <title>A Stress Test of Global PDF Fits: Closure Testing the MSHT PDFs and a First Direct Comparison to the Neural Net Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first global closure test of the fixed parameterisation (MSHT) approach to PDF fitting. We find that the default MSHT20 parameterisation can reproduce the features of the input set in such a closure test to well within the textbook uncertainties. This provides strong evidence that parameterisation inflexibility in the MSHT20 fit is not a significant issue in the data region. We also present the first completely like-for-like comparison between two global PDF fits, namely MSHT and NNPDF, where the only difference is guaranteed to be due to the fitting methodology. To achieve this, we present a fit to the NNPDF4.0 data and theory inputs, but with the MSHT fixed parameterisation. We find that this gives a moderately, but noticeably, better fit quality than the central NNPDF4.0 fits, both with perturbative and fitted charm, and that this difference persists at the level of the PDFs and benchmark cross sections. The NNPDF4.0 uncertainties are found to be broadly in line with the MSHT results if a textbook $T^2=1$ tolerance is applied, but to be significantly smaller if a tolerance typical of the MSHT20 fit is applied. This points to an inherent inconsistency between these approaches. We discuss the need for an enlarged tolerance criterion in global PDF fits in detail, and demonstrate the impact of data/theory inconsistencies in the closure test setting; namely, these do not lead to any increase in the $T^2=1$ PDF uncertainty. We also investigate the impact of restricting the PDF parameterisation to have fewer free parameters than the default MSHT20 case, and find this can be significant at the level of both closure tests and the full fit.</description>

      <title>Dimension-8 SMEFT contact-terms for vector-pair production via on-shell Higgsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the dimension-8 standard-model effective theory (SMEFT) contact terms relevant for vector-pair production at the LHC and lepton colliders. We first list the relevant dimension-8 massless SMEFT amplitudes, and then obtain the low-energy amplitudes using on-shell Higgsing. In all cases, the contributions we calculate are the leading-order contributions to 4-point contact-terms; the dimension-6 SMEFT merely corrects the three-point couplings entering the amplitudes. Since they are given in terms of physical quantities, namely momenta and polarizations, the results allow for a direct mapping of EFT effects to low-energy observables. The vector amplitudes are sensitive to both anomalous vector couplings and Higgs self-couplings. The left-handed fermion amplitudes feature SU(2) violating effects first generated at dimension-8. We also compare our results to HEFT predictions. Interestingly, the dimension-8 SMEFT populates almost all the novel structures generated by the dimension-8 HEFT.</description>

      <title>Description of the processes $e^+ e^- \to \pi^+ \pi^-$ and $\tau^- \to \pi^- \pi^0 \nu_\tau$ in the NJL model with value of the vector coupling constant $ g_{\rho} = 6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the processes $e^+ e^- \to \pi^+ \pi^-$ and $\tau^- \to \pi^- \pi^0 \nu_\tau$ can be described in a unified approach in satisfactory agreement with experiment using the vector coupling constant $g_{\rho} = 6$. In this case, in addition to quark loops, it is also necessary to take into account meson loops corresponding to the next order in $1/N_c$. These loops must be taken into account when describing the $\gamma (W) \to \rho$ transition, as well as in interaction of mesons in the final state.</description>

      <title>Leptophilic ALPs with TWIST data for polarized muon decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the production of axion-like particles (ALPs) in association with electrons and neutrinos in the muon decay process. For this purpose, we compute the decay width of the muon to a four-body channel using a $d=7$ effective operator that couples the ALP to the Standard model fermions, namely leptons and neutrinos. Assuming a dominant coupling of the ALP to the dark sector, we only consider ALP decays to invisible final states. To obtain constraints on our model using the existing measurements, we leverage data from the TRIUMF Weak Interaction Symmetry Test (TWIST) experiment and obtain bounds on the ALP-lepton coupling for masses in the range of $0 &lt; m_{\phi} &lt; m_{\mu}/4$, as allowed by kinematics. Using the precision of current TWIST measurements, we obtain an order of magnitude estimation necessary for future searches to further constrain the parameter space for such a setup. Furthermore, we find that keeping realistic considerations, the new physics contribution can possibly be enhanced even with a minimalistic modification to the fiducial area used in the experiment potentially allowing for stringer constraints. At the end, in an attempt to relax the assumption that ALP decays to invisible only, we also investigate its stability and find potential longevity within collider environments for the mass range considered in this study.</description>

      <title>Cosmic dawn constraints on freeze-in dark matter from Lyman-alpha forest and 21-cm signal : single-field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose cosmological observations of Lyman-alpha and 21-cm signal to set stringent constraints on freeze-in dark matter (FIDM). Explicitly we consider Higgs (neutrino)-portal FIDM in the single-field context, which injects energy into the intergalactic medium via its annihilation (decay). With respect to Lyman-alpha the baseline ionization history is inferred from low redshift data about astrophysical reionization, whereas for 21-cm signal the baseline values of 21-cm power spectrum are obtained through a standard modeling of star formation developed. We use numerical tools to derive the FIDM induced deviations from these baseline values in high redshift region. Our results show that (i) current Lyman-alpha data has already constrained the neutrino portal FIDM mass to be less than 1.06 MeV, (ii) future Lyman-alpha data about the intergalactic medium temperature with a 10(100)% precision at z~9-15 is sufficient to exclude the Higgs (neutrino)-portal FIDM, and (iii) future SKA sensitivity (1000 hrs) on the 21-cm power spectrum for reference wavenumber k*=0.2h /Mpc at z~15-16 is also able to exclude the surviving neutrino-portal FIDM mass window.</description>

      <title>Stable dark matter from Pauli blocking in the degenerate fermion background with Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a mechanism to make dark matter stable based on the Pauli blocking in the fermion background. In the background where fermions occupy the states, the decay of dark matter to those final states is not allowed, as a result, DM becomes stable. We derive the evolution equations of the distribution function in the quantum field theory and compare it with the Boltzmann equation. We apply this mechanism to a realistic model of neutrino and dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this talk I report on progress towards the computation of the next-to-next-to-leading order virtual corrections to Higgs boson pair production in gluon fusion, in an expansion around the forward-scattering limit. The results of this computation will provide an estimate of the size and uncertainty of the three-loop virtual corrections in a comparatively much larger region of phase space than the results available in the literature, which are based on an expansion in the limit of a large top quark mass.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of photons-enriched semi-visible jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Letter proposes a new signature for confining dark sectors at the LHC. Under the assumption of a QCD-like hidden sector, hadronic jets containing stable dark bound states originating from hidden strong dynamics, known as semi-visible jets, could manifest in proton-proton collisions. In the proposed simplified model, a heavy $Z'$ mediator coupling to SM quarks allows the resonant production of dark quarks, subsequently hadronizing in stable and unstable dark bound states. The unstable dark bound states can then decay back to SM quarks via the same $Z'$ portal or photons via a lighter pseudo-scalar portal (such as an axion-like particle). This mechanism creates a new signature where semi-visible jets are enriched in non-isolated photons. We show that these exotic jets evade the phase space probed by current LHC searches exploiting jets or photons due to the expected high jet neutral electromagnetic fraction and photons candidates non-isolation, respectively. In the proposed analysis strategy to tackle such signature, we exploit jets as final state objects to represent the underlying QCD-like hidden sector. We show that, by removing any selection on the neutral electromagnetic fraction from the jet identification criteria, higher signal efficiency can be reached. To enhance the signal-to-background discrimination, we train a deep neural network as a jet tagger that exploits differences in the substructure of signal and background jets. We estimate that with the available triggers for Run 2 and this new strategy, a high mass search can claim a $5 \sigma$ discovery (exclusion) of the $Z'$ boson with a mass up to 5 TeV (5 TeV) with the full Run 2 data of the LHC when the fraction of unstable dark hadrons decaying to photons pairs is around 30 %, and with a coupling of the $Z'$ to SM quarks of 0.25.</description>

      <title>Search for dark matter mediator in the production of three and four top quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of simplified models of dark matter, the contributions of a scalar mediator to top quark production processes are considered. Tree-level and one-loop contributions of the mediator's decay into a top-antitop quark pair in two-, three-, and four-top quarks production processes are calculated. A significant contribution from diagrams involving the dark matter mediator is demonstrated in the total cross section for three- and four-top quark production processes, taking into account current experimental limits on model parameters. The perspective of searching for dark matter mediators in the processes under consideration is determined by the ability to reconstruct the final state with modern collider detectors and the experimental sensitivity that has already been achieved for such rare events.</description>

      <title>Dynamically assisted pair production enhancement by combined multiple potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new Sauter-like field model with combinatorial multiple potentials consisting of a deep slow-varying and some shallow fast-varying potentials. The dynamically assisted Sauter-Schwinger effect on the pair production is found by using the computational quantum field theory. The enhanced pair production is found to be significant at about one order increasing for multiple potentials rather than single potential. In case of dominated by Schwinger mechanism, the obvious time effect leads to electrons concentrating at the two edges of the potential, meanwhile, the momentum locates at the zero nearby. In contrary, however, for the multiphoton processes, the pair generation makes the electrons distributing outside the potential and the momentum appearing multiple peaks far away from zero and evenly evolving toward a step-like structure. An interesting finding is that the particles of pair produced in the alternating potential has a quasi-monoenergetic structure compared to the oscillating potential well or/and potential barrier, which is helpful to achieve the high quality positron source.</description>

      <title>Detection of dilute axion stars with stimulated decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous orbits of trans-Neptunian objects can be accounted for by the planet 9 hypothesis. One intriguing possibility is that planet 9 could be a dilute axion star captured by the solar system, with the ratio of the axion star to dark matter being approximately 1/10. Although dilute axion stars can emit monochromatic signals through two-photon decay, the spontaneous decay signal is too weak to be detected by radio telescopes. However, we find that stimulated decay of the dilute axion star, which explains planet 9, can occur by directing a radio beam with a power of 50MW into the star. The resulting echo can be detected by terrestrial telescopes such as SKA, FAST, ngLOBO, and LOFAR. Therefore, the dilute axion star can be distinguished from other planet 9 candidates, such as a primordial black hole or a free-floating planet captured by the solar system.</description>

      <title>Modified dilepton production rate from charged pion-pair annihilation in the inhomogeneous chiral condensed phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dilepton production rates from annihilation processes of charged pion pairs with modified pion dispersion relations in the inhomogeneous chiral condensed phase. We assume a dual chiral density wave as an inhomogeneous chiral condensate, and obtain the dispersion relations of the Nambu-Goldstone modes in the inhomogeneous chiral condensed phase. We use a low energy effective Lagrangian based on the O(4) symmetry which is expanded by the order parameter up to the sixth order. The obtained dispersion relations are anisotropic and quadratic for the momentum. We evaluate the electron-positron production rates by charged pion-pair annihilations as functions of an invariant mass using the obtained dispersion relations. Basically, the production rate in the inhomogeneous chiral condensed phase has a steeper overall slope with respect to an invariant mass than that in the homogeneous chiral condensed phase. Also, there may be a possibility that the production rate diverges when the invariant mass is just twice the pion mass.</description>

Abstract: We present a new approach for determining the strong coupling $\alpha_s(Q)$ over the entire perturbative range of validity, for scales from $\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$ up to the Planck scale ${\sim}10^{19}$\,GeV, with the highest precision and using the data of just a single experiment. The results obtained with this method are consistent with world averages and exhibit improved precision with respect to previous reports.

      <description>arXiv:2407.08598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present quantum kinetic equations for neutrinos and derive Feynman rules for computing scattering rates involving coherent states. Our rules encompass both flavour- and particle-antiparticle coherence and allow writing down the scattering matrix elements and collision integrals with the same intuitive ease as with the usual non-coherent Feynman rules. Our results are useful for computing collision rates that arise routinely in the context of coherently mixing neutrinos with arbitrary masses. We give several explicit examples, including some collision integrals for coherently mixing neutrinos in supernovae.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the $\Xi_c^* \bar K$ molecular pentaquark state by its electromagnetic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are systematically studying the electromagnetic characteristics of multiquark systems to shed light on their internal structure, whose nature and quantum numbers are controversial. In this study, we investigate the magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic octupole moments of the $\Xi_c^*\bar K$ state within the context of the QCD light-cone sum rule. During this analysis, we posit that the $\Xi_c^*\bar K$ state assumes a molecular structure with quantum numbers $J^P = \frac{3}{2}^-$. The extracted outcomes are given as $\mu_{\Xi_c^*\bar K} = 0.15^{+0.04}_{-0.03}\,\mu_N$, $\mathcal{Q}_{\Xi_c^*\bar K} = (-0.93^{+0.22}_{-0.17})\times 10^{-3}\,\rm{fm^2}$, and $\mathcal{O}_{\Xi_c^*\bar K} = (-0.45^{+0.10}_{-0.09})\times 10^{-4}\,\rm{fm^3}$. The findings of this study, when considered alongside other pertinent characteristics, may assist in elucidating the nature of this controversial phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: High-energy scattering in pQCD in the Regge limit is described by the evolution of Wilson lines governed by the BK equation. In the leading order, the BK equation is conformally invariant and the eigenfunctions of the linearized BFKL equation are powers. It is a common belief that at $d\neq 4$ the BFKL equation is useless since unlike $d=4$ case it cannot be solved by usual methods. However, we demonstrate that at critical Wilson-Fisher point of QCD the relevant part of NLO BK restores the conformal invariance so the solutions are again powers. As a check of our approach to high-energy amplitudes at the Wilson-Fisher point, we calculate the anomalous dimensions of twist-2 light-ray operators in the Regge limit $j\rightarrow 1$.}</description>

Abstract: Feebly Interacting Particles are a commonly considered extension to the Standard Model of Particle Physics. In many theoretical frameworks these particles can explain observed physical phenomena which are in tension with the current model. \textsc{ALPiNIST} is a simplified Monte Carlo framework aimed at evaluating past, present, and future, short and long baseline experiments for their sensitivities to different models of Axion-Like Particles. We present the extension of this framework to accommodate new classes of Feebly Interacting Particles with emphasis on Heavy Neutral Leptons. This extension is especially well motivated, solving multiple of the standing issues with the Standard Model at the same time. The fundamental importance of inputs on the resulting parameter sensitivity, and thus the need for a unified simulation set-up, is highlighted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $g_\mu - 2 \equiv 2 a_\mu$, in the context of supersymmetric models beyond the CMSSM, where the unification of either the gaugino masses $M_{1,2,3}$ or sfermion and Higgs masses is relaxed, taking into account the measured mass of the Higgs boson, $m_H$, the cosmological dark matter density and the direct detection rate. We find that the model with non-unified gaugino masses can make a contribution $\Delta a_\mu\sim 20 \times 10^{-10}$ to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, for example if $M_{1,2} \sim 600$ GeV and $M_3\sim 8$ TeV. The model with non-universal sfermion and Higgs masses can provide even larger $\Delta a_\mu \sim 24 \times 10^{-10}$ if the sfermion masses for the first and the second generations are $ \sim 400 $ GeV and that of the third is $ \sim 8 $ TeV. We discuss the prospects for collider searches for supersymmetric particles in specific benchmark scenarios illustrating these possibilities, focusing in particular on the prospects for detecting the lighter smuon and the lightest neutralino.</description>

      <title>Jet Tagging with More-Interaction Particle Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce the More-Interaction Particle Transformer (MIParT), a novel deep learning neural network designed for jet tagging. This framework incorporates our own design, the More-Interaction Attention (MIA) mechanism, which increases the dimensionality of particle interaction embeddings. We tested MIParT using the top tagging and quark-gluon datasets. Our results show that MIParT not only matches the accuracy and AUC of LorentzNet but also significantly outperforms the ParT model in background rejection. Specifically, it improves background rejection by approximately 25\% at a 30\% signal efficiency on the top tagging dataset and by 3\% on the quark-gluon dataset. Additionally, MIParT requires only 30% of the parameters and 47% of the computational complexity needed by ParT, proving that high performance can be achieved with reduced model complexity and without extensive pretraining on large datasets. The results suggest that MIParT has the potential to advance efficiency benchmarks for jet tagging and event identification in particle physics.</description>

      <title>Sedimentary rocks from Mediterranean drought in the Messinian age as a probe of the past cosmic ray flux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of natural minerals as detectors to study the past flux of cosmic rays. This novel application of the \textit{paleo-detector} technique requires a specific approach as it needs samples that have been exposed to secondary cosmic rays for a well defined period of time. We suggest here the use of the evaporites formed during the desiccation of the Mediterranean sea ${\sim}6$ Myr ago. These minerals have been created and exposed to the air or under a shallow water basin for ${\sim}500$ kyr before being quickly submerged again by a km-scale overburden of water. We show that, by looking at the damages left in the minerals by muons in cosmic ray showers, we could detect differences in the primary cosmic ray flux during that period, as the ones expected from nearby supernova explosions, below the percent-level. We show also that little to no background from radioactive contamination and other astroparticles is expected for this kind of analysis.</description>

      <title>Reviving QFT in $2+1$ de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a conformally coupled scalar QFT on $2+1$ dimensional static Einstein universe $R \times S^2$, and write down the free theory Hilbert space. We explain that this theory is secretly a QFT in $2+1$ de Sitter space because all the quantum observables experience {\it quantum revivals}, which naturally restricts the timelike $R$ to the appropriate de Sitter time range. Our construction circumvents the causal obstruction to formulating QFT in de Sitter due to event horizons. There aren't any in static Einstein. The `unitary gauge' description of the theory is realized by the zonal harmonics $P_\ell(\hat n \cdot \hat n')$. We verify that interactions with conformally invariant external sources are mediated only by these modes. Hence these modes comprise the complete basis of the "bulk" theory. When the theory is cut off in the UV the basis dimension scales as the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Gravitational Waves as a probe of the unknown post-inflationary primordial Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key predictions of the standard inflationary paradigm is the quantum mechanical generation of the transverse and traceless tensor fluctuations due to the rapid accelerated expansion of space, which later constitute a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The amplitude of the (nearly) scale-invariant inflationary tensor power spectrum at large scales provides us with crucial information about the energy scale of inflation in the case of the minimal inflaton coupling to gravity. Furthermore, the spectral energy density, $\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}(f)$, of the GWs at sufficiently small scales (or, large frequencies $f$) serves as an important observational probe of post-inflationary primordial dynamics. In fact, the small-scale spectral tilt, $n_{_{\rm GW}} = \frac{{\rm d}\log{\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}}}{{\rm d}\log{f}}$, of the spectral energy density of GWs is sensitive to the (unknown) post-inflationary equation of state (EoS), $w$, of the universe; with a softer EoS ($w &lt; 1/3$) leading to a red tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &lt; 0$, while a stiffer EoS ($w &gt; 1/3$) resulting in a blue tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &gt; 0$. The post-inflationary dynamics, however, is generically expected to be quite complex, potentially involving a number of distinct phases. Hence, in this work, we discuss the possibility of multiple sharp transitions, namely $w_1 \to w_2 \to w_3 \to ... \to w_n$, in the EoS of the post-inflationary universe and compute the corresponding spectral energy density of the inflationary GWs. We explicitly determine the region of the parameter space $\lbrace{ w_1, \, w_2, \, w_3, ..., w_n\rbrace}$ which leads to a potentially detectable signal in the upcoming GW detectors, without violating the current constraints.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Beyond-Standard-Model Event Discovery at the LHC with a Novel Quantum Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of unsupervised anomaly detection for identifying physics beyond the Standard Model that may appear at proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. We introduce a novel quantum autoencoder circuit ansatz that is specifically designed for this task and demonstrates superior performance compared to previous approaches. To assess its robustness, we evaluate the quantum autoencoder on various types of new physics 'signal' events and varying problem sizes. Additionally, we develop classical autoencoders that outperform previously proposed quantum autoencoders but remain outpaced by the new quantum ansatz, despite its significantly reduced number of trainable parameters. Finally, we investigate the properties of quantum autoencoder circuits, focusing on entanglement and magic. We introduce a novel metric in the context of parameterised quantum circuits, stabilizer 2-R\'enyi entropy to quantify magic, along with the previously studied Meyer-Wallach measure for entanglement. Intriguingly, both metrics decreased throughout the training process along with the decrease in the loss function. This appears to suggest that models preferentially learn parameters that reduce these metrics. This study highlights the potential utility of quantum autoencoders in searching for physics beyond the Standard Model at the Large Hadron Collider and opens exciting avenues for further research into the role of entanglement and magic in quantum machine learning more generally.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to proton-proton fusion in pionless EFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the leading radiative correction to proton-proton fusion using the pionless effective field theory framework at leading order. We derive the relevant matrix elements and evaluate them using the method of regions. We benchmark the accuracy of our approximations by carrying out numerical computations of the full expressions. We show that the first order radiative corrections due to the exchange of a Coulomb photon between positron and proton-proton systems map onto the Sirlin function and the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ contribution from the Fermi function. We furthermore find that the nuclear structure dependent radiative correction omitted in the previous analysis by Kurylov {\it et al} gives an up to 0.2~\% correction to the pp fusion S-factor with its size ultimately depending on a two-nucleon counterterm that renormalizes the axial two-body current $L_{1A}$.</description>

      <title>Investigating tidal heating in neutron stars via gravitational Raman scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scattering amplitude formalism to study the tidal heating effects of nonspinning neutron stars incorporating both worldline effective field theory and relativistic stellar perturbation theory. In neutron stars, tidal heating arises from fluid viscosity due to various scattering processes in the interior. It also serves as a channel for the exchange of energy and angular momentum between the neutron star and its environment. In the interior of the neutron star, we first derive two master perturbation equations that capture fluid perturbations accurate to linear order in frequency. Remarkably, these equations receive no contribution from bulk viscosity due to a peculiar adiabatic incompressibility which arises in stellar fluid for non-barotropic perturbations. In the exterior, the metric perturbations reduce to the Regge-Wheeler (RW) equation which we solve using the analytical Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) method. We compute the amplitude for gravitational waves scattering off a neutron star, also known as gravitational Raman scattering. From the amplitude, we obtain expressions for the electric quadrupolar static Love number and the leading dissipation number to all orders in compactness. We then compute the leading dissipation number for various realistic equation-of-state(s) and estimate the change in the number of gravitational wave cycles due to tidal heating during inspiral in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) band.</description>

      <title>Operator Origin of Anomalous Dimensions in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The late time limit of the power spectrum for heavy (principal series) fields in de Sitter space yields a series of polynomial terms with complex scaling dimensions. Such scaling behavior is expected to result from an associated operator with a complex dimension. In a free theory, these complex dimensions are known to match the constraints imposed by unitarity on the space of states. Yet, perturbative corrections to the scaling behavior of operators are naively inconsistent with unitary evolution of the quantum fields in dS. This paper demonstrates how to compute one-loop corrections to the scaling dimensions that appear in the two point function from the field theory description in terms of local operators. We first show how to evaluate these anomalous dimensions using Mellin space, which has the feature that it naturally accommodates a scaleless regulator. We then explore the consequences for the Soft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET) description that emerges in the long wavelength limit. Carefully matching between the UV and SdSET descriptions requires the introduction of novel non-dynamical "operators" in the effective theory. This is not only necessary to reproduce results extracted from the K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation (that use the space of unitary states directly), but it is also required by general arguments that invoke positivity.</description>

      <title>A unitary coupled-channel three-body amplitude with pions and kaons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-body dynamics above threshold is required for the reliable extraction of many amplitudes and resonances from experiment and lattice QCD. The S-matrix principle of unitarity can be used to construct dynamical coupled-channel approaches in which three particles scatter off each other, re-arranging two-body subsystems by particle exchange. This paper reports the development of a three-body coupled-channel, amplitude including pions and kaons. The unequal-mass amplitude contains two-body S- and P-wave subsystems ("isobars") of all isospins, $I=0,\,1/2,\,1,\, 3/2, \, 2$, and it also allows for transitions within a given isobar. The $f_0(500)\, ("\sigma"),\,f_0(980),\,\rho(700), K_0^*(700)\,("\kappa")$, and $K^*(892)$ resonances are included, apart from repulsive isobars. Different methods to evaluate the amplitude for physical momenta are discussed. Production amplitudes for $a_1$ quantum numbers are shown as a proof of principle for the numerical implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive particles produced during inflation impact soft limits of primordial correlators. Searching for these signatures presents an exciting opportunity to uncover the particle spectrum in the inflationary epoch. We present non-perturbative methods to constrain intermediate-mass scalars ($0\leq m/H&lt;3/2$, where $H$ is the inflationary Hubble scale) produced during inflation, which give rise to a power-law scaling in the squeezed primordial bispectrum. Exploiting the large-scale structure consistency relations and the separate universe approach, we derive models for the late-time squeezed matter bispectrum and collapsed matter trispectrum sourced by these fields. To validate our models, we run $N$-body simulations with the "Cosmological Collider" squeezed bispectrum for two different particle masses. Our models yield unbiased constraints on the amplitude of non-Gaussianity, $f_{\rm NL}^{\Delta}$, from the squeezed bispectrum and collapsed trispectrum deep into the non-linear regime ($k_{\rm max}\approx 2~h/{\rm Mpc}$ at $z=0$). We assess the information content of these summary statistics, emphasizing the importance of sample variance cancellation in the matter sector. We also study the scale-dependent halo bias in our simulations. For mass-selected halos, the non-Gaussian bias estimated from our simulations agrees with predictions based on (i) separate universe simulations and (ii) universal mass functions. With further work, these results can be used to search for inflationary massive particle production with upcoming galaxy surveys.</description>

Abstract: A sizable magnetic moment for neutrinos would be evidence of exotic physics. In the early Universe, left-handed neutrinos with a magnetic moment would interact with electromagnetic fields in the primordial plasma, flipping their helicity and producing a population of right-handed (RH) neutrinos. In this work, we present a new calculation of the production rate of RH neutrinos in a multi-component primordial plasma and quantify their contribution to the total energy density of relativistic species at early times, stressing the implications of the dependence on the initial time for production. We find that current cosmological data exclude values of the magnetic moment $\mu \gtrsim 1.6\times 10^{-11}~\mu_B$, while future cosmological experiments will be able to probe non-thermal production of RH neutrinos, becoming competitive with stellar limits.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in $b$, $c$, and $s$ quark tagging coupled with novel statistical analysis techniques will allow future high energy and high statistics electron-positron colliders, such as the FCC-ee, to place phenomenologically relevant bounds on flavor violating Higgs and $Z$ decays to quarks. We assess the FCC-ee reach for $Z/h\to bs, cu$ decays as a function of jet tagging performance. We also update the SM predictions for the corresponding branching ratios, as well as the indirect constraints on the flavor violating Higgs and $Z$ couplings to quarks. Using type III two Higgs doublet model as an example of beyond the standard model physics, we show that the searches for $h\to bs, cu$ decays at FCC-ee can probe new parameter space not excluded by indirect searches.

      <title>Constraining Ultralight Dark Matter through an Accelerated Resonant Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments aimed at detecting ultralight dark matter typically rely on resonant effects, which are sensitive to the dark matter mass that matches the resonance frequency. In this study, we investigate the nucleon couplings of ultralight axion dark matter using a magnetometer operating in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) mode. Our approach involves the use of a $^{21}$Ne spin-based sensor, which features the lowest nuclear magnetic moment among noble-gas spins. This configuration allows us to achieve an ultrahigh sensitivity of 0.73 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$ at around 5 Hz, corresponding to energy resolution of approximately 1.5$\times
  10^{-23}\,\rm{eV/Hz^{1/2}}$. Our analysis reveals that under certain conditions it is beneficial to scan the frequency with steps significantly larger than the resonance width. The analytical results are in agreement with experimental data and the scan strategy is potentially applicable to other resonant searches. Further, our study establishes stringent constraints on axion-like particles (ALP) in the 4.5--15.5 Hz Compton-frequency range coupling to neutrons and protons, improving on prior work by several-fold. Within a band around 4.6--6.6 Hz and around 7.5 Hz, our laboratory findings surpass astrophysical limits derived from neutron-star cooling. Hence, we demonstrate an accelerated resonance search for ultralight dark matter, achieving an approximately 30-fold increase in scanning step while maintaining competitive sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Heavy vector-like quarks decaying to exotic scalars: a case study with triplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the pair production of a vector-like quark triplet with hypercharge 5/3 decaying into top quark and a complex scalar triplet with hypercharge 1 at the LHC. This novel scenario, featuring particles with exotic charges - two quarks with charge 8/3 and 5/3 and a scalar with charge 2 - serves as a unique window to models based on the framework of partial compositeness, where these particles naturally emerge as bound states around the TeV scale. Leveraging on the LHC data we establish exclusion limits on the masses of the vector-like quark and the scalar triplet. Subsequently, we design an analysis strategy aimed at improving sensitivity in the region which is still allowed. Our analysis focuses on two specific regions in the parameter space: the first entails a large mass gap between the vector-like quarks and the scalars, so that the vector-like quarks can decay into the scalars; the second involves a small mass gap, such that this decay is forbidden. To simplify the parameter space, both vector-like quarks and scalars are assumed to be degenerate or almost degenerate within the triplets, such that chain decays between fermions and scalars are suppressed. As a result, we found that final states characterized by a same-sign lepton pair, multiple jets, and high net transverse momentum (i.e. effective mass) will play a pivotal role to unveil this model and, more in general, models characterised by multiple vector-like quarks around the same mass scale during the high luminosity LHC phase.</description>

Abstract: A new release of the Monte Carlo event generator Herwig (version 7.3) has been launched. This iteration encompasses several enhancements over its predecessor, version 7.2. Noteworthy upgrades include: the implementation of a process-independent electroweak angular-ordered parton shower integrated with QCD and QED radiation; a new recoil scheme for initial-state radiation improving the behaviour of the angular-ordered parton shower; the incorporation of the heavy quark effective theory to refine the hadronization and decay of excited heavy mesons and heavy baryons; a dynamic strategy to regulate the kinematic threshold of cluster splittings within the cluster hadronization model; several improvements to the structure of the cluster hadronization model allowing for refined models; the possibility to extract event-by-event hadronization corrections in a well-defined way; the possibility of using the string model, with a dedicated tune. Additionally, a new tuning of the parton shower and hadronization parameters has been executed. This article discusses the novel features introduced in version 7.3.0.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Moller experiment and the P2 experiment aim at measuring the weak mixing angle at low scales. The Moller experiment uses $e^- e^- \rightarrow e^- e^-$-scattering, the P2 experiment uses $e^- N \rightarrow e^- N$-scattering. In both cases, two-loop electroweak corrections have to be taken into account, and here in particular diagrams which give rise to large logarithms. In this paper we compute a set of two-loop electroweak Feynman integrals for point-like particles, which are obtained from a box integral by the insertion of a light fermion loop. By rationalising all occurring square roots we show that these Feynman integrals can be expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms. We present the results in a form, which makes the large logarithms manifest. We provide highly efficient numerical evaluation routines for these integrals.</description>

      <title>Prospects on the Detection of Solar Dark Photons by the International Axion Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark (hidden) photons are widely recognised as well motivated candidates for physics beyond the standard model, and have been invoked for the solution of several outstanding problems, including to account for the dark matter in the universe. In this paper, we consider a simple model for dark photons, which is coupled to ordinary matter only through kinetic mixing with ordinary photons. Within this framework, we calculate the flux of solar dark photons on Earth and revise the potential to detect it with the next generation of axion helioscopes, particularly with the International AXion Observatory (IAXO). This paper extends on previous theoretical analyses in two main ways. Firstly, it includes a more complete analysis of the possible sources of dark photons from the sun, including the contribution of the solar magnetic field and of nuclear processes, and secondly it includes predictions on the parameter space accessible in the gas-filled phase of IAXO.</description>

Abstract: Light hypothetical particles with masses up to $\mathcal{O}(100)\ {\rm MeV}$ can be produced in the core of supernovae. Their subsequent decays to neutrinos can produce a flux component with higher energies than the standard flux. We study the impact of heavy neutral leptons, $Z'$ bosons, in particular ${\rm U(1)}_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ and ${\rm U(1)}_{B-L}$ gauge bosons, and majorons coupled to neutrinos flavor-dependently. We obtain new strong limits on these particles from no events of high-energy SN 1987A neutrinos and their future sensitivities from observations of galactic supernova neutrinos.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we perform a comprehensive study of Lepton Flavor Violation (LFV) in semileptonic transitions in the framework of an Effective Field Theory with general flavor structure. We account for the Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs), which induce non-trivial correlations between the different types of LFV processes. In particular, we show that these loop effects are needed to improve the bounds on several coefficients that are not efficiently constrained at tree level. For illustration, we consider a few concrete scenarios, with predominant couplings to third-generation quarks, and we explore the correlations between the various tree- and loop-level constraints on these models. As a by-product, we also provide expressions for several semileptonic LFV meson decays by using the latest determinations of the relevant hadronic form factors on the lattice.</description>

      <title>An EFT origin of Secluded Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study aims to unveil a scenario with a non-minimal secluded dark sector (DS) in an effective field theory (EFT) framework. To explore this, we have examined a suitable extension of the type-X Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) as a potential origin for the secluded DS. The DS comprises a dark matter (DM) candidate and a mediator particle `$a$' and possesses some non-minimal characteristics. It becomes non-thermally populated through diverse dim-6 four-Fermi operators, effectively generated by integrating out the heavier Higgs particles. The analysis further focuses on the consequences of the collision processes $\textit{DM}+ a \leftrightarrow a + a$ and $\textit{DM}+ \textit{DM} \leftrightarrow a + a$ occurring within the DS. We have investigated the significance of employing an EFT approach in tracking the temperature evolution of the DS. Within the present framework, the observed relic abundance of the DM can be realized through both dark freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms. Further, we have delineated the permissible ranges of the relevant parameters, viz., the DM mass ($m_\chi \gtrsim 20 \, \text{GeV}$), the portal coupling ($C_\tau \lesssim 10^{-14}\, \text{GeV}^{-2}$), and the DS coupling ($\lambda \lesssim 10^{-6} \,\text{GeV}^{-2}$) by taking into account the perturbativity of the involved couplings while reproducing the observed DM relic and complying with the bounds from a successful Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and $\gamma$-ray searches.</description>

      <title>Masked Particle Modeling on Sets: Towards Self-Supervised High Energy Physics Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose masked particle modeling (MPM) as a self-supervised method for learning generic, transferable, and reusable representations on unordered sets of inputs for use in high energy physics (HEP) scientific data. This work provides a novel scheme to perform masked modeling based pre-training to learn permutation invariant functions on sets. More generally, this work provides a step towards building large foundation models for HEP that can be generically pre-trained with self-supervised learning and later fine-tuned for a variety of down-stream tasks. In MPM, particles in a set are masked and the training objective is to recover their identity, as defined by a discretized token representation of a pre-trained vector quantized variational autoencoder. We study the efficacy of the method in samples of high energy jets at collider physics experiments, including studies on the impact of discretization, permutation invariance, and ordering. We also study the fine-tuning capability of the model, showing that it can be adapted to tasks such as supervised and weakly supervised jet classification, and that the model can transfer efficiently with small fine-tuning data sets to new classes and new data domains.</description>

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a promising, model-agnostic strategy to find physics beyond the Standard Model. State-of-the-art machine learning methods offer impressive performance on anomaly detection tasks, but interpretability, resource, and memory concerns motivate considering a wide range of alternatives. We explore using the 2-Wasserstein distance from optimal transport theory, both as an anomaly score and as input to interpretable machine learning methods, for event-level anomaly detection at the Large Hadron Collider. The choice of ground space plays a key role in optimizing performance. We comment on the feasibility of implementing these methods in the L1 trigger system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum tomography in high-energy physics processes has usually been restricted to the spin degrees of freedom. We address the case of top quark decays $t \to W b$, in which the orbital angular momentum ($L$) and the spins of $W$ and $b$ are intertwined into a 54-dimensional $LWb$ density operator. The entanglement between $L$ and the $W$ or $b$ spin is large and could be determined for decays of single top quarks produced at the Large Hadron Collider with Run 2 data. With the foreseen statistical and systematic uncertainties, the significance is well above $5\sigma$ from the separability hypothesis for $L$-$W$ entanglement, and $3.2\sigma$ for $L$-$b$. These would be the first entanglement measurements between orbital and spin angular momenta in high-energy physics. Likewise, the genuine tripartite entanglement between $L$ and the two spins could be established with more than $5\sigma$. The method presented paves the way for similar measurements in other processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To maximise the information obtained from various independent new physics searches conducted at the LHC, it is imperative to consider the combination of multiple analyses. To showcase the exclusion power gained by combining signal regions from different searches, we consider a simplified scenario inspired by supersymmetry, with all particles but one squark flavour and a bino-like neutralino decoupled. The corresponding signal therefore comprises strong squark pair production, associated squark-neutralino production, as well as weak neutralino pair production. We find that considering the associated and strong production mechanisms together significantly impacts mass limits, while contributions from the weak production are insignificant in the context of current exclusion limits. In addition, we demonstrate that the combination of uncorrelated signal regions as assessed from the recent TACO approach substantially pushes exclusion limits towards higher masses, relative to the bounds derived from the most sensitive individual analyses.</description>

Abstract: The decays of the Higgs boson produce a state in which the spins of the decay products and the orbital angular momentum ($L$) are highly entangled. We obtain the tripartite density operator, as well as reduced operators, for the decay into two weak bosons. For $H \to ZZ$ in the four-lepton final state we also estimate the statistical sensitivity at the Large Hadron Collider and future upgrades, using a binned method to reconstruct the density operators from distributions. With the expected Run 3 data, establishing genuine tripartite entanglement would be possible beyond the $5\sigma$ level. The violation of Bell inequalities involving the spins of the two weak bosons could also be established beyond the $5\sigma$ level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the gravitational form factors $A_i$, $D_i$ and $\bar c_i$ of the scalar Yukawa theory using both the light-cone and covariant perturbation theory at the one-loop level. The light-cone formalism provides a potential approach to access these form factors beyond the perturbative regime. However, unlike the covariant formulation, the Poincar\'e symmetry on the light cone is not manifest. In this work, we use perturbation theory as a benchmark to extract the gravitational form factors from the light-front energy-momentum tensor. By comparing results on and off the light cone, we identify $T^{++}, T^{+a}, T^{+-}, T^{12}$ as the "good currents" that are properly renormalized and can be used to extract the gravitational form factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply deep learning techniques to the late-time turbulent regime in a post-inflationary model where a real scalar inflaton field and the standard model Higgs doublet interact with renormalizable couplings between them. After inflation, the inflaton decays into the Higgs through a trilinear coupling and the Higgs field subsequently thermalizes with gauge bosons via its $SU(2)\times U(1)$ gauge interaction. Depending on the strength of the trilinear interaction and the Higgs self-coupling, the effective mass squared of Higgs can become negative, leading to the tachyonic production of Higgs particles. These produced Higgs particles would then share their energy with gauge bosons, potentially indicating thermalization. Since the model entails different non-perturbative effects, it is necessary to resort to numerical and semi-classical techniques. However, simulations require significant costs in terms of time and computational resources depending on the model used. Particularly, when $SU(2)$ gauge interactions are introduced, this becomes evident as the gauge field redistributes particle energies through rescattering processes, leading to an abundance of UV modes that disrupt simulation stability. This necessitates very small lattice spacings, resulting in exceedingly long simulation runtimes. Furthermore, the late-time behavior of preheating dynamics exhibits a universal form by wave kinetic theory. Therefore, we analyze patterns in the flow of particle numbers and predict future behavior using CNN-LSTM (Convolutional Neural Network combined with Long Short-Term Memory) time series analysis. In this way, we can reduce our dependence on simulations by orders of magnitude in terms of time and computational resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a conceptually simple model to generate asymmetries that are not directly related to baryon nor lepton charges. The model employs a three-Higgs doublet framework, wherein the other two Higgs fields are significantly heavier than the Standard Model (SM) Higgs field. The decay of these heavier Higgs fields generates asymmetry for approximately conserved charges in the Standard Model at a high temperature. These asymmetries will be converted into baryon/lepton asymmetry through $B-L$ violating interactions associated with right-handed neutrinos via the wash-in mechanism.</description>

      <title>Parity and Lepton Masses in the Left Right Symmetric Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Curiously in the minimal left right symmetric model, chiral ($\chi$) symmetry that protects the electron's mass ($m_e$), due to parity (P) implies the vanishing of its neutrino mixing angles. We break the $\chi$ symmetry to generate the observed neutrino mixing which causes the electron to acquire its mass on RGE running, and in turn determines the B-L gauge symmetry breaking scale ($v_R$) to be $10^{10} GeV \lesssim v_R \leq 10^{15} GeV $ (and with fine-tuning can be at $10 TeV$ scale). If the muon's mass is also generated radiatively, the B-L breaking scale is $\sim 10^{14-15}$ GeV. Regardless of how the high scale $v_R$ is, this is a testable model for obtaining the mass of the electron (and muon), since on RGE running and P breaking, a large strong CP phase ($\bar{\theta} &gt;&gt; 10^{-10}$) which depends logarithmically on $v_R$ is generated if there is O(1) CP violation in leptonic Yukawa couplings. Hence we expect that leptonic CP phases including the Dirac CP phase $\delta_{CP}$ of the PMNS matrix must be consistent with $0$ or $180^o$ to within a degree, which can be verified or excluded by neutrino experiments such as DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande. In lieu of P, if charge conjugation C is used, the same results follow. However with C and no P, axions would likely need to be added anyway, in which case there is no constraint on $\delta_{CP}$.</description>

      <title>Discrete dark matter with light Dirac neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new realisation of light Dirac neutrino mass and dark matter (DM) within the framework of a non-Abelian discrete flavour symmetry based on $A_4$ group. In addition to $A_4$, we also consider a $Z_2$ and an unbroken global lepton number symmetry $U(1)_L$ to keep unwanted terms away while guaranteeing the Dirac nature of light neutrinos. The field content, their transformations and flavon vacuum alignments are chosen in such a way that the type-I Dirac seesaw generates only one light Dirac neutrino mass while the other two masses arise from scotogenic contributions at one-loop. This leads to the Dirac scoto-seesaw framework, a generalisation of the widely studied scoto-seesaw model to Dirac neutrinos. The symmetry breaking of $A_4$ leaves a remnant $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry responsible for stabilising DM. Dirac nature of light neutrinos introduces additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ within reach of cosmic microwave background experiments.</description>

      <title>Observable CP-violation in charmed baryons decays with SU(3) symmetry analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CP violation in baryon decays has recently garnered significant attention. Traditionally, CP violation in charmed baryon decays is predicted to be at the order of $O(10^{-4})$. Utilizing recent measurements from BESIII, Belle and Belle~II experiments, we conduct a comprehensive global analysis to estimate the contribution of topological diagrams in these processes. Our study reveals that topological diagrams alone cannot fully account for the experimental data. By incorporating new effects that are not included in traditional topological diagrams and exploring the possible source of the new effect, our analysis reveals the potential for significant CP violation in $\Lambda_c^+\to n \pi^+$ and $\Xi_c^+\to \Xi^0 K^+$. This suggests a promising opportunity to observe CP violation for the first time in charmed baryon decays.</description>

      <title>An interpretation of scalars in SO(32)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an interpretation for the adjoint representation of the $SO(32)$ group to classify the scalars of a generic Supersymmetric Standard Model having just three generations of particles, via a flavour group $SU(5)$. We show that this same interpretation arises from a simple postulate of self-consistence of composites for these scalars. The model looks only for colour and electric charge, and it pays the cost of an additional chiral $+4/3$ quark per generation.</description>

      <title>Diphoton signals for the Georgi-Machacek scenario at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diphoton channel for exploring the Georgi-Machacek (GM) scenario containing scalar triplets at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been identified as germane, and subjected to a detailed study. The scalar spectrum of the model, which imposes a custodial SU(2) on the potential, gets classified into a 5-plet, a 3-plet and two singlets under the custodial symmetry. While most attempts to probe or constrain the scenario at the LHC depend largely on signals of charged scalars, we point out that the custodial SU(2) singlet state H can have a substantial branching ratio (amounting to a few per cent) into two photons. We carry out a detailed simulation of the resulting signal and the standard model backgrounds, obtaining the signal significance in different regions of the parameter space using the profile likelihood ratio method. Substantial regions of the GM parameter space is thus shown to be accessible to LHC studies, both at the high-luminosity run with $\int {\cal L} dt = 3000 fb^{-1}$, and also in Run-3 with $\int {\cal L} dt = 300 fb^{-1}$, even after folding in systematic errors.</description>

      <title>The Tameness of Quantum Field Theory, Part I -- Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalized finiteness principle for physical theories, in terms of the concept of tameness in mathematical logic. A tame function or space can only have a finite amount of structure, in a precise sense which we explain. Tameness generalizes the notion of an analytic function to include certain non-analytic limits, and we show that this includes many limits which are known to arise in physics. For renormalizable quantum field theories, we give a general proof that amplitudes at each order in the loop expansion are tame functions of the external momenta and the couplings. We then consider a variety of exact non-perturbative results and show that they are tame but only given constraints on the UV definition of the theory. This provides further evidence for the recent conjecture of the second author that all effective theories that can be coupled to quantum gravity are tame. We also discuss whether renormalization group flow is tame, and comment on the applicability of our results to effective theories.</description>

Abstract: By refining the method proposed in arXiv:2010.07660, entropy current and entropy density for a relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium system with spherical symmetry are constructed as a non-Noether conserved charge in the Einstein gravity with cosmological constant. It is shown that the constructed entropy density satisfies both the local Euler relation and the first law of thermodynamics non-perturbatively with respect to the Newton constant. Finally the established relativistic thermodynamics is applied to one of the systems with uniform energy density as a crude model of a degenerate star and its local thermodynamic observables are determined analytically.</description>

      <title>Examination of STAR fixed-target data on directed flow at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3 and 4.5 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results of simulations of directed flow of various hadrons in Au+Au collisions at collision energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3 and 4.5 GeV. Simulations are performed within the model three-fluid dynamics (3FD) and the event simulator based on it (THESEUS). The results are compared with recent STAR data. The directed flows of various particles provide information on dynamics in various parts and at various stages of the colliding system depending on the particle. However, the information on the equation of state is not always directly accessible because of strong influence of the afterburner stage or insufficient equilibration of the matter. It is found that the crossover scenario gives the best overall description of the data. This crossover EoS is soft in the hadronic phase. The transition into QGP in Au+Au collisions occurs at collision energies between 3 and 4.5 GeV, at baryon densities $n_B \geq 4 n_0$ and temperatures $\approx 150$ MeV. In-medium effects in the directed flow of (anti)kaons are discussed.</description>

      <title>Prospects of nuclear-coupled-dark-matter detection via correlation spectroscopy of I$_2^+$ and Ca$^+$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter (DM) and its interaction with the Standard Model (SM) is one of the biggest open questions in physics nowadays. The vast majority of theoretically-motivated Ultralight-DM (ULDM) models predict that ULDM couples dominantly to the SM strong/nuclear sector. This coupling leads to oscillations of nuclear parameters that are detectable by comparing clocks with different sensitivities to these nature's constants. Vibrational transitions of molecular clocks are more sensitive to a change in the nuclear parameters than the electronic transitions of atomic clocks. Here, we propose the iodine molecular ion, I$_2^+$, as a sensitive detector for such a class of ULDM models. The iodine's dense spectrum allows us to match its transition frequency to that of an optical atomic clock (Ca$^+$) and perform correlation spectroscopy between the two clock species. With this technique, we project a few-orders-of-magnitude improvement over the most sensitive clock comparisons performed to date. We also briefly consider the robustness of the corresponding "Earth-bound" under modifications of the $Z_N$-QCD axion model.</description>

      <title>Accelerated protons produced by magnetic Penrose process in Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Typical mechanisms to extract energies from a rotating black hole are the Blandford-Znajek process and the Penrose process. The Penrose process requires a special condition that is difficult to occur in common astrophysical situations. However, the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) does not require such a special condition, and can produce ultra-high energy cosmic rays. When neutrons decay near a rotating black hole, the MPP efficiency of the produced proton is maximized. The supermassive black hole in Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is likely to have a radiatively inefficient accretion flow that is hot enough to produce neutrons by nuclear reactions, which can be subsequently accelerated to high-energy by the MPP. We calculate the production rate of accelerated protons from the Sgr A* to estimated the gamma-ray flux at Earth produced by these accelerated protons and the flux of the accelerated protons themselves transported from Sgr A* to Earth. We find that these very high-energy gamma rays ($E_{\gamma}\gtrsim10\,\mathrm{TeV}$) amount to a significant fraction of the flux of the gamma-ray from the HESS J1745-290 and the central molecular zone around $100\,\mathrm{TeV}$. The accelerated proton flux, when the dimensionless spin parameter $a_{*}=0.5$ and the magnetic field strength in the vicinity of the black hole $B_{0}=100\,\mathrm{G}$, is about $1.6-4.1\%$ of the cosmic ray proton flux from KASCADE experiment at about $1\,\mathrm{PeV}$. Due to the finite decay time of neutrons which need to be transported from the accretion flow to the acceleration zone, our acceleration model can operate only around black holes with mass not much greater than $\sim10^8\,M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Jet Flavour Tagging at FCC-ee with a Transformer-based Neural Network: DeepJetTransformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jet flavour tagging is crucial in experimental high-energy physics. A tagging algorithm, DeepJetTransformer, is presented, which exploits a transformer-based neural network that is substantially faster to train.
  The DeepJetTransformer network uses information from particle flow-style objects and secondary vertex reconstruction as is standard for $b$- and $c$-jet identification supplemented by additional information, such as reconstructed V$^0$s and $K^{\pm}/\pi^{\pm}$ discrimination, typically not included in tagging algorithms at the LHC. The model is trained as a multiclassifier to identify all quark flavours separately and performs excellently in identifying $b$- and $c$-jets. An $s$-tagging efficiency of $40\%$ can be achieved with a $10\%$ $ud$-jet background efficiency. The impact of including V$^0$s and $K^{\pm}/\pi^{\pm}$ discrimination is presented.
  The network is applied on exclusive $Z \to q\bar{q}$ samples to examine the physics potential and is shown to isolate $Z \to s\bar{s}$ events. Assuming all other backgrounds can be efficiently rejected, a $5\sigma$ discovery significance for $Z \to s\bar{s}$ can be achieved with an integrated luminosity of $60~\text{nb}^{-1}$, corresponding to less than a second of the FCC-ee run plan at the $Z$ resonance.</description>

      <title>Primordial gravitational waves in horizon cosmology and constraints on entropic parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hallmark of the 4-parameter generalized entropy is that it can represent various known entropies proposed so far for suitable limits of the parameters, and thus the 4-parameter generalized entropy can be applied on additive as well as on non-additive systems. Thereafter the proposal of the generalized entropy, it becomes important to constrain the corresponding parameters. In the present work, we intend to do this from the perspective of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) generated during inflation. In the background level, the generalized entropy successfully drives a viable and smooth evolution of the universe, particularly from inflation to reheating followed by a radiation era, for certain ranges of the entropic parameters. Consequently we investigate whether such viable ranges of the entropic parameters (coming from the background level) allow the primordial GWs spectrum to pass through the sensitivity curves of various GWs observatories. Therefore, if the future observatories can detect the signal of primordial GWs, then our theoretical expectation carried in the present work may provide a possible tool for the measurement of the generalized entropic parameters.</description>

      <title>Higher-Dimensional MOG dark compact object: shadow behavior in the light of EHT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consideration of extra spatial dimensions is motivated by the unification of gravity with other interactions, the achievement of the ultimate framework of quantum gravity, and fundamental problems in particle physics and cosmology. Much attention has been focused on the effect of these extra dimensions on the modified theories of gravity. Analytically examining astrophysical phenomena like black hole shadows is one approach to understand how extra dimensions would affect the modified gravitational theories. The purpose of this study is to derive a higher dimensional metric for a dark compact object in STVG theory and then examine the behavior of the shadow shapes for this solution in STVG theory in higher dimensions. We apply the Carter method to formulate the geodesic equations and the Hamilton Jacobi method to find photon orbits around this higher dimensional MOG dark compact object. We investigate the effects of extra dimensions and the STVG parameter alpha on the black hole shadow size. Next, we compare the shadow radius of this higher dimensional MOG dark compact object to the shadow size of the supermassive black hole M87, which has been realized by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaborations, in order to restrict these parameters. We find that extra dimensions in the STVG theory typically lead to a reduction in the shadow size of the higher dimensional MOG dark compact object, whereas the effect of parameter alpha on this black hole shadow is suppressible. Remarkably, given the constraints from EHT observations, we find that the shadow size of the four dimensional MOG dark compact object lies in the confidence levels of the EHT data. Finally, we investigate the issue of acceleration bounds in higher dimensional MOG dark compact object in confrontation with EHT data of M87.</description>
