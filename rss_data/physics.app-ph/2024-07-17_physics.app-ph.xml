      <title>A practical approach to calculating magnetic Johnson noise for precision measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Johnson noise is an important consideration for many applications involving precision magnetometry, and its significance will only increase in the future with improvements in measurement sensitivity. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be utilized to derive analytic expressions for magnetic Johnson noise in certain situations. But when used in conjunction with commercially available finite element analysis tools, the combined approach is particularly powerful as it provides a practical means to calculate the magnetic Johnson noise arising from conductors of arbitrary geometry and permeability. In this paper, we demonstrate this method to be one of the most comprehensive approaches presently available to calculate thermal magnetic noise. In particular, its applicability is shown to not be limited to cases where the noise is evaluated at a point in space but also can be expanded to include cases where the magnetic field detector has a more general shape, such as a finite size loop, a gradiometer, or a detector that consists of a polarized atomic species trapped in a volume. Furthermore, some physics insights gained through studies made using this method are discussed.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous integration of high endurance ferroelectric and piezoelectric epitaxial BaTiO$_3$ devices on Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating epitaxial BaTiO$_3$ (BTO) with Si is essential for leveraging its ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and nonlinear optical properties in microelectronics. Recently, heterogeneous integration approaches that involve growth of BTO on ideal substrates followed by transfer to a desired substrate show promise of achieving excellent device-quality films. However, beyond simple demonstrations of the existence of ferroelectricity, robust devices with high endurance were not yet demonstrated on Si using the latter approach. Here, using a novel two-step approach to synthesize epitaxial BTO using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on water soluble Sr3Al2O7 (SAO) (on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) substrates), we demonstrate successful integration of high-quality BTO capacitors on Si, with Pr of 7 uC/cm2, Ec 150 kV/cm, ferroelectric and electromechanical endurance of greater than $10^6$ cycles. We further address the challenge of cracking and disintegration of thicker films by first transferring a large area (5 mm x 5 mm) of the templated layer of BTO (~30 nm thick) on the desired substrate, followed by the growth of high-quality BTO on this substrate, as revealed by HRXRD and HRSTEM measurements. These templated Si substrates offer a versatile platform for integrating any epitaxial complex oxides with diverse functionalities onto any inorganic substrate.</description>

      <title>Harnessing an elastic flow instability to improve the kinetic performance of chromatographic columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of research and development, the optimal efficiency of slurry-packed HPLC columns is still hindered by inherent long-range flow heterogeneity from the wall to the central bulk region of these columns. Here, we show an example of how this issue can be addressed through the straightforward addition of a semidilute amount (500~ppm) of a large, flexible, synthetic polymer (18~MDa partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide, HPAM) to the mobile phase (1\% NaCl aqueous solution) during operation of a 4.6 mm $\times$ 300 mm column packed with 10~$\mu$m BEH$^{\mathrm{TM}}$ 125~\AA \ Particles. Addition of the polymer imparts elasticity to the mobile phase, causing the flow in the interparticle pore space to become unstable above a threshold flow rate. We verify the development of this elastic flow instability using pressure drop measurements of the friction factor versus Reynolds number. In prior work, we showed that this flow instability is characterized by large spatiotemporal fluctuations in the pore-scale flow velocities that may promote analyte dispersion across the column. Axial dispersion measurements of the quasi non-retained tracer thiourea confirm this possibility: they unequivocally reveal that operating above the onset of the instability improves column efficiency by significantly reducing peak asymmetry. These experiments thereby provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that elastic flow instabilities can be harnessed to mitigate the negative impact of trans-column flow heterogeneities on the efficiency of slurry-packed HPLC columns. While this approach has its own inherent limitations and constraints, our work lays the groundwork for future targeted development of polymers that can impart elasticity when dissolved in commonly used liquid chromatography mobile phases, and can thereby generate elastic flow instabilities to help improve the resolution of HPLC columns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride is rapidly gaining interest as a platform for photonic quantum technologies, due to its two-dimensional nature and its ability to host defects deep within its large band gap that may act as room-temperature single-photon emitters. In this review paper we provide an overview of (1) the structure, properties, growth and transfer of hexagonal boron nitride; (2) the creation and assignment of colour centres in hexagonal boron nitride for applications in photonic quantum technologies; and (3) heterostructure devices for the electrical tuning and charge control of colour centres that form the basis for photonic quantum technology devices. The aim of this review is to provide readers a summary of progress in both defect engineering and device fabrication in hexagonal boron nitride based photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Performance Limits in Current-Matched Tandem Solar Cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tandem solar cells are at the forefront of extending the efficiency limits of solar cell technology. Among two-terminal tandems, current-matched (CM) tandem solar cells are of particular interest, owing to their relative ease of fabrication. Though CM tandems have been extensively studied, an analytical framework based on the detailed balance for N-layer CM tandems with area de-coupled subcells has not been addressed. Current matching constraints can be alleviated with the addition of area de-coupled subcells/modules at each layer appropriately. In this work, we propose an analytical framework for modeling the performance limits of an N-layer CM tandem solar cell with subcells across layers. Radiative coupling among cells is taken into account. Analytical expressions for the optimal number of subcells across layers are presented. This may provide design guidelines for designing and estimating the performance limits of advanced solar cell architecture and can be extended to voltage-matched and bifacial devices as well.</description>

      <title>On the geometric phase and its role in the design of elastic topological materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric phase provides important mathematical insights to understand the fundamental nature and evolution of the dynamic response in a wide spectrum of systems ranging from quantum to classical mechanics. While the concept of geometric phase, which is an additional phase factor occurring in dynamical systems, holds the same meaning across different fields of application, its use and interpretation can acquire important nuances specific to the system of interest. In recent years, the development of quantum topological materials and its extension to classical mechanical systems have renewed the interest in the concept of geometric phase. This review revisits the concept of geometric phase and discusses, by means of either established or original results, its critical role in the design and dynamic behavior of elastic waveguides. Concepts of differential geometry and topology are put forward to provide a theoretical understanding of the geometric phase and its connection to the physical properties of the system. Then, the concept of geometric phase is applied to different types of elastic waveguides to explain how either topologically trivial or non-trivial behavior can emerge based on the geometric features of the waveguide.</description>

      <title>k-space Physics-informed Neural Network (k-PINN) for Compressed Spectral Mapping and Efficient Inversion of Vibrations in Thin Composite Laminates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vibrational response of structural components carries valuable information about their underlying mechanical properties, health status and operational conditions. This underscores the need for the development of efficient physics-based inversion algorithms which, given a limited set of sensing data points and in the presence of measurement noise, can reconstruct the response at locations where measurement data is not available and/or identify the unknown mechanical properties. Addressing this challenge, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach. PINNs seamlessly integrate governing equations into their architecture and have gained significant interest in solving inversion problems. In the context of learning and inversion of multimodal, multiscale vibrational responses, this paper introduces a novel spectral extension of PINNs, utilizing Fourier basis functions in the wavenumber domain, commonly known as k-space. The proposed k-space PINN (k-PINN), offers a robust framework for adjusting complexity and wavenumber composition of the response. Notably, the spectral formulation of k-PINN, coupled with the generally sparse representation of vibrations in k-space, facilitate efficient reconstruction and learning of broadband vibrations and alleviate the spectral bias associated with standard PINN. Additionally, the spectral solution space introduced by k-PINN substantially reduces the computational cost associated with computing physics-informed loss terms. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology on reconstructing the bending vibrational mode shapes of a thin composite laminate and identifying its effective bending stiffness coefficients. It is shown that the proposed k-PINN methodology outperforms the standard PINN in terms of both learning and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the transport properties of interface-type, analog memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interface-type, analog memristors have quite a reputation for real-time applications in edge sensorics, edge computing, and neuromorphic computing. The n-type conducting BiFeO3 (BFO) is such an interface-type, analog memristor which is also nonlinear and can therefore not only store, but also process data in the same memristor cell without data transfer between the data storage unit and the data processing unit. Here we present a physical memristor model which describes the hysteretic current-voltage curves of the BFO memristor in the small and large current-voltage range. Extracted internal state variables are reconfigured by the ion drift in the two write branches and are determining the electron transport in the two read branches. Simulation of electronic circuits with the BFO interface-type, analog memristors was not possible so far because previous physical memristor models have not captured the full range of internal state variables. We show quantitative agreement between modeled and experimental current-voltage curves exemplarily of three different BFO memristors in the small and large current-voltage ranges. Extracted dynamic and static internal state variables in the two full write branches and in the two full read branches, respectively, can be used for simulating electronic circuits with BFO memristors, e.g. in edge sensorics, edge computing, and neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Green and Solid State Reduction of GO Monolayers Sandwiched between Arachidic Acid LB Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel, single step and environment friendly solid state approach for reduction of graphene oxide (GO) monolayers has been demonstrated, in which, arachidic acid-GO-arachidic acid (AA-GO-AA) sandwich structure obtained by Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique was heat treated at moderate temperatures to obtain RGO sheets. Heat treatment of AA-GO-AA sandwich structure at 200 C results in substantial reduction of GO, with concurrent removal of AA molecules. Such developed RGO sheets possess sp2-C content of 69%, O/C ratio of 0.17 and significantly reduced I(D) and I(G) ratio of ~1.1. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) studies on RGO sheets evidenced significant increase in density of states in immediate vicinity of Fermi level and decrease in work function after reduction. Bottom gated field effect transistors fabricated with isolated RGO sheets displayed charge neutrality point at a positive gate voltage, indicating p-type nature, consistent with UPS and electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) measurement results.The RGO sheets obtained by heat treatment of AA-GO-AA sandwich structure exhibited conductivity in the range of 2-7Scm-1 and field effect mobility of 0.03-2cm2V-1s-1, which are consistent with values reported for RGO sheets obtained by various chemical or thermal reduction procedures.The extent of GO reduction is determined primarily by proximity of AA molecules and found to be unaltered with either escalation of heat treatment temperature or increase of AA content in sandwich structure. The single-step GO reduction approach demonstrated in this work is an effective way for development of RGO monolayers with high structural quality towards graphene-based electronic device applications.</description>
