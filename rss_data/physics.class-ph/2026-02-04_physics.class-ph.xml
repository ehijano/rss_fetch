      <title>A third law of thermodynamics is an unnecessary complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper elaborates on the implications of the relationship between the Second and Third Laws and provides a comprehensive formal and historical justification for the logical redundancy of the Nernst heat theorem. By revisiting the Nernst-Einstein debate, the underlying hypotheses that lead to the traditional view of the Third Law as an independent postulate are examined. It is argued that the historical rejection of Nernst's proof -- motivated by Einstein's insistence on the practical non-performability of cycles at absolute zero -- overlooks the fact that a universal Second Law already precludes such cycles, rendering an independent Third Law an unnecessary complexity. Ultimately, the Nernst theorem is shown to be an essential consistency regulator rather than an independent physical discovery.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Propagation for Non-Conservative Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a physics-inspired learning algorithm that uses stationary states of a dynamical system both for inference and learning. In its original formulation it is limited to conservative systems, $\textit{i.e.}$ to dynamics which derive from an energy function. Given their importance in applications, it is important to extend EP to nonconservative systems, $\textit{i.e.}$ systems with non-reciprocal interactions. Previous attempts to generalize EP to such systems failed to compute the exact gradient of the cost function. Here we propose a framework that extends EP to arbitrary nonconservative systems, including feedforward networks. We keep the key property of equilibrium propagation, namely the use of stationary states both for inference and learning. However, we modify the dynamics in the learning phase by a term proportional to the non-reciprocal part of the interaction so as to obtain the exact gradient of the cost function. This algorithm can also be derived using a variational formulation that generates the learning dynamics through an energy function defined over an augmented state space. Numerical experiments using the MNIST database show that this algorithm achieves better performance and learns faster than previous proposals.</description>

      <title>The Mpemba effect in the Descartes protocol: A time-delayed Newton's law of cooling approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the direct and inverse Mpemba effects within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling by introducing and analyzing the Descartes protocol, a three-reservoir thermal scheme in which each sample undergoes a single-step quench at different times. This protocol enables a transparent separation of the roles of the delay time $\tau$, the waiting time $t_{\text{w}}$, and the normalized warm temperature $\omega$, thus providing a flexible setting to characterize anomalous thermal relaxation. For instantaneous quenches, exact conditions for the existence of the Mpemba effect are obtained as bounds on $\omega$ for given $\tau$ and $t_{\text{w}}$. Within those bounds, the effect becomes maximal at a specific value $\omega=\widetilde{\omega}(t_{\text{w}})$, and its magnitude is quantified by the extremal value of the temperature-difference function at this optimum. Accurate and compact approximations for both $\widetilde{\omega}(t_{\text{w}})$ and the maximal magnitude $\text{Mp}(t_{\text{w}})$ are derived, showing in particular that the absolute maximum at fixed $\tau$ is reached for $t_{\text{w}}=\tau$. A comparison with a previously studied two-reservoir protocol reveals that, despite its additional control parameter, the Descartes protocol yields a smaller maximal magnitude of the effect. The analysis is extended to finite-rate quenches, where strict equality of bath conditions prevents a genuine Mpemba effect, although an approximate one survives when the bath time scale is sufficiently short. The developed framework offers a unified and analytically tractable approach that can be readily applied to other multi-step thermal protocols.</description>
