      <title>KnowMol: Advancing Molecular Large Language Models with Multi-Level Chemical Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The molecular large language models have garnered widespread attention due to their promising potential on molecular applications. However, current molecular large language models face significant limitations in understanding molecules due to inadequate textual descriptions and suboptimal molecular representation strategies during pretraining. To address these challenges, we introduce KnowMol-100K, a large-scale dataset with 100K fine-grained molecular annotations across multiple levels, bridging the gap between molecules and textual descriptions. Additionally, we propose chemically-informative molecular representation, effectively addressing limitations in existing molecular representation strategies. Building upon these innovations, we develop KnowMol, a state-of-the-art multi-modal molecular large language model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KnowMol achieves superior performance across molecular understanding and generation tasks.

      <title>Machine Olfaction and Embedded AI Are Shaping the New Global Sensing Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine olfaction is rapidly emerging as a transformative capability, with applications spanning non-invasive medical diagnostics, industrial monitoring, agriculture, and security and defense. Recent advances in stabilizing mammalian olfactory receptors and integrating them into biophotonic and bioelectronic systems have enabled detection at near single-molecule resolution thus placing machines on par with trained detection dogs. As this technology converges with multimodal AI and distributed sensor networks imbued with embedded AI, it introduces a new, biochemical layer to a sensing ecosystem currently dominated by machine vision and audition. This review and industry roadmap surveys the scientific foundations, technological frontiers, and strategic applications of machine olfaction making the case that we are currently witnessing the rise of a new industry that brings with it a global chemosensory infrastructure. We cover exemplary industrial, military and consumer applications and address some of the ethical and legal concerns arising. We find that machine olfaction is poised to bring forth a planet-wide molecular awareness tech layer with the potential of spawning vast emerging markets in health, security, and environmental sensing via scent.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Benchmark for RNA 3D Structure-Function Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relationship between RNA structure and function has recently attracted interest within the deep learning community, a trend expected to intensify as nucleic acid structure models advance. Despite this momentum, the lack of standardized, accessible benchmarks for applying deep learning to RNA 3D structures hinders progress. To this end, we introduce a collection of seven benchmarking datasets specifically designed to support RNA structure-function prediction. Built on top of the established Python package rnaglib, our library streamlines data distribution and encoding, provides tools for dataset splitting and evaluation, and offers a comprehensive, user-friendly environment for model comparison. The modular and reproducible design of our datasets encourages community contributions and enables rapid customization. To demonstrate the utility of our benchmarks, we report baseline results for all tasks using a relational graph neural network.</description>

      <title>AtomSurf : Surface Representation for Learning on Protein Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16519v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While there has been significant progress in evaluating and comparing different representations for learning on protein data, the role of surface-based learning approaches remains not well-understood. In particular, there is a lack of direct and fair benchmark comparison between the best available surface-based learning methods against alternative representations such as graphs. Moreover, the few existing surface-based approaches either use surface information in isolation or, at best, perform global pooling between surface and graph-based architectures.
  In this work, we fill this gap by first adapting a state-of-the-art surface encoder for protein learning tasks. We then perform a direct and fair comparison of the resulting method against alternative approaches within the Atom3D benchmark, highlighting the limitations of pure surface-based learning. Finally, we propose an integrated approach, which allows learned feature sharing between graphs and surface representations on the level of nodes and vertices across all layers.
  We demonstrate that the resulting architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on all tasks in the Atom3D benchmark, while adhering to the strict benchmark protocol, as well as more broadly on binding site identification and binding pocket classification. Furthermore, we use coarsened surfaces and optimize our approach for efficiency, making our tool competitive in training and inference time with existing techniques.

      <title>LICO: Large Language Models for In-Context Molecular Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimizing black-box functions is a fundamental problem in science and engineering. To solve this problem, many approaches learn a surrogate function that estimates the underlying objective from limited historical evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong pattern-matching capabilities via pretraining on vast amounts of data, stand out as a potential candidate for surrogate modeling. However, directly prompting a pretrained language model to produce predictions is not feasible in many scientific domains due to the scarcity of domain-specific data in the pretraining corpora and the challenges of articulating complex problems in natural language. In this work, we introduce LICO, a general-purpose model that extends arbitrary base LLMs for black-box optimization, with a particular application to the molecular domain. To achieve this, we equip the language model with a separate embedding layer and prediction layer, and train the model to perform in-context predictions on a diverse set of functions defined over the domain. Once trained, LICO can generalize to unseen molecule properties simply via in-context prompting. LICO performs competitively on PMO, a challenging molecular optimization benchmark comprising 23 objective functions, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on its low-budget version PMO-1K.</description>

      <title>PRING: Rethinking Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction from Pairs to Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality, multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818 interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories, consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The dataset and source code of PRING are available at https://github.com/SophieSarceau/PRING.</description>
