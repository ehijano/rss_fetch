      <title>Controlled symmetry breaking of the Fermi surface in ultracold polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions between ultracold polar molecules are predicted to drive exotic quantum phases, yet direct many-body signatures of these interactions in degenerate Fermi gases have remained elusive. Here, we report the observation of an interaction-induced controlled deformation of the Fermi surface, providing a clear many-body signature in a deeply degenerate Fermi gas of $^{23}\text{Na}^{40}\text{K}$ molecules. Using double microwave (MW) shielding, we prepare $8 \times 10^3$ molecules at $0.23(1)$ times the Fermi temperature, achieving a three-fold suppression of inelastic losses compared to single MW shielding while preserving strong elastic dipolar scattering. We observe Fermi surface deformations of up to $7\,\%$, more than two times larger than those observed in magnetic atoms, despite operating at two orders of magnitude lower densities. Crucially, we demonstrate continuous tuning of the interaction potential from axial U(1) to biaxial C$_{2}$ symmetry, directly imprinting this geometry onto the Fermi surface. We find excellent agreement between our experimental results and parameter-free Hartree-Fock theory. These results establish MW-shielded polar molecules as a highly tunable platform for exploring strongly correlated dipolar Fermi matter and offer a promising path towards topological superfluidity.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic quantum self-trapping in bosonic Josephson junctions: an exact quantum treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fully quantum evolution of the population imbalance in a perfectly symmetric Bose-Josephson junction modeled by a two-mode Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, focusing on the validity of macroscopic quantum self-trapping beyond the mean-field theory. We show that for any finite number of particles the exact quantum dynamics leads to the breakdown of macroscopic quantum self-trapping after a finite time, regardless of the initial state. Using the symmetries of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, we provide a mathematical demonstration of this result and analyze the spectral properties governing the dynamics. We identify a branching behavior in the eigenvalues differences and a nontrivial structure of the population-imbalance amplitudes. These features allow us to distinguish two clearly different dynamical regimes and to elucidate the mechanism leading to the emergence of a quasi-MQST regime for large particle numbers. These findings bridge the gap between mean-field predictions and exact quantum dynamics and provide insight into the emergence of classical nonlinear behavior from finite quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Metastable confinement in Rydberg lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confinement and string breaking are two fundamental phenomena in gauge theories. Signatures of both are currently pursued in quantum-simulator experiments, opening a new angle on strongly interacting dynamics of gauge fields out of equilibrium, complementary to traditional particle-physics settings. In this work, we report the emergence of metastable confinement dynamics in a U(1) lattice gauge theory, originating from the competition between string tension and four-Fermi coupling - a competition that naturally arises in Rydberg atom arrays. We show that the initial string state can be resonantly melted through controlled energy matching, a phenomenon we identify as resonant string breaking. We demonstrate this mechanism for both static and Floquet-driven systems, where periodic modulation generates a spectrum of tunable sideband resonances. Our work provides new insights into the mechanisms of confinement and string breaking driven by long-range interactions and time-dependent fields, which are available in current quantum simulators on a variety of platforms.</description>

      <title>Equal-spin and opposite-spin density-density correlations in the BCS-BEC crossover: Gauge Symmetry, Pauli Exclusion Principle, Wick's Theorem and Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of spin-dependent density-density correlations, that is valid for any temperature, interactions, dimensions and mass or population status of Fermi gases with two internal states. We use gauge invariance and the Pauli principle to establish constraints on the spin-dependent density-density correlations that are consistent with the fluctuation-dissipation and Wick's theorem. As an example, we study the spin-dependent density-density correlations from the BCS to the Bose regime in two dimensions at zero temperature, inspired by experiments in 6Li. We show that two-particle irreducible contributions involving collective excitations, many-particle scattering and vertex corrections, are essential to describe experiments. In particular they turn out to be responsible for the emergence of an experimentally observed minimum in the opposite-spin density-density correlations.</description>

      <title>Finite-time thermal refrigerator in interacting Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a finite-time thermodynamic refrigeration cycle realized numerically in three-dimensional, weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). The setup consists of three spatially separated condensates -- system, piston, and reservoir -- coupled through time-dependent potential barriers that implement compression, expansion, and contact strokes. Finite-temperature initial states are generated with the Stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation, and the subsequent dynamics are evolved using the truncated Gross-Pitaevskii equation. To measure temperatures we use a momentum-space thermometry method that provides estimates for each condensate. We find that despite mass transfer and sound excitations, the protocol achieves successful cooling during consecutive cycles: the first cycle lowers its temperature by ~20%, and a second cycle yields additional, though reduced, cooling, reaching a final ~27% cooling from the initial state. Our results show that interacting BECs can sustain finite-time quantum thermal cycles under realistic conditions, and provide a platform for exploring different refrigeration schemes, optimized control protocols, and shortcuts to adiabaticity.</description>

      <title>A Maxwell Fish-Eye Lens in a Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally realize an analogue of the optical Maxwell fish-eye lens (MFEL) using phononic excitations in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). A MFEL is characterized by a radially symmetric, spatially varying refractive index with the remarkable property that rays emitted from any point within the lens are perfectly focused at their image points. While the implementation of such gradient-index lenses is challenging in conventional optical systems, BECs offer a highly tunable platform in which the spatially varying speed of sound of collective excitations -- phonons, the acoustic-wave analogues of photons -- can be engineered and their dynamics observed in real time. Time-resolved measurements of phonon wavefronts reveal focusing behavior that shows good agreement with analytical theory and numerical simulations. This work provides both a geometric and physical framework for engineering effective refractive indices using ultracold atoms, and simulating wave propagation on effective spherical geometries.</description>

      <title>Taxonomy of Integrable and Ground-State Solvable Models: Jastrow Wavefunctions on Graphs and Parent Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of many-body systems of distinguishable continuous-variable particles in which interparticle interactions are set by the adjacency matrix of a graph. The ground-state wavefunction of such systems is of a generalized Jastrow form involving the product of pair-correlation functions over the edge set of the graph. These systems describe quantum fluids when the graph is complete, and the pair function has a well-defined permutation symmetry. In general, they provide the continuous-variable generalization of spin systems on graphs, with broken permutation symmetry. The corresponding parent Hamiltonian is shown to include (a) two-body interactions determined by the graph adjacency matrix and (b) three-body interactions over all possible 2-paths on the graph. Employing elements of graph theory, we chart the landscape of models, recovering known instances in the literature and providing numerous new examples of ground-state solvable models for which the system Hamiltonian, ground-state wavefunction, and corresponding energy eigenvalue are specified.</description>

      <title>Generating entangled polaritonic condensates by pumping with entangled pairs of photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the steady state of two single-mode uniform spatially separated polaritonic conden- sates exposed to resonant pumping with entangled pairs of photons. We demonstrate the principal possibility of driving the system to an entangled state despite its exposure to noises arising from the excitonic reservoir and photon leakage through the microcavity mirrors. Estimates are provided for the flux of entangled particles required to drive the system into a steady state that violates the partial-transpose criterion for entanglement. Furthermore, we trace the evolution of the system after a sudden disappearance of the entangled pumping. Our analysis provides estimates for the entanglement lifetime in a system of two exciton-polariton condensates</description>

      <title>(1+1)-Dimensional Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation with contact interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of contact interactions in the dynamics of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) modeled through the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation in one spatial dimension. While the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm successfully explains structure formation on large scales, its small-scale predictions remain in tension with observations. FDM offers an alternative framework, where local self-interactions can further influence the formation and evolution of structures. We explore both attractive and repulsive contact interactions in static and expanding backgrounds. Using numerical simulations, we examine their impact on three key scenarios: the properties of the lowest-energy stationary solution, the relaxation of localized initial states, and the gravitational collapse of nonlocalized states. Our results show that contact interactions modify the density profile of the stationary solution and affect the onset of characteristic stages of gravitational collapse, particularly the shell-crossing event. In the (1+1) model, we confirm that relaxation does not converge to the lowest-energy stationary solution, even when local self-interactions are included. Taken together, local self-interactions play a relevant role in shaping the nonlinear dynamics of FDM and motivate further studies in higher-dimensional and cosmologically realistic settings.</description>

      <title>Polarization-selective quantum cooperative response in dual-species atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform for quantum light-matter interfaces, yet single-species arrays are constrained by in-plane symmetry, restricting polarization control. Here we investigate the cooperative optical response of dual-species subwavelength atom arrays, in which intrinsic polarizability difference breaks in-plane symmetry. By engineering the lattice spacing and detunings, the arrays exhibit polarization-dependent subradiant modes, enabling complete reflection of specific polarization component. Leveraging this mechanism, we assemble array units as functional pixels and demonstrate a scalable polarization-selective quantum light modulator. Our work establishes a dynamically reconfigurable atomic-photonic platform for versatile subwavelength quantum optical elements.</description>

      <title>Analogue many-body gravitating quantum systems with a network of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operational probes of the interface between quantum mechanics and general relativity in the Newtonian regime -- via mass-energy equivalence in clocks or spatial superpositions in interferometers -- share a common description in terms of an effective qubit-qubit Ising coupling. Here we generalize both paradigms to interacting $(N+1)$-level effective qudits made of atomic ensembles with particle number, $N$. The many-body enhancement boosts the signal-to-noise and increases the effective interaction rate, facilitating the observation of gravitationally induced entanglement and decoherence, certified by metrological witnesses based on local and collective measurements. Furthermore, we show that quantum effects induced by gravitational interaction can be simulated by trapped bimodal Bose-Einstein condensates with long-range (e.g. dipolar) coupling, providing a programmable analogue platform to explore gravitating quantum dynamics at accessible time and energy scales. Finally, extending the protocol to a sensor network broadens the entanglement-detection window.</description>

      <title>The crossover from classical to quantum transport in a weakly-interacting Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact solution of the quantum kinetic equation of a weakly interacting Fermi gas in the crossover from the degenerate Fermi-liquid regime to the classical Boltzmann gas. We construct families of orthogonal polynomials tailored to each angular momentum channel, enabling a fast and systematically improvable decomposition of the phase-space distribution. This approach yields accurate, non-variational predictions for the shear viscosity, thermal diffusivity, and spin diffusivity to leading order in the scattering length. We demonstrate that the commonly used relaxation-time approximation fails dramatically at low temperature--by up to 25%. Our method provides a numerically efficient framework for benchmarking transport in strongly correlated regimes and for simulating the kinetics of quantum gases beyond hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Light-enhanced dipolar interactions between exciton polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the scenario of excitons in a semiconductor bilayer that are strongly coupled to cavity photons, leading to the formation of dipolar exciton polaritons (dipolaritons). Using a realistic pseudopotential for the dipolar interactions, we exactly determine the scattering between dipolaritons, accounting for the hybridization between interlayer and intralayer excitons. Similar to conventional non-dipolar polaritons, we find that the light-matter coupling enhances the interactions between dipolaritons by forcing excitons to scatter at energies that would otherwise be forbidden in ordinary exciton-exciton collisions. However, we show that this light enhancement is larger for long-range dipolar interactions than for short-range intralayer interactions, and is sensitive to the (non-uniform) dielectric environment of the bilayer. Crucially, we find that the largest dipolariton interactions are achieved for transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers in vacuum. Our results thus reveal the optimal dipolariton setup for realizing strong photon correlations.</description>
