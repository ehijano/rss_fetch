      <description>arXiv:2408.03366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic disks lie at the heart of many of the most pressing astrophysical puzzles. There are sophisticated kinetic theories that describe some aspects of galaxy disk dynamics, but extracting quantitative predictions from those theories has proven very difficult, meaning they have shed little light on observations/simulations of galaxies. Here, we begin to address this issue by developing a tractable theory describing fluctuations and transport in thin galactic disks. Our main conceptual advance is to split potential fluctuations into asymptotic wavelength regimes relative to orbital guiding radius and epicyclic amplitude (similar to plasma gyrokinetics), and then to treat separately the dynamics in each regime. As an illustration, we apply our results to quasilinear theory, calculating the angular-momentum transport due to a transient spiral. At each stage we verify our formulae with numerical examples. Our approach should simplify many important calculations in galactic disk dynamics.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-CRISTAL Survey: Spatial extent of [CII] line emission in star-forming galaxies at $z=4-6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spatial extent of the [CII] line emission in a sample of 34 galaxies at $z=4-6$ from the ALMA-CRISTAL Survey. By modeling the [CII] line emission in the visibility data directly, we derive the effective radius of [CII] line emission assuming exponential distribution. These measurements comprise not only isolated galaxies but also interacting systems, identified thanks to the high spatial resolution of the data. The [CII] line radius ranges from 0.5 to 3.5 kpc with an average value of 1.9 kpc. We compare the [CII] sizes with the sizes of UV and FIR continua, which were measured from the HST F160W and ALMA Band-7 continuum images, respectively. We confirm that the [CII] line emission is more spatially extended than the continuum emission, with average size ratios of $R_{e,[CII]}/R_{e,UV}=2.90$ and $R_{e,[CII]}/R_{e,FIR}=1.54$, although about half of the FIR-detected sample show comparable spatial extent between [CII] line and FIR continuum emission ($R_{e,[CII]}\approx R_{e, FIR}$). The residual visibility data of the best-fit model do not show evidence of flux excesses either individually or in stacking analysis. This indicates that the [CII] line emission in star-forming galaxies can be characterized by an extended exponential disk profile. Overall, our results suggest that the spatial extent of [CII] line emission can primarily be explained by photodissociation regions associated with star formation activity, while the contribution from diffuse neutral medium (atomic gas) and the effects of mergers may further expand the [CII] line distributions, causing their variations among our sample. We report the correlations between the [CII] line, dust, and Lya line properties, which may be in line with our scenario. Future 3D-analysis of Lya and Ha lines will shed light on the association of the extended [CII] line emission with atomic gas and outflows.</description>

      <title>The active role of co-evolving haloes in stellar bar formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use idealised N-body simulations of equilibrium discs in live and static haloes to study how dark matter co-evolution impacts the assembly of stellar particles into a bar and the halo response. Initial conditions correspond to a marginally unstable disc according to commonly used disc stability criteria, and are evolved for the equivalent of about 150 disc dynamical times (10Gyr). An extensive convergence study ensures accurate modelling of the bar formation process. Live haloes lead to the formation of a strong bar, but the same disc remains unbarred when evolved in a static halo. Neither seeded disc instabilities, nor longer (60Gyr) simulations result in the formation of a bar when the halo is static. When the live halo is replaced with a static analogue at later times the previously robust bar slowly dissipates, suggesting: (1) the co-evolution of the disc and halo is critical for the assembly and long-term survival of bars in marginally unstable discs; and (2) global disc stability criteria must be modified for discs in the presence of live haloes. In our live halo runs, a "dark bar" grows synchronously with the stellar bar. Processes that inhibit the transfer of angular momentum between the halo and disc may stabilise a galaxy against bar formation, and can lead to the dissolution of the bar itself. This raises further questions about the puzzling stability of observed discs that are marginally unstable, but unbarred.</description>

      <title>COOL-LAMPS VIII: Known wide-separation lensed quasars and their host galaxies reveal a lack of evolution in $M_{\rm{BH}}/M_\star$ since $z\sim 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide-separation lensed quasars (WSLQs) are a rare class of strongly lensed quasars, magnified by foreground massive galaxy clusters, with typically large magnifications of the multiple quasar images. They are a relatively unexplored opportunity for detailed study of quasar host galaxies. The current small sample of known WSLQs has a median redshift of $z\approx 2.1$, larger than most other samples of quasar host galaxies studied to date. Here, we derive precise constraints on the properties of six WSLQs and their host galaxies, using parametric surface brightness fitting, measurements of quasar emission lines, and stellar population synthesis of host galaxies in six WSLQ systems. Our results, with significant uncertainty, indicate that these six hosts are a mixture of star-forming and quiescent galaxies. To probe for co-evolution between AGNs and host galaxies, we model the offset from the `local' ($z=0$) $M_{\rm{BH}}\unicode{x2013}M_\star$ relation as a simple power-law in redshift. Accounting for selection effects, a WSLQ-based model for evolution in the $M_{\rm{BH}}\unicode{x2013}M_\star$ relation has a power-law index of $\gamma_M=-0.42\pm0.31$, consistent with no evolution. Compared to several literature samples, which mostly probe unlensed quasars at $z&lt;2$, the WSLQ sample shows less evolution from the local relation, at $\sim 4\sigma$. We find that selection affects and choices of $M_{\rm{BH}}$ calibration are the most important systematics in these comparisons. Given that we resolve host galaxy flux confidently even from the ground in some instances, our work demonstrates that WSLQs and highly magnified AGNs are exceptional systems for future AGN$\unicode{x2013}$host co-evolution studies.</description>

      <title>Constraining the duration of ram pressure stripping features in the optical from the direction of jellyfish galaxy tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ram pressure stripping is perhaps the most efficient mechanism for removing gas and quenching galaxies in dense environments as they move through the intergalactic medium. Extreme examples of on-going ram pressure stripping are known as jellyfish galaxies, characterized by a tail of stripped material that can be directly observed in multiple wavelengths. Using the largest homogeneous broad-band optical jellyfish candidate sample in local clusters known to date, we measure the angle between the direction of the tails visible in the galaxies, and the direction towards the host cluster center. We find that $33\%$ of the galaxy tails point away from the cluster center, $18\%$ point towards the cluster center, and $49\%$ point elsewhere. Moreover, we find stronger signatures of ram pressure stripping happening on galaxies with a tail pointing away and towards the cluster center, and larger velocity dispersion profiles for galaxies with tails pointing away. These results are consistent with a scenario where ram pressure stripping has a stronger effect for galaxies following radial orbits on first infall. The results also suggest that in many cases, radially infalling galaxies are able to retain their tails after pericenter and continue to experience significant on-going ram pressure stripping. We further constrain the lifespan of the optical tails from the moment they first appear to the moment they disappear, by comparing the observed tail directions with matched N-body simulations through Bayesian parameter estimation. We obtain that galaxy tails appear for the first time at $\sim 1.16$ R$_{200}$ and disappear $\sim660$ Myr after pericenter.</description>

      <title>The Galactic Center in Color: Measuring Extinction with High-Proper-Motion Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky Way's central parsec is a highly extinguished region with a population of high-proper-motion stars. We have tracked 145 stars for $\sim$10 years at wavelengths between 1 and 4 microns to analyze extinction effects in color-magnitude space. Approximately $30\%$ of this sample dims and reddens over the course of years, likely from the motion of sources relative to an inhomogeneous screen of dust. We correct previous measurements of the intrinsic variability fraction for differential extinction effects, resulting in a reduced stellar variability fraction of $34\%$. The extinction variability sub-sample shows that the extinguishing material has sub-arcsecond scales, much smaller variations than previously reported. The observed extinction events imply a typical cross-section of 500 AU and a density of around $3 \times 10^{4} \ \mathrm{atoms/cm^{3}}$ for the extinguishing material, which are consistent with measurements of filamentary dust and gas at the Galactic Center. Furthermore, given that the stars showing extinction variability tend to be more highly reddened than the rest of the sample, the extinction changes are likely due to material localized to the Galactic Center region. We estimate the relative extinction between 1 and 4 microns as, $\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{H}}:\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{K'}}:\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{L'}} = 1.67 \pm 0.05:1:0.69 \pm 0.03$. Our measurement of extinction at longer wavelengths -- L' (3.8 $\mu$m) -- is inconsistent with recent estimations of the integrated extinction towards the central parsec. One interpretation of this difference is that the dust variations this experiment is sensitive to -- which are local to the Galactic Center -- are dominated by grains of larger radius than the foreground.</description>

      <title>The Chicago-Carnegie Hubble Program: The JWST J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) Extragalactic Distance Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The J-region asymptotic giant branch (JAGB) method is a new standard candle based on the constant luminosities of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars in the J band. The JAGB method is independent of the Cepheid and TRGB distance indicators. Therefore, we can leverage it to both cross-check Cepheid and TRGB distances for systematic errors and use it to measure an independent local Hubble constant. The JAGB method also boasts a number of advantages in measuring distances relative to the TRGB and Cepheids, several of which are especially amplified when combined with JWST's revolutionary resolving power. First, JAGB stars are 1 mag brighter in the NIR than the TRGB, and can be discovered from single-epoch NIR photometry unlike Cepheids which require congruent optical imaging in at least 12 epochs. Thus, JAGB stars can be used to measure significantly farther distances than both the TRGB stars and Cepheids using the same amount of observing time. Further advantages include: JAGB stars are easily identified solely via their colors and magnitudes, dust extinction is reduced in near-infrared observations, and JAGB stars are ubiquitous in all galaxies with intermediate-age populations. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that identifies the optimal location in a galaxy for applying the JAGB method, so as to minimize effects from crowding. We then deploy this algorithm in JWST NIRCam imaging of seven SN Ia host galaxies to measure their JAGB distances, undertaking a completely blind analysis. The zero-point of this JAGB distance scale is set in the water mega-maser galaxy NGC 4258. In our CCHP overview paper Freedman et al. (2024), we apply the JAGB distances measured in this paper to the Carnegie Supernova Program (CSP) SNe Ia sample, measuring a Hubble constant of H0 = 67.96 +/- 1.85 (stat) km/s/Mpc.</description>

      <title>A public grid of radiative transfer simulations for Lyman-alpha and metal lines in idealised galactic outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03605v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vast majority of star-forming galaxies are surrounded by large reservoirs of gas ejected from the interstellar medium. Ultraviolet absorption and emission lines represent powerful diagnostics to constrain the cool phase of these outflows, through resonant transitions of hydrogen and metal ions. The interpretation of these observations is often remarkably difficult as it requires detailed modelling of the propagation of the continuum and emission lines in the gas. To this aim, we present a large public grid of about 20000 simulated spectra which includes HI Lyman-alpha (Lya) and five metal transitions associated with MgII, CII, SiII, and FeII that is accessible online at https://rascas.univ-lyon1.fr/app/idealised_models_grid/. The spectra have been computed with the RASCAS radiative transfer code for 5760 idealised spherical configurations surrounding a central point source emission, and characterised by their column density, Doppler parameter, dust opacity, wind velocity, as well as various density/velocity gradients. Designed to interpret Lya and metal line profiles, our grid exhibits a wide diversity of resonant absorption and emission features, as well as fluorescent lines. We illustrate how it can help better constrain wind properties by performing a joint modelling of observed Lya, CII, and SiII spectra. Using CLOUDY simulations and virial scaling relations, we show that Lya is expected to be a faithful tracer of the gas at T=10^4-10^5 K, even if the medium is highly-ionised. While CII is found to probe the same range of temperatures as Lya, other metal lines merely trace cooler phases (T=10^4 K). As their gas opacity strongly depends on gas temperature, incident radiation field, metallicity and dust depletion, we caution that optically thin metal lines do not necessarily originate from low HI column densities and may not accurately probe Lyman continuum leakage.</description>

      <title>AstroSat UV Deep Field South -- I. Far and Near-ultraviolet Source Catalog of the GOODS South region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the AstroSat UV Deep Field South (AUDFs), an imaging survey using the wide-field Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope on board AstroSat. AUDFs covers $\sim 236$ arcmin$^{2}$ of the sky area, including the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) South field in F154W and N242W filters. The deep and shallow parts of AUDFs have exposure time $\sim 62000$ and $\sim31000$ sec respectively, in the F154W filter, while in the N242W filter, they are $\sim 64000$ and $\sim34000$ sec. These observations reached a $3\sigma$ depth of 27.2 and 27.7 AB mag with a $50\%$ completeness limit of 27 and 27.6 AB mag in the F154W and N242W filters, respectively. With the acquired depth, AUDFs is the deepest far and near-UV imaging data covering the largest area known to date at 1.2" - 1.6" spatial resolution. Two primary catalogs were constructed for the F154W and N242W filters, each containing 13495 and 19374 sources brighter than the 3$\sigma$ detection limit, respectively. Our galaxy counts power-law slope $\sim0.43$~dex~mag$^{-1}$ in the N242W filter matches well with HST/WFC3/UVIS observations.
  A wide range of extra-galactic science can be achieved with this unique data, such as providing a sample of galaxies emitting ionizing photons in the redshift range $z \sim 1 - 3$ and beyond; constraining the UV luminosity function, investigating the extended-UV (XUV) emission around star-forming galaxies and UV morphologies for $z &lt; 1$. The UV catalog will enhance the legacy value of the existing optical/IR imaging and spectroscopic observations from ground and space-based telescopes on the GOODS South field.</description>

      <title>Advancing spectroscopic understanding of HOCS$^+$: Laboratory investigations and astronomical implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sulphur-bearing species play crucial roles in interstellar chemistry, yet their precise characterisation remains challenging. Here, we present laboratory experiments aimed at extending the high-resolution spectroscopy of protonated carbonyl sulphide (HOCS$^+$), a recently detected molecular ion in space. Using a frequency-modulated free-space absorption spectrometer, we detected rotational transitions of HOCS$^+$ in an extended negative glow discharge with a mixture of H$_2$ and OCS, extending the high-resolution rotational characterisation of the cation well into the millimetre wave region (200-370 GHz). Comparisons with prior measurements and quantum chemical calculations revealed an overall agreement in the spectroscopic parameters. With the new spectroscopic dataset in hand, we re-investigated the observations of HOCS$^+$ towards G+0.693-0.027, which were initially based solely on K$_a$ = 0 lines contaminated by HNC$^{34}$S. This re-investigation enabled the detection of weak K$_a$ = 0 transitions, free from HNC$^{34}$S contamination. Our high-resolution spectroscopic characterisation also provides valuable insights for future millimetre and submillimetre astronomical observations of these species in different interstellar environments. In particular, the new high-resolution catalogue will facilitate the search for this cation in cold dark clouds, where very narrow line widths are typically observed.</description>

      <title>The UNCOVER Survey: First Release of Ultradeep JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectra for ~700 galaxies from z~0.3-13 in Abell 2744</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and observations of low resolution JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy from the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1 JWST Treasury program. Targets are selected using JWST/NIRCam photometry from UNCOVER and other programs, and cover a wide range of categories and redshifts to ensure the legacy value of the survey. These categories include the first galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$, faint galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization ($z\gtrsim6-8$), high redshift AGN ($z\gtrsim6$), Population III star candidates, distant quiescent and dusty galaxies ($1\lesssim z \lesssim 6$), and filler galaxies sampling redshift--color--magnitude space from $z\sim 0.1-13$. Seven NIRSpec MSA masks across the extended Abell 2744 cluster were observed, along with NIRCam parallel imaging in 8 filters (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, F444W, F480M) over a total area of ~26 arcmin$^2$, overlapping existing HST coverage from programs including the Hubble Frontier Fields and BUFFALO. We successfully observed 553 objects down to $m_{\mathrm{F444W}}\sim30\mathrm{AB}$, and by leveraging mask overlaps, we reach total on-target exposure times ranging from 2.4-16.7h. We demonstrate the success rate and distribution of confirmed redshifts, and also highlight the rich information revealed by these ultradeep spectra for a subset of our targets. An updated lens model of Abell 2744 is also presented, including 14 additional spectroscopic redshifts and finding a total cluster mass of $M_{\mathrm{SL}}=(2.1\pm0.3)\times10^{15}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. We publicly release reduced 1D and 2D spectra for all objects observed in Summer 2023 along with a spectroscopic redshift catalog and the updated lens model of the cluster (https://jwst-uncover.github.io/DR4.html).</description>

      <title>The Valuable Long-period Cluster Cepheid KQ Scorpii and other Calibration Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Cepheid KQ Sco is a valuable anchor for the distance scale because of its long pulsation period ($28^{\rm d}.7$) and evidence implying membership in the open cluster UBC 1558. Analyses tied to Gaia DR3 astrometry, photometry, spectroscopy, radial velocities, and 2MASS-VVV photometry indicate a common distance of $2.15\pm0.15$ kpc (L21 DR3 corrections applied). Additional cluster Cepheid candidates requiring follow-up are identified, and it's suggested that a team of international researchers could maintain a cluster Cepheid database to guide the broader community to cases where consensus exists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We hereby reported a new physical binary cluster (ASCC~19 and ASCC~21) near the Orion star-forming complex based on the data in the literature. Analysis of the results shows that it is a primordial binary cluster. It is possible that this binary cluster is undergoing two-body relaxation by inspecting the radial velocity anomalies of its member stars. In addition, based on the analysis of its metal abundances, we found that the components of this binary cluster may have been formed by the deep fusion of multiple subclusters. Finally, we investigated the 3D morphology of this binary cluster, simulated the trajectories of its components in the galactic disk, and concluded that its components may not merge into a single cluster.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Primordial Magnetic Fields from High Redshift Stellar Mass Density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) play a pivotal role in influencing small-scale fluctuations within the primordial density field, thereby enhancing the matter power spectrum within the context of the $\Lambda$CDM model at small scales. These amplified fluctuations accelerate the early formation of galactic halos and stars, which can be observed through advanced high-redshift observational techniques. Therefore, Stellar Mass Density (SMD) observations, which provide significant opportunities for detailed studies of galaxies at small scales and high redshifts, offer a novel perspective on small-scale cosmic phenomena and constrain the characteristics of PMFs. In this study, we compile 14 SMD data points at redshifts $z &gt; 6$ and derive stringent constraints on the parameters of PMFs, which include the amplitude of the magnetic field at a characteristic scale of $\lambda=1\,{\rm Mpc}$, denoted as $B_0$, and the spectral index of the magnetic field power spectrum, $n_{\rm B}$. At 95\% confidence level, we establish upper limits of $B_0 &lt; 4.44$ nG and $n_{\rm B} &lt; -2.24$, along with a star formation efficiency of approximately $f_*^0 \sim 0.1$. If we fix $n_{\rm B}$ at specific values, such as $-2.85$, $-2.9$, and $-2.95$, the 95\% upper limits for the amplitude of the magnetic field can be constrained to 1.33 nG, 2.21 nG, and 3.90 nG, respectively. Finally, we attempt to interpret recent early observations provided by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) using the theory of PMFs, and find that by selecting appropriate PMF parameters, it is possible to explain these results without significantly increasing the star formation efficiency.</description>

      <title>Formation of WNL stars for the MW and LMC based on the k-omega model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adopt a set of second-order differential equations ($k-\omega$ model) to handle core convective overshooting in massive stars, simulate the evolution of WNL stars with different metallicities and initial masses, both rotating and non-rotating models, and compare the results with the classical overshooting model. The results indicate that under the same initial conditions, the $k-\omega$ model generally produces larger convective cores and wider overshooting regions, thereby increasing the mass ranges and extending the lifetimes of WNL stars, as well as the likelihood of forming WNL stars. The masses and lifetimes of WNL stars both increase with higher metallicities and initial masses. Under higher-metallicity conditions, the two overshooting schemes significantly differ in their impacts on lifetimes of the WNL stars, but insignificant in the mass ranges of the WNL stars. Rotation may drive the formation of WNL stars in low-mass, metal-poor counterparts, with this effect being more pronounced in the OV model. The surface nitrogen of metal-rich WNL stars formed during the MS phase is likely primarily from the CN-cycle, while it may come from both the CN- and NO-cycles for relatively metal-poor counterparts. Our model can effectively explain the distribution of WNL stars in the Milky Way, but appears to have inadequacies in explaining the WNL stars in the LMC.</description>

      <title>The $R$-Process Alliance: Fifth Data Release from the Search for $R$-Process-Enhanced Metal-poor Stars in the Galactic Halo with the GTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the abundance pattern of metal-poor stars and the production of heavy elements through various nucleosynthesis processes offers crucial insights into the chemical evolution of the Milky Way, revealing primary sites and major sources of rapid neutron-capture process ($r$-process) material in the Universe. In this fifth data release from the $R$-Process Alliance, we present the detailed chemical abundances of 41 faint (down to V = 15.8) and extremely metal-poor (down to [Fe/H] = -3.3) halo stars selected from the $R$-Process Alliance (RPA). We obtained high-resolution spectra for these objects with the HORuS spectrograph on the Gran Telescopio Canarias. We measure the abundances of light, alpha, Fe-peak, and neutron-capture elements. We report the discovery of five CEMP, one limited-$r$, three $r$-I, and four $r$-II stars, and six Mg-poor stars. We also identify one star of a possible globular cluster origin at an extremely low metallicity at [Fe/H] = -3.0. This adds to the growing evidence of a lower limit metallicity floor for globular cluster abundances. We use the abundances of Fe-peak elements and the alpha-elements to investigate the contributions from different nucleosynthesis channels in the progenitor supernovae. We find the distribution of [Mg/Eu] as a function of [Fe/H] to have different enrichment levels, indicating different possible pathways and sites of their production. We also reveal differences in the trends of the neutron-capture element abundances of Sr, Ba, and Eu of various r-I and r-II stars from the RPA data releases, which provide constraints on their nucleosynthesis sites and subsequent evolution.</description>

      <title>Violations of energy conservation in Horava-Lifshitz gravity: a new ingredient in the dark matter puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between Horava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity and more general theories where the local Hamiltonian constraint is lost, for example due to the time variability of the Lagrangian (e.g. via its parameters) where time is defined on a foliation according to a prescription mimicking Lambda and 4-volume time in unimodualr gravity. In one direction we subject the multitude of parameters in HL to this variability game, mimicking RG flow in a cosmological setting. In the opposite direction, we examine the evolution on the left-over Hamiltonian should the HL algebra of constraints be still applicable, rather than the algebra of General Relativity being restored. Within the projectable theory, the non-vanishing Hamiltonian can be reinterpreted as a pressureless fluid. Unlike in theories with similar variability based on GR, violations of stress-energy tensor conservation persist, and these are computed here for the full class of projectable HL models. The phenomenological implications are examined: remarkably the driven solutions resulting from these energy conservation violations have the correct profiles to flatten the galactic rotation curves in a toy model. Unfortunately this interesting remark does not survive closer scrutiny: neither is the driven solution an attractor, nor does it have the right sign for acceptable values of the HL parameter, certainly for the simplest terms examined. Yet, in this paper we have established a new ingredient in the dark matter mystery, the possibility of energy conservation violation.</description>

Abstract: Spin can influence the dynamics of the already chaotic black hole triplet system. We follow this problem in two sets of simulations: first, the Agekian-Anosova region (or region D), and second, using Pythagorean triangles. We use ARCcode, an N-body code that performs numerical integration of orbits. This code includes post-Newtonian corrections, which we include up to the 2.5$^{th}$ order. In set one of our simulations, we fix the masses of the black holes at 10$^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$. Then we run the simulations first without any spin added and after by initialising spin on one of the black holes. We find that after including spin into the system, 22\% of the simulations changed outcomes. Either the systems went from having all black holes merging to having a black hole escaping the system, or vice versa. In the second set of simulations, we expanded into Pythagorean triangles as initial positions of black holes, stemming from Burrau's three-body problem. We varied the masses of the black holes from 10$^{0}$ M$_{\odot}$ - 10$^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$. Black holes in these systems were given spin in normalised units ranging from 0 to $\sim$ 0.95. We find that black holes in the intermediary mass range of our simulations (10$^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$-10$^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$), were influenced the most by spin, particularly in their lifetimes. We also find that simulations, initialised as 2D, become 3D.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic fields permeate the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way, and are essential to explain the dynamical evolution and current shape of the Galaxy. Magnetic fields reveal themselves via their influence on the surrounding matter, and as such are notoriously hard to measure independently of other tracers. In this work, we attempt to disentangle an all sky map of the line-of-sight parallel component of the Galactic magnetic field from the Faraday effect, utilizing several tracers of the Galactic thermal electron density. Additionally, we aim to produce a Galactic electron dispersion measure map and quantify several tracers of the structure of the ionized medium of the Milky Way. We rely on compiled catalogs of extragalactic Faraday rotation measures and Galactic pulsar dispersion measures, a well as data on bremsstrahlung and the hydrogen $\alpha$ spectral line to trace the ionized medium of the Milky Way. We present the first full sky map of the line-of-sight averaged Galactic magnetic field. Within this map, we find LoS parallel and LoS-averaged magnetic field strengths of up to 4 $\mu$G, with an all-sky root-mean-square of 1.1 $\mu$G, which is consistent with previous local measurements and global magnetic field models. Additionally, we produce a detailed electron dispersion measure map, which agrees with already existing parametric models at high latitudes, but suffers from systematic effects in the disk. Further analysis of our results with regard to the 3D structure of $n_{th}$ reveals that it follows a Kolmogorov-type turbulence for most of the sky. From the reconstructed dispersion measure and emission measure maps we construct several tracers of variability of $n_{th}$ along the LoS.</description>

      <title>Carbon envelopes around merging galaxies at z ~ 4.5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxies evolve through a dynamic exchange of material with their immediate surrounding environment, the so-called circumgalactic medium (CGM). Understanding the physics of gas flows and the nature of the CGM is thus fundamental to studying galaxy evolution, especially at $4 \leq z \leq 6$ (i.e. at post-Reionization Epoch) when galaxies rapidly assembled their masses and reached their chemical maturity. Galactic outflows are predicted to enrich the CGM with metals, although gas stripping in systems undergoing a major merger has also been suggested to play a role. In this work, we explore the metal enrichment of the medium around merging galaxies at $z \sim 4.5$, observed by the ALMA Large Program to INvestigate [CII] at Early times (ALPINE). To do so, we study the nature of the [CII]158 $\mu$m emission in the CGM around these systems, using simulations to help disentangle the mechanisms contributing to the CGM metal pollution. By adopting an updated classification of major merger systems in the ALPINE survey, we select and analyze merging galaxies whose components can be spatially and/or spectrally resolved in a robust way. Thus, we can distinguish between the [CII] emission coming from the single components of the system and that coming from the system as a whole. We also make use of the \texttt{dustyGadget} cosmological simulation to select synthetic analogs of observed galaxies and guide the interpretation of the observational results. We find a large diffuse [CII] envelope ($\gtrsim 20 $ kpc) embedding all the merging systems, with at least $25 \%$ of the total [CII] emission coming from the medium \textit{between} the galaxies. Using predictions from \texttt{dustyGadget} we suggest that this emission has a multi-fold nature, with dynamical interactions between galaxies playing a major role in stripping the gas and enriching the medium with heavy elements.}</description>

      <title>The impact of stellar bars on star-formation quenching: Insights from a spatially resolved analysis in the local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar bars are common morphological structures in the local Universe; according to optical and NIR surveys, they are present in about two-thirds of disc galaxies. These elongated structures are also believed to play a crucial role in secular evolutionary processes, because they are able to efficiently redistribute gas, stars, and angular momentum within their hosts, although it remains unclear as to whether they enhance or suppress star formation. A useful tool to investigate this ambiguity is the main sequence (MS) relation, which tightly links stellar mass ($M_{\star}$) and star formation rate (SFR). The main goal of this work is to explore star-formation processes in barred galaxies in order to assess the relevance of bars in star-formation quenching and whether or not they affect the typical log-linear trend of the resolved MS. To this purpose, we carried out a spatially resolved analysis on subkiloparsec (subkpc) scales for a sample of six nearby barred galaxies. We collected multi-wavelength photometric data from far-ultraviolet (FUV) to far-infrared (FIR) from the DustPedia database and applied a panchromatic spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting procedure on square apertures of fixed angular size (8" $\times$ 8") using the magphys code. For each galaxy, we obtain the distributions of stellar mass and SFR surface density and relate them in the $\log \Sigma_{\star}$ - $\log \Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ plane, deriving the spatially resolved MS relation. Although significant galaxy-to-galaxy variations are in place, we infer the presence of a common anti-correlation track in correspondence with the bar-hosting region, which shows systematically lower SFRs. This central quiescent signature can be interpreted as the result of a bar-driven depletion of gas reservoirs and a consequent halting of star formation. Our findings appear to support an inside-out quenching scenario.</description>

Abstract: The Orion Molecular Cloud complex, one of the nearest (D = 406 pc) and most extensively studied massive star-forming regions, is ideal for constraining the physics of stellar feedback, but its ~12 deg diameter on the sky requires a dedicated approach to mapping ionized gas structures within and around the nebula. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V) Local Volume Mapper (LVM) is a new optical integral field unit (IFU) that will map the ionized gas within the Milky Way and Local Group galaxies, covering 4300 deg^2 of the sky with the new LVM Instrument. We showcase optical emission line maps from LVM covering 12 deg^2 inside of the Orion belt region, with 195,000 individual spectra combined to produce images at 0.07 pc (35.3") resolution. This is the largest IFU map made (to date) of the Milky Way, and contains well-known nebulae (the Horsehead Nebula, Flame Nebula, IC 434, and IC 432), as well as ionized interfaces with the neighboring dense Orion B molecular cloud. We resolve the ionization structure of each nebula, and map the increase in both the [SII]/Ha and [NII]/Ha line ratios at the outskirts of nebulae and along the ionization front with Orion B. [OIII] line emission is only spatially resolved within the center of the Flame Nebula and IC 434, and our ~0.1 pc scale line ratio diagrams show how variations in these diagnostics are lost as we move from the resolved to the integrated view of each nebula. We detect ionized gas emission associated with the dusty bow wave driven ahead of the star sigma Orionis, where the stellar wind interacts with the ambient interstellar medium. The Horsehead Nebula is seen as a dark occlusion of the bright surrounding photo-disassociation region. This small glimpse into Orion only hints at the rich science that will be enabled by the LVM.</description>

      <title>BreakBRD Galaxies: Evolutionary Clues Through an Analysis of Gas Content</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By combining newly obtained deep GBT 21cm observations with optical spectroscopic data, we present an analysis of the gas content of BreakBRD galaxies, a population denoted by their blue star-forming centers and red quenched disks that do not appear to follow the typical inside-out evolution of spiral galaxies. We confirm previous results that the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) gas fractions of BreakBRDs are on-average lower than those of typical galaxies on the star-forming sequence (SFS), and find that their \ion{H}{1} fractions are generally higher than Green Valley (GV) galaxies. HI depletion times for BreakBRDs are roughly an order of magnitude lower than those of SFS galaxies, in stark contrast with GV galaxies that typically have much longer depletion times than SFS galaxies. The nuclear gas-phase metallicities of BreakBRDs have a broader distribution than SFS galaxies and are skewed towards slightly above-average values. BreakBRDs are systematically offset from the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation towards lower baryonic mass at a given rotation velocity. They also have higher typical HI asymmetries than SFS galaxies, and of those galaxies with spatially resolved gas velocity fields from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey, two-thirds are either highly distorted or completely misaligned relative to the stellar disk. Evidence supports a scenario where BreakBRDs are in an early phase of quenching, and there is mixed evidence that their behavior is related to past merger activity.</description>

      <title>CLASSY X: Highlighting Differences Between Partial Covering and Semi-Analytic Modeling in the Estimate of Galactic Outflow Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03646</link>

Abstract: Feedback driven massive outflows play a crucial role in galaxy evolution by regulating star formation and influencing the dynamics of surrounding media. Extracting outflow properties from spectral lines is a notoriously difficult process for a number of reasons, including the possibility that a substantial fraction of the outflow is carried by dense gas in a very narrow range in velocity. This gas can hide in spectra with insufficient resolution. Empirically motivated analysis based on the Apparent Optical Depth method, commonly used in the literature, neglects the contribution of this gas, and may therefore underestimate the true gas column density. More complex semi-analytical line transfer (e.g., SALT) models, on the other hand, allow for the presence of this gas by modeling the radial density and velocity of the outflows as power laws. Here we compare the two approaches to quantify the uncertainties in the inferences of outflow properties based on 1-D "down-the-barrel" using the UV spectra of the CLASSY galaxy sample. We find that empirical modeling may significantly underestimate the column densities relative to SALT analysis, particularly in the optically thick regime. We use simulations to show that the main reason for this discrepancy is the presence of large amount of dense material at low velocities, which can be hidden by the finite spectral resolution of the data. The SALT models in turn could over-estimate the column densities if the assumed power laws of the density profiles strong are not a property of actual outflows.</description>

      <title>The RGB tip in the SDSS, PS1, JWST, NGRST and Euclid photometric systems. Calibration in optical passbands using Gaia DR3 synthetic photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use synthetic photometry from Gaia DR3 BP and RP spectra for a large selected sample of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) to derive the magnitude of the Red Giant Branch (RGB) tip for these two galaxies in several passbands in various widely used optical photometric systems, including those of space missions that have not yet started operations. The RGB tip is estimated by fitting a well-motivated model to the RGB luminosity function (LF) within a fully Bayesian framework, allowing for a proper representation of the uncertainties of all the involved parameters and their correlations. Adopting the best available distance and interstellar extinction estimates we provide a calibration of the RGB tip as a standard candle for the following passbands: Johnson-Kron-Cousins I (mainly used for validation purposes), Hubble Space Telescope F814W, Sloan Digital Sky Survey i and z, PanSTARRS1 y, James Webb Space Telescope F090W, Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Z087, and Euclid I$_E$, with an accuracy of a few per cent, depending on the case. The trend of the absolute magnitude of the tip as a function of colour in the different passbands, beyond the range spanned by the LMC and SMC, as well as its dependency on age, is explored by means of theoretical models. These calibrations can be very helpful to obtain state-of-the-art RGB tip distance estimates to stellar systems in a very large range of distances directly from data in the natural photometric system of these surveys and/or missions, without recurring to photometric transformations.

      <title>What halts the growth of galaxies?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gas reservoir of galaxies can be altered by outflows driven by star-formation and luminous active galactic nuclei. Jets heating the surroundings of host galaxies can also prevent gas cooling and inflows. Spectacular examples for these three mass displacement channels have been observed, but their importance in transforming the galaxy population depends on the occurance rates of outflow triggers. We aim to investigate the absolute and relative importance of these three channels. In an observation-driven approach, we combine distribution functions and scaling relations to empirically compare average outflow rates across the galaxy total stellar mass spectrum and across cosmic time. This hinges on local outflow studies which should be extended to systematic, large and diverse samples, and we do not yet consider a halo heating effect by radiation-driven outflows. Our results show, independent of simulations, the dominance of star formation-driven outflows in low-mass galaxies. Massive galaxies today are predominately prevented from growing further by jet heating, while at z=1-3 all three processes are approximately similarly important. Over the full mass spectrum and cosmic history, outflows driven by the radiation from active galactic nuclei is never the dominant process.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations: Three Different Types of Galaxy Alignment in TNG100 Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, galaxy samples have been generated using mock observation techniques based on the results of TNG100-1 simulations to investigate three forms of intrinsic alignment: satellite-central alignment between the orientation of the brightest group galaxies (BGG) and the spatial distribution of their satellites, radial alignment between the satellites' orientation and the direction towards their BGG, as well as direct alignment between the orientation of BGG and that of its satellites. Overall, the predictions of galaxy alignment generally align with observations, although minor discrepancies have been identified. For satellite-central alignment, the alignment strength and color-dependence trends are well replicated by the mock observations. Regarding radial alignment, the signals are weak but discernible, with no apparent color dependence. As for direct alignment, no signal is detected, nor is there any color dependence. We also investigate the alignment dependencies on halo or the BGG properties, and proximity effect. For satellite-central alignment, the predicted alignment signal shows a positive correlation with halo and BGG mass, consistent with observations and previous predictions. Similar correlations have also been observed with the BGG age and metallicity, which merit future observational analysis for confirmation. Proximity effects have been observed for all three types of alignment, with satellites closer to the BGG exhibiting stronger alignment signals. The influence of galaxy definition and shape determination on alignment studies is also analyzed. This study underscores the importance of employing mock observation techniques for a fair comparison between predictions and observations.</description>

      <title>21 Balmer Jump Street: The Nebular Continuum at High Redshift and Implications for the Bright Galaxy Problem, UV Continuum Slopes, and Early Stellar Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study, from both a theoretical and observational perspective, the physical origin and spectroscopic impact of extreme nebular emission in high-redshift galaxies. The nebular continuum, which can appear during extreme starbursts, is of particular importance as it tends to redden UV slopes and has a significant contribution to the UV luminosities of galaxies. Furthermore, its shape can be used to infer the gas density and temperature of the ISM. First, we provide a theoretical background, showing how different stellar populations (SPS models, IMFs, and stellar temperatures) and nebular conditions impact observed galaxy spectra. We demonstrate that, for systems with strong nebular continuum emission, 1) UV fluxes can increase by up to 0.7~magnitudes (or more in the case of hot/massive stars) above the stellar continuum, which may help reconcile the surprising abundance of bright high-redshift galaxies and the elevated UV luminosity density at $z&gt;10$, 2) at high gas densities, UV slopes can redden from $\beta\lesssim-2.5$ to $\beta\sim-1$, 3) observational measurements of $\xi_{ion}$ are grossly underestimated, and 4) UV downturns from two-photon emission can masquerade as DLAs. Second, we present a dataset of 58 galaxies observed with NIRSpec on JWST at $2.5&lt;z&lt;9.0$ that are selected to have strong nebular continuum emission via the detection of the Balmer jump. Five of the 58 spectra are consistent with being dominated by nebular emission, exhibiting both a Balmer jump and a UV downturn consistent with two-photon emission. For some galaxies, this may imply the presence of hot massive stars and a top-heavy IMF. We conclude by exploring the properties of spectroscopically confirmed $z&gt;10$ galaxies, finding that UV slopes and UV downturns are in some cases redder or steeper than expected from SPS models, which may hint at more exotic (e.g. hotter/more massive stars or AGN) ionizing sources.</description>

      <title>Red Type-1 Quasars after Cosmic Noon and Impact on $L_{\rm UV}$-related Quasar Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decades, nearly a million quasars have been explored to shed light on the evolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies. The ultraviolet-to-optical spectra of type-1 quasars particularly offer insights into their black hole activities. Recent findings, however, raise questions about the prevalence of red type-1 quasars of which colors might be due to dust-obscuration and their potential influence on luminosity-related properties of quasars. We examine the fraction of red type-1 quasars within the redshift range of $0.68\leq z &lt; 2.20$, applying spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using optical-to-MIR photometric data of Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 14 quasars. Approximately 10\,\% of the type-1 quasars exhibit red colors suggestive of dust obscuration. There is an association between the brightness of the MIR luminosity and a higher fraction of red type-1 quasars, albeit with negligible redshift evolution. By employing $E(B-V)$ values from the SED fitting, we obtained dereddened luminosity of the red type-1 quasars and reassess the quasar luminosity function (QLF) and black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) estimates. Result shows a modest increase in the number density of bright quasars, linking to more flatten bright-end slope of QLFs, while $M_{\rm BH}$ adjustments are minimal. Current SDSS selections in optical could miss a significant population of heavily dust-obscured quasars. As future MIR surveys like SPHEREx expand, they may reveal enough obscured quasars to prompt a more profound revision of fundamental quasar properties.</description>

      <title>Eddington Ratios of Dust-obscured Quasars at $z \lesssim 1$: Evidence Supporting Dust-obscured Quasars as Young Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dust-obscured quasars have been suspected as the intermediate stage galaxies between merger-driven star-forming galaxies and unobscured quasars. This merger-driven galaxy evolution scenario suggests that dust-obscured quasars exhibit higher Eddington ratios ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$) than those of unobscured quasars. However, their high dust obscuration poses challenges to accurately measuring their $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ using commonly employed bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}$) and black hole (BH) mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) estimators based on the ultraviolet (UV) or optical luminosity. Recently, Kim et al. (2023) established new estimators for $L_{\rm bol}$ and $M_{\rm BH}$ based on mid-infrared (MIR) continuum luminosity ($L_{\rm MIR}$), which are less affected by dust obscuration. These estimators enable the study of a large number of dust-obscured quasars across a wide redshift range. In this study, we measure the $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ values of 30 dust-obscured quasars at $z \lesssim 1$, the largest sample size to date, using the $L_{\rm MIR}$-based $L_{\rm bol}$ and $M_{\rm BH}$ estimators. Our findings reveal that dust-obscured quasars exhibit significantly higher $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ values compared to unobscured quasars. Moreover, we confirm that the enhanced $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ values of dust-obscured quasars maintain consistency across the redshift span of 0 to 1. Our results strongly support the picture that dust-obscured quasars are in the earlier stage than unobscured quasars in the merger-driven galaxy evolutionary track.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Substructure Mass Power Spectrum of 23 SLACS Strong Galaxy-Galaxy Lenses with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing can be used as a tool for constraining the substructure in the mass distribution of galaxies. In this study we investigate the power spectrum of dark matter perturbations in a population of 23 Hubble Space Telescope images of strong galaxy-galaxy lenses selected from The Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) survey. We model the dark matter substructure as a Gaussian Random Field perturbation on a smooth lens mass potential, characterized by power-law statistics. We expand upon the previously developed machine learning framework to predict the power-law statistics by using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that accounts for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. For the training sets, we use the smooth lens mass potentials and reconstructed source galaxies that have been previously modelled through traditional fits of analytical and shapelet profiles as a starting point. We train three CNNs with different training set: the first using standard data augmentation on the best-fitting reconstructed sources, the second using different reconstructed sources spaced throughout the posterior distribution, and the third using a combination of the two data sets. We apply the trained CNNs to the SLACS data and find agreement in their predictions. Our results suggest a significant substructure perturbation favoring a high frequency power spectrum across our lens population.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2015-BLG-0845L: A low-mass M dwarf from the microlensing parallax and xallarap effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the analysis of the microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-0845, which was affected by both the microlensing parallax and xallarap effects. The former was detected via the simultaneous observations from the ground and Spitzer, and the latter was caused by the orbital motion of the source star in a relatively close binary. The combination of these two effects led to a mass measurement of the lens object, revealing a low-mass ($0.14 \pm 0.05 M_{\odot}$) M-dwarf at the bulge distance ($7.6 \pm 1.0$ kpc). The source binary consists of a late F-type subgiant and a K-type dwarf of $\sim1.2 M_{\odot}$ and $\sim 0.9 M_{\odot}$, respectively, and the orbital period is $70 \pm 10$ days. OGLE-2015-BLG-0845 is the first single-lens event in which the lens mass is measured via the binarity of the source. Given the abundance of binary systems as potential microlensing sources, the xallarap effect may not be a rare phenomenon. Our work thus highlights the application of the xallarap effect in the mass determination of microlenses, and the same method can be used to identify isolated dark lenses.</description>

      <title>Multiple Emission Regions in Jets of Low Luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus in NGC 4278</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) has detected very high energy gamma rays from the LINER galaxy NGC 4278, which has a low luminosity active galactic nucleus, and symmetric mildly relativistic S-shaped twin jets detected by radio observations. Few low-luminosity active galactic nuclei are detected in gamma rays due to their faintness. Earlier, several radio-emitting components were detected in the jets of NGC 4278. We model their radio emission with synchrotron emission of ultra-relativistic electrons to estimate the strength of the magnetic field inside these components within a time-dependent framework after including the ages of the different components. We show that the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission by these components cannot explain the Swift X-ray data and the LHAASO gamma-ray data from NGC 4278. We suggest that a separate component in one of the jets is responsible for the high energy emission whose age, size, magnetic field and the spectrum of the ultra-relativistic electrons inside it have been estimated after fitting the multi-wavelength data of NGC 4278 with the sum of the spectral energy distributions from the radio components and the high energy component. We note that the radio components of NGC 4278 are larger than the high-energy component which has also been observed in several high-luminosity active galactic nuclei.</description>
