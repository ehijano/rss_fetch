      <title>On the Hausdorff dimension and attracting laminations for fully irreducible automorphisms of free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a classic theorem of Birman and Series about the set of complete simple geodesics on a hyperbolic surface, we study the Hausdorff dimension of the set of endpoints in $\partial F_r$ of some abstract algebraic laminations associated with free group automorphisms. For a fully irreducible $\phi\in\Out(F_r)$ we show that the set of endpoints $\mathcal E_{L_\phi}\subseteq \partial F_r$ of the attracting lamination $L_\phi$ of $\phi$ has Hausdorff dimension $0$ for any tree $T\in\cvr$ and any visual metric on the boundary $\partial T=\partial F_r$. If $\phi$ is both atoroidal and fully irreducible, we deduce the same conclusion for the set of endpoints of the ending lamination $\Lambda_\phi$ of $\phi$ that gets collapsed by the Cannon-Thurston map $\partial F_r\to \partial G_\phi$ for the associated free-by-cyclic group $G_\phi=F_r\rtimes_\phi\mathbb Z$.</description>

      <title>An Arad and Fisman's theorem on products of conjugacy classes revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theorem of Z. Arad and E. Fisman establishes that if $A$ and $B$ are two conjugacy classes of a finite group $G$ such that either $AB=A\cup B$ or $AB=A^{-1} \cup B$, then $G$ cannot be non-abelian simple. We demonstrate that, in fact, $\langle A\rangle = \langle B\rangle$ is solvable, the elements of $A$ and $B$ are $p$-elements for some prime $p$, and $\langle A\rangle $ is $p$-nilpotent. Moreover, under the second assumption, it turns out that $A=B$ and this is the only possible case. This research is done by appealing to recently developed techniques and results that are based on the Classification of Finite Simple Groups.</description>

      <title>Kronecker classes, normal coverings and chief factors of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a group $G$, a subgroup $U \leq G$ and a group $\mathrm{Inn}(G) \leq A \leq \mathrm{Aut}(G)$, we say that $U$ is an $A$-covering group of $G$ if $G = \bigcup_{a\in A}U^a$. A theorem of Jordan (1872) implies that if $G$ is a finite group, $A = \mathrm{Inn}(G)$ and $U$ is an $A$-covering group of $G$, then $U = G$. Motivated by a question concerning Kronecker classes of field extensions, Neumann and Praeger (1988) conjectured that, more generally, there is an integer function $f$ such that if $G$ is a finite group and $U$ is an $A$-covering subgroup of $G$, then $|G:U| \leq f(|A:\mathrm{Inn}(G)|)$. A key piece of evidence for this conjecture is a theorem of Praeger (1994), which asserts that there is a two-variable integer function $g$ such that if $G$ is a finite group and $U$ is an $A$-covering subgroup of $G$, then $|G:U|\leq g(|A:\mathrm{Inn}(G)|,c)$ where $c$ is the number of $A$-chief factors of~$G$. Unfortunately, the proof of this result contains an error. In this paper, using a different argument, we give a correct proof of this theorem.</description>

      <title>Subexponential growth and $C^1$ actions on one-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a countable group with no finitely generated subgroup of exponential growth. We show that every action of $G$ on a countable set preserving a linear (respectively, circular) order can be realised as the restriction of some action by $C^1$ diffeomorphisms on an interval (respectively, the circle) to an invariant subset. As a consequence, every action of $G$ by homeomorphisms on a compact connected one-manifold can be made $C^1$ upon passing to a semi-conjugate action. The proof is based on a functional characterisation of groups of local subexponential growth.</description>

      <title>Approximate marked length spectrum rigidity in coarse geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the marked length spectra of isometric actions of groups with non-positively curved features. Inspired by the recent works of Butt we study approximate versions of marked length spectrum rigidity. We show that for pairs of metrics, the supremum of the quotient of their marked length spectra is approximately determined by their marked length spectra restricted to an appropriate finite set of conjugacy classes. Applying this to fundamental groups of closed negatively curved Riemannian manifolds allows us to refine Butt's result. Our results however apply in greater generality and do not require the acting group to be hyperbolic. For example we are able to compare the marked length spectra associated to mapping class groups acting on their Cayley graphs or on the curve graph.</description>

      <title>Two classes of oligomorphic groups with smooth topological isomorphism relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is an open question whether topological isomorphism of oligomorphic groups is smooth in the sense of Borel reducibility. We show smoothness for two Borel classes of oligomorphic groups: groups with no algebraicity, and groups with finitely many {\em essential} subgroups up to conjugacy. This second class, which is new, contains the class of automorphism groups of $\aleph_0$-categorical structures that have weak elimination of imaginaries, studied in (G.\ Paolini, the isomorphism problem for oligomorphic groups with weak elimination of imaginaries, Bull.\ London Math.\ Soc., 2024). Towards showing this, we obtain results on general oligomorphic groups $G$ that are of independent interest. $\Inn(G)$ is closed in $\Aut(G)$, where $\Aut(G)$ carries the topology of pointwise convergence on open cosets. $N_G/G$ is profinite, where $N_G$ denotes the normaliser of $G$ in $\Sym(\omega)$. The topological group $\Out(G)= \Aut(G)/\Inn(G)$ is totally disconnected, locally compact. Finally, we show that if $G$ is in one of our two classes, then $\Aut(G)$ is topologically isomorphic \mbox{to an oligomorphic group, and that $\Out(G)$ is profinite.}</description>

      <title>$\aleph_1$-free abelian non-Archimedean Polish groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An uncountable $\aleph_1$-free group can not admit a Polish group topology but an uncountable $\aleph_1$-free abelian group can, as witnessed e.g. by the Baer-Specker group $\mathbb{Z}^\omega$. In this paper we study $\aleph_1$-free abelian non-Archimedean Polish groups. We prove two results. The first is that being $\aleph_1$-free abelian is a complete co-analytic problem in the space of closed subgroups of $S_\infty$. The second is that there are continuum many $\aleph_1$-free abelian non-Archimedean Polish groups which are not topologically isomorphic to product groups and are pairwise not continuous homomorphic images of each other.</description>

Abstract: We say that a semigroup of matrices has a submultiplicative spectrum if the spectrum of the product of any two elements of the semigroup is contained in the product of the two spectra in question (as sets). In this note we explore an approximate version of this condition.</description>

Abstract: We provide a direct connection between the $\mathcal{Z}_{\max}$ (or essential) JSJ decomposition and the Friedl--Tillmann polytope of a hyperbolic two-generator one-relator group with abelianisation of rank $2$.
  We deduce various structural and algorithmic properties, like the existence of a quadratic-time algorithm computing the \ZC{}-JSJ decomposition of such groups.</description>

      <title>Algebraically hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.01331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of torsion-free algebraically hyperbolic groups; these groups generalise torsion-free hyperbolic groups and are intricately related to groups with no Baumslag--Solitar subgroups. Indeed, for groups of cohomological dimension $2$ we prove that algebraic hyperbolicity is equivalent to containing no Baumslag--Solitar subgroups. This links algebraically hyperbolic groups to two famous questions of Gromov; recent work has shown these questions to have negative answers in general, but they remain open for groups of cohomological dimension $2$.
  We also prove that algebraically hyperbolic groups are CSA, and so have canonical abelian JSJ-decompositions. In the two-generated case we give a precise description of the form of these decompositions.</description>

      <title>Isometric embeddings of surfaces for scl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\varphi:F_1\to F_2$ be an injective morphism of free groups. If $\varphi$ is geometric (i.e. induced by an inclusion of oriented compact connected surfaces with nonempty boundary), then we show that $\varphi$ is an isometric embedding for stable commutator length. More generally, we show that if $T$ is a subsurface of an oriented compact (possibly closed) connected surface $S$, and $c$ is an integral $1$-chain on $\pi_1T$, then there is an isometric embedding $H_2(T,c)\to H_2(S,c)$ for the relative Gromov seminorm. Those statements are proved by finding an appropriate standard form for admissible surfaces and showing that, under the right homology vanishing conditions, such an admissible surface in $S$ for a chain in $T$ is in fact an admissible surface in $T$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the integral filling volume of a Dehn twist $f$ on a closed oriented surface vanishes, i.e. that the integral simplicial volume of the mapping torus with monodromy $f^n$ grows sublinearly with respect to $n$. We deduce a complete characterization of mapping classes on surfaces with vanishing integral filling volume and, building on results by Purcell and Lackenby on the complexity of mapping tori, we show that, in dimension three, complexity and integral simplicial volume are not Lipschitz equivalent.</description>

      <title>McDuff and Prime von Neumann algebras arising from Thompson-Like Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the cloning system construction of Skipper and Zaremsky [SZ21], under sufficient conditions, gives rise to Thompson-Like groups which are stable; in particular, these are McDuff groups in the sense of Deprez and Vaes [DV18]. This answers a question of Bashwinger and Zaremsky posed in [BZ23] in the affirmative. In the opposite direction, we show that the group von Neumann algebra for the Higman-Thompson groups $T_d$ and $V_d$ are both prime II$_1$ factors. This follows from a new deformation/rigidity argument for a certain class of groups which admit a proper cocycle into a quasi-regular representation that is not necessarily weakly $\ell^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The special Galilean group, usually denoted SGal(3), is a 10-dimensional Lie group whose important subgroups include the special orthogonal group, the special Euclidean group, and the group of extended poses. We briefly describe SGal(3) and its Lie algebra and show how the group structure supports a unified representation of uncertainty in space and time. Our aim is to highlight the potential usefulness of this group for several robotics problems.</description>
