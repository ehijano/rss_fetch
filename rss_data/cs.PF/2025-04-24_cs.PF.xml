      <title>Closed-form analysis of Multi-RIS Reflected Signals in RIS-Aided Networks Using Stochastic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) enhance wireless communication by creating engineered signal reflection paths in addition to direct links. This work presents a stochastic geometry framework using point processes (PPs) to model multiple randomly deployed RISs conditioned on their associated base station (BS) locations. By characterizing aggregated reflections from multiple RISs using the Laplace transform, we analytically assess the performance impact of RIS-reflected signals by integrating this characterization into well-established stochastic geometry frameworks. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for the Laplace transform of the reflected signal power in several deployment scenarios. These analytical results facilitate performance evaluation of RIS-enabled enhancements. Numerical simulations validate that optimal RIS placement favors proximity to BSs or user equipment (UEs), and further quantify the impact of reflected interference, various fading assumptions, and diverse spatial deployment strategies. Importantly, our analytical approach shows superior computational efficiency compared to Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Low-Latency, Quantum-Ready RF Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown the promise of applying deep learning to enhance software processing of radio frequency (RF) signals. In parallel, hardware developments with quantum RF sensors based on Rydberg atoms are breaking longstanding barriers in frequency range, resolution, and sensitivity. In this paper, we describe our implementations of quantum-ready machine learning approaches for RF signal classification. Our primary objective is latency: while deep learning offers a more powerful computational paradigm, it also traditionally incurs latency overheads that hinder wider scale deployment. Our work spans three axes. (1) A novel continuous wavelet transform (CWT) based recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that enables flexible online classification of RF signals on-the-fly with reduced sampling time. (2) Low-latency inference techniques for both GPU and CPU that span over 100x reductions in inference time, enabling real-time operation with sub-millisecond inference. (3) Quantum-readiness validated through application of our models to physics-based simulation of Rydberg atom QRF sensors. Altogether, our work bridges towards next-generation RF sensors that use quantum technology to surpass previous physical limits, paired with latency-optimized AI/ML software that is suitable for real-time deployment.</description>
