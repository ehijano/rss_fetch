      <title>Auction Design using Value Prediction with Hallucinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a Bayesian mechanism design problem where a seller seeks to maximize revenue by selling an indivisible good to one of n buyers, incorporating potentially unreliable predictions (signals) of buyers' private values derived from a machine learning model. We propose a framework where these signals are sometimes reflective of buyers' true valuations but other times are hallucinations, which are uncorrelated with the buyers' true valuations. Our main contribution is a characterization of the optimal auction under this framework. Our characterization establishes a near-decomposition of how to treat types above and below the signal. For the one buyer case, the seller's optimal strategy is to post one of three fairly intuitive prices depending on the signal, which we call the "ignore", "follow" and "cap" actions.</description>

      <title>Stable Hypergraph Matching in Unimodular Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the NP-hard Stable Hypergraph Matching (SHM) problem and its generalization allowing capacities, the Stable Hypergraph $b$-Matching (SH$b$M) problem, and investigate their computational properties under various structural constraints. Our study is motivated by the fact that Scarf's Lemma (Scarf, 1967) together with a result of Lov\'asz (1972) guarantees the existence of a stable matching whenever the underlying hypergraph is normal. Furthermore, if the hypergraph is unimodular (i.e., its incidence matrix is totally unimodular), then even a stable $b$-matching is guaranteed to exist. However, no polynomial-time algorithm is known for finding a stable matching or $b$-matching in unimodular hypergraphs.
  We identify subclasses of unimodular hypergraphs where SHM and SH$b$M are tractable such as laminar hypergraphs or so-called subpath hypergraphs with bounded-size hyperedges; for the latter case, even a maximum-weight stable $b$-matching can be found efficiently. We complement our algorithms by showing that optimizing over stable matchings is NP-hard even in laminar hypergraphs. As a practically important special case of SH$b$M for unimodular hypergraphs, we investigate a tripartite stable matching problem with students, schools, and companies as agents, called the University Dual Admission problem, which models real-world scenarios in higher education admissions.
  Finally, we examine a superclass of subpath hypergraphs that are normal but necessarily not unimodular, namely subtree hypergraphs where hyperedges correspond to subtrees of a tree. We establish that for such hypergraphs, stable matchings can be found in polynomial time but, in the setting with capacities, finding a stable $b$-matching is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Learning in Strategic Queuing Systems with Small Buffers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Routers in networking use simple learning algorithms to find the best way to deliver packets to their desired destination. This simple, myopic and distributed decision system makes large queuing systems simple to operate, but at the same time, the system needs more capacity than would be required if all traffic were centrally coordinated. In a recent paper, Gaitonde and Tardos (EC 2020 and JACM 2023) initiate the study of such systems, modeling them as an infinitely repeated game in which routers compete for servers and the system maintains a state (number of packets held by each queue) resulting from outcomes of previous rounds. Queues get to send a packet at each step to one of the servers, and servers attempt to process only one of the arriving packets, modeling routers. However, their model assumes that servers have no buffers at all, so queues have to resend all packets that were not served successfully. They show that, even with hugely increased server capacity relative to what is needed in the centrally-coordinated case, ensuring that the system is stable requires using timestamps and priority for older packets. We consider a system with two important changes, which make the model more realistic: first we add a very small buffer to each server, allowing it to hold on to a single packet to be served later (even if it fails to serve it); and second, we do not require timestamps or priority for older packets. Our main result is to show that when queues are learning, a small constant factor increase in server capacity, compared to what would be needed if centrally coordinating, suffices to keep the system stable, even if servers select randomly among packets arriving simultaneously. This work contributes to the growing literature on the impact of selfish learning in systems with carryover effects between rounds: when outcomes in the present round affect the game in the future.</description>

      <title>Prophet Inequalities for Bandits, Cabinets, and DAGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A decisionmaker faces $n$ alternatives, each of which represents a potential reward. After investing costly resources into investigating the alternatives, the decisionmaker may select one, or more generally a feasible subset, and obtain the associated reward(s). The objective is to maximize the sum of rewards minus total costs invested. We consider this problem under a general model of an alternative as a "Markov Search Process," a type of undiscounted Markov Decision Process on a finite acyclic graph. Even simple cases generalize NP-hard problems such as Pandora's Box with nonobligatory inspection.
  Despite the apparently adaptive and interactive nature of the problem, we prove optimal prophet inequalities for this problem under a variety of combinatorial constraints. That is, we give approximation algorithms that interact with the alternatives sequentially, where each must be fully explored and either selected or else discarded before the next arrives. In particular, we obtain a computationally efficient $\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon$ prophet inequality for Combinatorial Markov Search subject to any matroid constraint. This result implies incentive-compatible mechanisms with constant Price of Anarchy for serving single-parameter agents when the agents strategically conduct independent, costly search processes to discover their values.</description>

      <title>Whoever Said Money Won't Solve All Your Problems? Weighted Envy-free Allocation with Subsidy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore solutions for fairly allocating indivisible items among agents assigned weights representing their entitlements. Our fairness goal is weighted-envy-freeness (WEF), where each agent deems their allocated portion relative to their entitlement at least as favorable as any others relative to their own. Often, achieving WEF necessitates monetary transfers, which can be modeled as third-party subsidies. The goal is to attain WEF with bounded subsidies.
  Previous work relied on characterizations of unweighted envy-freeness (EF), that fail in the weighted setting. This makes our new setting challenging. We present polynomial-time algorithms that compute WEF allocations with a guaranteed upper bound on total subsidy for monotone valuations and various subclasses thereof.
  We also present an efficient algorithm to compute a fair allocation of items and money, when the budget is not enough to make the allocation WEF. This algorithm is new even for the unweighted setting.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Distributed Nash Equilibrium Seeking over Time-Varying Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new differentially private distributed Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm for aggregative games under time-varying unbalanced directed communication graphs. Random independent Laplace noises are injected into the transmitted information to protect players' sensitive information. Then, the push-sum consensus protocol is utilized to estimate the aggregate function with the perturbed information under the time-varying topologies. The weakening factor and the momentum term are designed to attenuate the negative affect of the noise and guarantee the convergence of the algorithm, respectively. The algorithm is then proven to ensure the almost sure convergence, as well as rigorous differential privacy with a finite cumulative privacy budget, without requiring a trade-off between provable convergence and differential privacy. Finally, the simulation is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Properties of Path-Independent Choice Correspondences and Their Applications to Efficient and Stable Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Choice correspondences are crucial in decision-making, especially when faced with indifferences or ties. While tie-breaking can transform a choice correspondence into a choice function, it often introduces inefficiencies. This paper introduces a novel notion of path-independence (PI) for choice correspondences, extending the existing concept of PI for choice functions. Intuitively, a choice correspondence is PI if any consistent tie-breaking produces a PI choice function. This new notion yields several important properties. First, PI choice correspondences are rationalizabile, meaning they can be represented as the maximization of a utility function. This extends a core feature of PI in choice functions. Second, we demonstrate that the set of choices selected by a PI choice correspondence for any subset forms a generalized matroid. This property reveals that PI choice correspondences exhibit a nice structural property. Third, we establish that choice correspondences rationalized by ordinally concave functions inherently satisfy the PI condition. This aligns with recent findings that a choice function satisfies PI if and only if it can be rationalized by an ordinally concave function. Building on these theoretical foundations, we explore stable and efficient matchings under PI choice correspondences. Specifically, we investigate constrained efficient matchings, which are efficient (for one side of the market) within the set of stable matchings. Under responsive choice correspondences, such matchings are characterized by cycles. However, this cycle-based characterization fails in more general settings. We demonstrate that when the choice correspondence of each school satisfies both PI and monotonicity conditions, a similar cycle-based characterization is restored. These findings provide new insights into the matching theory and its practical applications.</description>

      <title>Fair Division via Resource Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and formalize the notion of resource augmentation for maximin share allocations -- an idea that can be traced back to the seminal work of Budish [JPE 2011].
  Specifically, given a fair division instance with $m$ goods and $n$ agents, we ask how many copies of the goods should be added in order to guarantee
  that each agent receives at least their original maximin share, or an approximation thereof.
  We establish a tight bound of $m/e$ copies for arbitrary monotone valuations.
  For additive valuations, we show that at most $\min\{n-2,\lfloor \frac{m}{3}\rfloor (1+o(1))\}$
  copies suffice. For approximate-MMS in ordered instances, we give a tradeoff between the number of copies needed and the approximation guarantee. In particular, we prove that $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ copies suffice to guarantee a $6/7$-approximation to the original MMS, and $\lfloor n/3 \rfloor$ copies suffice for a $4/5$-approximation. Both results improve upon the best known approximation guarantees for additive valuations in the absence of copies.</description>

      <title>Single-Agent Planning in a Multi-Agent System: A Unified Framework for Type-Based Planners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a general problem where an agent is in a multi-agent environment and must plan for herself without any prior information about her opponents. At each moment, this pivotal agent is faced with a trade-off between exploiting her currently accumulated information about the other agents and exploring further to improve future (re-)planning. We propose a theoretic framework that unifies a spectrum of planners for the pivotal agent to address this trade-off. The planner at one end of this spectrum aims to find exact solutions, while those towards the other end yield approximate solutions as the problem scales up. Beyond theoretical analysis, we also implement \textbf{13} planners and conduct experiments in a specific domain called \textit{multi-agent route planning} with the number of agents \textbf{up to~50}, to compare their performaces in various scenarios. One interesting observation comes from a class of planners that we call \textit{safe-agents} and their enhanced variants by incorporating domain-specific knowledge, which is a simple special case under the proposed general framework, but performs sufficiently well in most cases. Our unified framework, as well as those induced planners, provides new insights on multi-agent decision-making, with potential applications to related areas such as mechanism design.</description>

      <title>Game Theory Meets Large Language Models: A Systematic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Game theory establishes a fundamental framework for analyzing strategic interactions among rational decision-makers. The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has sparked extensive research exploring the intersection of these two fields. Specifically, game-theoretic methods are being applied to evaluate and enhance LLM capabilities, while LLMs themselves are reshaping classic game models. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the intersection of these fields, exploring a bidirectional relationship from three perspectives: (1) Establishing standardized game-based benchmarks for evaluating LLM behavior; (2) Leveraging game-theoretic methods to improve LLM performance through algorithmic innovations; (3) Characterizing the societal impacts of LLMs through game modeling. Among these three aspects, we also highlight how the equilibrium analysis for traditional game models is impacted by LLMs' advanced language understanding, which in turn extends the study of game theory. Finally, we identify key challenges and future research directions, assessing their feasibility based on the current state of the field. By bridging theoretical rigor with emerging AI capabilities, this survey aims to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and drive progress in this evolving research area.</description>

      <title>Full Swap Regret and Discretized Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing swap regret in structured normal-form games. Players have a very large (potentially infinite) number of pure actions, but each action has an embedding into $d$-dimensional space and payoffs are given by bilinear functions of these embeddings. We provide an efficient learning algorithm for this setting that incurs at most $\tilde{O}(T^{(d+1)/(d+3)})$ swap regret after $T$ rounds.
  To achieve this, we introduce a new online learning problem we call \emph{full swap regret minimization}. In this problem, a learner repeatedly takes a (randomized) action in a bounded convex $d$-dimensional action set $\mathcal{K}$ and then receives a loss from the adversary, with the goal of minimizing their regret with respect to the \emph{worst-case} swap function mapping $\mathcal{K}$ to $\mathcal{K}$. For varied assumptions about the convexity and smoothness of the loss functions, we design algorithms with full swap regret bounds ranging from $O(T^{d/(d+2)})$ to $O(T^{(d+1)/(d+2)})$.
  Finally, we apply these tools to the problem of online forecasting to minimize calibration error, showing that several notions of calibration can be viewed as specific instances of full swap regret. In particular, we design efficient algorithms for online forecasting that guarantee at most $O(T^{1/3})$ $\ell_2$-calibration error and $O(\max(\sqrt{\epsilon T}, T^{1/3}))$ \emph{discretized-calibration} error (when the forecaster is restricted to predicting multiples of $\epsilon$).</description>

      <title>Drivers of cooperation in social dilemmas on higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding cooperation in social dilemmas requires models that capture the complexity of real-world interactions. While network frameworks have provided valuable insights to model the evolution of cooperation, they are unable to encode group interactions properly. Here, we introduce a general higher-order network framework for multi-player games on structured populations. Our model considers multi-dimensional strategies, based on the observation that social behaviours are affected by the size of the group interaction. We investigate dynamical and structural coupling between different orders of interactions, revealing the crucial role of nested multilevel interactions, and showing how such features can enhance cooperation beyond the limit of traditional models with uni-dimensional strategies. Our work identifies the key drivers promoting cooperative behaviour commonly observed in real-world group social dilemmas.</description>

      <title>Statistical Equilibrium of Optimistic Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Statistical Equilibrium of Optimistic Beliefs (SE-OB) for the mixed extension of finite normal-form games, drawing insights from discrete choice theory. Departing from the conventional best responders of Nash equilibrium and the better responders of quantal response equilibrium, we reconceptualize player behavior as that of optimistic better responders. In this setting, the players assume that their expected payoffs are subject to random perturbations, and form optimistic beliefs by selecting the distribution of perturbations that maximizes their highest anticipated payoffs among belief sets. In doing so, SE-OB subsumes and extends the existing equilibria concepts. The player's view of the existence of perturbations in their payoffs reflects an inherent risk sensitivity, and thus, each player is equipped with a risk-preference function for every action. We demonstrate that every Nash equilibrium of a game, where expected payoffs are regularized with the risk-preference functions of the players, corresponds to an SE-OB in the original game, provided that the belief sets coincide with the feasible set of a multi-marginal optimal transport problem with marginals determined by risk-preference functions. Building on this connection, we propose an algorithm for repeated games among risk-sensitive players under optimistic beliefs when only zeroth-order feedback is available. We prove that, under appropriate conditions, the algorithm converges to an SE-OB. Our convergence analysis offers key insights into the strategic behaviors for equilibrium attainment: a player's risk sensitivity enhances equilibrium stability, while forming optimistic beliefs in the face of ambiguity helps to mitigate overly aggressive strategies over time. As a byproduct, our approach delivers the first generic convergent algorithm for general-form structural QRE beyond the classical logit-QRE.</description>

      <title>The Power of Static Pricing for Reusable Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of pricing a reusable resource service system. Potential customers arrive according to a Poisson process and purchase the service if their valuation exceeds the current price. If no units are available, customers immediately leave without service. Serving a customer corresponds to using one unit of the reusable resource, where the service time has a general distribution. The objective is to maximize the steady-state revenue rate. This system is equivalent to the classical Erlang loss model with price-sensitive customers, which has applications in vehicle sharing, cloud computing, and spare parts management.
  With general service times, the optimal pricing policy depends not only on the number of customers currently in the system but also on how long each unavailable unit has been in use. We prove several results that show a simple static policy is universally near-optimal for any service rate distribution, arrival rate, and number of units in the system. When there are multiple classes of customers, we prove that static pricing guarantees 78.9% of the revenue of the optimal dynamic policy, achieving the same guarantee known for a single class of customers with exponential service times. When there is one class of customers who have a monotone hazard rate valuation distribution, we prove that a static pricing policy guarantees 90.4% of the revenue from the optimal inventory-based policy. Finally, we prove that the optimal static policy can be easily computed, resulting in the first polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the multi-class problem.</description>

      <title>Efficient $\Phi$-Regret Minimization with Low-Degree Swap Deviations in Extensive-Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent breakthrough results by Dagan, Daskalakis, Fishelson and Golowich [2023] and Peng and Rubinstein [2023] established an efficient algorithm attaining at most $\epsilon$ swap regret over extensive-form strategy spaces of dimension $N$ in $N^{\tilde O(1/\epsilon)}$ rounds. On the other extreme, Farina and Pipis [2023] developed an efficient algorithm for minimizing the weaker notion of linear-swap regret in $\mathsf{poly}(N)/\epsilon^2$ rounds. In this paper, we develop efficient parameterized algorithms for regimes between these two extremes. We introduce the set of $k$-mediator deviations, which generalize the untimed communication deviations recently introduced by Zhang, Farina and Sandholm [2024] to the case of having multiple mediators, and we develop algorithms for minimizing the regret with respect to this set of deviations in $N^{O(k)}/\epsilon^2$ rounds. Moreover, by relating $k$-mediator deviations to low-degree polynomials, we show that regret minimization against degree-$k$ polynomial swap deviations is achievable in $N^{O(kd)^3}/\epsilon^2$ rounds, where $d$ is the depth of the game, assuming a constant branching factor. For a fixed degree $k$, this is polynomial for Bayesian games and quasipolynomial more broadly when $d = \mathsf{polylog} N$ -- the usual balancedness assumption on the game tree.</description>

      <title>Metric distortion Under Probabilistic Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14223v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metric distortion in social choice is a framework for evaluating how well voting rules minimize social cost when both voters and candidates exist in a shared metric space, with a voter's cost defined by their distance to a candidate. Voters submit rankings, and the rule aggregates these rankings to determine a winner. We extend this framework to incorporate probabilistic voting, recognizing that real-world voters exhibit randomness in how they vote. Our extension includes various probability functions, notably the widely studied Plackett-Luce (PL) model.
  We show that the distortion results under probabilistic voting better correspond with conventional intuitions regarding popular voting rules such as \textsc{Plurality}, \textsc{Copeland}, \textsc{Random Dictator} and \textsc{Borda} than those under deterministic voting. For example, in the PL model with candidate strength inversely proportional to the square of their metric distance from a voter, we show that \textsc{Copeland}'s distortion is at most 2, whereas that of \textsc{RandomDictator} is $\Omega(\sqrt{m})$ in large elections (i.e., number of voters $n \rightarrow \infty$), where $m$ is the number of candidates. This contrasts sharply with the classical model, where \textsc{RandomDictator} beats \textsc{Copeland} with a distortion of 3 versus 5. In the PL model where the candidate strength is inversely proportional to the distance raised to power $\theta$, the distortion under \textsc{Borda} is $\Theta(m^{1-2/\theta})$ when $\theta&gt;2$ and $\Theta(1)$ otherwise. This generalizes the classical deterministic voting model where the distortion of \textsc{Borda} is $2m-1$. The proof uses a novel variant of asymptotic duality where we choose the Lagrange multiplier via asymptotically maximizing the derivative of the objective function. Overall, our work opens a new frontier for analyzing voting rules.</description>

      <title>Revenue vs. Welfare: A Comprehensive Analysis of Strategic Trade-offs in Online Food Delivery Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the trade-off between short-term revenue generation and long-term social welfare optimization in online food delivery platforms. We first develop a static model that captures the equilibrium interactions among restaurants, consumers, and delivery workers, using Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) as a proxy for immediate performance. Building on this, we extend our analysis to a dynamic model that integrates evolving state variables,such as platform reputation and participant retention-to capture long-term behavior. By applying dynamic programming techniques, we derive optimal strategies that balance GMV maximization with social welfare enhancement. Extensive multi-agent simulations validate our theoretical predictions, demonstrating that while a GMV-focused approach yields strong initial gains, it ultimately undermines long-term stability. In contrast, a social welfare-oriented strategy produces more sustainable and robust outcomes. Our findings provide actionable insights for platform operators and policymakers seeking to harmonize rapid growth with long-term</description>

      <title>Approximation guarantees of Median Mechanism in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coordinate-wise median is a classic and most well-studied strategy-proof mechanism in social choice and facility location scenarios. Surprisingly, there is no systematic study of its approximation ratio in $d$-dimensional spaces. The best known approximation guarantee in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{L}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is $\sqrt{d}$ via embedding $\mathbb{L}_1(\mathbb{R}^d)$ into $\mathbb{L}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ metric space, that only appeared in appendix of [Meir 2019].This upper bound is known to be tight in dimension $d=2$, but there are no known super constant lower bounds. Still, it seems that the community's belief about coordinate-wise median is on the side of $\Theta(\sqrt{d})$. E.g., a few recent papers on mechanism design with predictions [Agrawal, Balkanski, Gkatzelis, Ou, Tan 2022], [Christodoulou, Sgouritsa, Vlachos 2024], and [Barak, Gupta, Talgam-Cohen 2024] directly rely on the $\sqrt{d}$-approximation result.
  In this paper, we systematically study approximate efficiency of the coordinate-median in $\mathbb{L}_{q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ spaces for any $\mathbb{L}_q$ norm with $q\in[1,\infty]$ and any dimension $d$. We derive a series of constant upper bounds $UB(q)$ independent of the dimension $d$. This series $UB(q)$ is growing with parameter $q$, but never exceeds the constant $UB(\infty)= 3$. Our bound $UB(2)=\sqrt{6\sqrt{3}-8}&lt;1.55$ for $\mathbb{L}_2$ norm is only slightly worse than the tight approximation guarantee of $\sqrt{2}&gt;1.41$ in dimension $d=2$. Furthermore, we show that our upper bounds are essentially tight by giving almost matching lower bounds $LB(q,d)=UB(q)\cdot(1-O(1/d))$ for any dimension $d$ with $LB(q,d)=UB(q)$ when $d\to\infty$. We also extend our analysis to the generalized median mechanism in [Agrawal, Balkanski, Gkatzelis, Ou, Tan 2022] for $\mathbb{L}_2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ space to arbitrary dimensions $d$ with similar results.</description>

      <title>Improved Algorithms for Contextual Dynamic Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contextual dynamic pricing, a seller sequentially prices goods based on contextual information. Buyers will purchase products only if the prices are below their valuations. The goal of the seller is to design a pricing strategy that collects as much revenue as possible. We focus on two different valuation models. The first assumes that valuations linearly depend on the context and are further distorted by noise. Under minor regularity assumptions, our algorithm achieves an optimal regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$, improving the existing results. The second model removes the linearity assumption, requiring only that the expected buyer valuation is $\beta$-H\"older in the context. For this model, our algorithm obtains a regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{d+2\beta/d+3\beta})$, where $d$ is the dimension of the context space.</description>

      <title>Each of those eight coalition logics is also determined by six other kinds of models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coalition Logic is a central logic in logical research on strategic reasoning. In two recent papers, Li and Ju argued that generally, concurrent game models, models of Coalition Logic, have three too strong assumptions: seriality, independence of agents, and determinism. They presented eight coalition logics based on eight classes of general concurrent game models, determined by which of the three assumptions are met. In this paper, we show that each of the eight logics is also determined by six other kinds of models, with respective properties, that is, single-coalition-first action models, single-coalition-first neighborhood models, clear grand-coalition-first action models, clear single-coalition-first neighborhood models, tree-like grand-coalition-first action models, and tree-like single-coalition-first neighborhood models.</description>
