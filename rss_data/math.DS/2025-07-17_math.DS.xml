      <title>Reduced Order Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Using Slow Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model order reduction in high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamical systems if often enabled through fast-slow timescale separation. One such approach involves identifying a low-dimensional slow manifold to which the state rapidly converges and subsequently studying the behavior on the slow manifold. Leveraging the isostable coordinate framework, which considers the slowest decaying principle Koopman eigenmodes of a stable attractor, this work investigates the relationships between stable and unstable fixed points and periodic orbits and associated slow manifolds embedded in state space. It is found that under appropriate technical conditions, a slow manifold is formed by the intersection of the unstable manifold of an unstable fixed point (resp.,~periodic orbit) and the stable manifold of a stable periodic orbit (resp.,~fixed point). This insight allows for the straightforward computation of slow manifolds that enable model order reduction. Detailed examples are provided for two different highly nonlinear dynamical systems, the first being a coupled system of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons and the second being a biophysically detailed model of circadian oscillations. The resulting reduced order models are illustrated in the consideration of two different biologically motivated control objectives.</description>

      <title>Interacting Hosts with Microbiome Exchange: An Extension of Metacommunity Theory for Discrete Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microbiomes, which are collections of interacting microbes in an environment, often substantially impact the environmental patches or living hosts that they occupy. In microbiome models, it is important to consider both the local dynamics within an environment and exchanges of microbiomes between environments. One way to incorporate these and other interactions across multiple scales is to employ metacommunity theory. Metacommunity models commonly assume continuous microbiome dispersal between the environments in which local microbiome dynamics occur. Under this assumption, a single parameter between each pair of environments controls the dispersal rate between those environments. This metacommunity framework is well-suited to abiotic environmental patches, but it fails to capture an essential aspect of the microbiomes of living hosts, which generally do not interact continuously with each other. Instead, living hosts interact with each other in discrete time intervals. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework that encodes such discrete interactions and uses two parameters to separately control the interaction frequencies between hosts and the amount of microbiome exchange during each interaction. We derive analytical approximations of models in our framework in three parameter regimes and prove that they are accurate in those regimes. We compare these approximations to numerical simulations for an illustrative model. We demonstrate that both parameters in our modeling framework are necessary to determine microbiome dynamics. Key features of the dynamics, such as microbiome convergence across hosts, depend sensitively on the interplay between interaction frequency and strength.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Borel liftings in complex analysis and PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish Borel equivariant analogues of several classical theorems from complex analysis and PDE. The starting point is an equivariant Weierstrass theorem for entire functions: there exists a Borel mapping which assigns to each non-periodic positive divisor $d$ an entire function $f_d$ with divisor of zeros $\mathrm{div}(f_d)=d$ and which commutes with translation, $f_{d-w}(z)=f_d(z+w)$. We also examine the existence of equivariant Borel right inverses for the distributional Laplacian, the heat operator, and the $\bar{\partial}$-operator on the space of smooth functions. We demonstrate that Borel equivariant inverses for these maps exist on the free part of the range (for the heat operator, this holds up to the removal of a null set with respect to any invariant probability measure). In general, the freeness assumptions cannot be omitted and Borelness cannot be strengthened to continuity. Our positive results follow from a theorem establishing sufficient conditions for the existence of equivariant Borel liftings. Two key ingredients are Runge-type approximation theorems and the existence of Borel toasts, which are Borel analogues of Rokhlin towers from ergodic theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we briefly discuss how singular KAM Theory - which was worked out in a previous work by L.B. and L.C. for the mechanical case $\frac12 |y|^2+\varepsilon f(x)$ - can be extended to convex real analytic nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems with Hamiltonian in action-angle variables given by $h(y)+\varepsilon f(x)$ with $h$ convex and generic $f$.</description>

      <title>Orbit sets, transitivity, and sensitivity with upper semicontinuous maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact metric space $X$ and an upper semicontinuous function $F\colon X \to 2^X$, we explore the dynamic system $(X,F)$. In this study, we introduce new concepts, demonstrate various results, and provide numerous examples. In particular, we define the orbit set $\mathcal{O}_F(p)$ and prove that it is compact. We also establish conditions for connectedness of the orbit sets and pose several questions related to the system.
  We also investigate transitivity and its relation to the density of orbits. In addition, we present strong and weak notions of sensitivity and examine the relationships between these concepts.</description>

      <title>Branches of localized patterned states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by theoretical analyses of spatially localized structures with arbitrarily long periodic plateaus, we provide a framework of assumptions that simplifies their analysis and leads to a topological criterion for when localized patterned structures lie on a discrete stack of loops or on a single unbounded branch. The framework proposed here also connects closely with continuation algorithms that are often used to verify the hypotheses that guarantee the emergence of localized patterned states.</description>

      <title>A Perturbative Multiplicity Theorem for the Borsuk-Ulam Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a generalization of the classical Borsuk--Ulam Theorem under small perturbations (shaking) of the sphere. We show that for a generic perturbation of a continuous map $f : S^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$, the number of points $x \in S^2$ such that $f_\epsilon(x) = f_\epsilon(-x)$ becomes finite and odd, and may exceed the classical lower bound of one antipodal coincidence. In particular, we show the existence of maps with 3, 5, or 7 such points, and explain the unbounded nature of this multiplicity under higher complexity of the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics with Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) is a method for discovering nonlinear dynamical system models from data. Quantifying uncertainty in SINDy models is essential for assessing their reliability, particularly in safety-critical applications. While various uncertainty quantification methods exist for SINDy, including Bayesian and ensemble approaches, this work explores the integration of Conformal Prediction, a framework that can provide valid prediction intervals with coverage guarantees based on minimal assumptions like data exchangeability. We introduce three applications of conformal prediction with Ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy): (1) quantifying uncertainty in time series prediction, (2) model selection based on library feature importance, and (3) quantifying the uncertainty of identified model coefficients using feature conformal prediction. We demonstrate the three applications on stochastic predator-prey dynamics and several chaotic dynamical systems. We show that conformal prediction methods integrated with E-SINDy can reliably achieve desired target coverage for time series forecasting, effectively quantify feature importance, and produce more robust uncertainty intervals for model coefficients, even under non-Gaussian noise, compared to standard E-SINDy coefficient estimates.</description>

Abstract: Using a generalization of the Kechris-Pestov-Todor\v{c}evi\'{c} correspondence due to Nguyen Van Th\'{e} we obtain fixed point theorems for null and tame actions of groups of the form $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal F)$, where $\mathcal{F}$ is a Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} structure. In particular we show that if $\mathrm{Age}(\mathcal F)$ is a free joint embedding class, then every null flow $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal F)\curvearrowright X$ has a fixed point, while if $\mathrm{Age}(\mathcal F)$ is a free amalgamation class, then every tame flow $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal F)\curvearrowright X$ has a fixed point.</description>

      <title>Global Synchronization in Matrix-Weighted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization phenomena in complex systems are fundamental to understanding collective behavior across disciplines. While classical approaches model such systems by using scalar-weighted networks and simple diffusive couplings, many real-world interactions are inherently multidimensional and transformative. To address this limitation, Matrix-Weighted Networks (MWNs) have been introduced as a versatile framework where edges are associated with matrix weights that encode both interaction strength and directional transformation. In this work, we investigate the emergence and stability of global synchronization in MWNs by studying coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators-an archetypal model of nonlinear dynamics near a Hopf bifurcation. We derive a generalized Master Stability Function (MSF) tailored to MWNs and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for synchronization to occur. Central to our analysis is the concept of coherence, a structural property of MWNs ensuring path-independent transformations. Our results show that coherence is necessary to achieve global synchronization and provides a theoretical foundation for analyzing multidimensional dynamical processes in complex networked systems.</description>

Abstract: We establish an abstract, effective, exponential large deviations type estimate for Markov systems satisfying a weaker form of mixing. We employ this result to derive such estimates, as well as a central limit theorem, for the skew product encoding a random torus translation, a model we call a mixed random-quasiperiodic dynamical system. This abstract scheme is applicable to many other types of skew product dynamics, including systems for which the spectral gap property for the transition or the transfer operator does not hold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by partition regularity problems of homogeneous quadratic equations, we prove multiple recurrence and convergence results for multiplicative measure preserving actions with iterates given by rational sequences involving polynomials that factor into products of linear forms in two variables. We focus mainly on actions that are finitely generated, and the key tool in our analysis is a decomposition result for any bounded measurable function into a sum of two components, one that mimics concentration properties of pretentious multiplicative functions and another that mimics vanishing properties of aperiodic multiplicative functions. Crucial to part of our arguments are some new seminorms that are defined by a mixture of addition and multiplication of the iterates of the action, and we prove an inverse theorem that explicitly characterizes the factor of the system on which these seminorms vanish.</description>

      <title>Continuum limit of the Kuramoto model with random natural frequencies on uniform graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Kuramoto model (KM) having random natural frequencies and defined on uniform graphs that may be complete, random dense or random sparse. The natural frequencies are assumed to be independent and identically distributed on a bounded interval. In the previous work, the corresponding continuum limit (CL) was proven to approximate stable motions in the KM well when the natural frequencies are deterministic, even if the graph is not uniform, although it may not do so for unstable motions and bifurcations. We show that the method of CLs is still valid even when the natural frequencies are random, especially uniformly distributed. In particular, an asymptotically stable family of solutions to the CL is proven to behave in the $L^2$ sense as if it is an asymptotically stable one in the KM, under an appropriate uniform random permutation. We demonstrate the theoretical results by numerical simulations for the KM with uniformly distributed random natural frequencies.</description>

      <title>Periodic localized traveling waves in the two-dimensional suspension bridge equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the dynamics generated by the suspension bridge equation, traveling waves are an essential feature. The existing literature focuses primarily on the idealized one-dimensional case, while traveling structures in two spatial dimensions have only been studied via numerical simulations. We use computer-assisted proof methods based on a Newton-Kantorovich type argument to find and prove periodic localized traveling waves in two dimensions. The main obstacle is the exponential nonlinearity in combination with the resulting large amplitude of the localized waves. Our analysis hinges on establishing computable bounds to control the aliasing error in the computed Fourier coefficients. This leads to existence proofs of different traveling wave solutions, accompanied by small, explicit, rigorous bounds on the deficiency of numerical approximations. This approach is directly extendable to other wave equation models and elliptic partial differential equations with analytic nonlinearities, in two as well as in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Neural field equations with time-periodic external inputs and some applications to visual processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to present a mathematical framework for the study of flickering inputs in visual processing tasks. When combined with geometric patterns, these inputs influence and induce interesting psychophysical phenomena, such as the MacKay and the Billock-Tsou effects, where the subjects perceive specific afterimages typically modulated by the flickering frequency. Due to the symmetry-breaking structure of the inputs, classical bifurcation theory and multi-scale analysis techniques are not very effective in our context. We thus take an approach based on the input-output framework of control theory for Amari-type neural fields. This allows us to prove that, when driven by periodic inputs, the dynamics converge to a periodic state. Moreover, we study under which assumptions these nonlinear dynamics can be effectively linearised, and in this case we present a precise approximation of the integral kernel for short-range excitatory and long-range inhibitory neuronal interactions. Finally, for inputs concentrated at the center of the visual field with a flickering background, we directly relate the width of the illusory contours appearing in the afterimage with both the flickering frequency and the strength of the inhibition.</description>
