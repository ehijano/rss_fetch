      <title>Nonlinear Impulse Pattern Formulation dynamical social and political prediction algorithm for city planning and public participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonlinear-dynamical algorithm for city planning is proposed as an Impulse Pattern Formulation (IPF) for predicting relevant parameters like health, artistic freedom, or financial developments of different social or political stakeholders over the cause of a planning process. The IPF has already shown high predictive precision at low computational cost in musical instrument simulations, brain dynamics, and human-human interactions. The social and political IPF consists of three basic equations of system state developments, self-adaptation of stakeholders, two adaptive interactions, and external impact terms suitable for respective planning situations. Typical scenarios of stakeholder interactions and developments are modeled by adjusting a set of system parameters. These include stakeholder reaction to external input, enhanced system stability through self-adaptation, stakeholder convergence due to mediative interaction adaptation, as well as complex dynamics in terms of direct stakeholder impacts. A workflow for implementing the algorithm in real city planning scenarios is outlined. This workflow includes machine learning of a suitable set of parameters suggesting best-practice planning to aim at the desired development of the planning process and its output.</description>

      <title>Stability of equilibria of the spatially inhomogeneous Vicsek-BGK equation across a bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vicsek-BGK equation is a kinetic model for alignment of particles moving with constant speed between stochastic reorientation events with sampling from a von Mises distribution. The spatially homogeneous model shows a steady state bifurcation with exchange of stability. The main result of this work is an extension of the bifurcation result to the spatially inhomogeneous problem under the additional assumption of a sufficiently large Knudsen number, which is shown to be necessary. A counterexample is derived in the form of an exponentially increasing travelling wave solution of the linearized equation, indicating a possible explanation of traveling bands, which have been observed in the literature in simulations with an individual based model. The mathematical core is the proof of linearized stability, which employs a new hypocoercivity approach based on Laplace-Fourier transformation. The bifurcation result includes global existence of smooth solutions for close-to-equilibrium initial data. For large data smooth solutions might blow up in finite time whereas weak solutions with bounded Boltzmann entropy are shown to exist globally.</description>

      <title>Imitation dynamics and the replicator equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary game theory has impacted many fields of research by providing a mathematical framework for studying the evolution and maintenance of social and moral behaviors. This success is owed in large part to the demonstration that the central equation of this theory - the replicator equation - is the deterministic limit of a stochastic imitation (social learning) dynamics. Here we offer an alternative elementary proof of this result, which holds for the scenario where players compare their instantaneous (not average) payoffs to decide whether to maintain or change their strategies, and only more successful individuals can be imitated.</description>

      <title>Positioning is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One can drive around safely using a GPS without memorizing a world map (not to mention the dark regions that humans have never explored) because we only pay attention to the next instruction of turning. Such simple observation with attention mechanism has a profound implication on our understanding of how the brain works. The nonlinear effects generated by inhibitory networks have long been known to provide a ``winner-take-all'' mechanism for localized attention. This attention mechanism, at the system level, implements the selection/positioning operation needed by the hippocampus to provide spatio-temporal context to the neocortex. The localized receptive field of sensory organs, when inspected under the framework of embodied cognition, turns from a constraint to an advantage. Since we only need access to a local map, positioning works better than reconstruction. Such simple intuition implies that the attention mechanism is all you need to understand the flexible behavior generated by hippocampal-neocortical systems. Geometrically, we present a novel manifold positioning framework to explain the principle of localized embodied cognition. Through the co-evolution of the hippocampus and the neocortex, the positioning operation implemented by the attention mechanism can be interpreted as a nonlinear projection linking the discovery of local subspace structure by the neocortex (a sensorimotor machine generating the world map) with the navigation task in mind and $without$ discovering global manifold topology by the hippocampus (the neocortex's map index).</description>

      <title>Self-Organization Towards $1/f$ Noise in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of $1/f$ noise, also known as pink noise, is a well-established phenomenon in biological neural networks, and is thought to play an important role in information processing in the brain. In this study, we find that such $1/f$ noise is also found in deep neural networks trained on natural language, resembling that of their biological counterparts. Specifically, we trained Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks on the `IMDb' AI benchmark dataset, then measured the neuron activations. The detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) on the time series of the different neurons demonstrate clear $1/f$ patterns, which is absent in the time series of the inputs to the LSTM. Interestingly, when the neural network is at overcapacity, having more than enough neurons to achieve the learning task, the activation patterns deviate from $1/f$ noise and shifts towards white noise. This is because many of the neurons are not effectively used, showing little fluctuations when fed with input data. We further examine the exponent values in the $1/f$ noise in ``internal" and ``external" activations in the LSTM cell, finding some resemblance in the variations of the exponents in fMRI signals of the human brain. Our findings further supports the hypothesis that $1/f$ noise is a signature of optimal learning. With deep learning models approaching or surpassing humans in certain tasks, and being more ``experimentable'' than their biological counterparts, our study suggests that they are good candidates to understand the fundamental origins of $1/f$ noise.</description>
