      <title>Automatic Music Mixing using a Generative Model of Effect Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music mixing involves combining individual tracks into a cohesive mixture, a task characterized by subjectivity where multiple valid solutions exist for the same input. Existing automatic mixing systems treat this task as a deterministic regression problem, thus ignoring this multiplicity of solutions. Here we introduce MEGAMI (Multitrack Embedding Generative Auto MIxing), a generative framework that models the conditional distribution of professional mixes given unprocessed tracks. MEGAMI uses a track-agnostic effects processor conditioned on per-track generated embeddings, handles arbitrary unlabeled tracks through a permutation-equivariant architecture, and enables training on both dry and wet recordings via domain adaptation. Our objective evaluation using distributional metrics shows consistent improvements over existing methods, while listening tests indicate performances approaching human-level quality across diverse musical genres.</description>

      <title>Pruning as Regularization: Sensitivity-Aware One-Shot Pruning in ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We challenge the conventional view of neural network pruning as solely a compression technique, demonstrating that one-shot magnitude pruning serves as a powerful implicit regularizer for ASR. Using Whisper-small, we combine gradient- and Fisher-based sensitivity diagnostics with targeted, component-wise pruning. This reveals architectural asymmetries: decoder FFNs are pruning-fragile, whereas decoder self-attention and the last encoder layers contain redundancy that, when removed, improves generalization. Without fine-tuning, pruning 50% of decoder self-attention reduces WER by 2.38% absolute (20.44% relative) on LibriSpeech test-other; pruning the last four encoder layers at 50% instead yields a 1.72% absolute (14.8% relative) improvement. Gains persisted on Common Voice and TED-LIUM datasets. Beyond regularization benefits, our sensitivity-aware approach enables more aggressive one-shot compression. At 40% sparsity, where established global pruning approaches catastrophically fail, our method preserves near-baseline accuracy. This positions pruning as a first-class architectural design tool: knowing where to prune is as important as how much to prune.</description>

      <title>Quantizing Whisper-small: How design choices affect ASR performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large speech recognition models like Whisper-small achieve high accuracy but are difficult to deploy on edge devices due to their high computational demand. To this end, we present a unified, cross-library evaluation of post-training quantization (PTQ) on Whisper-small that disentangles the impact of quantization scheme, method, granularity, and bit-width. Our study is based on four libraries: PyTorch, Optimum-Quanto, HQQ, and bitsandbytes. Experiments on LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other show that dynamic int8 quantization with Quanto offers the best trade-off, reducing model size by 57% while improving on the baseline's word error rate. Static quantization performed worse, likely due to Whisper's Transformer architecture, while more aggressive formats (e.g., nf4, int3) achieved up to 71% compression at the cost of accuracy in noisy conditions. Overall, our results demonstrate that carefully chosen PTQ methods can substantially reduce model size and inference cost without retraining, enabling efficient deployment of Whisper-small on constrained hardware.</description>

      <title>Unifying Model and Layer Fusion for Speech Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech Foundation Models have gained significant attention recently. Prior works have shown that the fusion of representations from multiple layers of the same model or the fusion of multiple models can improve performance on downstream tasks. We unify these two fusion strategies by proposing an interface module that enables fusion across multiple upstream speech models while integrating information across their layers. We conduct extensive experiments on different self-supervised and supervised models across various speech tasks, including ASR and paralinguistic analysis, and demonstrate that our method outperforms prior fusion approaches. We further analyze its scalability concerning model size and count, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate upstream models. Our results show that the proposed interface provides an additional performance boost when given a suitable upstream model selection, making it a promising approach for utilizing Speech Foundation Models.</description>

      <title>Melodia: Training-Free Music Editing Guided by Attention Probing in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-music generation technology is progressing rapidly, creating new opportunities for musical composition and editing. However, existing music editing methods often fail to preserve the source music's temporal structure, including melody and rhythm, when altering particular attributes like instrument, genre, and mood. To address this challenge, this paper conducts an in-depth probing analysis on attention maps within AudioLDM 2, a diffusion-based model commonly used as the backbone for existing music editing methods. We reveal a key finding: cross-attention maps encompass details regarding distinct musical characteristics, and interventions on these maps frequently result in ineffective modifications. In contrast, self-attention maps are essential for preserving the temporal structure of the source music during its conversion into the target music. Building upon this understanding, we present Melodia, a training-free technique that selectively manipulates self-attention maps in particular layers during the denoising process and leverages an attention repository to store source music information, achieving accurate modification of musical characteristics while preserving the original structure without requiring textual descriptions of the source music. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to better evaluate music editing methods. Both objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior results in terms of textual adherence and structural integrity across various datasets. This research enhances comprehension of internal mechanisms within music generation models and provides improved control for music creation.</description>

      <title>HQ-SVC: Towards High-Quality Zero-Shot Singing Voice Conversion in Low-Resource Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot singing voice conversion (SVC) transforms a source singer's timbre to an unseen target speaker's voice while preserving melodic content without fine-tuning. Existing methods model speaker timbre and vocal content separately, losing essential acoustic information that degrades output quality while requiring significant computational resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose HQ-SVC, an efficient framework for high-quality zero-shot SVC. HQ-SVC first extracts jointly content and speaker features using a decoupled codec. It then enhances fidelity through pitch and volume modeling, preserving critical acoustic information typically lost in separate modeling approaches, and progressively refines outputs via differentiable signal processing and diffusion techniques. Evaluations confirm HQ-SVC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot SVC methods in conversion quality and efficiency. Beyond voice conversion, HQ-SVC achieves superior voice naturalness compared to specialized audio super-resolution methods while natively supporting voice super-resolution tasks.</description>

      <title>Say More with Less: Variable-Frame-Rate Speech Tokenization via Adaptive Clustering and Implicit Duration Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing speech tokenizers typically assign a fixed number of tokens per second, regardless of the varying information density or temporal fluctuations in the speech signal. This uniform token allocation mismatches the intrinsic structure of speech, where information is distributed unevenly over time. To address this, we propose VARSTok, a VAriable-frame-Rate Speech Tokenizer that adapts token allocation based on local feature similarity. VARSTok introduces two key innovations: (1) a temporal-aware density peak clustering algorithm that adaptively segments speech into variable-length units, and (2) a novel implicit duration coding scheme that embeds both content and temporal span into a single token index, eliminating the need for auxiliary duration predictors. Extensive experiments show that VARSTok significantly outperforms strong fixed-rate baselines. Notably, it achieves superior reconstruction naturalness while using up to 23% fewer tokens than a 40 Hz fixed-frame-rate baseline. VARSTok further yields lower word error rates and improved naturalness in zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that a fully dynamic, variable-frame-rate acoustic speech tokenizer can be seamlessly integrated into downstream speech language models.</description>

      <title>Quality Over Quantity? LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09205v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains a challenge. The Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA) framework addresses this by considering AV scene alignment beyond mere temporal synchronization, and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data curation. AVVA implements a scoring mechanism for selecting aligned training data segments. It integrates Whisper, a speech-based foundation model, for audio and DINOv2 for video analysis in a dual-encoder structure with contrastive learning on AV pairs. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model architecture and data curation approach. AVVA achieves a significant improvement in top-k accuracies for video-to-audio retrieval on all datasets compared to DenseAV, while using only 192 hrs of curated training data. Furthermore, an ablation study indicates that the data curation process effectively trades data quality for data quantity, yielding increases in top-k retrieval accuracies on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound, compared to training on the full spectrum of uncurated data.</description>

      <title>UniCUE: Unified Recognition and Generation Framework for Chinese Cued Speech Video-to-Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04134v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) enhances lipreading via hand coding, offering visual phonemic cues that support precise speech perception for the hearing-impaired. The task of CS Video-to-Speech generation (CSV2S) aims to convert CS videos into intelligible speech signals. Most existing research focuses on CS Recognition (CSR), which transcribes video content into text. Consequently, a common solution for CSV2S is to integrate CSR with a text-to-speech (TTS) system. However, this pipeline relies on text as an intermediate medium, which may lead to error propagation and temporal misalignment between speech and CS video dynamics. In contrast, directly generating audio speech from CS video (direct CSV2S) often suffers from the inherent multimodal complexity and the limited availability of CS data. To address these challenges, we propose UniCUE, the first unified framework for CSV2S that directly generates speech from CS videos without relying on intermediate text. The core innovation of UniCUE lies in integrating an understanding task (CSR) that provides fine-grained CS visual-semantic cues to guide speech generation. Specifically, UniCUE incorporates a pose-aware visual processor, a semantic alignment pool that enables precise visual-semantic mapping, and a VisioPhonetic adapter to bridge the understanding and generation tasks within a unified architecture. To support this framework, we construct UniCUE-HI, a large-scale Mandarin CS dataset containing 11282 videos from 14 cuers, including both hearing-impaired and normal-hearing individuals. Extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate that UniCUE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics.</description>
