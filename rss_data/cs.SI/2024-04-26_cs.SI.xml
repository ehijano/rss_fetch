      <title>Semantic Evolvement Enhanced Graph Autoencoder for Rumor Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the rapid spread of rumors on social media, rumor detection has become an extremely important challenge. Recently, numerous rumor detection models which utilize textual information and the propagation structure of events have been proposed. However, these methods overlook the importance of semantic evolvement information of event in propagation process, which is often challenging to be truly learned in supervised training paradigms and traditional rumor detection methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel semantic evolvement enhanced Graph Autoencoder for Rumor Detection (GARD) model in this paper. The model learns semantic evolvement information of events by capturing local semantic changes and global semantic evolvement information through specific graph autoencoder and reconstruction strategies. By combining semantic evolvement information and propagation structure information, the model achieves a comprehensive understanding of event propagation and perform accurate and robust detection, while also detecting rumors earlier by capturing semantic evolvement information in the early stages. Moreover, in order to enhance the model's ability to learn the distinct patterns of rumors and non-rumors, we introduce a uniformity regularizer to further improve the model's performance. Experimental results on three public benchmark datasets confirm the superiority of our GARD method over the state-of-the-art approaches in both overall performance and early rumor detection.</description>

      <title>A communication protocol based on NK boolean networks for coordinating collective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I describe a digital social communication protocol (Gridt) based on Kauffman's NK boolean networks. The main assertion is that a communication network with this topology supports infinitely scalable self-organization of collective action without requiring hierarchy or central control. The paper presents the functionality of this protocol and substantiates the following propositions about its function and implications: (1) Communication via NK boolean networks facilitates coordination on collective action games for any variable number of users, and justifies the assumption that the game's payoff structure is common knowledge; (2) Use of this protocol increases its users' transfer empowerment, a form of intrinsic motivation that motivates coordinated action independent of the task or outcome; (3) Communication via this network can be considered 'cheap talk' and benefits the strategy of players with aligned interests, but not of players with conflicting interests; (4) Absence of significant barriers for its realization warrants a timely and continuing discussion on the ethics and implications of this technology; (5) Full realization of the technology's potential calls for a free-to-use service with maximal transparency of design and associated economic incentives.</description>

      <title>Sublinear-Time Opinion Estimation in the Friedkin--Johnsen Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online social networks are ubiquitous parts of modern societies and the discussions that take place in these networks impact people's opinions on diverse topics, such as politics or vaccination. One of the most popular models to formally describe this opinion formation process is the Friedkin--Johnsen (FJ) model, which allows to define measures, such as the polarization and the disagreement of a network. Recently, Xu, Bao and Zhang (WebConf'21) showed that all opinions and relevant measures in the FJ model can be approximated in near-linear time. However, their algorithm requires the entire network and the opinions of all nodes as input. Given the sheer size of online social networks and increasing data-access limitations, obtaining the entirety of this data might, however, be unrealistic in practice. In this paper, we show that node opinions and all relevant measures, like polarization and disagreement, can be efficiently approximated in time that is sublinear in the size of the network. Particularly, our algorithms only require query-access to the network and do not have to preprocess the graph. Furthermore, we use a connection between FJ opinion dynamics and personalized PageRank, and show that in $d$-regular graphs, we can deterministically approximate each node's opinion by only looking at a constant-size neighborhood, independently of the network size. We also experimentally validate that our estimation algorithms perform well in practice.</description>

      <title>ReliK: A Reliability Measure for Knowledge Graph Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can we assess a priori how well a knowledge graph embedding will perform on a specific downstream task and in a specific part of the knowledge graph? Knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) represent entities (e.g., "da Vinci," "Mona Lisa") and relationships (e.g., "painted") of a knowledge graph (KG) as vectors. KGEs are generated by optimizing an embedding score, which assesses whether a triple (e.g., "da Vinci," "painted," "Mona Lisa") exists in the graph. KGEs have been proven effective in a variety of web-related downstream tasks, including, for instance, predicting relationships among entities. However, the problem of anticipating the performance of a given KGE in a certain downstream task and locally to a specific individual triple, has not been tackled so far.
  In this paper, we fill this gap with ReliK, a Reliability measure for KGEs. ReliK relies solely on KGE embedding scores, is task- and KGE-agnostic, and requires no further KGE training. As such, it is particularly appealing for semantic web applications which call for testing multiple KGE methods on various parts of the KG and on each individual downstream task. Through extensive experiments, we attest that ReliK correlates well with both common downstream tasks, such as tail or relation prediction and triple classification, as well as advanced downstream tasks, such as rule mining and question answering, while preserving locality.</description>

      <title>Social Media Use is Predictable from App Sequences: Using LSTM and Transformer Neural Networks to Model Habitual Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present paper introduces a novel approach to studying social media habits through predictive modeling of sequential smartphone user behaviors. While much of the literature on media and technology habits has relied on self-report questionnaires and simple behavioral frequency measures, we examine an important yet understudied aspect of media and technology habits: their embeddedness in repetitive behavioral sequences. Leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and transformer neural networks, we show that (i) social media use is predictable at the within and between-person level and that (ii) there are robust individual differences in the predictability of social media use. We examine the performance of several modeling approaches, including (i) global models trained on the pooled data from all participants, (ii) idiographic person-specific models, and (iii) global models fine-tuned on person-specific data. Neither person-specific modeling nor fine-tuning on person-specific data substantially outperformed the global models, indicating that the global models were able to represent a variety of idiosyncratic behavioral patterns. Additionally, our analyses reveal that the person-level predictability of social media use is not substantially related to the frequency of smartphone use in general or the frequency of social media use, indicating that our approach captures an aspect of habits that is distinct from behavioral frequency. Implications for habit modeling and theoretical development are discussed.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Approximations for Cluster Deletion: Simpler, Faster, and Better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cluster deletion is an NP-hard graph clustering objective with applications in computational biology and social network analysis, where the goal is to delete a minimum number of edges to partition a graph into cliques. We first provide a tighter analysis of two previous approximation algorithms, improving their approximation guarantees from 4 to 3. Moreover, we show that both algorithms can be derandomized in a surprisingly simple way, by greedily taking a vertex of maximum degree in an auxiliary graph and forming a cluster around it. One of these algorithms relies on solving a linear program. Our final contribution is to design a new and purely combinatorial approach for doing so that is far more scalable in theory and practice.</description>

      <title>Stretched and measured neural predictions of complex network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04900v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential equations are a ubiquitous tool to study dynamics, ranging from physical systems to complex systems, where a large number of agents interact through a graph with non-trivial topological features. Data-driven approximations of differential equations present a promising alternative to traditional methods for uncovering a model of dynamical systems, especially in complex systems that lack explicit first principles. A recently employed machine learning tool for studying dynamics is neural networks, which can be used for data-driven solution finding or discovery of differential equations. Specifically for the latter task, however, deploying deep learning models in unfamiliar settings - such as predicting dynamics in unobserved state space regions or on novel graphs - can lead to spurious results. Focusing on complex systems whose dynamics are described with a system of first-order differential equations coupled through a graph, we show that extending the model's generalizability beyond traditional statistical learning theory limits is feasible. However, achieving this advanced level of generalization requires neural network models to conform to fundamental assumptions about the dynamical model. Additionally, we propose a statistical significance test to assess prediction quality during inference, enabling the identification of a neural network's confidence level in its predictions.</description>

      <title>A Grassroots Architecture to Supplant Global Digital Platforms by a Global Digital Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an architectural alternative to global digital platforms termed grassroots, designed to serve the social, economic, civic, and political needs of local digital communities, as well as their federation. Grassroots platforms may offer local communities an alternative to global digital platforms while operating solely on the smartphones of their members, forsaking any global resources other than the network itself. Such communities may form digital economies without initial capital or external credit, exercise sovereign democratic governance, and federate, ultimately resulting in the grassroots formation of a global digital democracy.</description>

      <title>FedTAD: Topology-aware Data-free Knowledge Distillation for Subgraph Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subgraph federated learning (subgraph-FL) is a new distributed paradigm that facilitates the collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) by multi-client subgraphs. Unfortunately, a significant challenge of subgraph-FL arises from subgraph heterogeneity, which stems from node and topology variation, causing the impaired performance of the global GNN. Despite various studies, they have not yet thoroughly investigated the impact mechanism of subgraph heterogeneity. To this end, we decouple node and topology variation, revealing that they correspond to differences in label distribution and structure homophily. Remarkably, these variations lead to significant differences in the class-wise knowledge reliability of multiple local GNNs, misguiding the model aggregation with varying degrees. Building on this insight, we propose topology-aware data-free knowledge distillation technology (FedTAD), enhancing reliable knowledge transfer from the local model to the global model. Extensive experiments on six public datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FedTAD over state-of-the-art baselines.</description>
