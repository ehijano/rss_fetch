      <title>Group-IV Pentaoctite: A New 2D Material Family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the structural, mechanical, and electronic properties of novel two-dimensional (2D) pentaoctite (PO) monolayers composed of group-IV elements (PO-C, PO-Si, PO-Ge, and PO-Sn) using first-principles calculations. Stability is explored through phonon spectra and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, confirming that all proposed structures are dynamically and thermally stable. Mechanical analysis shows that PO-C monolayers exhibit exceptional rigidity, while the others demonstrate greater flexibility, making them suitable for applications in foldable materials. The electronic properties show semimetallic behavior for PO-C and metallic behavior for PO-Si, while PO-Ge and PO-Sn possess narrow band gaps, positioning them as promising candidates for semiconductor applications. Additionally, PO-C exhibits potential as an efficient catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with strain engineering further enhancing its catalytic performance. These findings suggest a wide range of technological applications, from nanoelectronics and nanomechanics to metal-free catalysis in sustainable energy production.</description>

      <title>Exciton crystal melting and destruction by disorder in bilayer quantum hall system with total filling factor one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilayer quantum hall system with total filling factor 1 was studied in the regime of heavy layer imbalance in a recent transport experiment (Ref. 1), with intriguing new findings. We demonstrate in this paper that 1) the exciton Wigner crystal in this regime can melt into a superfluid phase, giving rise to re-entrant superfluid behavior; 2) in the presence of disorder, electron and hole Wigner crystals in the two layers go through a locking/decoupling transition as layer separation increases, resulting in a sudden change in the counter flow conductance. Comparison will be made with the findings of Ref. 1.</description>

      <title>Helicity controlled spin Hall angle in the 2D Rashba altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the efficiency of charge-to-spin conversion in two-dimensional Rashba altermagnets, a class of materials that merge characteristics of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Utilizing quantum linear response theory, we quantify the longitudinal and spin Hall conductivities in this system and demonstrate that a substantial enhancement of the spin Hall angle is achieved below the band crossing point through the dual effects of relativistic spin-orbit interaction and nonrelativistic altermagnetic exchange interaction. Additionally, we find that skew scattering and topology-related intrinsic mechanisms are almost negligible in this system, which contrasts with conventional ferromagnetic Rashba systems. Our findings not only advance the understanding of spin dynamics in Rashba altermagnets but also pave the way for novel strategies in manipulating charge-to-spin conversion via the sophisticated control of noncollinear in-plane and collinear out-of-plane spin textures.</description>

      <title>Giant anisotropic anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnetic topological metal NdGaSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between magnetism and strong electron correlation in magnetic materials discerns a variety of intriguing topological features. Here, we report a systematic investigation of the magnetic, thermodynamic, and electrical transport properties in NdGaSi single crystals. The magnetic measurements reveal a magnetic ordering below T_N (11 K), with spins aligning antiferromagnetically in-plane, and it orders ferromagnetically (FM) out-of-plane. The longitudinal resistivity data and heat capacity exhibit a significant anomaly as a consequence of the magnetic ordering at TN. The magnetoresistance study shows significantly different behavior when measured along either direction, resulting from the complex nature of the magnetic structure, stemming from complete saturation of moments in one direction and subsequent spin flop transitions in the other. Remarkably, we have also noticed an unusual anisotropic anomalous Hall response. We have observed a giant anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 1730 ohm-1 cm-1 and 490 ohm-1 cm-1 at 2 K, with B // [001] and B // [100], respectively. Our scaling analysis of AHC reveals that the anomalous Hall effect in the studied compound is dominated by the Berry phase-driven intrinsic mechanism. These astonishing findings in NdGaSi open up new possibilities for antiferromagnetic spintronics in rare-earth-based intermetallic compounds.</description>

      <title>Berry curvature and shift vector effects at high-order wave mixing in biased bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a microscopic quantum theory that elucidates the nonlinear-nonperturbative optical response of biased bilayer graphene subjected to a bichromatic strong laser fields. This response is analyzed using a four-band Hamiltonian derived from ab-initio calculations. For the laser-stimulated dynamics, we employ structure gauge-invariant evolutionary equations to accurately describe the evolution of the single-particle density matrix across the entire Brillouin zone. The resonant generation of electron-hole pairs by the high-frequency component of the field, combined with the induction of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) and high-order wave mixing (HWM) by the strong low-frequency field component, leads to significant alterations in the HWM and HHG spectra. These changes are driven by the effects of Berry curvature and the shift vector, which modify the relative contributions of interband and intraband channels, thereby fundamentally reshaping the radiation spectra at high-order frequency multiplication.</description>

      <title>Planar Bragg microcavities with monolayer WS$_2$ for strong exciton-photon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and numerically investigate a novel compact planar microcavity design based on a high-index dielectric slab waveguide with embedded monolayer semiconductor. In comparison to more traditional vertical Bragg microcavities, our design relies on the transmission of guided optical modes and achieves strong exciton-photon coupling in a chip-compatible and compact geometry with sub-100 nm thickness. We show that Rabi splitting values of more than 70 meV can be obtained in planar microcavities with the total length below 5 um. Further, we reveal the dependence of Rabi splitting on the dimensions of the structure and explain it with a simple theoretical model. Our results contribute towards the development of novel compact 2D semiconductor-based components for integrated photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Internal tensorial variables and a heat transport equation with inertial, thermal viscosity and vorticity terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking into account some results obtained within the framework of non-equilibrium thermodynamics with internal variables (NET-IV) in a previous paper, where generalized Guyer-Krumhansl evolution equations for the heat flux in heat rigid conductors were derived, in this paper we obtain a heat transport equation describing conductive, viscous and vortical motions of phonons. To do so, we take as independent variables the internal energy, the heat flux, and a tensorial internal variable, with a symmetric part and an antisymmetric part, which turns out to be related to the rotational terms in the final equation. Besides the shear phonon viscosity arising in usual phonon hydrodynamics, we propose a rotational phonon viscosity, which would describe a transfer from ordered rotational motion of phonon vortices to rotational microscopic motions of diatomic particles constituting complex polar crystals, in analogy to the hydrodynamics of classical micropolar fluids. This possibility emphasizes the interest of exploring the interactions between the average heat flow and the heat vortices found in some models of phonon hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Brewster Angle Shift in Doped Graphene via the Fizeau Drag Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the general Fresnel coefficients for reflection by incorporating the Fizeau drag effect in doped graphene, which arises from the unique behavior of its massless Dirac electrons. Using the standard Maxwell equations and constitutive relations, we analyze the influence of this relativistic phenomenon on the optical properties of doped graphene. Our study focuses on the angular shift of Brewster's angle in a structure where monolayer graphene is sandwiched between two static dielectric media. Our findings reveal that the presence of the Fizeau drag effect significantly enhances the Brewster angle shift, leading to substantial modifications in the optical characteristics of the graphene channel, including notable alterations in the reflectance spectrum. We demonstrate that this angular shift can be further amplified by increasing the drift velocities and charge densities of the electrons in graphene, offering a tunable mechanism for controlling optical behavior in graphene-based systems. The findings of this work have significant implications for the design and development of planar photonic devices that take advantage of the optical characteristics of graphene. This breakthrough creates new opportunities for the use of graphene in sophisticated photonic technologies, where exact control over the interactions between light and matter is essential.</description>

      <title>Targeted Polariton Flow Through Tailored Photonic Defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In non-Hermitian open quantum systems, such as polariton condensates, local tailoring of gains and losses opens up an interesting possibility to realize functional optical elements. Here, we demonstrate that deliberately introducing losses via a photonic defect, realized by reducing the quality factor of a DBR mirror locally within an ultrahigh-quality microcavity, may be utilized to create directed polariton currents towards the defect. We discuss the role of polariton-polariton interactions in the process and how to tailor the effective decay time of a polariton condensate via coupling to the defect. Our results highlight the far-reaching potential of non-Hermitian physics in polaritonics.</description>

      <title>Synthetic fractional flux quanta in a ring of superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A ring of capacitively-coupled transmons threaded by a synthetic magnetic field is studied as a realization of a strongly interacting bosonic system. The synthetic flux is imparted through a specific Floquet modulation scheme based on a suitable periodic sequence of Lorentzian pulses that are known as `Levitons'. Such scheme has the advantage to preserve the translation invariance of the system and to work at the qubits sweet spots. We employ this system to demonstrate the concept of fractional values of flux quanta. Although such fractionalization phenomenon was originally predicted for bright solitons in cold atoms, it may be in fact challenging to access with that platform. Here, we show how fractional flux quanta can be read-out in the absorption spectrum of a suitable 'scattering experiment' in which the qubit ring is driven by microwaves.</description>

      <title>Periodic source of energy-entangled electrons in helical states coupled to a BCS superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a source of purely electronic energy-entangled states implemented in a solid-state system with potential applications in quantum information protocols based on electron flying qubits. The proposed device relies on the standard tools of Electron Quantum Optics (EQO) and exploits entanglement of the Cooper pairs of a BCS superconductor. The latter is coupled via an adjustable quantum point contact to two opposite spin polarized electron wave-guides, which are driven by trains of Lorentzian pulses. This specific choice for the drive is crucial to inject purely electronic entangled-states devoid of spurious electron-hole pairs. In the Andreev regime, a perturbative calculation in the tunnel coupling confirms that entangled electrons states (EES) are generated at the output of the normal side. We introduce a quantity related to charge current cross-correlations which allows one to verify experimentally the entangled nature of the emitted state.</description>

      <title>Zero Flux Localization: Magic Revealed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat bands correspond to the spatial localization of a quantum particle moving in a field with discrete or continuous translational invariance. The canonical example is the flat Landau levels in a homogeneous magnetic field. Several significant problems -- including flat bands in moir\'e structures -- are related to the problem of a particle moving in an inhomogeneous magnetic field with zero total flux. We demonstrate that while perfectly flat bands in such cases are impossible, the introduction of a "non-Abelian component" -- a spin field with zero total curvature -- can lead to perfect localization. Several exactly solvable models are constructed: (i) a half-space up/down field with a sharp 1D boundary; (ii) an alternating up/down field periodic in one direction on a cylinder; and (iii) a doubly periodic alternating field on a torus. The exact solution on the torus is expressed in terms of elliptic functions. It is shown that flat bands are only possible for certain magic values of the field corresponding to a quantized flux through an individual tile. These exact solutions clarify the simple structure underlying flat bands in moir\'e materials and provide a springboard for constructing a novel class of fractional quantum Hall states.</description>

      <title>Mathematical foundations of phonons in incommensurate materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In some models, periodic configurations can be shown to be stable under, both, global $\ell^2$ or local perturbations. This is not the case for aperiodic media. The specific class of aperiodic media we are interested, in arise from taking two 2D periodic crystals and stacking them parallel at a relative twist. In periodic media, phonons are generalized eigenvectors for a stability operator acting on $\ell^2$, coming from a mechanical energy. The goal of our analysis is to provide phonons in the given class of aperiodic media with meaning. As rigorously established for the 1D Frenkel-Kontorova model and previously applied by one of the authors, we assume that we can parametrize minimizing lattice deformations w.r.t. local perturbations via continuous stacking-periodic functions, for which we previously derived a continuous energy density functional. Such (continuous) energy densities are analytically and computationally much better accessible compared to discrete energy functionals. In order to pass to an $\ell^2$-based energy functional, we also study the offset energy w.r.t. given lattice deformations, under $\ell^1$-perturbations. Our findings show that, in the case of an undeformed bilayer heterostructure, while the energy density can be shown to be stable under the assumption of stability of individual layers, the offset energy fails to be stable in the case of twisted bilayer graphene. We then establish conditions for stability and instability of the offset energy w.r.t. the relaxed lattice. Finally, we show that, in the case of incommensurate bilayer homostructures, i.e., two equal layers, if we choose minimizing deformations according to the global energy density above, the offset energy is stable in the limit of zero twist angle. Consequently, in this case, one can then define phonons as generalized eigenvectors w.r.t. the stability operator associated with the offset energy.</description>

      <title>Non-Monotonic Size-Dependent Exciton Radiative Lifetime in CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lead-halide perovskite nanocrystals have recently emerged as desirable optical materials for applications such as coherent quantum light emitters and solid-state laser cooling due to their short radiative lifetime and near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Here, we investigate the effect of CsPbBr3 nanocrystal size on the radiative lifetime under ambient conditions. High-quality nanocrystals, with monoexponential time-resolved photoluminescence decay behaviors, unveil a non-monotonic trend in radiative lifetime. This non-monotonicity appears to reflect a behavior common among II-VI (CdSe) and perovskites semiconducting nanocrystals. We find that large nanocrystals in the weak quantum confinement regime exhibit long radiative lifetimes due to a thermally accessible population of dim states. Small nanocrystals within the strong quantum confinement regime, surprisingly, also show long radiative lifetimes, due however to a substantial reduction in oscillator strength. Nanocrystals in the intermediate quantum confinement regime displays the shortest radiative lifetime, as their oscillator strength is enhanced relative to particles in the strong confinement regime, but do not have sufficient low-lying dim states like the large particles to counteract this affect. These findings shed light on the impact of nanocrystal size on radiative lifetime and pave the way for tailored optical materials in various optical applications.</description>

Abstract: In order to promote the development of the next generation of nano-spintronic devices, it is of great significance to tune the freedom of valley in two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here, we propose a mechanism for manipulating the valley and nonlinear Hall effect by the 2D ferroelectric substrate. The monolayer Mn2P2S3Se3 is a robust antiferromagnetic valley polarized semiconductor. Importantly, the valley polarized metal-semiconductor phase transition of Mn2P2S3Se3 can be effectively tuned by switching the ferroelectric polarization of Sc2CO2. We reveal the microscopic mechanism of phase transition, which origins from the charge transfer and band alignment. Additionally, we find that transformed polarization direction of Sc2CO2 flexibly manipulate the Berry curvature dipole. Based on this discovery, we present the detection valley polarized metal-semiconductor transition by the nonlinear Hall effect devices. These findings not only offer a scheme to tune the valley degree of freedom, but also provide promising platform to design the nonlinear Hall effect devices.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of ordered self-assembled structures in the liquid phase of a hard-core, square-shoulder system</title>

Abstract: We investigate the phase ordering (pattern formation) of systems of two-dimensional core-shell particles using Monte-Carlo (MC) computer simulations and classical density functional theory (DFT). The particles interact via a pair potential having a hard core and a repulsive square shoulder. Our simulations show that on cooling, the liquid state structure becomes increasingly characterised by long wavelength density modulations, and on further cooling forms a variety of other phases, including clustered, striped and other patterned phases. In DFT, the hard core part of the potential is treated using either fundamental measure theory or a simple local density approximation, whereas the soft shoulder is treated using the random phase approximation. The different DFTs are bench-marked using large-scale grand-canonical-MC and Gibbs-ensemble-MC simulations, demonstrating their predictive capabilities and shortcomings. We find that having the liquid state static structure factor $S(k)$ for wavenumber $k$ is sufficient to identify the Fourier modes governing both the liquid and solid phases. This allows to identify from easier-to-obtain liquid state data the wavenumbers relevant to the periodic phases and to predict roughly where in the phase diagram these patterned phases arise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find that the double-threshold voltage-current characteristics in the insulating regime in the ultra-clean two-valley two-dimensional electron system in SiGe/Si/SiGe quantum wells are promoted by perpendicular magnetic fields, persisting to an order of magnitude lower voltages and considerably higher electron densities compared to the zero-field case. This observation indicates the perpendicular-magnetic-field stabilization of the quantum electron solid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, which has been discovered experimentally in Han $et$ $al$ arXiv:2408.15233. We construct a minimal model for the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity, assuming a simplified anisotropic interaction that depends only on the angle between the incoming and outgoing momenta. Despite the absence of Fermi surface nesting, we show that the superconductivity appears near the Van Hove singularity with the maximal $T_c$ near a bifurcation point of the peaks in the density of states. We identify the topological $p+ip$, topological $h+ih$, and the non-topological nodal $f$-wave pairings as the possible states, which are all pair density wave orders due to the intravalley nature. Furthermore, these pair density wave orders require a finite attractive threshold for superconductivity, resulting in narrow superconducting regions, consistent with experimental findings. We discuss the possible pairing mechanisms and point out that the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism is a plausible explanation for the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in the rhombohedral tetralayer graphene.</description>

Abstract: The BR, formulated by Zak in the 80s, is widely used in studies of topological phase of material. EBR are considered the building block of TQC. However, there were debate on whether they admit split bands, or if they contain band invariant subspaces. This manuscript presents a clear definition of the basis and illustrate that the band transformation properties are dependent on the band connectivity. Two different Fourier transform conventions in defining the BR induced from the same set of localised Wannier functions are discussed and identified as related by a simple gauge transformation. The TB BR are used to derive the form of TB Hamiltonian using group theoretical technique. The transformation properties of EBR allow explicit decomposition in terms of irreps of space group, and use of projection operators in determining symmetry permitted band connectivity. It is shown that EBRs arising from Wyckoff positions with multiplicity can have multiple atomic limits and identifies explicitly what occurs at HSPs on the surface of BZ as what determines the band connectivity and the irreducible nature of the connected band. Such multiple configurations arise from multiple ways to block-diagonalising representation matrix at these HSPs. The symmetry permitted connectivity allows the existence of dynamic band invariant subspaces known as irreducible band representations. Such IBR, induced from Wannier functions centred on linear combination of orbits of Wyckoff positions, can also arise from interaction among composite EBRs. They are rooted in the permutation symmetry of crystallographic orbits of Wyckoff positions with multiplicity and can occur even if the parental EBR is classified as indecomposable. When symmetry permitted split EBR occurs, which does not correspond to division between connected IBRs, the topologies of the bands are potentially non-trivial on both sides of the gap.</description>

      <title>Spin-resolved nonlocal transport in proximitized Rashba nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium transport in hybrid semiconductor-superconductor nanowires is crucial for many quantum phenomena such as generating entangled states via cross Andreev reflection (CAR) processes, detecting topological superconductivity, reading out Andreev spin qubits, coupling spin qubits over long distances and so on. Here, we investigate numerically transport properties of a proximitized Rashba nanowire that hosts spin-polarized low-energy quasiparticle states. We show that the spin polarization in such one-dimensional Andreev bands, extended over the entire nanowire length, can be detected in nonlocal transport measurements with tunnel-coupled side leads that are spin polarized. Remarkably, we find an exact correspondence between the sign of the nonlocal conductance and the spin density of the superconducting quasiparticles at the side lead position. We demonstrate that this feature is robust to moderate static disorder. As an example, we show that such a method can be used to detect spin inversion of the bands, accompanying the topological phase transition (TPT) for realistic system parameters. Furthermore, we show that such effects can be used to switch between CAR and elastic cotunneling (ECT) processes by tuning the strength of either the electric or the magnetic field. These findings hold significant practical implications for state-of-the-art transport experiments in such hybrid systems.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, simulation methods based on the scaling of atomic potential functions, such as quasi-coarse-grained dynamics and coarse-grained dynamics, have shown promising results for modeling crystalline systems at multiple scales. However, this letter presents evidence suggesting that the spatiotemporal trajectories of coarse-grained systems generated by such simulation methods exhibit a complete correspondence with those of specific molecular dynamics systems. In essence, current coarse-grained simulation methods involve a direct amplification of the results obtained from molecular dynamics simulations across spatial and temporal scales, yet they may lack the capability to adequately capture authentic scale effects. Consequently, the findings of related studies warrant careful re-evaluation. Furthermore, this study underscores the importance of not only verifying the consistency of mesoscale simulation methods with microscopic simulations but also meticulously assessing their capability to accurately forecast mesoscale physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Hofstadter spectrum of Chern bands in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the topological bands in twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides in an external magnetic field. We first focus on a paradigmatic model of WSe$_2$, which can be described in an adiabatic approximation as particles moving in a periodic potential and an emergent periodic magnetic field with nonzero average. We understand the magnetic-field dependent spectra of WSe$_2$ based on the point net zero flux, at which the external field cancels the average emergent field. At this point, the band structure interpolates between the tightly-bound and nearly-free (weak periodic potential) paradigms as the twist angle increases. For small twist angles, the energy levels in a magnetic field mirror the Hofstadter butterfly of the Haldane model. For larger twist angles, the isolated Chern band at zero flux evolves from nearly-free bands at the point of net zero flux. We also apply our framework to a realistic model of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$, which has recently been suggested to feature higher Landau level analogs. We show that at negative unit flux per unit cell, the bands exhibit remarkable similarity to a backfolded parabolic dispersion, even though the adiabatic approximation is inapplicable. This backfolded parabolic dispersion naturally explains the similarity of the Chern bands at zero applied flux to the two lowest Landau levels, offering a simple picture supporting the emergence of non-Abelian states in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$. We propose the study of magnetic field dependent band structures as a versatile method to investigate the nature of topological bands and identify Landau level analogs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we propose two theoretical models of a metallic N\'{e}el ordered antiferromagnet with charge-density wave order which shows the anomalous Hall effect. In our models a combination of the N\'{e}el order and the charge-density wave order results in spin splitting of the conducting fermions. In addition, spin-orbit coupling is required to drive the anomalous Hall effect. In the first model we analyzed the effects of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling, and of the intrinsic $d-$wave spin-orbit coupling in the second model.</description>

Abstract: EBR is considered the building block in TQC and fundamental concept in SI methods. One of the hypophysis is that a fully occupied EBR has zero Berry-Wilczek-Zee phase and those occupied corresponds to trivial topology. Associated with it are the concepts of atomic limit and equivalence between BRs. In this manuscript, an explicit link between the BWZ phase of connected bands and that of its EBR or irreducible band representation (IBR) basis is established. When gapped system occurs under the TB model, the relation between the BWZ phase of a set of connected bands and its BR basis only persist if the later are IBRs. Thus the BWZ phase can be evaluated in terms of the IBRs. Equivalent segments of path integral of BWZ connection with respect to IBRs are established as representation of the space group and selection rule for corresponding BWZ phase established where possible. The occurrence of IBRs is rooted in real space symmetry but dependent on dynamic interaction and band topology. Three gapped systems in honeycomb lattices are discussed. Two spin-less cases are shown to be topologically trivial, whereas the selection rule cannot be developed for the spin-full pz orbital as in graphene. Two necessary conditions for topologically trivial phase are established, namely 1.Connected bands having the same closed set of IBR basis for all k and, 2.The reduced tensor element for the path integral of BWZ connection for such basis is symmetry forbidden due to contractable close loop having zero BWZ phase. Thus the IBRs are the building block of topologically trivial phase and symmetry constraint on BWZ phase are obtained through IBRs and selection rules via Wigner-Eckart theorem. Some examples demonstrate that the basic hypothesis of SI method is false. The analysis here advocate a paradigm shift from EBR to IBR as building block of topologically trivial phase.</description>

Abstract: Topological semimetals are some of the topological phases of matter most intensely-studied experimentally. The Weyl semimetal phase, in particular, has garned tremendous, sustained interest given fascinating signatures such as the Fermi arc surface states and the chiral anomaly, as well as the minimal requirements to protect this three-dimensional topological phase. Here, we show that thin films of Weyl semimetals (which we call quasi-(3-1)-dimensional, or q(3-1)d) generically realize finite-size topological phases distinct from 3d and 2d topological phases of established classification schemes: response signatures of the 3d bulk topology co-exist with topologically-protected, quasi-(3-2)d Fermi arc states or chiral boundary modes due to a second, previously-unidentified bulk-boundary correspondence. We show these finite-size topological semimetal phases are realized by Hamiltonians capturing the Fermiology of few-layer Van der Waals material MoTe2 in experiment. Given the broad experimental interest in few-layer Van der Waals materials and topological semimetals, our work paves the way for extensive future theoretical and experimental characterization of finite-size topological phases.</description>

Abstract: The deluge of sensors and data generating devices has driven a paradigm shift in modern computing from arithmetic-logic centric to data-centric processing. Data-centric processing require innovations at device level to enable novel compute-in-memory (CIM) operations. A key challenge in construction of CIM architectures is the conflicting trade-off between the performance and their flexibility for various essential data operations. Here, we present a transistor-free CIM architecture that permits storage, search and neural network operations on sub-50nm thick Aluminum Scandium Nitride ferroelectric diodes (FeDs). Our circuit designs and devices can be directly integrated on top of Silicon microprocessors in a scalable process. By leveraging the field-programmability, non-volatility and non-linearity of FeDs, search operations are demonstrated with a cell footprint &lt; 0.12 um2 when projected onto 45-nm node technology. We further demonstrate neural network operations with 4-bit operation using FeDs. Our results highlight FeDs as candidates for efficient and multifunctional CIM platforms.</description>

      <title>A classical density functional theory for solvation across length scales</title>

Abstract: A central aim of multiscale modeling is to use results from the Schr\"odinger Equation to predict phenomenology on length scales that far exceed those of typical molecular correlations. In this work, we present a new approach rooted in classical density functional theory (cDFT) that allows us to accurately describe the solvation of apolar solutes across length scales. Our approach builds on the Lum-Chandler-Weeks (LCW) theory of hydrophobicity [K. Lum et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 103, 4570 (1999)] by constructing a free energy functional that uses a slowly-varying component of the density field as a reference. From a practical viewpoint, the theory we present is numerically simpler and generalizes to solutes with soft-core repulsion more easily than LCW theory. Furthermore, by assessing the local compressibility and its critical scaling behavior, we demonstrate that our LCW-style cDFT approach contains the physics of critical drying, which has been emphasized as an essential aspect of hydrophobicity by recent theories. As our approach is parameterized on the two-body direct correlation function of the uniform fluid and the liquid-vapor surface tension, it straightforwardly captures the temperature dependence of solvation. Moreover, we use our theory to describe solvation at a first-principles level, on length scales that vastly exceed what is accessible to molecular simulations.</description>

Abstract: We investigated the interlayer coupling effect in homobilayer structures of MSi2X4 with M = Mo/W and X = N/P/As. Through the combination of first-principles calculations and analytical formulations, the equilibrium interlayer distance, layer energy difference and interlayer hopping strength are obtained for all six MSi2X4 materials, which are found to be insensitive to the type of M atom but differ significantly between X = N and X = P/As. In homobilayers with close to 0{\deg} twist angles, the interlayer charge redistribution introduces a stacking-dependent interlayer electrostatic potential with a magnitude reaching 0.1 eV in MSi2N4, suggesting that it can be an excellent candidate for studying the sliding ferroelectricity. The interlayer hopping strengths are found to be as large as several tens meV at valence band maxima positions K and {\Gamma}, and ~ 1 meV at the conduction band edge K. The resultant layer-hybridizations vary in a large range under different stacking registries, which can be used to simulate honeycomb lattice models with both trivial and non-trivial band topologies.</description>

      <title>Magnon-mediated quantum gates for superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum system consisting of a magnetic particle inductively coupled to two superconducting transmon qubits, where qubit-qubit interactions are mediated via magnons. We show that the system can be tuned into three different regimes of effective qubit-qubit interactions, namely a transverse ($XX + YY$), a longitudinal ($ZZ$) and a non-trivial $ZX$ interaction. In addition, we show that an enhanced coupling can be achieved by employing an ellipsoidal magnet, carrying anisotropic magnetic fluctuations. We propose a scheme for realizing two-qubit gates, and simulate their performance under realistic experimental conditions. We find that iSWAP and CZ gates can be performed in this setup with an average fidelity $\gtrsim 99 \% $ , while an iCNOT gate can be applied with an average fidelity $\gtrsim 88 \%$. Our proposed hybrid circuit architecture offers an alternative platform for realizing two-qubit gates between superconducting qubits and could be employed for constructing qubit networks using magnons as mediators.</description>
