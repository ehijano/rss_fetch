      <title>Polynomials in homotopy type theory as a Kleisli category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polynomials in a category have been studied as a generalization of the traditional notion in mathematics. Their construction has recently been extended to higher groupoids, as formalized in homotopy type theory, by Finster, Mimram, Lucas and Seiller, thus resulting in a cartesian closed bicategory. We refine and extend their work in multiple directions. We begin by generalizing the construction of the free symmetric monoid monad on types in order to handle arities in an arbitrary universe. Then, we extend this monad to the (wild) category of spans of types, and thus to a comonad by self-duality. Finally, we show that the resulting Kleisli category is equivalent to the traditional category of polynomials. This thus establishes polynomials as a (homotopical) model of linear logic. In fact, we explain that it is closely related to a bicategorical model of differential linear logic introduced by Melli\`es.</description>

      <title>Variational methods for Learning Multilevel Genetic Algorithms using the Kantorovich Monad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Levels of selection and multilevel evolutionary processes are essential concepts in evolutionary theory, and yet there is a lack of common mathematical models for these core ideas. Here, we propose a unified mathematical framework for formulating and optimizing multilevel evolutionary processes and genetic algorithms over arbitrarily many levels based on concepts from category theory and population genetics. We formulate a multilevel version of the Wright-Fisher process using this approach, and we show that this model can be analyzed to clarify key features of multilevel selection. Particularly, we derive an extended multilevel probabilistic version of Price's Equation via the Kantorovich Monad, and we use this to characterize regimes of parameter space within which selection acts antagonistically or cooperatively across levels. Finally, we show how our framework can provide a unified setting for learning genetic algorithms (GAs), and we show how we can use a Variational Optimization and a multi-level analogue of coalescent analysis to fit multilevel GAs to simulated data.</description>

      <title>Homotopical recognition of diagram categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on work of Marta Bunge in the one-categorical case, we characterize when a given model category is Quillen equivalent to a presheaf category with the projective model structure. This involves introducing a notion of homotopy atoms, generalizing the orbits of Dwyer and Kan. Apart from the orbit model structures of Dwyer and Kan, our examples include the classification of stable model categories after Schwede and Shipley, isovariant homotopy theory after Yeakel, and Cat-enriched homotopy theory after Gu.
  The most surprising example is the classical category of spectra, which turns out to be equivalent to the presheaf category of pointed simplicial sets indexed by the desuspensions of the sphere spectrum. No Bousfield localization is needed.
  As an application, we give a classification of polynomial functors (the sense of Goodwillie calculus) from finite pointed simplicial sets to spectra, and compare it to the previous work by Arone and Ching.</description>

      <title>Tensor product of A$_{\infty}$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we define the tensor product of two A$_{\infty}$-categories and two A$_{\infty}$-functors. This tensor product makes the category of A$_{\infty}$-categories symmetric monoidal (up to homotopy), and the category A$_{\infty}$Cat$^u$/$_{\approx}$ a closed symmetric monoidal category. Moreover, we define the derived tensor product making Ho(A$_{\infty}$Cat), the homotopy category of the A$_{\infty}$-categories, a closed symmetric monoidal category. We provide also an explicit description of the internal homs in terms of A$_{\infty}$- functors.</description>

      <title>Enriched structure-semantics adjunctions and monad-theory equivalences for subcategories of arities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lawvere's algebraic theories, or Lawvere theories, underpin a categorical approach to general algebra, and Lawvere's adjunction between semantics and algebraic structure leads to an equivalence between Lawvere theories and finitary monads on the category of sets. Several authors have transported these ideas to a variety of settings, including contexts of category theory enriched in a symmetric monoidal closed category. In this paper, we develop a general axiomatic framework for enriched structure-semantics adjunctions and monad-theory equivalences for subcategories of arities. Not only do we establish a simultaneous generalization of the monad-theory equivalences previously developed in the settings of Lawvere (1963), Linton (1966), Dubuc (1970), Borceux-Day (1980), Power (1999), Nishizawa-Power (2009), Lack-Rosick\'y (2011), Lucyshyn-Wright (2016), and Bourke-Garner (2019), but also we establish a structure-semantics theorem that generalizes those given in the first four of these works while applying also to the remaining five, for which such a result has not previously been developed. Furthermore, we employ our axiomatic framework to establish broad new classes of examples of enriched monad-theory equivalences and structure-semantics adjunctions for subcategories of arities enriched in locally bounded closed categories, including various convenient closed categories that are relevant in topology and analysis and need not be locally presentable.</description>

      <title>Gapped Phases in (2+1)d with Non-Invertible Symmetries: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) to study and classify gapped phases in (2+1)d for a class of categorical symmetries, referred to as being of bosonic type. The SymTFTs for these symmetries are given by twisted and untwisted (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories for finite groups G. A finite set of boundary conditions (BCs) of these DW theories is well-known: these simply involve imposing Dirichlet and Neumann conditions on the (3+1)d gauge fields. We refer to these as minimal BCs. The key new observation here is that for each DW theory, there exists an infinite number of other BCs, that we call non-minimal BCs. These non-minimal BCs are all obtained by a 'theta construction', which involves stacking the Dirichlet BC with 3d TFTs having G 0-form symmetry, and gauging the diagonal G symmetry. On the one hand, using the non-minimal BCs as symmetry BCs gives rise to an infinite number of non-invertible symmetries having the same SymTFT, while on the other hand, using the non-minimal BCs as physical BCs in the sandwich construction gives rise to an infinite number of (2+1)d gapped phases for each such non-invertible symmetry. Our analysis is thoroughly exemplified for G = $\mathbb{Z_2}$ and more generally any finite abelian group, for which the resulting non-invertible symmetries and their gapped phases already reveal an immensely rich structure.</description>
