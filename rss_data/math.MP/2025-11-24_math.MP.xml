      <title>A permutation-based power series representation of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula was recently resummed exactly in one variable, and left as a power series in the other (Moodie and Long 2021 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 54 015208). The coefficients of the power series were provided as a sum of products of three hyperbolic functions that are analogous to the familiar commutator expansion. We find a new form of the power series coefficients that is a linear combination of just one of the hyperbolic functions. This linear combination can be understood through elementary permutations of the arguments of the hyperbolic function. We use generating functions and hyperbolic identities to relate the representations. The permutation representation is radically different to previously known structures in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula and naturally supersedes the previous power series representation for future use, in our opinion. It also allows us to prove a set of intriguing marching identities that are useful in physical applications and were discovered in the initial work.</description>

      <title>The identification of the extended refined open partition function and the Kontsevich-Penner matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The open intersection theory has been initiated by R. Pandharipande, J. P. Solomon and R. J. Tessler. In the scope of matrix model theory, A. Buryak and R. J. Tessler have constructed a matrix model $\mathcal{Z}^o$ for the open partition function based on a Kontsevich type combinatorial formula for the open intersection numbers found by R. J. Tessler. In this paper, using the Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber formula and operational calculus, we transform $\mathcal{Z}^o$ into another simple form, and define the matrix model $\mathcal{Z}_N^{o,ext,s}$ for the extended refined open partition function from it. The expression of $\mathcal{Z}_N^{o,ext,s}$ will immediately lead us to the Kontsevich-Penner matrix model $Z_N$ under the Miwa parametrization $s_i=2^ii!\operatorname{tr} \Lambda^{-2i-2}$. Hence it confirms the identification between the two models for general $N\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Superconformal topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a supersymmetric generalisation of topological recursion from two perspectives: algebraic and geometric. The algebraic side concerns a recursive structure encoded in modules of a super Virasoro algebra, and the geometric counterpart is what we call superconformal topological recursion defined on a super Riemann surface. Superconformal topological recursion indicates that odd holomorphic one-forms on a super Riemann surface are related to zero modes of copies of the Clifford algebras, and it also provides a tool to study deformation of non-split super Riemann surfaces, e.g. certain families of super Riemann surfaces carrying odd parameters. On a super Riemann surface over a non-reduced base, the formalism is recursive not only in terms of pants-decomposition but also in terms of odd parameters in a suitable sense.</description>

      <title>On gap properties for the linearized 1D Dirac--Soler model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spectral properties of the Dirac operator $L_0$ arising as the upper-right off-diagonal block in the linearization around standing wave solutions of the one-dimensional Soler model with power nonlinearity $f(s)=s|s|^{p-1}$, $p&gt;0$. Our main results concern the so-called gap property: we show that if $p \geq 1$, then the only eigenvalues of $L_0$ are its ground state energies, $-2\omega$ and $0$. In contrast, for $p&lt;1$, additional eigenvalues appear from the thresholds of the essential spectrum. Furthermore, we prove that the thresholds never admit eigenvalues and that they have at most one resonance.</description>

      <title>Empirical Quantum Advantage in Constrained Optimization from Encoded Unitary Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Constraint-Enhanced Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (CE-QAOA), a shallow, constraint-aware ansatz that operates inside the one-hot product space of size [n]^m, where m is the number of blocks and each block is initialized with an n-qubit W_n state. We give an ancilla-free, depth-optimal encoder that prepares a W_n state using n-1 two-qubit rotations per block, and a two-local XY mixer restricted to the same block of n qubits with a constant spectral gap. Algorithmically, we wrap constant-depth sampling with a deterministic classical checker to obtain a polynomial-time hybrid quantum-classical solver (PHQC) that returns the best observed feasible solution in O(S n^2) time, where S is the number of shots. We obtain two advantages. First, when CE-QAOA fixes r &gt;= 1 locations different from the start city, we achieve a Theta(n^r) reduction in shot complexity even against a classical sampler that draws uniformly from the feasible set. Second, against a classical baseline restricted to raw bitstring sampling, we show an exp(Theta(n^2)) separation in the minimax sense. In noiseless circuit simulations of TSP instances ranging from 4 to 10 locations from the QOPTLib benchmark library, we recover the global optimum at depth p = 1 using polynomial shot budgets and coarse parameter grids defined by the problem sizes.</description>

      <title>Berezin-Toeplitz quantization revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a sequel to a series of works, where we studied the local aspects of the asymptotic action of deformation quantization on the Hilbert spaces $H^0(X, L^{\otimes k})$ of geometric quantization for a K\"ahler manifold $X$; here $L$ is a pre-quantum line bundle on $X$. In this paper, we consider the Berezin-Toeplitz deformation quantization and obtain the following global results concerning the asymptotic action of Berezin-Toeplitz operators on $H^0(X, L^{\otimes k})$:
  (1). For a general smooth function $f \in C^\infty(X)$, we prove that the Berezin-Toeplitz operators $T_{f,k}$ are asymptotic to differential operators acting on $H^0(X, L^{\otimes k})$ as $k \to \infty$. An immediate consequence is their asymptotic locality.
  (2). If $f \in C^\infty(X)$ is furthermore the symbol of a level $k$ quantizable function, then we prove that the associated Berezin-Toeplitz operators $T_{f,k}$ are all holomorphic differential operators. Conversely, Berezin-Toeplitz operators that are holomorphic differential operators all arise in this way. This gives a complete characterization of when Berezin-Toeplitz operators are holomorphic differential operators.
  To prove these results, we construct higher order analgoues of Kostant-Souriau's pre-quantum differential operators using our Fedosov-type constructions in previous works, establish new orthogonality relations which generalize the classical Tuynman's Lemma, and employ various differential-geometric and analytic technqiues such as H\"ormander's estimates.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates with Rabi frequency (II): The De Giorgi conjecture for the nonlocal problem in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ or $\mathbb{R}^{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this series of papers, we investigate coupled systems arising in the study of two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, and we establish classification results for solutions of De Giorgi conjecture type.
  In the present (second) paper of the series, we focus on the nonlocal problem of the form
  \begin{equation*}
  \left\{\begin{aligned}
  (-\Delta)^{s}u+u(u^{2}+v^{2}-1)+v(\alpha uv-\omega)=0,
  (-\Delta)^{s}v+v(u^{2}+v^{2}-1)+u(\alpha uv-\omega)=0,
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
  \end{equation*}
  which models the stationary states of Rabi-coupled condensates with inter- and intra-species interactions.
  We prove that for $\frac{1}{2}\le s&lt;1$, any positive entire solution $(u,v)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ satisfying the monotonicity condition $\partial_{x_3}u&gt;0&gt;\partial_{x_3}v$ must be one-dimensional. Moreover, when $0&lt;s&lt;\frac{1}{2}$, the same conclusion holds for monotone solutions in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
  Our work generalizes classical De Giorgi-type theorems to a new class of nonlocal coupled systems and, to the best of our knowledge, presents the first Liouville-type classification of monotone solutions for Rabi-coupled fractional Bose-Einstein condensates, with particular emphasis on fractional Gross-Pitaevskii models.</description>

      <title>Distortion of charge distribution due to internal electric fields described by the drift-diffusion semiconductor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the initial value problem for the Debye--Hueckel drift-diffusion equation is studied. This equation was introduced as a model describing plasma behavior and is also known as a simulation model of MOSFET, and so its solution describes charge density. It is well-known that, if the initial density is localized, then the density is adjusted to be radially symmetric due to the linear diffusion. Consequently, the electric field is also governed by a radially symmetric potential, and its effects are expected to act radially symmetrically. The main result express the electric field and its effect on the charge density as concrete functions. It also denotes the distortion of symmetry and the shift of scale on the density due to the internal electric field. Unlike the historical paper via Escobedo and Zuazua and the followers, the main result captures stronger nonlinearity than the logarithmic shift.</description>

      <title>Local wellposedness of the 2d Anderson-Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the local wellposedness of a general Gross-Pitaevskii equation with rough potential is proven in dimension 2. The class of rough potentials we are considering is large enough to contain the spatial white noise and thus a renormalization procedure may be needed. We first construct the associated Schr\"odinger operator from its quadratic form. Then, the regularity of elements of its domain is explored. This allows to use a paracontrolled approach in order to obtain Strichartz estimates, which are used to prove the local wellposedness by a contraction argument.</description>

      <title>The incompressible limit of the Euler-Maxwell two-fluid system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this text, the filtering unitary group method developed, among others, by S. Schochet is adapted to prove the existence and well-posedness of modulation equations describing the incompressible limit of the Euler-Maxwell Two-Fluid (EMTF) system. The reduced model captures up to the ion and electron skin depths the long-time behavior of solutions near a constant neutral background with non-zero densities. In the prepared case, the solutions of our asymptotic equations are in one-to-one correspondence with those of incompressible eXtended MagnetoHyDrodynamics (XMHD), hence providing a new basis to the XMHD framework which is currently being studied by physicists through Hamiltonian methods, see P.J. Morrison et al. By this way, we can give a simplified access to many plasma phenomena such as (a form of two-fluid) turbulence, Hall and inertial effects, as well as collisionless magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limitations of QAOA on Constrained Problems and a Route to Exponential Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fundamental limitations of the generic Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on constrained problems where valid solutions form a low dimensional manifold inside the Boolean hypercube, and we present a provable route to exponential improvements via constraint embedding. Focusing on permutation constrained objectives, we show that the standard generic QAOA ansatz, with a transverse field mixer and diagonal r local cost, faces an intrinsic feasibility bottleneck: even after angle optimization, circuits whose depth grows at most linearly with n cannot raise the total probability mass on the feasible manifold much above the uniform baseline suppressed by the size of the full Hilber space. Against this envelope we introduce a minimal constraint enhanced kernel (CE QAOA) that operates directly inside a product one hot subspace and mixes with a block local XY Hamiltonian. For permutation constrained problems, we prove an angle robust, depth matched exponential enhancement where the ratio between the feasible mass from CE QAOA and generic QAOA grows exponentially in $n^2$ for all depths up to a linear fraction of n, under a mild polynomial growth condition on the interaction hypergraph. Thanks to the problem algorithm co design in the kernel construction, the techniques and guarantees extend beyond permutations to a broad class of NP-Hard constrained optimization problems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the wave operator $\square_g$ on non-trapping (at all energies) even asymptotically de Sitter spaces. We construct a Feynman operator on the conformal extension of asymptotically de Sitter spaces and give a proof of uniform microlocal estimates for the Feynman operator in this setting. This enables the study of the Lorentzian "spectral" zeta functions in asymptotically de Sitter and the construction of a "spectral" action of the Feynman propagator.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and correlations between local observables in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of quantum field entanglement in de Sitter space based on the von Neumann entropy of local patches have concluded that curvature enhances entanglement between regions and their complements. Similar conclusions about entanglement enhancement have been reached in analyses of Fourier modes in the cosmological patch of de Sitter space. We challenge this interpretation by adopting a fully local approach: examining entanglement between pairs of field modes compactly supported within de Sitter's cosmological patch. Our approach is formulated in terms of the properties of a metric tensor and an associated complex structure induced by the Bunch-Davies vacuum on the classical phase space. We find that increasing curvature increases correlations between local modes but, somewhat counterintuitively, decreases their entanglement. Our methods allow us to characterize how entanglement is spatially distributed, revealing that a cosmological constant, even if tiny, qualitatively alters the vacuum's entanglement structure. We show that our results are compatible with previous entropy-based studies when properly interpreted. Our findings have implications for entanglement between observables generated during cosmic inflation.</description>

      <title>Hadamard states for decomposable Green-hyperbolic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hadamard states were originally introduced for quantised Klein-Gordon fields and occupy a central position in the theory of quantum fields on curved spacetimes. Subsequently they have been developed for other linear theories, such as the Dirac, Proca and Maxwell fields, but the particular features of each require slightly different treatments.
  The first aim of this paper is to give a generalised definition of Hadamard states for linear bosonic and fermionic theories encompassing a range of theories that are described by Green-hyperbolic operators with 'decomposable' Pauli-Jordan propagators, including theories whose bicharacteristic curves are not necessarily determined by the spacetime metric. The new definition reduces to previous definitions for normally hyperbolic and Dirac-type operators. We develop the theory of Hadamard states in detail, showing that our definition propagates under the equation of motion, and is also stable under pullbacks and suitable pushforwards. There is an equivalent formulation in terms of Hilbert space valued distributions, and the generalised Hadamard condition on 2-point functions constrains the singular behaviour of all $n$-point functions. For locally covariant theories, the Hadamard states form a covariant state space. It is also shown how Hadamard states may be combined through tensor products or reduced by partial tracing while preserving the Hadamard property. As a particular application it is shown that state updates resulting from nonselective measurements preserve the Hadamard condition.
  The treatment we give was partly inspired by a recent work of Moretti, Murro and Volpe (MMV) on the neutral Proca field.

      <title>Linear viscoelasticity: Mechanics, analysis and approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this review is to highlight the connection between well-established physical and mathematical principles as they pertain to the theory of linear viscoelasticity. We begin by examining the physical foundations of Boltzmann and Volterra's hereditary law formalism, and how those principles restrict the form of the hereditary law. We then turn to questions of material stability and continuous dependence on the stress history within the framework of the Lax-Milgram theorem, which we find to set forth rigorous and unequivocal conditions for the well-posedness of the linear viscoelastic problem. The outcome of this analysis is remarkable in that it gives precise meaning to fundamental physical properties such as fading memory. Finally, we turn to the question of best representation of viscoelastic materials by finite-rank hereditary operators or, equivalently, by a finite set of history or internal variables. We note that the theory of Hilbert-Schmidt operators and $N$-widths supplies the answer to the question.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of a probability measure near the bottom of its support in terms of time averaged quotients of its Laplace transform. We discuss how our results are connected to both rank-one perturbation theory as well as renewal theory. We further apply our results in order to derive criteria for the existence and non-existence of ground states for a finite dimensional quantum system coupled to a bosonic field.</description>

      <title>Toward Super-polynomial Quantum Speedup of Equivariant Quantum Algorithms with SU($d$) Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.07250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework of the equivariant convolutional quantum algorithms which is tailored for a number of machine-learning tasks on physical systems with arbitrary SU$(d)$ symmetries. It allows us to enhance a natural model of quantum computation -- permutational quantum computing (PQC) -- and define a more powerful model: PQC+. While PQC was shown to be efficiently classically simulatable, we exhibit a problem which can be efficiently solved on PQC+ machine, whereas no classical polynomial time algorithm is known; thus providing evidence against PQC+ being classically simulatable. We further discuss practical quantum machine learning algorithms which can be carried out in the paradigm of PQC+.</description>

      <title>BPS algebras and generalised Kac-Moody algebras from 2-Calabi-Yau categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12592v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the structure of the BPS algebra of 2-Calabi-Yau Abelian categories for which the stack of objects admits a good moduli space. We prove that this algebra is isomorphic to the positive part of the enveloping algebra of a generalised Kac-Moody Lie algebra generated by the intersection cohomology of certain connected components (corresponding to roots) of the good moduli space. Some major examples include the BPS algebras of (1) the category of semistable coherent sheaves of given slope on a K3 surface or, more generally, quasiprojective symplectic surface, (2) semistable Higgs bundles on a smooth projective curve, (3) preprojective algebras of quivers, (4) multiplicative preprojective algebras and (5) fundamental groups of (quiver) Riemann surfaces. We define the BPS Lie algebras of 2-Calabi-Yau categories and prove that they coincide with the ones obtained by dimensional reduction from the critical cohomological Hall algebra in the case in which the 2-Calabi-Yau category is the category of representations of a preprojective algebra. Consequences include (1) A proof in full generality of the Bozec-Schiffmann positivity conjecture for absolutely cuspidal polynomials, a strengthening of the Kac positivity conjecture (2) A proof of the cohomological integrality conjecture for the category of semistable coherent sheaves on local K3 surfaces (3) A description of the cohomology (in all degrees) of Nakajima quiver varieties as direct sums of irreducible lowest weight representations over the BPS Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Near invariance of quasi-energy spectrum of Floquet Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral analysis of the unitary monodromy operator, associated with a time-periodically (paramatrically) forced Schrodinger equation, is a question of longstanding interest. Here, we consider this question for Hamiltonians of the form
  $$H^{\varepsilon}(t)=H^0 + \varepsilon^a W(\varepsilon^a t, -i\nabla)\, ,$$ where $H^0$ is an unperturbed autonomous Hamiltonian, $a\geq 1$, and $W(T,\cdot)$ has a period of $T_{\rm per} &gt;0$. In particular, in the small $\varepsilon&gt;0$ regime, we seek a comparison between the spectral properties of the monodromy operator, the one-period flow map associated with the $H^\varepsilon(t)$ dynamics, and that of the autonomous (unforced) flow, $\exp[-iH^0 T_{\rm per} \varepsilon ^{-a}]$. We consider $H^0$ which is spatially periodic on $\mathbb{R} ^n$ with respect to a lattice. Using the decomposition of $H^0$ and $H^\varepsilon(t)$ into their actions on spaces (Floquet-Bloch fibers) of pseudo-periodic functions, we establish a near spectral-invariance property for the monodromy operator, when acting data which are $\varepsilon$-localized in energy and quasi-momentum. Our analysis requires the following steps: (i) spectrally-localized data are approximated by {\it band-limited (Floquet-Bloch) wavepackets}; (ii) the envelope dynamics of such wavepackets is well approximated by an effective (homogenized) PDE, and (iii) an exact invariance property for band-limited Floquet-Bloch wavepackets, which follows from the effective dynamics. We apply our general results to a number of periodic Hamiltonians, $H^0$, of interest in the study of photonic and quantum materials.</description>

      <title>On the non-uniqueness of the energy-momentum and spin currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02127v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic energy-momentum and spin densities of relativistic spin hydrodynamics are obtained from the ensemble average of their respective microscopic definitions (quantum operators). These microscopic definitions suffer from ambiguities, meaning that one may obtain different forms of symmetric energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor through pseudogauge transformations (or, in other words, Belinfante improvement procedure). However, this ambiguity may be fixed if we obtain these currents using Noether's second theorem instead of widely used Noether's first theorem. The second theorem fixes the super-potential determined by local symmetry, thereby selecting a unique physically consistent pseudogauge. In this article, we use Noether's second theorem to derive energy-momentum and spin currents without the need of pseudogauge transformations for free Dirac massive particles with spin one-half.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the many-body Hamiltonian describing a mobile impurity immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Using exact unitary transformations and rigorous error estimates, we show the validity of the Bogoliubov-Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian for the Bose polaron in the regime of moderately strong, repulsive interactions with a dilute BEC. Moreover, we calculate analytically the universal logarithmic correction to the ground state energy that arises from an impurity mediated phonon-phonon interaction.</description>

Abstract: Lecture notes prepared for the Les Houches school "Quantum Geometry: Mathematical Methods for Gravity, Gauge Theories and Non-Perturbative Physics" that took place during the summer 2024. We cover the techniques to perform the exact gravitational path integral of two-dimensional dilaton-gravity, and supergravity, over spacetimes with arbitrary topology, with an application to black holes. We discuss the connection with random matrix models and moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces briefly, since those concepts were covered in other lectures of the school.</description>

      <title>Energy field of critical Ising model and examples of singular fields in QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to prove singularity of three natural fields in QFT with respect to their natural base measure. The fields we consider are the following ones:
  (1) The near-critical limit of the $2d$ Ising model (in the $\beta$-direction) is locally singular w.r.t the critical scaling limit of $2d$ Ising. (N.B. In the $h$-direction it is not locally singular).
  (2) The $2d$ Hierarchical Sine-Gordon field is singular w.r.t the $2d$ hierarchical Gaussian Free Field for all $\beta\in[\beta_{L^2}, \beta_{BKT})$.
  (3) The Hierarchical $\Phi^4_3$ field is singular w.r.t the $3d$ hierarchical GFF.
  Item (1) gives the first strong indication that the energy field of critical $2d$ Ising model does not exist as a random Schwarz distribution on the plane. Item (2) has been proved to be singular for the non-hierarchical $2d$ Sine-Gordon sufficiently far from the BKT point in [GM24] while item (3) is proved to be singular for the non-hierarchical $3d$ $\Phi^4_3$ field in [BG21, OOT21, HKN24].
  We believe our way to detect a singular behaviour at all scales is very much down to earth and may be applicable in all settings where one has a good enough control on the so-called effective potentials.</description>

      <title>A stringy dispersion relation for field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a local, crossing symmetric dispersion relation (CSDR) for 2-2 scattering amplitudes with a parametric ambiguity motivated by string theory. Various limits of the parameter lead to the fixed-t, fixed-s, and other known CSDRs. We also present formulae for higher-subtracted cases. Several examples are discussed for illustration. In particular, for the Veneziano and the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitudes, we derive parametric series representations which manifest poles in all channels and converge everywhere. We then discuss applications of our formalism for bootstrapping weakly-coupled gravitational EFTs. We demonstrate that even in the presence of the graviton pole, one can derive bounds on the Wilson coefficients while working in the forward limit, with the parameter acting as the IR regulator instead. Finally, we derive series representations for multi-variable, totally symmetric generalisations of the Veneziano and Virasoro-Shapiro amplitudes that manifest poles in all the variables. This is a first step towards dispersion relations for n-particle scattering amplitudes.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly construct a class of multivariate generalized hypergeometric series which is conjectured in our previous paper [Alkalaev &amp; Mandrygin 2025] to calculate multipoint one-loop parametric conformal integrals in $D$ dimensions. Our approach is based on a simple diagrammatic algorithm which systematically builds both arguments and series coefficients in terms of a convex polygon which is part of the Baxter lattice. The examples of the box, pentagon, and hexagon integrals are considered in detail.</description>

      <title>Commutativity of operator algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We call an operator algebra A {\em reversible} if A with reversed multiplication is also an abstract operator algebra (in the modern operator space sense). This class of operator algebras is intimately related to the {\em symmetric operator algebras}: the subalgebras of B(H) on which the transpose map is a complete isometry. In previous work we studied the unital case, where reversibility is equivalent to commutativity. We give many sufficient conditions under which a nonunital reversible or symmetric operator algebra is commutative. We also give many complementary results of independent interest, and solve a few open questions from previous papers. Not every reversible or symmetric operator algebra is commutative, however we show that they all are 3-commutative. That is, order does not matter in the product of three or more elements from A. The proof of this relies on a technical analysis involving the injective envelope. Indeed nonunital algebras are often enormously more complicated than unital ones in regard to the topics we consider. On the positive side, our considerations raise very many questions even for low dimensional matrix algebras, some of which are of a computational nature and might be suitable for undergraduate research. The canonical anticommutation relations from mathematical physics play a significant role.</description>

      <title>On the supra-linear storage in dense networks of grid and place cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Place-cell networks, typically forced to pairwise synaptic interactions, are widely studied as models of cognitive maps: such models, however, share a severely limited storage capacity, scaling linearly with network size and with a very small critical storage. This limitation is a challenge for navigation in 3-dimensional space because, oversimplifying, if encoding motion along a one-dimensional trajectory embedded in 2-dimensions requires $O(K)$ patterns (interpreted as bins), extending this to a 2-dimensional manifold embedded in a 3-dimensional space -- yet preserving the same resolution -- requires roughly $O(K^2)$ patterns, namely a supra-linear amount of patterns. In these regards, dense Hebbian architectures, where higher-order neural assemblies mediate memory retrieval, display much larger capacities and are increasingly recognized as biologically plausible, but have never linked to place cells so far. Here we propose a minimal two-layer model, with place cells building a layer and leaving the other layer populated by neural units that account for the internal representations (so to qualitatively resemble grid cells in the MEC of mammals): crucially, by assuming that each place cell interacts with pairs of grid cells, we show how such a model is formally equivalent to a dense Battaglia-Treves-like Hebbian network of grid cells only endowed with four-body interactions. By studying its emergent computational properties by means of statistical mechanics of disordered systems, we prove -- analytically -- that such effective higher-order assemblies (constructed under the guise of biological plausibility) can support supra-linear storage of continuous attractors; furthermore, we prove -- numerically -- that the present neural network is capable of recognition and navigation on general surfaces embedded in a 3-dimensional space.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Formation of Apparent Horizons due to Boundary Effect in Vacuum Einstein Gravity</title>

Abstract: We prove that an apparent horizon can form as a result of Einsteinian evolution in pure vacuum spacetime starting from regular initial data free of apparent horizons due to pure boundary effects. We adapt a Cauchy-double-null framework and use the boundary generalized mean curvature condition for the existence of an interior apparent horizon imposed by the author S-T Yau in \cite{yau}. In particular, we prove that the condition of \cite{yau} can be met dynamically starting from a configuration that does not verify the same through a focusing mechanism. This is the first part of a two-part sequence, and in the sequel, we will focus on explicitly constructing the Cauchy data.</description>
