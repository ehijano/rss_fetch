      <title>Skands and coskands (The non-founded set theory with individuals and its model in the Field of all Conway numbers)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basic one in this work is the axiomatic set theory $NBG$ (von Neumann-Bernays-G{\"o}del), which is a first-order theory with its own axioms, including in particular the axiom of choice ${\bf AC}$ and the axiom of regularity ${\bf RA}$. The universal class ${\bf V}$ of all sets in this theory exactly coincides with the class of all founded sets, i.e., such $X\in{\bf V}$ that {\it does not exist} an infinitely descending $\in$-sequence $X\ni X_1\ni X_2\ni...\ni X_n\ni...$ of sets $X_n$, $n=1,2,3,...\,\,$. In the first part of the paper, a new concept of {\it skand} is introduced -- a random aggregate, or \grqq decreasing\grqq\, tuple composed of founded sets, e.g., $X=\{1,\{2,\{3,\{...\,\,\,...\}\}\}\}$, and the theory of $NBG^-=NBG-{\bf RA}$, i.e., the theory of $NBG$ without the axiom of regularity ${\bf RA}$, to which is added the new axiom ${\bf SEA}$ of the existence of infinite-length skands and the pseudo-founding axiom ${\bf PFA}$. These new axioms are a negation of the axiom of regularity and are thus less restrictive than the axiom of regularity ${\bf RA}$ in the sense that they admit the existence of non-founded sets, and the axiom of regularity excludes the existence of such sets. At the same time of course the axiom of extensionality ${\bf EA}$ is replaced by a more accurate axiom of extensionality ${\bf EEA}$, since it takes into account the equality of new objects. In the second part of the paper, a new concept of {\it coskand} is introduced, which is dual to a notion of skand and is a random aggregate, or \grqq increasing\grqq\, tuple composed of founded sets and the theory of $NBG$ and actually is a theory $NBG[\cal U]$ with individuals as limiting coskands, e.g., $X=...\{3,\{2,\{1,\{0\}\}\}\}...\,\,$.</description>

      <title>Extending Fubini Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C\subseteq M$ be stably embedded in a structure $\cM=(M;\dots)$. We consider {\em Fubini measures} on the subcategory $\Def(C)$ of the category $\Def(\cM)$ of definable sets in $\cM$, with ``Fubini" signaling good behaviour in definable families. We show that such a Fubini measure extends uniquely to the larger subcategory of $\Def(\cM)$ whose objects are the sets that are ``fiberable over $C$". In cases of interest ``fiberable over $C$" coincides with ``co-analyzable relative to $C$." This applies in particular to the differential field $\T$ of transseries with $C=\R$, and to differentially closed fields with constant field $C$.</description>

      <title>More on Goldstern's principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of the paper [Got25]. The main result is that the Hausdorff measure version of Goldstern's principle for $\boldsymbol{\Pi}^1_1$ sets fails in $L$, despite the fact that the Lebesgue measure version is true. Other various results regarding Goldstern's principle are established.</description>

      <title>MSO logic of the real order with the set quantifier ranging over Borel sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A celebrated 1969 theorem of Michael Rabin is that the MSO theory of the real order where the monadic quantifier is allowed only to range over the sets of rational numbers, is decidable. In 1975 Saharon Shelah proved that if the monadic quantifier is allowed to range over all subsets of the reals, the resulting MSO theory is undecidable. He asked what happens when we allow the monadic quantifier to range over the Borel subsets of the reals. We answer that question in the affirmative. Namely, the MSO theory of the real order where the set quantifier is allowed to range over the Borel sets, is decidable.</description>

      <title>Encoding higher-order argumentation frameworks with supports to propositional logic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Argumentation frameworks ($AF$s) have been extensively developed, but existing higher-order bipolar $AF$s suffer from critical limitations: attackers and supporters are restricted to arguments, multi-valued and fuzzy semantics lack unified generalization, and encodings often rely on complex logics with poor interoperability. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a higher-order argumentation framework with supports ($HAFS$), which explicitly allows attacks and supports to act as both targets and sources of interactions. We define a suite of semantics for $HAFS$s, including extension-based semantics, adjacent complete labelling semantics (a 3-valued semantics), and numerical equational semantics ([0,1]-valued semantics). Furthermore, we develop a normal encoding methodology to translate $HAFS$s into propositional logic systems ($\mathcal{PLS}$s): $HAFS$s under complete labelling semantics are encoded into {\L}ukasiewicz's three-valued propositional logic ($\mathcal{PL}_3^L$), and those under equational semantics are encoded into fuzzy $\mathcal{PLS}$s ($\mathcal{PL}_{[0,1]}$) such as G\"odel and Product fuzzy logics. We prove model equivalence between $HAFS$s and their encoded logical formulas, establishing the logical foundation of $HAFS$ semantics. Additionally, we investigate the relationships between 3-valued complete semantics and fuzzy equational semantics, showing that models of fuzzy encoded semantics can be transformed into complete semantics models via ternarization, and vice versa for specific t-norms. This work advances the formalization and logical encoding of higher-order bipolar argumentation, enabling seamless integration with lightweight computational solvers and uniform handling of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Many-valued coalgebraic dynamic logics: Safety and strong completeness via reducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a coalgebraic framework for studying generalisations of dynamic modal logics such as PDL and game logic in which both the propositions and the semantic structures can take values in an algebra $\mathbf{A}$ of truth-degrees. More precisely, we work with coalgebraic modal logic via $\mathbf{A}$-valued predicate liftings where $\mathbf{A}$ is a $\mathsf{FL}_{\mathrm{ew}}$-algebra, and interpret actions (abstracting programs and games) as $\mathsf{F}$-coalgebras where the functor $\mathsf{F}$ represents some type of $\mathbf{A}$-weighted system. We also allow combinations of crisp propositions with $\mathbf{A}$-weighted systems and vice versa. We introduce coalgebra operations and tests, with a focus on operations that are reducible in the sense that modalities for composed actions can be reduced to compositions of modalities for the constituent actions. We prove that reducible operations are safe for bisimulation and behavioural equivalence, and prove a general strong completeness result, from which we obtain new strong completeness results for $2$-valued iteration-free PDL with $\mathbf{A}$-valued accessibility relations when $\mathbf{A}$ is a finite chain, and for many-valued iteration-free game logic with many-valued strategies based on finite Lukasiewicz logic.</description>

      <title>Modelling of logical systems by means of their fragments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the algorithmic complexity of non-classical logics, focusing on superintuitionistic and modal systems. It is shown that propositional logics are usually polynomial-time reducible to their fragments with at most two variables (often to the one-variable or even variable-free fragments). Also, it is proved that predicate logics are usually reducible to their fragments with one or two unary predicate letters and two or three individual variables. The work describes conditions sufficient for such reductions and provides examples where they fail, establishing non-reducibility in those cases. Furthermore, the work provides new complexity bounds for several logics, results on Kripke-incompleteness of predicate calculi, and analogues of the classical theorems of Church and Trakhtenbrot for the logic of quasiary predicates.</description>

      <title>All spaces of countable spread can be small</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main result of this paper is the proof of the simultaneous consistency, modulo a weakly compact cardinal, of the equality $2^{&lt; \mathfrak{c}} = \mathfrak{c}$ with the following property (*) of partitions of pairs of $\mathfrak{c}$:
  \smallskip
  (*) For any coloring (or partition) $k : [\mathfrak{c}]^2 \rightarrow 2$ either there is a homogeneous set of size $\mathfrak{c}$ in color $0$ or there is a set $S \in [\mathfrak{c}]^\mathfrak{c}$ such that for every countable $A \subset S$ there is $\beta \in \mathfrak{c}$ for which $A \subset \beta$ and $k(\{\alpha, \beta\}) = 1$ for all $\alpha \in A$.
  \smallskip
  (*) plus $2^{&lt; \mathfrak{c}} = \mathfrak{c}$ together then imply that for every topological space $X$ of countable
  spread, i.e. not containing any uncountable discrete subset,
  $|X| \le \mathfrak{c}$ if it is
  Hausdorff and
  $o(X) = \mathfrak c$ if it is also infinite and regular. Here $o(X)$ denotes the number of all open subsets of $X$.</description>

      <title>Locally Integral Involutive PO-Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every locally integral involutive partially ordered semigroup (ipo-semigroup) $\mathbf A = (A,\le, \cdot, \sim,-)$, and in particular every locally integral involutive semiring, decomposes in a unique way into a family $\{\mathbf A_p : p\in A^+\}$ of integral ipo-monoids, which we call its integral components. In the semiring case, the integral components are unital semirings. Moreover, we show that there is a family of monoid homomorphisms $\Phi = \{\varphi_{pq}: \mathbf A_p\to \mathbf A_q : p\le q\}$, indexed over the positive cone $(A^+,\le)$, so that the structure of $\mathbf A$ can be recovered as a glueing $\int_\Phi \mathbf A_p$ of its integral components along $\Phi$. Reciprocally, we give necessary and sufficient conditions so that the P{\l}onka sum of any family of integral ipo-monoids $\{\mathbf A_p : p\in D\}$, indexed over a join-semilattice $(D,\lor)$ along a family of monoid homomorphisms $\Phi$ is an ipo-semigroup.</description>

      <title>Borel graphable equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of analytic equivalence relations which are Borel graphable, i.e. which can be realized as the connectedness relation of a Borel graph. Our main focus is the question of which analytic equivalence relations are Borel graphable. First, we study an equivalence relation arising from the theory of countable admissible ordinals and show that it is Borel graphable if and only if there is a non-constructible real. As a corollary of the proof, we construct an analytic equivalence relation which is (provably in ZFC) not Borel graphable and an effectively analytic equivalence relation which is Borel graphable but not effectively Borel graphable. Next, we study analytic equivalence relations given by the isomorphism relation for some class of countable structures. We show that all such equivalence relations are Borel graphable, which implies that for every Borel action of $S_\infty$, the associated orbit equivalence relation is Borel graphable. This leads us to study the class of Polish groups whose Borel actions always give rise to Borel graphable orbit equivalence relations; we refer to such groups as graphic groups. We show that besides $S_\infty$, the class of graphic groups includes all connected Polish groups and is closed under countable products. We finish by studying structural properties of the class of Borel graphable analytic equivalence relations and by considering two variations on Borel graphability: a generalization with hypegraphs instead of graphs and an analogue of Borel graphability in the setting of computably enumerable equivalence relations.</description>

      <title>Nonamenable subforests of multi-ended quasi-pmp graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07908v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the a.e. nonamenability of locally finite quasi-pmp Borel graphs whose every component admits at least three nonvanishing ends with respect to the underlying Radon--Nikodym cocycle. We witness their nonamenability by constructing Borel subforests with at least three nonvanishing ends per component, and then applying Tserunyan and Tucker-Drob's recent characterization of amenability for acyclic quasi-pmp Borel graphs. Our main technique is a weighted cycle-cutting algorithm, which yields a weight-maximal spanning forest. We also introduce a random version of this forest, which generalizes the Free Minimal Spanning Forest, to capture nonunimodularity in the context of percolation theory.</description>
