      <title>Coupled dynamics of chiral waves and gyroscopic systems with applications to atmospheric phenomena</title>

Abstract: The present paper introduces the notion of chiral gravitational elastic waves and explores their connections to equatorial and planetary waves. The analysis of the gravity-induced waveforms in gyroscopic systems composed of gyropendulums provides important insights into the dynamics of waves in the vicinity of the equatorial belt. We show that the direction of motion of the chiral waveforms can be controlled by choosing the orientation of the spinners. The presence of gravity is shown to affect the stop band frequencies for such structures, providing an additional control parameter for the chiral waveguides. The effect of the Coriolis force is demonstrated for chiral continuum models describing waves in the equatorial region and the polar regions on a rotating sphere. Additional asymptotic features of equatorial waves are presented in this paper. We show that the shape of a ridge of a polar vortex can be approximated by the governing equations of a gyropendulum. The theoretical work is accompanied by illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Quantum Neural Networks for Cloud Cover Parameterizations in Climate Models</title>

Abstract: Long-term climate projections require running global Earth system models on timescales of hundreds of years and have relatively coarse resolution (from 40 to 160 km in the horizontal) due to their high computational costs. Unresolved subgrid-scale processes, such as clouds, are described in a semi-empirical manner by so called parameterizations, which are a major source of uncertainty in climate projections. Machine learning models trained on short high-resolution climate simulations are promising candidates to replace conventional parameterizations. In this work, we explore the potential of quantum machine learning (QML), and in particular quantum neural networks (QNNs), to develop cloud cover parameterizations. QNNs differ from their classical counterparts, and their potentially high expressivity turns them into promising tools for accurate data-driven schemes to be used in climate models. We perform an extensive comparative analysis between several QNNs and classical neural networks (NNs), by training both ansatzes on data coming from high-resolution simulations with the ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic weather and climate model (ICON). Our results show that the overall performance of the investigated QNNs is comparable to that of classical NNs of similar size, i.e., with the same number of trainable parameters, with both ansatzes outperforming standard parameterizations used in climate models. Our study includes an analysis of the generalization ability of the models as well as the geometrical properties of their optimization landscape. We also investigate the effects of finite sampling noise, and show that the training and the predictions of the QNNs are stable even in this noisy setting. These results demonstrate the applicability of QML to learn meaningful patterns in climate data, and are thus relevant for a broad range of problems within the climate modeling community.</description>

      <title>A fluctuation-dissipation theorem perspective on radiative responses to temperature perturbations</title>

Abstract: Radiative forcing drives warming in the Earth system, leading to changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and associated radiative feedbacks. The link between changes in the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) net radiative flux and SST patterns, known as the "pattern effect", is typically diagnosed by studying the response of atmosphere-only models to SST perturbations. In this work, we diagnose the pattern effect through response theory, by performing idealized warming perturbation experiments from unperturbed data alone. First, by studying the response at short time scales, where the response is dominated by atmospheric variability, we recover results that agree with the literature. Second, by extending the framework to longer time scales, we capture coupled interactions between the slow ocean component and the atmosphere, yielding a novel "sensitivity map" quantifying the response of the net radiative flux to SST perturbations in the coupled system. Here, feedbacks are captured by a spatiotemporal response operator, rather than time-independent maps as in traditional studies. Both formulations skillfully reconstruct changes in externally forced simulations and provide practical strategies for climate studies. The key distinction lies in their perspectives on climate feedbacks. The first formulation, closely aligned with prediction tasks, follows the traditional view in which slow variables, such as SSTs, exert a one-way influence on fast variables. The second formulation broadens this perspective by incorporating spatiotemporal interactions across state variables. This alternative approach explores how localized SST perturbations can alter the coupled dynamics, leading to temperature changes in remote areas and further impacting the radiative fluxes at later times.</description>
