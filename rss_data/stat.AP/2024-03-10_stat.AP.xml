      <title>The SIDO Performance Model for League of Legends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: League of Legends (LoL) has been a dominant esport for a decade, yet the inherent complexity of the game has stymied the creation of analytical measures of player skill and performance. Current industry standards are limited to easy-to-procure individual player statistics that are incomplete and lacking context as they do not take into account teamplay or game state. We present a unified performance model for League of Legends which blends together measures of a player's contribution within the context of their team, insights from traditional sports metrics such as the Plus-Minus model, and the intricacies of LoL as a complex team invasion sport. Using hierarchical Bayesian models, we outline the use of gold and damage dealt as a measure of skill, detailing players' impact on their own-, their allies'- and their enemies' statistics throughout the course of the game. Our results showcase the model's increased efficacy in separating professional players when compared to a Plus-Minus model and to current esports industry standards, while metric quality is rigorously assessed for discrimination, independence, and stability. Readers might also find additional qualitative analytics which explore champion proficiency and the impact of collaborative team-play. Future work is proposed to refine and expand the SIDO performance model, offering a comprehensive framework for esports analytics in team performance management, scouting and research realms.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Hierarchical Probabilistic Forecasting of Intraday Electricity Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first study of Bayesian forecasting of electricity prices traded on the German continuous intraday market which fully incorporates parameter uncertainty. Our target variable is the IDFull price index, forecasts are given in terms of posterior predictive distributions. For validation we use the exceedingly volatile electricity prices of 2022, which have hardly been the subject of forecasting studies before. As a benchmark model, we use all available intraday transactions at the time of forecast creation to compute a current value for the IDFull. According to the weak-form efficiency hypothesis, it would not be possible to significantly improve this benchmark built from last price information. We do, however, observe statistically significant improvement in terms of both point measures and probability scores. Finally, we challenge the declared gold standard of using LASSO for feature selection in electricity price forecasting by presenting strong statistical evidence that Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) leads to better forecasting performance.</description>

      <title>Not all tickets are equal and we know it: Guiding pruning with domain-specific knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural structure learning is of paramount importance for scientific discovery and interpretability. Yet, contemporary pruning algorithms that focus on computational resource efficiency face algorithmic barriers to select a meaningful model that aligns with domain expertise. To mitigate this challenge, we propose DASH, which guides pruning by available domain-specific structural information. In the context of learning dynamic gene regulatory network models, we show that DASH combined with existing general knowledge on interaction partners provides data-specific insights aligned with biology. For this task, we show on synthetic data with ground truth information and two real world applications the effectiveness of DASH, which outperforms competing methods by a large margin and provides more meaningful biological insights. Our work shows that domain specific structural information bears the potential to improve model-derived scientific insights.</description>

      <title>Estimating time-varying exposure effects through continuous-time modelling in Mendelian randomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mendelian randomization is an instrumental variable method that utilizes genetic information to investigate the causal effect of a modifiable exposure on an outcome. In most cases, the exposure changes over time. Understanding the time-varying causal effect of the exposure can yield detailed insights into mechanistic effects and the potential impact of public health interventions. Recently, a growing number of Mendelian randomization studies have attempted to explore time-varying causal effects. However, the proposed approaches oversimplify temporal information and rely on overly restrictive structural assumptions, limiting their reliability in addressing time-varying causal problems. This paper considers a novel approach to estimate time-varying effects through continuous-time modelling by combining functional principal component analysis and weak-instrument-robust techniques. Our method effectively utilizes available data without making strong structural assumptions and can be applied in general settings where the exposure measurements occur at different timepoints for different individuals. We demonstrate through simulations that our proposed method performs well in estimating time-varying effects and provides reliable inference results when the time-varying effect form is correctly specified. The method could theoretically be used to estimate arbitrarily complex time-varying effects. However, there is a trade-off between model complexity and instrument strength. Estimating complex time-varying effects requires instruments that are unrealistically strong. We illustrate the application of this method in a case study examining the time-varying effects of systolic blood pressure on urea levels.</description>

      <title>Nodal heterogeneity can induce ghost triadic effects in relational event models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.16386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal network data is often encoded as time-stamped interaction events between senders and receivers, such as co-authoring scientific articles or communication via email. A number of relational event frameworks have been proposed to address specific issues raised by complex temporal dependencies. These models attempt to quantify how individual behaviour, endogenous and exogenous factors, as well as interactions with other individuals modify the network dynamics over time. It is often of interest to determine whether changes in the network can be attributed to endogenous mechanisms reflecting natural relational tendencies, such as reciprocity or triadic effects.
  The propensity to form or receive ties can also, at least partially, be related to actor attributes. Nodal heterogeneity in the network is often modelled by including actor-specific or dyadic covariates. However, comprehensively capturing all personality traits is difficult in practice, if not impossible. A failure to account for heterogeneity may confound the substantive effect of key variables of interest. This work shows that failing to account for node level sender and receiver effects can induce ghost triadic effects. We propose a random-effect extension of the relational event model to deal with these problems. We show that it is often effective over more traditional approaches, such as in-degree and out-degree statistics. These results that the violation of the hierarchy principle due to insufficient information about nodal heterogeneity can be resolved by including random effects in the relational event model as a standard.</description>

      <title>Learning tapestries, a statistical learning substrate for open chaotic systems measured with error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of statistical inference for open chaotic systems measured with error is complicated by the interaction of the uncertainty introduced by chaos, and the various sources of random or external variation. Here a method of representing measured data from large open chaotic systems subject to error as collections of threads of plausible pseudo future histories to enable statistical analysis is described. This representation provides asymptotically consistent predictive distributions, for use in developing predictive likelihood methods which: 1. provide a framework for variable selection, 2. provide a framework for Bayesian updating, so for example 4 season ahead predictions learn naturally as the 3rd season ahead is measured. 3. allows examination of conditional scenarios along the future histories for planning purposes. 4. allows the ranking of variable, delay combinations with higher signal to noise ratio.
  The method is tested for learning and variable selection by examining its behavior in predicting 9 years across 4 seasons of climate variables, including local temperature and rainfall measurements at two locations, predicting up to 4 seasons ahead.</description>

      <title>The Expected Sample Allele Frequencies from Populations of Changing Size via Orthogonal Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, discrete and stochastic changes in (effective) population size are incorporated into the spectral representation of a biallelic diffusion process for drift and small mutation rates. A forward algorithm inspired by Hidden-Markov-Model (HMM) literature is used to compute exact sample allele frequency spectra for three demographic scenarios: single changes in (effective) population size, boom-bust dynamics, and stochastic fluctuations in (effective) population size. An approach for fully agnostic demographic inference from these sample allele spectra is explored, and sufficient statistics for step-wise changes in population size are found. Further, convergence behaviours of the polymorphic sample spectra for population size changes on different time scales are examined and discussed within the context of inference of the effective population size. Joint visual assessment of the sample spectra and the temporal coefficients of the spectral decomposition of the forward diffusion process is found to be important in determining departure from equilibrium. Stochastic changes in (effective) population size are shown to shape sample spectra particularly strongly.</description>

      <title>Random matrix statistics and safety rest areas on interstates in the United States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06425v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze physical spacings between locations of safety rest areas on interstates in the United States. We show normalized safety rest area spacings on major interstates exhibit Wigner surmise statistics, which align with the eigenvalue spacings for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble from random matrix theory as well as the one-dimensional gas interactions via the Coulomb potential. We identify economic and geographic regional traits at the state level that exhibit Poissonian statistics, which become more pronounced with increased geographical obstacles in interstate travel. Other regional filters (e.g., historical or political) produced results that did not diverge substantially from the overall Wigner surmise model.</description>

      <title>Mixed Models with Multiple Instance Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting patient features from single-cell data can help identify cellular states implicated in health and disease. Linear models and average cell type expressions are typically favored for this task for their efficiency and robustness, but they overlook the rich cell heterogeneity inherent in single-cell data. To address this gap, we introduce MixMIL, a framework integrating Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), upholding the advantages of linear models while modeling cell state heterogeneity. By leveraging predefined cell embeddings, MixMIL enhances computational efficiency and aligns with recent advancements in single-cell representation learning. Our empirical results reveal that MixMIL outperforms existing MIL models in single-cell datasets, uncovering new associations and elucidating biological mechanisms across different domains.</description>
