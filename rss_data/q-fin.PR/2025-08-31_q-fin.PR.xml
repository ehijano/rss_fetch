      <title>Do Sell-side Analyst Reports Have Investment Value?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper documents novel investment value in analyst report text. Using 1.2 million reports from 2000-2023, I embed narratives with large language models (LLMs) and fit machine learning (ML) forecasts of future long-term returns. Portfolios formed on the report narrative forecasts earn sizable and significant performance that is incremental to analysts' numerical outputs and to a broad set of established factors and characteristic-based predictors. The effect is stronger after adverse news and is amplified for growth stocks with aggressive investment. To open the black box, I apply a Shapley decomposition that attributes portfolio performance to distinct topics. Analysts' strategic outlook contributes the most to portfolio performance, especially forward-looking fundamental assessments. Beyond providing direct evidence that analyst narratives contain value-relevant assessments that diffuse into price over time, this study illustrates how interpretable LLM-plus-ML pipelines can scale and augment human judgment in investment decisions.</description>

      <title>Occupied Processes: Going with the Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07936v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A stochastic process $X$ becomes occupied when it is enlarged with its occupation flow $\mathcal{O}$, which tracks the time spent by the path at each level. Crucially, the occupied process $(\mathcal{O},X)$ enjoys a Markov structure when $X$ is Markov. We develop a novel It\^o calculus for occupied processes that lies midway between Dupire's functional It\^o calculus and the classical version. We derive a surprisingly simple It\^o formula and, through Feynman-Kac, unveil a broad class of path-dependent PDEs where $\mathcal{O}$ plays the role of time. The space variable, given by the current value of $X$, remains finite-dimensional, thereby paving the way for standard elliptic PDE techniques and numerical methods.
  In the financial applications, we demonstrate that occupation flows provide unified Markovian lifts for exotic options and variance instruments, allowing financial institutions to price and manage derivatives books with a single numerical solver. We then explore avenues in financial modeling where volatility is driven by the occupied process. In particular, we propose the local occupied volatility (LOV) model which not only calibrates to European vanilla options but also offers the flexibility to capture stylized facts of volatility and fit other instruments. We also present an extension of forward variance models that leverages the entire forward occupation surface.</description>
