      <title>Fermi surface and magnetic breakdown in PdGa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electronic structure of the chiral semimetal PdGa by means of the de Haas-van Alphen and Shubnikov-de Haas effect. We find that the Fermi surface of PdGa comprises multiple pockets split by spin-orbit coupling. We compare our experimental findings with the band structure calculated ab initio. We demonstrate that the quantum oscillation spectra can be fully understood by considering nodal plane degeneracies at the Brillouin zone boundary and magnetic breakdown between individual Fermi surface pockets. Expanding traditional analysis methods, we explicitly calculate magnetic breakdown frequencies and cyclotron masses while taking into account that extremal breakdown trajectories may reside away from the planes of the single-band orbits. We further analyze high-frequency contributions arising from breakdown trajectories involving multiple revolutions around the Fermi surface which are distinct from conventional harmonic frequencies. Our results highlight the existence of gaps induced by spin-orbit coupling throughout the band structure of PdGa, the relevance of nodal planes on the Brillouin zone boundary, and the necessity for a comprehensive analysis of magnetic breakdown.</description>

      <title>Chiral crossroads in $\mathrm{Ho_3ScO_6}$: a tale of frustration in maple leaf lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of a uniform vector chirality (UVC) magnetic order in the maple-leaf lattice (MLL) realization $\mathrm{Ho_3ScO_6}$ via powder neutron scattering experiments, we investigate the classical antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the maple-leaf lattice. The MLL features three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor couplings, $J_d$, $J_t$, and $J_h$. Previous studies, primarily focused on the case where $J_t = J_h$, identified a staggered vector chirality (SVC) order. Extending beyond this limit, we demonstrate that the SVC order remains stable across a broad parameter regime. However, we also find that the UVC order cannot emerge from the nearest-neighbor model alone. By introducing a further-neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction, $J_x$, we demonstrate that even a weak $J_x$ can cause a first-order phase transition from SVC to UVC order. Using linear spin wave theory, we compute the dynamical spin structure factor, revealing distinct signatures for SVC and UVC orders that can be probed through inelastic neutron scattering experiments. Additionally, we calculate the specific heat, which exhibits qualitative agreement with the experimental data for $\mathrm{Ho_3ScO_6}$. Our findings provide a minimal framework for understanding $\mathrm{Ho_3ScO_6}$ and related MLL systems, like $\mathrm{MgMn_3O_7.3H_2O}$, suggesting avenues for further experimental and theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Probing viscous regimes of spin transport with local magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is now well-established, both theoretically and experimentally, that charge transport of metals can be in a hydrodynamic regime in which frequent electron-electron collisions play a significant role. Meanwhile, recent experiments have demonstrated that it is possible to inject spin currents into magnetic insulator films and explore the DC transport properties of spins. Inspired by these developments, we investigate the effect of viscosity, which naturally arises in the hydrodynamic regime, on DC spin transport. We show that viscosity gives rise to a sharp peak in the spatial profile of the out-of-plane stray magnetic field near the spin current injector. We propose that local magnetometers such as SQUIDs and nitrogen-vacancy centers can detect this viscosity-induced structure in the stray magnetic field. We also discuss the relevance of our results to yittrium iron garnet, a ferromagnetic insulator, and to Kagome spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking in the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of an overlooked symmetry structure in non-collinear antiferromagnets that gives rise to an emergent quantum number for magnons. Focusing on the triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we show that its spin order parameter transforms under an enlarged symmetry group, $\mathrm{SO(3)_L \times SO(3)_R}$, rather than the conventional spin-rotation group $\mathrm{SO(3)}$. Although this larger symmetry is spontaneously broken by the ground state, a residual subgroup survives, leading to conserved Noether charges that, upon quantization, endow magnons with an additional quantum number -- \emph{isospin} -- beyond their energy and momentum. Our results provide a comprehensive framework for understanding symmetry, degeneracy, and quantum numbers in non-collinear magnetic systems, and bridge an unexpected connection between the paradigms of symmetry breaking in non-collinear antiferromagnets and chiral symmetry breaking in particle physics.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Electrical Transport in the Kagome Magnet YbFe$_6$Ge$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) kagome metals offer a unique platform for exploring electron correlation phenomena derived from quantum many-body effects. Here, we report a combined study of electrical magnetotransport and neutron scattering on YbFe$_6$Ge$_6$, where the Fe moments in the 2D kagome layers exhibit an $A$-type collinear antiferromagnetic order below $T_{\rm{N}} \approx 500$ K. Interactions between the Fe ions in the layers and the localized Yb magnetic ions in between reorient the $c$-axis aligned Fe moments to the kagome plane below $T_{\rm{SR}} \approx 63$ K. Our magnetotransport measurements show an intriguing anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that emerges in the spin-reorientated collinear state, accompanied by the closing of the spin anisotropy gap as revealed from inelastic neutron scattering. The gapless spin excitations and the Yb-Fe interaction are able to support a dynamic scalar spin chirality, which explains the observed AHE. Therefore, our study demonstrates spin fluctuations may provide an additional scattering channel for the conduction electrons and give rise to AHE even in a collinear antiferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Surface charge density wave in UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatially uniform electronic density characteristic of a metal can become unstable at low temperatures, leading to the formation of charge density waves (CDWs). These CDWs, observed in dichalcogenides, cuprates, and pnictides arise from features in the electron and lattice bandstructures that facilitate charge ordering. CDWs are often considered to compete with Kondo screening and are relatively rare in heavy fermion metals. However, the heavy fermion topological superconductor candidate UTe2 presents a notable exception, exhibiting a CDW whose origin remains elusive. Here we report high resolution Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) experiments that reveal the primitive wavevectors of the CDW in UTe2. This allows for a refined identification of the electronic bandstructure regions susceptible to nesting. We demonstrate that the CDW wavevectors are not linked to bulk antiferromagnetic fluctuations that have been connected to other nesting features, indicating a decoupling from the bulk. We propose that surface-induced modifications of the U-5f electronic structure result in an enhancement of electronic interactions specifically at the nesting wavevectors identified here, thereby driving the formation of the observed surface CDW.</description>

      <title>Boundary criticality in two-dimensional interacting topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the boundary criticality in 2D interacting topological insulators. Using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we present the first nonperturbative study of the boundary quantum phase diagram in the Kane-Mele-Hubbard-Rashba model. Our results reveal rich boundary critical phenomena at the quantum phase transition between a topological insulator and an antiferromagnetic insulator, encompassing ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. Combining analytical derivation of the boundary theory with unbiased numerically-exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the presence of topological edge states enriches the ordinary transition that renders a continuous boundary scaling dimension and, more intriguingly, leads to a special transition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. Our work establishes a novel framework for the nonperturbative study of boundary criticality in two-dimensional topological systems with strong electron correlations.</description>

      <title>Crystal growth, structure and physical properties of quasi-one-dimensional tellurides Fe$_{4-x}$VTe$_{4-y}$ ($x=1.01$, $y=0.74$) and V$_{4.64}$Te$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new ternary compound Fe$_{4-x}$VTe$_{4-y}$ ($x=1.01$, $y=0.74$) with Ti5Te4-type structure is identified. Fe and V atoms tend to occupy different crystallographic positions and form quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) Fe-V chains along the c-axis. Millimeter-sized single crystal of Fe$_{2.99}$VTe$_{3.26}$ (FVT) with slender-stick shape could be grown by chemical vapor transport method which reflects its quasi-1D crystal structure. Magnetization measurements reveal that FVT orders antiferromagnetically below T$_N$=93 K with strong easy ab-plane magnetic anisotropy. Although a weak glassy-like behavior appears below 10 K, FVT is dominant by long-range antiferromagnetic order in contrast to the spin-glass state in previously reported isostructural Fe$_{5}$Te$_{4}$. We also synthesize V$_{4.64}$Te$_4$ with similar quasi-1D V-chains and find it has weak anomalies at 144 K on both resistivity and susceptibility curves. However, no clear evidence is found for the development of magnetic or charge order. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Curie-Weiss fit reveal that the effective moments for Fe$^{2+}$ and V$^{4+}$ in both compounds have large deviations from the conventional local moment model, which may possibly result from the formation of Fe/V metal-metal bondings. Furthermore the resistivity of both FVT and V$_{4.64}$Te$_4$ exhibits semiconducting-like temperature-dependent behavior but with average values close to typical bad metals, which resembles the transport behavior in the normal state of Fe-based superconductors. These quasi-1D compounds have shown interesting physical properties for future condensed matter physics research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $S=1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a frustrated kagome-lattice bilayer with strong nearest-neighbor interlayer coupling and examine its low-temperature magnetothermodynamics using a mapping onto a rhombi gas on the kagome lattice. Besides, we use finite-size numerics to illustrate the validity of the classical lattice-gas description. Among our findings there are i) the absence of an order-disorder phase transition and ii) the sensitivity of the specific heat at low temperatures to the shape of the system just below the saturation magnetic field even in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced magnetic phase transitions in the cubic Kondo-lattice model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study photoinduced magnetic phase transitions and their dynamical processes in the Kondo-lattice model on a cubic lattice. It is demonstrated that light irradiation gives rise to magnetic phase transitions from the ground-state ferromagnetic state to a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic state as a nonequilibrium steady state in the photodriven system. This phase transition occurs as a consequence of the formation of pseudo half-filling band occupation via the photoexcitation and relaxation of electrons, where all the electron states constituting the lower band separated from the upper band by an exchange gap are partially but nearly uniformly occupied. We also find that several types of antiferromagnetic correlations, e.g., A-type and C-type antiferromagnetic correlations, appear in a transient state of the dynamical phase transition. By calculating magnon spectra for the photodriven system, we argue that the instability to the A-type or C-type antiferromagnetic state occurs in the ferromagnetic ground state as a softening of the magnon band dispersion at corresponding momentum points depending on the light polarization. Our findings provide important insights into the understanding of photoinduced magnetic phase transitions in the three-dimensional Kondo-lattice magnets.</description>

      <title>Switching of an antiferromagnet controlled by spin canting in a laser-induced hidden phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During laser-induced phase transitions, fast transformations of electronic, atomic, and spin configurations often involve emergence of hidden and metastable phases. Being inaccessible under any other stimuli, such phases are indispensable for unveiling mechanisms and controlling the transitions. We experimentally explore spin kinetics during ultrafast first-order 90$^{\circ}$ spin-reorientation (SR) transition in a canted antiferromagnet Fe$_3$BO$_6$, and reveal that the transition is controlled by the canting between the magnetic sublattices. Laser-induced perturbation of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction results in a change of the intersublattice canting within first picoseconds, bringing Fe$_3$BO$_6$ to a hidden phase. Once this phase emerges, laser-induced heating activates precessional 90$^\circ$ spin switching. Combination of the spin canting and heating controls the final spin configuration comprising coexisting initial and switched phases. Extended phase coexistence range is in a striking contrast to the narrow SR transition in Fe$_3$BO$_6$ induced by conventional heating.</description>

      <title>Magnetism-Enhanced Strong Electron-Phonon Coupling in Infinite-Layer Nickelate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intriguing analogies between the nickelates and the cuprates provide a promising avenue for unraveling the microscopic mechanisms underlying high-$T_c$ superconductivity. While electron correlation effects in the nickelates have been extensively studied, the role of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) remains highly controversial. Here, by taking pristine LaNiO$_2$ as an exemplar nickelate, we present an in-depth study of EPC for both the non-magnetic (NM) and the $C$-type antiferromagnetic ($C$-AFM) phase using advanced density functional theory methods without invoking $U$ or other free parameters. The weak EPC strength $\lambda$ in the NM phase is found to be greatly enhanced ($\sim$4$\times$) due to the presence of magnetism in the $C$-AFM phase. This enhancement arises from strong interactions between the flat bands associated with the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals and the low-frequency phonon modes driven by the vibrations of Ni and La atoms. The resulting phonon softening is shown to yield a distinctive kink in the electronic structure around 15 meV, which would provide an experimentally testable signature of our predictions. Our study highlights the critical role of local magnetic moments and interply EPC in the nickelate.</description>

      <title>Giant nematic response of the incommensurate charge density wave in the nickel-pnictide Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron nematicity-the breaking of rotational symmetry while preserving translational symmetry-is the quantum analogue of classical nematic liquid crystals. First predicted in 1998, electronic nematicity has been established in a variety of materials, including two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in magnetic fields, copper-oxide superconductors, and Fe-based superconductors. A long-standing open question is what physical mechanisms drive electronic nematic order. In BaFe$_2$As$_2$ and highly underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+y}$, strong evidence suggests that nematicity arises from vestigial spin-density-wave (SDW) order. However, evidence for nematicity associated with charge-density-wave (CDW) order has been less conclusive, particularly in systems near a superconducting state. Here, we present direct evidence for CDW-driven nematic fluctuations in the pnictide superconductor Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$As$_2$ (BSNA), a Ni-based homologue of Fe-based superconductors that exhibits CDW rather than SDW order. Previous elastoresistance studies have shown that BSNA displays a large nematic susceptibility-linked to a six-fold enhancement of superconductivity-within a region of the phase diagram occupied by an incommensurate CDW. Using x-ray scattering under uniaxial strain, we demonstrate that even minimal strain levels ($\epsilon \sim 10^{-4}$) significantly break the fourfold symmetry of the CDW. Within a Ginzburg-Landau framework, we define a nematic susceptibility based on the asymmetric response of symmetry-related CDW superlattice reflections, showing strong agreement with elastoresistivity measurements. Our study provides the first clear demonstration of a direct link between charge order and a nematic state, offering key insights into the intertwined superconducting phases of these materials.</description>

Abstract: We present a topological mechanism for superconductivity emerging from Chern-2 insulators. While, naively, time-reversal symmetry breaking is expected to prevent superconductivity, it turns out that the opposite is the case: An explicit model calculation for a generalized attractive-U Haldane-Hubbard model demonstrates that superconductivity is only stabilized near the quantum anomalous Hall state, but not near a trivial, time-reversal symmetric band insulator. As standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like mean-field theory fails to capture any superconducting state, we explain this using an effective fractionalized field theory involving fermionic chargeons, bosonic colorons and an emergent U(1) gauge field. When the chargeons form a gapped topological band structure, the proliferation of single monopoles of this gauge field is forbidden. However, long-ranged monopole-antimonopole correlations emerge, and we argue that those correspond to superconducting order. Using random phase approximation on top of extensive slave-rotor mean-field calculations we characterize coherence length and stiffness of the superconductor. Thereby, we deduce the phase diagram in parameter space and furthermore discuss the effect of doping, temperature and an external magnetic field. We complement the fractionalized theory with calculations using an effective spin model and Gutzwiller projected wavefunctions. While mostly based on a simple toy model, we argue that our findings contribute to a better understanding of superconductivity emerging out of spin- and valley polarized rhombohedral graphene multilayers in a parameter regime with nearby quantum anomalous Hall insulators.</description>

      <title>ScarFinder: a detector of optimal scar trajectories in quantum many-body dynamics</title>

Abstract: Mechanisms that give rise to coherent quantum dynamics, such as quantum many-body scars, have recently attracted much interest as a way of controlling quantum chaos. However, identifying the presence of quantum scars in general many-body Hamiltonians remains an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce ScarFinder, a variational framework that reveals possible scar-like dynamics without prior knowledge of scar states or their algebraic structure. By iteratively evolving and projecting states within a low-entanglement variational manifold, ScarFinder isolates scarred trajectories by suppressing thermal contributions. We validate the method on the analytically tractable spin-1 XY model, recovering the known scar dynamics, as well as the mixed field Ising model, where we capture and generalize the initial conditions previously associated with ``weak thermalization''. We then apply the method to the PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, efficiently characterizing its mixed phase space and finding a previously unknown trajectory with nearly-perfect revival dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. Our results establish ScarFinder as a powerful, model-agnostic tool for identifying and optimizing coherent dynamics in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Finding periodic orbits in projected quantum many-body dynamics</title>

Abstract: Describing general quantum many-body dynamics is a challenging task due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size. The time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) provides a powerful tool to tackle this task by projecting quantum evolution onto a classical dynamical system within a variational manifold. In classical systems, periodic orbits play a crucial role in understanding the structure of the phase space and the long-term behavior of the system. However, finding periodic orbits is generally difficult, and their existence and properties in generic TDVP dynamics over matrix product states have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we develop an algorithm to systematically identify and characterize periodic orbits in TDVP dynamics. Applying our method to the periodically kicked Ising model, we uncover both stable and unstable periodic orbits. We characterize the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser tori in the vicinity of stable periodic orbits and track the change of the periodic orbits as we modify the Hamiltonian parameters. We observe that periodic orbits exist at any value of the coupling constant between prethermal and fully thermalizing regimes, but their relevance to quantum dynamics and imprint on quantum eigenstates diminishes as the system leaves the prethermal regime. Our results demonstrate that periodic orbits provide valuable insights into the TDVP approximation of quantum many-body evolution and establish a closer connection between quantum and classical chaos.</description>

      <title>A scaling relation of vortex-induced rectification effects in a superconducting thin-film heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supercurrent rectification, nonreciprocal response of superconducting properties sensitive to the polarity of bias and magnetic field, has attracted growing interest as an ideal diode. While the superconducting rectification effect is a consequence of the asymmetric vortex pinning, the mechanisms to develop its asymmetric potentials have been a subject of ongoing debate, mainly focusing on microscopic breaking of spatial inversion symmetry and macroscopic imbalance of the sample structure. Here, we report on comparative study of the superconducting diode effect and nonreciprocal resistance in a superconducting Fe(Se,Te)/FeTe heterostructure. In normal state, we observe finite nonreciprocal resistance as a hallmark of the spin-orbit interaction with structural inversion asymmetry. In the superconducting state, we find that the strongly enhanced nonreciprocal coefficient in transition regime is directly coupled to the superconducting diode efficiency through a universal scaling law, indicating the role of spin-momentum-locked state on the asymmetric pinning potential. Our findings, providing a unified picture of the superconducting rectification, pave the way for functionalizing superconducting diode devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A tight-binding model for $e_g$ orbitals on a simple cubic lattice with finite thickness is investigated. The hopping integrals for nearest-neighboring sites are considered. We examine the electronic band structures for systems with (001), (110), and (111) surfaces. Electronic states well localized around the surfaces are found for the (110) and (111) surfaces. In particular, the surface state is flat and extends in the entire Brillouin zone for the (111) surface, provided the bulk band projected onto the surface Brillouin zone is gapped. We also find that these surface states possess octupole moments in both the (110) and (111) surface cases.</description>

      <title>Dualities between 2+1d fusion surface models from braided fusion categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fusion surface models generalize the concept of anyon chains to 2+1 dimensions, utilizing fusion 2-categories as their input. We investigate bond-algebraic dualities in these systems and show that distinct module tensor categories $\mathcal{M}$ over the same braided fusion category $\mathcal{B}$ give rise to dual lattice models. This extends the 1+1d result that dualities in anyon chains are classified by module categories over fusion categories. We analyze two concrete examples: (i) a $\text{Rep}(S_3)$ model with a constrained Hilbert space, dual to the spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ XXZ model on the honeycomb lattice, and (ii) a bilayer Kitaev honeycomb model, dual to a spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ model with XXZ and Ising interactions. Unlike regular $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{B}$ fusion surface models, which conserve only 1-form symmetries, models constructed from $\mathcal{M} \neq \mathcal{B}$ can exhibit both 1-form and 0-form symmetries, including non-invertible ones.</description>

      <title>Towards numerically exact computation of conductivity in the thermodynamic limit of interacting lattice models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing dynamical response functions in interacting lattice models is a long standing challenge in condensed matter physics. In view of recent results, the dc resistivity $\rho_\mathrm{dc}$ in the weak coupling regime of the Hubbard model is of great interest, yet it is not fully understood. The challenge lies in having to work with large lattices while avoiding analytical continuation. The weak-coupling $\rho_\mathrm{dc}$ results were so far computed at the level of the Boltzmann theory and at the level of the Kubo bubble approximation, which neglects vertex corrections. Neither theory was so far rigorously proven to give exact results even at infinitesimal coupling, and the respective dc resistivity results differ greatly. In this work we develop, cross-check and apply two state-of-the-art methods for obtaining dynamical response functions. We compute the optical conductivity at weak coupling in the Hubbard model in a fully controlled way, in the thermodynamic limit and without analytical continuation. We show that vertex corrections persist to infinitesimal coupling, with a constant ratio to the Kubo bubble. We connect our methods with the Boltzmann theory, and show that the latter applies additional approximations, which lead to quantitatively incorrect scaling of $\rho_\mathrm{dc}$ with respect to the coupling constant.</description>

      <title>High-accuracy evaluation of non-thermal magnetic states beyond spin-wave theory: applications to higher-energy states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an approximation scheme based on selective Hilbert space truncation for characterizing non-thermal states of magnetic systems beyond spin-wave theory. We study applications to states that are inaccessible through linear spin-wave theory, such as multi-magnon states and higher-energy states. Our approach is based on the existence of an exact representation of spin operators in terms of finite-order polynomials of bosonic operators. It can be applied to systems with and without a magnetically ordered ground state. The approximation exactly diagonalizes the bosonic Hamiltonian restricted to particular boson occupation subspaces, improving the conventional linear spin-wave approach and exponentially reducing the computing time relative to exact diagonalization schemes. As a test case, we apply the approach to a prototypical one-dimensional model - an XXZ spin chain with an applied magnetic field and antisymmetric exchange coupling. Here the antisymmetric coupling introduces a continuous parameter to tune the system away from its exactly solvable limit. We find excellent agreement between numerically exact eigenstates and eigenvalues and those found via the approximation scheme. Our approach applies not just to higher lying states but also to boson bound states, which could make them more accessible to theoretical predictions for comparison with experiment.</description>

      <title>Symmetrizing the Constraints -- Density Matrix Renormalization Group for Constrained Lattice Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for constrained quantum lattice models that successfully {\it{implements the local constraints as symmetries in the contraction of the matrix product states and matrix product operators}}. Such an implementation allows us to investigate a quantum dimer model in DMRG for any lattice geometry wrapped around a cylinder with substantial circumference. We have thence computed the ground state phase diagram of the quantum dimer model on triangular lattice, with the symmetry-breaking characteristics of the columnar solid phase and $\sqrt{12}\times\sqrt{12}$ valence bond solid phase fully captured, as well as the topological entanglement entropy of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid phase that extends to the RK point on non-bipartite lattice accurately revealed. Our DMRG algorithm on constrained quantum lattice models opens new opportunities for matrix and tensor-based algorithms for these systems that have immediate relevance towards the frustrated quantum magnets and synthetic quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: We study orbital orders in quadrupolar heavy-fermion compound PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$ under magnetic fields on the basis of the Landau theory. Assuming E$_g$ orbital (electric quadrupolar) orders in the cubic symmetry with the ordering wavenumber at the L points in the face-centered cubic lattice Brillouin zone as observed experimentally, we construct the Landau free energy and analyze it. We find that the unidentified high-temperature ordered phase under the magnetic field H ||[001] reported earlier can be interpreted as the consequence of the internal rotation in the orbital moments of f electrons at the Pr site. We discuss the phase diagram for various magnetic-field directions and also possible double-q quadrupolar orders in this system.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics model for Clifford random tensor networks and monitored quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.02988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an exact mapping of Clifford (stabilizer) random tensor networks (RTNs) and monitored quantum circuits, onto a statistical mechanics model. With Haar unitaries, the fundamental degrees of freedom ('spins') are permutations because all operators commuting with the action of the unitaries on a tensor product arise from permutations of the tensor factors ('Schur-Weyl duality'). For unitaries restricted to the smaller Clifford group, the set of commuting operators, the 'commutant', forming the new 'spin' degrees of freedom, will be larger. We use the recent full characterization of this commutant by Gross et al., Comm. Math. Phys. 385, 1325 (2021), to construct the Clifford statistical mechanics models for on-site Hilbert space dimensions which are powers of a prime number $p$. We show that the Boltzmann weights are invariant under a symmetry group involving orthogonal matrices with entries in the finite number field ${\bf F}_p$. This implies that the symmetry group, and consequently all universal properties of entanglement transitions in Clifford circuits and RTNs will in general depend on, and only on the prime $p$. We show that Clifford monitored circuits with on-site Hilbert space dimension $d=p^M$ are described by percolation in the limits $d \to \infty$ at (a) $p=$ fixed but $M\to \infty$, and at (b) $M= 1$ but $p \to \infty$. In the limit (a) we calculate the effective central charge, and in the limit (b) we derive the following universal minimal cut entanglement entropy $S_A =(\sqrt{3}/\pi)\ln p \ln L_A$ for $d=p$ large at the transition. We verify those predictions numerically, and present extensive numerical results for critical exponents at the transition in monitored Clifford circuits for prime number on-site Hilbert space dimension $d=p$ for a variety of different values of $p$, and find that they approach percolation values at large $p$.</description>

      <title>Incommensurate spin-fluctuations and competing pairing symmetries in La3Ni2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La3Ni2O7 under high pressure has generated much interest in the superconducting pairing mechanism of nickelates. Despite extensive theoretical work, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La3Ni2O7 remains unresolved, with conflicting results even for identical methods. This inconsistency has obscured the pairing mechanism and raised questions about the validity of simplified models. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. These spin-fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a superconducting order parameter with dx2-y2 symmetry for realistic model parameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the absence of magnetic order in La3Ni2O7, demonstrating that magnetic frustration and superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate spin-fluctuations.</description>
