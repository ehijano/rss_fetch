      <title>Image Watermarking of Generative Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding watermarks into the output of generative models is essential for establishing copyright and verifiable ownership over the generated content. Emerging diffusion model watermarking methods either embed watermarks in the frequency domain or offer limited versatility of the watermark patterns in the image space, which allows simplistic detection and removal of the watermarks from the generated content. To address this issue, we propose a watermarking technique that embeds watermark features into the diffusion model itself. Our technique enables training of a paired watermark extractor for a generative model that is learned through an end-to-end process. The extractor forces the generator, during training, to effectively embed versatile, imperceptible watermarks in the generated content while simultaneously ensuring their precise recovery. We demonstrate highly accurate watermark embedding/detection and show that it is also possible to distinguish between different watermarks embedded with our method to differentiate between generative models.</description>

      <title>SAMRI-2: A Memory-based Model for Cartilage and Meniscus Segmentation in 3D MRIs of the Knee Joint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate morphometric assessment of cartilage-such as thickness/volume-via MRI is essential for monitoring knee osteoarthritis. Segmenting cartilage remains challenging and dependent on extensive expert-annotated datasets, which are heavily subjected to inter-reader variability. Recent advancements in Visual Foundational Models (VFM), especially memory-based approaches, offer opportunities for improving generalizability and robustness. This study introduces a deep learning (DL) method for cartilage and meniscus segmentation from 3D MRIs using interactive, memory-based VFMs. To improve spatial awareness and convergence, we incorporated a Hybrid Shuffling Strategy (HSS) during training and applied a segmentation mask propagation technique to enhance annotation efficiency. We trained four AI models-a CNN-based 3D-VNet, two automatic transformer-based models (SaMRI2D and SaMRI3D), and a transformer-based promptable memory-based VFM (SAMRI-2)-on 3D knee MRIs from 270 patients using public and internal datasets and evaluated on 57 external cases, including multi-radiologist annotations and different data acquisitions. Model performance was assessed against reference standards using Dice Score (DSC) and Intersection over Union (IoU), with additional morphometric evaluations to further quantify segmentation accuracy. SAMRI-2 model, trained with HSS, outperformed all other models, achieving an average DSC improvement of 5 points, with a peak improvement of 12 points for tibial cartilage. It also demonstrated the lowest cartilage thickness errors, reducing discrepancies by up to threefold. Notably, SAMRI-2 maintained high performance with as few as three user clicks per volume, reducing annotation effort while ensuring anatomical precision. This memory-based VFM with spatial awareness offers a novel approach for reliable AI-assisted knee MRI segmentation, advancing DL in musculoskeletal imaging.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Quantitative MRI using Subspace Multiscale Energy Model (SS-MuSE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-contrast MRI methods acquire multiple images with different contrast weightings, which are used for the differentiation of the tissue types or quantitative mapping. However, the scan time needed to acquire multiple contrasts is prohibitively long for 3D acquisition schemes, which can offer isotropic image resolution. While deep learning-based methods have been extensively used to accelerate 2D and 2D + time problems, the high memory demand, computation time, and need for large training data sets make them challenging for large-scale volumes. To address these challenges, we generalize the plug-and-play multi-scale energy-based model (MuSE) to a regularized subspace recovery setting, where we jointly regularize the 3D multi-contrast spatial factors in a subspace formulation. The explicit energy-based formulation allows us to use variable splitting optimization methods for computationally efficient recovery.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Wound Tissue Segmentation: A Comprehensive Evaluation using A Novel Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) techniques have emerged as promising solutions for medical wound tissue segmentation. However, a notable limitation in this field is the lack of publicly available labelled datasets and a standardised performance evaluation of state-of-the-art DL models on such datasets. This study addresses this gap by comprehensively evaluating various DL models for wound tissue segmentation using a novel dataset. We have curated a dataset comprising 147 wound images exhibiting six tissue types: slough, granulation, maceration, necrosis, bone, and tendon. The dataset was meticulously labelled for semantic segmentation employing supervised machine learning techniques. Three distinct labelling formats were developed -- full image, patch, and superpixel. Our investigation encompassed a wide array of DL segmentation and classification methodologies, ranging from conventional approaches like UNet, to generative adversarial networks such as cGAN, and modified techniques like FPN+VGG16. Also, we explored DL-based classification methods (e.g., ResNet50) and machine learning-based classification leveraging DL features (e.g., AlexNet+RF). In total, 82 wound tissue segmentation models were derived across the three labelling formats. Our analysis yielded several notable findings, including identifying optimal DL models for each labelling format based on weighted average Dice or F1 scores. Notably, FPN+VGG16 emerged as the top-performing DL model for wound tissue segmentation, achieving a dice score of 82.25%. This study provides a valuable benchmark for evaluating wound image segmentation and classification models, offering insights to inform future research and clinical practice in wound care. The labelled dataset created in this study is available at https://github.com/akabircs/WoundTissue.</description>

      <title>Towards Zero-Shot Task-Generalizable Learning on fMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional MRI measuring BOLD signal is an increasingly important imaging modality in studying brain functions and neurological disorders. It can be acquired in either a resting-state or a task-based paradigm. Compared to resting-state fMRI, task-based fMRI is acquired while the subject is performing a specific task designed to enhance study-related brain activities. Consequently, it generally has more informative task-dependent signals. However, due to the variety of task designs, it is much more difficult than in resting state to aggregate task-based fMRI acquired in different tasks to train a generalizable model. To resolve this complication, we propose a supervised task-aware network TA-GAT that jointly learns a general-purpose encoder and task-specific contextual information. The encoder-generated embedding and the learned contextual information are then combined as input to multiple modules for performing downstream tasks. We believe that the proposed task-aware architecture can plug-and-play in any neural network architecture to incorporate the prior knowledge of fMRI tasks into capturing functional brain patterns.</description>

      <title>ResiComp: Loss-Resilient Image Compression via Dual-Functional Masked Visual Token Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in neural image codecs (NICs) are of significant compression performance, but limited attention has been paid to their error resilience.
  These resulting NICs tend to be sensitive to packet losses, which are prevalent in real-time communications.
  In this paper, we investigate how to elevate the resilience ability of NICs to combat packet losses.
  We propose ResiComp, a pioneering neural image compression framework with feature-domain packet loss concealment (PLC).
  Motivated by the inherent consistency between generation and compression, we advocate merging the tasks of entropy modeling and PLC into a unified framework focused on latent space context modeling.
  To this end, we take inspiration from the impressive generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly the recent advances of masked visual token modeling (MVTM).
  During training, we integrate MVTM to mirror the effects of packet loss, enabling a dual-functional Transformer to restore the masked latents by predicting their missing values and conditional probability mass functions.
  Our ResiComp jointly optimizes compression efficiency and loss resilience.
  Moreover, ResiComp provides flexible coding modes, allowing for explicitly adjusting the efficiency-resilience trade-off in response to varying Internet or wireless network conditions.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResiComp can significantly enhance the NIC's resilience against packet losses, while exhibits a worthy trade-off between compression efficiency and packet loss resilience.</description>

      <title>On Quantizing Neural Representation for Variable-Rate Video Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces NeuroQuant, a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) approach tailored to non-generalized Implicit Neural Representations for variable-rate Video Coding (INR-VC). Unlike existing methods that require extensive weight retraining for each target bitrate, we hypothesize that variable-rate coding can be achieved by adjusting quantization parameters (QPs) of pre-trained weights. Our study reveals that traditional quantization methods, which assume inter-layer independence, are ineffective for non-generalized INR-VC models due to significant dependencies across layers. To address this, we redefine variable-rate INR-VC as a mixed-precision quantization problem and establish a theoretical framework for sensitivity criteria aimed at simplified, fine-grained rate control. Additionally, we propose network-wise calibration and channel-wise quantization strategies to minimize quantization-induced errors, arriving at a unified formula for representation-oriented PTQ calibration. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that NeuroQuant significantly outperforms existing techniques in varying bitwidth quantization and compression efficiency, accelerating encoding by up to eight times and enabling quantization down to INT2 with minimal reconstruction loss. This work introduces variable-rate INR-VC for the first time and lays a theoretical foundation for future research in rate-distortion optimization, advancing the field of video coding technology.

      <title>Spiking Neural Network Feature Discrimination Boosts Modality Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature discrimination is a crucial aspect of neural network design, as it directly impacts the network's ability to distinguish between classes and generalize across diverse datasets. The accomplishment of achieving high-quality feature representations ensures high intra-class separability and poses one of the most challenging research directions. While conventional deep neural networks (DNNs) rely on complex transformations and very deep networks to come up with meaningful feature representations, they usually require days of training and consume significant energy amounts. To this end, spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative. SNN's ability to capture temporal and spatial dependencies renders them particularly suitable for complex tasks, where multi-modal data are required. In this paper, we propose a feature discrimination approach for multi-modal learning with SNNs, focusing on audio-visual data. We employ deep spiking residual learning for visual modality processing and a simpler yet efficient spiking network for auditory modality processing. Lastly, we deploy a spiking multilayer perceptron for modality fusion. We present our findings and evaluate our approach against similar works in the field of classification challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work investigating feature discrimination in SNNs.</description>

      <title>Quaternion-Hadamard Network: A Novel Defense Against Adversarial Attacks with a New Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the vulnerability of deep-learning models designed for rain, snow, and haze removal. Despite enhancing image quality in adverse weather, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks that compromise their effectiveness. Traditional defenses such as adversarial training and model distillation often require extensive retraining, making them costly and impractical for real-world deployment. While denoising and super-resolution techniques can aid image classification models, they impose high computational demands and introduce visual artifacts that hinder image processing tasks. We propose a model-agnostic defense against first-order white-box adversarial attacks using the Quaternion-Hadamard Network (QHNet) to tackle these challenges. White-box attacks are particularly difficult to defend against since attackers have full access to the model's architecture, weights, and training procedures. Our defense introduces the Quaternion Hadamard Denoising Convolutional Block (QHDCB) and the Quaternion Denoising Residual Block (QDRB), leveraging polynomial thresholding. QHNet incorporates these blocks within an encoder-decoder architecture, enhanced by feature refinement, to effectively neutralize adversarial noise. Additionally, we introduce the Adversarial Weather Conditions Vision Dataset (AWCVD), created by applying first-order gradient attacks on state-of-the-art weather removal techniques in scenarios involving haze, rain streaks, and snow. Using PSNR and SSIM metrics, we demonstrate that QHNet significantly enhances the robustness of low-level computer vision models against adversarial attacks compared with state-of-the-art denoising and super-resolution techniques. The source code and dataset will be released alongside the final version of this paper.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Deepfake Image Detection: A Comprehensive Dataset-Driven Approach Integrating Convolutional and Attention Mechanisms with Frequency Domain Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective deepfake detection tools are becoming increasingly essential over the last few years due to the growing usage of deepfakes in unethical practices. There exists a diverse range of deepfake generation techniques, which makes it challenging to develop an accurate universal detection mechanism. The 2025 Signal Processing Cup (DFWild-Cup competition) provided a diverse dataset of deepfake images, which are generated from multiple deepfake image generators, for training machine learning model(s) to emphasize the generalization of deepfake detection. To this end, we proposed an ensemble-based approach that employs three different neural network architectures: a ResNet-34-based architecture, a data-efficient image transformer (DeiT), and an XceptionNet with Wavelet Transform to capture both local and global features of deepfakes. We visualize the specific regions that these models focus for classification using Grad-CAM, and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of these models in grouping real and fake images into cohesive clusters using t-SNE plots. Individually, the ResNet-34 architecture has achieved 88.9% accuracy, whereas the Xception network and the DeiT architecture have achieved 87.76% and 89.32% accuracy, respectively. With these networks, our weighted ensemble model achieves an excellent accuracy of 93.23% on the validation dataset of the SP Cup 2025 competition. Finally, the confusion matrix and an Area Under the ROC curve of 97.44% further confirm the stability of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>GS-GVINS: A Tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System Augmented by 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has drawn significant attention in the area of 3D map reconstruction and visual SLAM. While extensive research has explored 3DGS for indoor trajectory tracking using visual sensor alone or in combination with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), its integration with GNSS for large-scale outdoor navigation remains underexplored. To address these concerns, we proposed GS-GVINS: a tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System augmented by 3DGS. This system leverages 3D Gaussian as a continuous differentiable scene representation in largescale outdoor environments, enhancing navigation performance through the constructed 3D Gaussian map. Notably, GS-GVINS is the first GNSS-Visual-Inertial navigation application that directly utilizes the analytical jacobians of SE3 camera pose with respect to 3D Gaussians. To maintain the quality of 3DGS rendering in extreme dynamic states, we introduce a motionaware 3D Gaussian pruning mechanism, updating the map based on relative pose translation and the accumulated opacity along the camera ray. For validation, we test our system under different driving environments: open-sky, sub-urban, and urban. Both self-collected and public datasets are used for evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-GVINS in enhancing navigation accuracy across diverse driving environments.</description>

Abstract: The multi-modality imaging system offers optimal fused images for safe and precise interventions in modern clinical practices, such as computed tomography - ultrasound (CT-US) guidance for needle insertion. However, the limited dexterity and mobility of current imaging devices hinder their integration into standardized workflows and the advancement toward fully autonomous intervention systems. In this paper, we present a novel clinical setup where robotic cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and robotic US are pre-calibrated and dynamically co-registered, enabling new clinical applications. This setup allows registration-free rigid registration, facilitating multi-modal guided procedures in the absence of tissue deformation. First, a one-time pre-calibration is performed between the systems. To ensure a safe insertion path by highlighting critical vasculature on the 3D CBCT, SAM2 segments vessels from B-mode images, using the Doppler signal as an autonomously generated prompt. Based on the registration, the Doppler image or segmented vessel masks are then mapped onto the CBCT, creating an optimally fused image with comprehensive detail. To validate the system, we used a specially designed phantom, featuring lesions covered by ribs and multiple vessels with simulated moving flow. The mapping error between US and CBCT resulted in an average deviation of 1.72+-0.62 mm. A user study demonstrated the effectiveness of CBCT-US fusion for needle insertion guidance, showing significant improvements in time efficiency, accuracy, and success rate. Needle intervention performance improved by approximately 50% compared to the conventional US-guided workflow. We present the first robotic dual-modality imaging system designed to guide clinical applications. The results show significant performance improvements compared to traditional manual interventions.</description>

      <title>On undesired emergent behaviors in compound prostate cancer detection systems</title>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems show promise to aid in the di- agnostic pathway of prostate cancer (PC), by supporting radiologists in interpreting magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the prostate. Most MRI-based systems are designed to detect clinically significant PC le- sions, with the main objective of preventing over-diagnosis. Typically, these systems involve an automatic prostate segmentation component and a clinically significant PC lesion detection component. In spite of the compound nature of the systems, evaluations are presented assum- ing a standalone clinically significant PC detection component. That is, they are evaluated in an idealized scenario and under the assumption that a highly accurate prostate segmentation is available at test time. In this work, we aim to evaluate a clinically significant PC lesion de- tection system accounting for its compound nature. For that purpose, we simulate a realistic deployment scenario and evaluate the effect of two non-ideal and previously validated prostate segmentation modules on the PC detection ability of the compound system. Following, we com- pare them with an idealized setting, where prostate segmentations are assumed to have no faults. We observe significant differences in the de- tection ability of the compound system in a realistic scenario and in the presence of the highest-performing prostate segmentation module (DSC: 90.07+-0.74), when compared to the idealized one (AUC: 77.93 +- 3.06 and 84.30+- 4.07, P&lt;.001). Our results depict the relevance of holistic evalu- ations for PC detection compound systems, where interactions between system components can lead to decreased performance and degradation at deployment time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16970v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: As visual inspection is an inherent process during radiological screening, the associated eye gaze data can provide valuable insights into relevant clinical decisions. As deep learning has become the state-of-the-art for computer-assisted diagnosis, integrating human behavior, such as eye gaze data, into these systems is instrumental to help align machine predictions with clinical diagnostic criteria, thus enhancing the quality of automatic radiological diagnosis. Methods: We propose a novel deep learning framework for joint disease diagnosis and prediction of corresponding clinical visual attention maps for chest X-ray scans. Specifically, we introduce a new dual-encoder multi-task UNet, which leverages both a DenseNet201 backbone and a Residual and Squeeze-and-Excitation block-based encoder to extract diverse features for visual attention map prediction, and a multi-scale feature-fusion classifier to perform disease classification. To tackle the issue of asynchronous training schedules of individual tasks in multi-task learning, we proposed a multi-stage cooperative learning strategy, with contrastive learning for feature encoder pretraining to boost performance. Results: Our proposed method is shown to significantly outperform existing techniques for chest X-ray diagnosis (AUC=0.93) and the quality of visual attention map prediction (Correlation coefficient=0.58). Conclusion: Benefiting from the proposed multi-task multi-stage cooperative learning, our technique demonstrates the benefit of integrating clinicians' eye gaze into clinical AI systems to boost performance and potentially explainability.</description>

      <title>Object-Attribute-Relation Representation Based Video Semantic Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of multimedia data volume, there is an increasing need for efficient video transmission in applications such as virtual reality and future video streaming services. Semantic communication is emerging as a vital technique for ensuring efficient and reliable transmission in low-bandwidth, high-noise settings. However, most current approaches focus on joint source-channel coding (JSCC) that depends on end-to-end training. These methods often lack an interpretable semantic representation and struggle with adaptability to various downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce the use of object-attribute-relation (OAR) as a semantic framework for videos to facilitate low bit-rate coding and enhance the JSCC process for more effective video transmission. We utilize OAR sequences for both low bit-rate representation and generative video reconstruction. Additionally, we incorporate OAR into the image JSCC model to prioritize communication resources for areas more critical to downstream tasks. Our experiments on traffic surveillance video datasets assess the effectiveness of our approach in terms of video transmission performance. The empirical findings demonstrate that our OAR-based video coding method not only outperforms H.265 coding at lower bit-rates but also synergizes with JSCC to deliver robust and efficient video transmission.</description>

      <title>ResSR: A Computationally Efficient Residual Approach to Super-Resolving Multispectral Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multispectral imaging sensors typically have wavelength-dependent resolution, which limits downstream processing. Consequently, researchers have proposed multispectral image super-resolution (MSI-SR) methods which upsample low-resolution bands to achieve a common resolution across all wavelengths. However, existing MSI-SR methods are computationally expensive because they require spatially regularized deconvolution and/or training-based methods.
  In this paper, we introduce ResSR, a computationally efficient MSI-SR method that achieves high-quality reconstructions by using spectral decomposition along with spatial residual correction. ResSR applies singular value decomposition to identify correlations across spectral bands, uses pixel-wise computation to upsample the MSI, and then applies a residual correction process to correct the high-spatial frequency components of the upsampled bands. While ResSR is formulated as the solution to a spatially-coupled optimization problem, we use pixel-wise regularization and derive an approximate non-iterative solution, resulting in a computationally efficient, non-iterative algorithm.
  Results on a combination of simulated and measured data show that ResSR is 2$\times$ to 10$\times$ faster than alternative MSI-SR algorithms, while producing comparable or better image quality. Code is available at https://github.com/hdsullivan/ResSR.</description>

      <title>DINeuro: Distilling Knowledge from 2D Natural Images via Deformable Tubular Transferring Strategy for 3D Neuron Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing neuron morphology from 3D light microscope imaging data is critical to aid neuroscientists in analyzing brain networks and neuroanatomy. With the boost from deep learning techniques, a variety of learning-based segmentation models have been developed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of raw neuron images as a pre-processing step in the reconstruction workflow. However, most existing models directly encode the latent representative features of volumetric neuron data but neglect their intrinsic morphological knowledge. To address this limitation, we design a novel framework that distills the prior knowledge from a 2D Vision Transformer pre-trained on extensive 2D natural images to facilitate neuronal morphological learning of our 3D Vision Transformer. To bridge the knowledge gap between the 2D natural image and 3D microscopic morphologic domains, we propose a deformable tubular transferring strategy that adapts the pre-trained 2D natural knowledge to the inherent tubular characteristics of neuronal structure in the latent embedding space. The experimental results on the Janelia dataset of the BigNeuron project demonstrate that our method achieves a segmentation performance improvement of 4.53% in mean Dice and 3.56% in mean 95% Hausdorff distance.</description>

      <title>On Disentangled Training for Nonlinear Transform in Learned Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has demonstrated superior rate-distortion (R-D) performance compared to traditional codecs, but is challenged by training inefficiency that could incur more than two weeks to train a state-of-the-art model from scratch. Existing LIC methods overlook the slow convergence caused by compacting energy in learning nonlinear transforms. In this paper, we first reveal that such energy compaction consists of two components, i.e., feature decorrelation and uneven energy modulation. On such basis, we propose a linear auxiliary transform (AuxT) to disentangle energy compaction in training nonlinear transforms. The proposed AuxT obtains coarse approximation to achieve efficient energy compaction such that distribution fitting with the nonlinear transforms can be simplified to fine details. We then develop wavelet-based linear shortcuts (WLSs) for AuxT that leverages wavelet-based downsampling and orthogonal linear projection for feature decorrelation and subband-aware scaling for</description>

      <title>Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation with Content Preserving Perspective: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image-to-image translation (I2I) transforms an image from a source domain to a target domain while preserving source content. Most computer vision applications are in the field of image-to-image translation, such as style transfer, image segmentation, and photo enhancement. The degree of preservation of the content of the source images in the translation process can be different according to the problem and the intended application. From this point of view, in this paper, we divide the different tasks in the field of image-to-image translation into three categories: Fully Content preserving, Partially Content preserving, and Non-Content preserving. We present different tasks, datasets, methods, results of methods for these three categories in this paper. We make a categorization for I2I methods based on the architecture of different models and study each category separately. In addition, we introduce well-known evaluation criteria in the I2I translation field. Specifically, nearly 70 different I2I models were analyzed, and more than 10 quantitative evaluation metrics and 30 distinct tasks and datasets relevant to the I2I translation problem were both introduced and assessed. Translating from simulation to real images could be well viewed as an application of fully content preserving or partially content preserving unsupervised image-to-image translation methods. So, we provide a benchmark for Sim-to-Real translation, which can be used to evaluate different methods. In general, we conclude that because of the different extent of the obligation to preserving content in various applications, it is better to consider this issue in choosing a suitable I2I model for a specific application.</description>

      <title>HyperFusion: A Hypernetwork Approach to Multimodal Integration of Tabular and Medical Imaging Data for Predictive Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of diverse clinical modalities such as medical imaging and the tabular data extracted from patients' Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is a crucial aspect of modern healthcare. Integrative analysis of multiple sources can provide a comprehensive understanding of the clinical condition of a patient, improving diagnosis and treatment decision. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) consistently demonstrate outstanding performance in a wide range of multimodal tasks in the medical domain. However, the complex endeavor of effectively merging medical imaging with clinical, demographic and genetic information represented as numerical tabular data remains a highly active and ongoing research pursuit.
  We present a novel framework based on hypernetworks to fuse clinical imaging and tabular data by conditioning the image processing on the EHR's values and measurements. This approach aims to leverage the complementary information present in these modalities to enhance the accuracy of various medical applications. We demonstrate the strength and generality of our method on two different brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) analysis tasks, namely, brain age prediction conditioned by subject's sex and multi-class Alzheimer's Disease (AD) classification conditioned by tabular data. We show that our framework outperforms both single-modality models and state-of-the-art MRI tabular data fusion methods.

      <title>IRSRMamba: Infrared Image Super-Resolution via Mamba-based Wavelet Transform Feature Modulation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infrared image super-resolution demands long-range dependency modeling and multi-scale feature extraction to address challenges such as homogeneous backgrounds, weak edges, and sparse textures. While Mamba-based state-space models (SSMs) excel in global dependency modeling with linear complexity, their block-wise processing disrupts spatial consistency, limiting their effectiveness for IR image reconstruction. We propose IRSRMamba, a novel framework integrating wavelet transform feature modulation for multi-scale adaptation and an SSMs-based semantic consistency loss to restore fragmented contextual information. This design enhances global-local feature fusion, structural coherence, and fine-detail preservation while mitigating block-induced artifacts. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that IRSRMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality. This work establishes Mamba-based architectures as a promising direction for high-fidelity IR image enhancement. Code are available at https://github.com/yongsongH/IRSRMamba.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Insect Monitoring: Ultra-Lightweight CNNs as On-Device Triggers for Insect Camera Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Camera traps, combined with AI, have emerged as a way to achieve automated, scalable biodiversity monitoring. However, the passive infrared (PIR) sensors that trigger camera traps are poorly suited for detecting small, fast-moving ectotherms such as insects. Insects comprise over half of all animal species and are key components of ecosystems and agriculture. The need for an appropriate and scalable insect camera trap is critical in the wake of concerning reports of declines in insect populations. This study proposes an alternative to the PIR trigger: ultra-lightweight convolutional neural networks running on low-powered hardware to detect insects in a continuous stream of captured images. We train a suite of models to distinguish insect images from backgrounds. Our design achieves zero latency between trigger and image capture. Our models are rigorously tested and achieve high accuracy ranging from 91.8% to 96.4% AUC on validation data and &gt;87% AUC on data from distributions unseen during training. The high specificity of our models ensures minimal saving of false positive images, maximising deployment storage efficiency. High recall scores indicate a minimal false negative rate, maximising insect detection. Further analysis with saliency maps shows the learned representation of our models to be robust, with low reliance on spurious background features. Our system is also shown to operate deployed on off-the-shelf, low-powered microcontroller units, consuming a maximum power draw of less than 300mW. This enables longer deployment times using cheap and readily available battery components. Overall we offer a step change in the cost, efficiency and scope of insect monitoring. Solving the challenging trigger problem, we demonstrate a system which can be deployed for far longer than existing designs and budgets power and bandwidth effectively, moving towards a generic insect camera trap.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a mobile-based solution that enhances online shoe shopping through 3D modeling and Augmented Reality (AR), leveraging the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Addressing the limitations of static 2D images, the framework generates realistic 3D shoe models from 2D images, achieving an average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32, and enables immersive AR interactions via smartphones. A custom shoe segmentation dataset of 3120 images was created, with the best-performing segmentation model achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.95. This paper demonstrates the potential of 3D modeling and AR to revolutionize online shopping by offering realistic virtual interactions, with applicability across broader fashion categories.</description>
