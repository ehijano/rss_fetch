      <title>Nested Fusion: A Method for Learning High Resolution Latent Structure of Multi-Scale Measurement Data on Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mars Perseverance Rover represents a generational change in the scale of measurements that can be taken on Mars, however this increased resolution introduces new challenges for techniques in exploratory data analysis. The multiple different instruments on the rover each measures specific properties of interest to scientists, so analyzing how underlying phenomena affect multiple different instruments together is important to understand the full picture. However each instrument has a unique resolution, making the mapping between overlapping layers of data non-trivial. In this work, we introduce Nested Fusion, a method to combine arbitrarily layered datasets of different resolutions and produce a latent distribution at the highest possible resolution, encoding complex interrelationships between different measurements and scales. Our method is efficient for large datasets, can perform inference even on unseen data, and outperforms existing methods of dimensionality reduction and latent analysis on real-world Mars rover data. We have deployed our method Nested Fusion within a Mars science team at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and through multiple rounds of participatory design enabled greatly enhanced exploratory analysis workflows for real scientists. To ensure the reproducibility of our work we have open sourced our code on GitHub at https://github.com/pixlise/NestedFusion.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the interplay between steel rebar corrosion rate and corrosion-induced cracking of reinforced concrete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerated impressed current testing is the most common experimental method for assessing the susceptibility to corrosion-induced cracking, the most prominent challenge to the durability of reinforced concrete structures. Although it is well known that accelerated impressed current tests lead to slower propagation of cracks (with respect to corrosion penetration) than in natural conditions, which results in overestimations of the delamination/spalling time, the origins of this phenomenon have puzzled researchers for more than a quarter of a century. In view of recent experimental findings, it is postulated that the phenomenon can be attributed to the variability of rust composition and density, specifically to the variable ratio of the mass fractions of iron oxide and iron hydroxide-oxide, which is affected by the magnitude of the applied corrosion current density. Based on this hypothesis, a corrosion-induced cracking model for virtual impressed-current testing is presented. The simulation results obtained with the proposed model are validated against experimental data, showing good agreement. Importantly, the model can predict corrosion-induced cracking under natural conditions and thus allows for the calculation of a newly proposed crack width slope correction factor, which extrapolates the surface crack width measured during accelerated impressed current tests to corrosion in natural conditions.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Modeling of Continuous Lyophilization for Pharmaceutical Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyophilization (also known as freeze drying) is a process that is commonly used to increase the stability of drug products, e.g., mRNA vaccines, in pharmaceutical manufacturing. While extensive efforts have been dedicated to shift the pharmaceutical industry towards continuous manufacturing, the majority of industrial-scale lyophilization is still being operated in a batch mode. This article proposes the first mechanistic model for a complete continuous lyophilization process, which includes freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying. The state-of-the-art lyophilization technology is considered, in which vials are suspended and moved continuously through the process. The model can describe the evolution of several critical process parameters, namely the product temperature, ice/water fraction, sublimation front position, and concentration of bound water, for the entire lyophilization process. The model is also demonstrated for several applications related to process design and optimization. Ultimately, the framework and results presented in this work can serve as a solid foundation to guide the design and development of future continuous lyophilization processes.</description>

      <title>Deep learning reveals key predictors of thermal conductivity in covalent organic frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal conductivity of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), an emerging class of nanoporous polymeric materials, is crucial for many applications, yet the link between their structure and thermal properties is not well understood. From a dataset of over 2,400 COFs, we find that conventional features like density, pore size, void fraction, and surface area do not reliably predict thermal conductivity. To overcome this, we train an attention-based machine learning model that accurately predicts thermal conductivities, even for structures outside the training set. We then use the attention mechanism to understand why the model works. Surprisingly, dangling molecular branches emerge as key predictors of thermal conductivity, alongside conventional geometric descriptors like density and pore size. Our findings show that COFs with dangling functional groups exhibit lower thermal transfer capabilities than otherwise. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm this, revealing significant mismatches in the vibrational density of states due to the presence of dangling branches.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised stratification of patients with myocardial infarction based on imaging and in-silico biomarkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel methodology for stratifying post-myocardial infarction patients at risk of ventricular arrhythmias using patient-specific 3D cardiac models derived from late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance (LGE-CMR) images. The method integrates imaging and computational simulation with a simplified cellular automaton model, Arrhythmic3D, enabling rapid and accurate VA risk assessment in clinical timeframes. Applied to 51 patients, the model generated thousands of personalized simulations to evaluate arrhythmia inducibility and predict VA risk. Key findings include the identification of slow conduction channels (SCCs) within scar tissue as critical to reentrant arrhythmias and the localization of high-risk zones for potential intervention. The Arrhythmic Risk Score (ARRISK), developed from simulation results, demonstrated strong concordance with clinical outcomes and outperformed traditional imaging-based risk stratification. The methodology is fully automated, requiring minimal user intervention, and offers a promising tool for improving precision medicine in cardiac care by enhancing patient-specific arrhythmia risk assessment and guiding treatment strategies.</description>
