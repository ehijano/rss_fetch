      <title>Decoding fairness: a reinforcement learning perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Behavioral experiments on the ultimatum game (UG) reveal that we humans prefer fair acts, which contradicts the prediction made in orthodox Economics. Existing explanations, however, are mostly attributed to exogenous factors within the imitation learning framework. Here, we adopt the reinforcement learning paradigm, where individuals make their moves aiming to maximize their accumulated rewards. Specifically, we apply Q-learning to UG, where each player is assigned two Q-tables to guide decisions for the roles of proposer and responder. In a two-player scenario, fairness emerges prominently when both experiences and future rewards are appreciated. In particular, the probability of successful deals increases with higher offers, which aligns with observations in behavioral experiments. Our mechanism analysis reveals that the system undergoes two phases, eventually stabilizing into fair or rational strategies. These results are robust when the rotating role assignment is replaced by a random or fixed manner, or the scenario is extended to a latticed population. Our findings thus conclude that the endogenous factor is sufficient to explain the emergence of fairness, exogenous factors are not needed.</description>

      <title>Trade-off between coherence and dissipation for excitable phase oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) bounds coherence in stochastic oscillatory systems. In this paper, we show that both dynamical and thermodynamic bounds play important roles for the excitable oscillators, e.g. neurons. Firstly, we investigate the trade-off between coherence and dissipation both in the sub and super-threshold regions for a single excitable unit, where both the TUR and the SNIC bounds constrain the fluctuation of inter-spike intervals. Secondly, we show that the widely studied phenomenon called coherence resonance, where there exists a noise strength to make the oscillatory responses of the system most coherent, is also bounded by the TUR in the one-dimensional excitable phase model. Finally, we study the coherence-dissipation relation in ensembles of strongly coupled excitable oscillators.</description>

      <title>Correlated Growth of Causal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of causal structure in complex systems has gained increasing attention, with many recent studies exploring causal networks that capture cause-effect relationships across diverse fields. Despite increasing empirical evidence linking causal structures to network topological correlations, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of these correlations in causal networks remain poorly understood. In this Letter, we propose a general growth framework for causal networks, incorporating two key types of correlations: causal and dynamic. We analytically solve our model for degree correlation and validate the theoretical predictions against empirical data from four large-scale innovation networks. Our theory not only sheds light on the origins of topological correlations but also provides a general framework for understanding correlated growth across causal systems.</description>

      <title>Power Law Behavior of Center-Like Decaying Oscillation : Exponent through Perturbation Theory and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In dynamical systems theory, there is a lack of a straightforward rule to distinguish exact center solutions from decaying center-like solutions, as both require the damping force function to be zero [1, 2]. By adopting a multi-scale perturbative method, we have demonstrated a general rule for the decaying center-like power law behavior, characterized by an exponent of 1/3 . The investigation began with a physical question about the higher-order nonlinearity in a damping force function, which exhibits birhythmic and trirhythmic behavior under a transition to a decaying center-type solution. Using numerical optimization algorithms, we identified the power law exponent for decaying center-type behavior across various rhythmic conditions. For all scenarios, we consistently observed a decaying power law with an exponent of 1/3 .Our study aims to elucidate their dynamical differences, contributing to theoretical insights and practical applications where distinguishing between different types of center-like behaviour is crucial. This key result would be beneficial for studying the multi-rhythmic nature of biological and engineering systems.</description>

      <title>Swarm navigation of cyborg-insects in unknown obstructed soft terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cyborg insects refer to hybrid robots that integrate living insects with miniature electronic controllers to enable robotic-like programmable control. These creatures exhibit advantages over conventional robots in adaption to complex terrain and sustained energy efficiency. Nevertheless, there is a lack of literature on the control of multi-cyborg systems. This research gap is due to the difficulty in coordinating the movements of a cyborg system under the presence of insects' inherent individual variability in their reactions to control input. Regarding this issue, we propose a swarm navigation algorithm and verify it under experiments. This research advances swarm robotics by integrating biological organisms with control theory to develop intelligent autonomous systems for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Does the brain behave like a (complex) network? I. Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph theory is now becoming a standard tool in system-level neuroscience. However, endowing observed brain anatomy and dynamics with a complex network structure does not entail that the brain actually works as a network. Asking whether the brain behaves as a network means asking whether network properties count. From the viewpoint of neurophysiology and, possibly, of brain physics, the most substantial issues a network structure may be instrumental in addressing relate to the influence of network properties on brain dynamics and to whether these properties ultimately explain some aspects of brain function. Here, we address the dynamical implications of complex network, examining which aspects and scales of brain activity may be understood to genuinely behave as a network. To do so, we first define the meaning of networkness, and analyse some of its implications. We then examine ways in which brain anatomy and dynamics can be endowed with a network structure and discuss possible ways in which network structure may be shown to represent a genuine organisational principle of brain activity, rather than just a convenient description of its anatomy and dynamics.</description>
