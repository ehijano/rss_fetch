      <title>Delayed phosphate release can highly improve energy efficiency of muscle contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power stroke of myosin and the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) are pivotal in the conversion of ATP's chemical energy into mechanical work. Although the precise sequence of these two events remains a subject of debate, it is generally agreed that Pi-release into the solution doesn't occur instantly upon the binding of a myosin to actin. Here, we examine how Pi-release that is not directly coupled with the power stroke affects muscle contraction. Utilizing a cross-scale mechanics model for a sarcomere unit that integrates the chemomechanical cycle of individual myosins, we find that relatively slow Pi-release can markedly improve energy efficiency during muscle contraction in silico. Our analysis leads us to propose that gradual Pi-release may offer a route to finely adjust the bond strength of an attached myosin, thereby indirectly modulating the power stroke to influence muscle performance. When our model is applied to simulate muscle performance in response to rapid jumps in Pi concentrations, we observe asymmetric rates of force alteration, which corroborate previous experimental findings. Indeed, our model's predictions in the current work are largely consistent with experimental data. This research provides crucial insights into the kinetics of Pi-release within the myosin's chemomechanical cycle and its significant regulatory impact on muscle contraction.</description>

      <title>Flight-Scope: microscopy with microfluidics in microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA working to return humans to the moon and onwards to Mars, it has never been more important to study the impact of altered gravity conditions on biological organisms. These include astronauts but also useful micro-organisms they may bring with them to produce food, medicine, and other useful compounds by synthetic biology. Parabolic flights are one of the most accessible microgravity research platforms but present their own challenges: relatively short periods of altered gravity (~20s) and aircraft vibration. Live-imaging is necessary in these altered-gravity conditions to readout any real-time phenotypes. Here we present Flight-Scope, a new microscopy and microfluidics platform to study dynamic cellular processes during the short, altered gravity periods on parabolic flights. We demonstrated Flight-Scopes capability by performing live and dynamic imaging of fluorescent glucose uptake by yeast, S. cerevisiae, on board an ESA parabolic flight. Flight-Scope operated well in this challenging environment, opening the way for future microgravity experiments on biological organisms.</description>

      <title>An insertable glucose sensor using a compact and cost-effective phosphorescence lifetime imager and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems are emerging for personalized glucose management owing to their lower cost and prolonged durability compared to conventional electrochemical CGMs. Here, we report a computational CGM system, which integrates a biocompatible phosphorescence-based insertable biosensor and a custom-designed phosphorescence lifetime imager (PLI). This compact and cost-effective PLI is designed to capture phosphorescence lifetime images of an insertable sensor through the skin, where the lifetime of the emitted phosphorescence signal is modulated by the local concentration of glucose. Because this phosphorescence signal has a very long lifetime compared to tissue autofluorescence or excitation leakage processes, it completely bypasses these noise sources by measuring the sensor emission over several tens of microseconds after the excitation light is turned off. The lifetime images acquired through the skin are processed by neural network-based models for misalignment-tolerant inference of glucose levels, accurately revealing normal, low (hypoglycemia) and high (hyperglycemia) concentration ranges. Using a 1-mm thick skin phantom mimicking the optical properties of human skin, we performed in vitro testing of the PLI using glucose-spiked samples, yielding 88.8% inference accuracy, also showing resilience to random and unknown misalignments within a lateral distance of ~4.7 mm with respect to the position of the insertable sensor underneath the skin phantom. Furthermore, the PLI accurately identified larger lateral misalignments beyond 5 mm, prompting user intervention for re-alignment. The misalignment-resilient glucose concentration inference capability of this compact and cost-effective phosphorescence lifetime imager makes it an appealing wearable diagnostics tool for real-time tracking of glucose and other biomarkers.</description>

      <title>Jointed Tails Enhance Control of Three-dimensional Body Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tails used as inertial appendages induce body rotations of animals and robots, a phenomenon that is governed largely by the ratio of the body and tail moments of inertia. However, vertebrate tails have more degrees of freedom (e.g., number of joints, rotational axes) than most current theoretical models and robotic tails. To understand how morphology affects inertial appendage function, we developed an optimization-based approach that finds the maximally effective tail trajectory and measures error from a target trajectory. For tails of equal total length and mass, increasing the number of equal-length joints increased the complexity of maximally effective tail motions. When we optimized the relative lengths of tail bones while keeping the total tail length, mass, and number of joints the same, this optimization-based approach found that the lengths match the pattern found in the tail bones of mammals specialized for inertial maneuvering. In both experiments, adding joints enhanced the performance of the inertial appendage, but with diminishing returns, largely due to the total control effort constraint. This optimization-based simulation can compare the maximum performance of diverse inertial appendages that dynamically vary in moment of inertia in 3D space, predict inertial capabilities from skeletal data, and inform the design of robotic inertial appendages.</description>

      <title>Is it Truly Necessary for Bicycle Power Meters to Rapidly Sample Angular Velocity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bicycle Power Meters have become ubiquitous in professional and amateur cycling. These devices claim high levels of accuracy, and this accuracy is indeed essential if they are to serve their purpose as reliable training aids and indicators of improvements in fitness. Power is generally obtained via the independent estimation of torque and angular velocity. Designs vary in the way in which they estimate angular velocity. Some power meters estimate angular velocity many times a second, whereas other power meters compute an average value for each pedal stroke. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether it is necessary to rapidly sample angular velocity in order to obtain accurate power values under conditions of dynamic equilibrium. Countering previous research on the topic, this paper finds that average angular velocity alone is usually sufficient for the purposes of computing power, although there may be certain exceptional circumstances where consideration of harmonics may appreciably improve fidelity.</description>

      <title>Local Volume Concentration, Packing Domains and Scaling Properties of Chromatin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the Self Returning Excluded Volume (SR-EV) model for the structure of chromatin based on stochastic rules and physical interactions. The SR-EV rules of return generate conformationally-defined domains observed by single cell imaging techniques. From nucleosome to chromosome scales, the model captures the overall chromatin organization as a corrugated system, with dense and dilute regions alternating in a manner that resembles the mixing of two disordered bi-continuous phases. This particular organizational topology is a consequence of the multiplicity of interactions and processes occurring in the nuclei, and mimicked by the proposed return rules. Single configuration properties and ensemble averages show a robust agreement between theoretical and experimental results including chromatin volume concentration, contact probability, packing domain identification and size characterization, and packing scaling behavior. Model and experimental results suggest that there is an inherent chromatin organization regardless of the cell character and resistant to an external forcing such as Rad21 degradation.</description>

      <title>Segmentation of dense and multi-species bacterial colonies achieved using models trained on synthetic microscopy images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spread of microbial infections is governed by the self-organization of bacteria on surfaces. Limitations of live imaging techniques make collective behaviors in clinically relevant systems challenging to quantify. Here, novel experimental and image analysis techniques for high-fidelity single-cell segmentation of bacterial colonies are developed. Machine learning-based segmentation models are trained solely using synthetic microscopy images that are processed to look realistic using state-of-the-art image-to-image translation methods, requiring no biophysical modeling. Accurate single-cell segmentation is achieved for densely packed single-species colonies and multi-species colonies of common pathogenic bacteria, even under suboptimal imaging conditions and for both brightfield and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The resulting data provide quantitative insights into the self-organization of bacteria on soft surfaces. Thanks to their high adaptability and relatively simple implementation, these methods promise to greatly facilitate quantitative descriptions of bacterial infections in varied environments.</description>

      <title>Limits on the Evolutionary Rates of Biological Traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07533v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the maximum speed at which biological evolution can occur. I derive inequalities that limit the rate of evolutionary processes driven by natural selection, mutations, or genetic drift. These \emph{rate limits} link the variability in a population to evolutionary rates. In particular, high variances in the fitness of a population and of a quantitative trait allow for fast changes in the trait's average. In contrast, low variability makes a trait less susceptible to random changes due to genetic drift. The results in this article generalize Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection to dynamics that allow for mutations and genetic drift, via trade-off relations that constrain the evolutionary rates of arbitrary traits. The rate limits can be used to probe questions in various evolutionary biology and ecology settings. They apply, for instance, to trait dynamics within or across species or to the evolution of bacteria strains. They apply to any quantitative trait, e.g., from species' weights to the lengths of DNA strands.</description>

      <title>Dynamic control of active droplets using light-responsive chiral liquid crystal environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microscopic active droplets are of interest since they can be used to transport matter from one point to another. The challenge is to control the trajectory. In this work, we demonstrate an approach to control the direction of active droplet propulsion by a photoresponsive cholesteric liquid crystal environment. The active droplet represents a water dispersion of bacterial B. subtilis microswimmers. When placed in a cholesteric, a surfactant-stabilized active droplet distorts the local director field, producing a point defect-hedgehog, which breaks the fore-aft symmetry. The chaotic motion of the bacteria inside the droplet is rectified into directional motion by the asymmetric director field outside the droplet. When the pitch of the cholesteric is altered by visible light irradiation, the asymmetry axis and thus the droplet trajectory realign along a new direction. Droplets realign counterclockwise on exposure to light of 535 nm, and clockwise on exposure to light of 450 nm, as dictated by the photoinduced change in the handedness of the cholesteric. The strategy allows for a non-contact dynamic control of active droplets trajectories and demonstrates the advantage of orientationally ordered media in control of active matter over their isotropic counterparts.</description>

      <title>Metacognitive particles, mental action and the sense of agency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper articulates metacognition using the language of statistical physics and Bayesian mechanics. Metacognitive beliefs, defined as beliefs about beliefs, find a natural description within this formalism, which allows us to define the dynamics of 'metacognitive particles', i.e., systems possessing metacognitive beliefs. We further unpack this typology of metacognitive systems by distinguishing passive and active metacognitive particles, where active particles are endowed with the capacity for mental actions that update the parameters of other beliefs. We provide arguments for the necessity of this architecture in the emergence of a subjective sense of agency and the experience of being separate from the environment. The motivation is to pave the way towards a mathematical and physical understanding of cognition -- and higher forms thereof -- furthering the study and formalization of cognitive science in the language of mathematical physics.</description>
