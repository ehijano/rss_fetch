      <title>Non-Resonant Picosecond Three-Wave Mixing in the Gas Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the experimental observation of non-resonant, second-order optical Sum-Frequency Generation (SFG) in five different atomic and molecular gases. The measured signal is attributed to a SFG process by characterizing its intensity scaling and its polarization behavior. We show that the electric quadrupole mechanism cannot explain the observed trends. Our results demonstrate that SFG in the gas phase is about four orders of magnitude stronger than Third Harmonic Generation (THG) and independent from any externally-applied electric fields. These features make this method suitable for gas number density measurements at the picosecond timescale in reactive flows and plasmas.</description>

      <title>Hybrid silicon all-optical switching devices integrated with two-dimensional material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate hybrid all-optical switching devices that combine silicon nanocavities and two-dimensional semiconductor material. By exploiting the refractive index modulation caused by photo-induced carriers in the two-dimensional material instead of the silicon substrate, we overcome the switching performance limitation imposed by the substrate material. Air-mode photonic crystal nanobeam cavities capable of efficient interaction with two-dimensional materials are fabricated, and molybdenum ditelluride, a two-dimensional material with rapid carrier recombination, is transferred onto the cavities. The molybdenum ditelluride flake is excited by an optical pump pulse to shift the resonant wavelength of the cavity for switching operation. We have successfully achieved all-optical switching operations on the time scale of tens of picoseconds while requiring low switching energies of a few hundred femtojoules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the theoretical framework for understanding the sensing capabilities of optical fibers. We show the distinct advantage of polarization over phase in detecting subhertz environmental processes. Subsequently, we propose a scheme capable of extracting the spectrum of perturbations affecting a specific section at any position along an optical fiber by detecting the state of polarization of the backreflected light. We discuss two examples of earthquake detection and the detection of sea swells and ocean tides through the analysis of the state of polarization of an optical signal reconstructed by the receiver of a transoceanic cable, obtained from an online database.\cite{zhongwenzhan_2020} Finally, we provide the analytical expression for the cross-correlation of the polarization perturbations of two wavelength division multiplexed channels, and show that the analysis of the polarization correlations between adjacent channels can provide valuable insights into the localization of earthquakes.</description>

      <title>Methods for fast and accurate material properties estimate with terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in transmission and reflection with optically thick materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, methods have been proposed to precisely estimate the thickness, refractive index, and attenuation coefficient of a sample. In this article, we propose a new method to compute these parameters. In this method, the attenuation is expressed in function of the refractive index. The theoretical unwrapped angle, which therefore only depends on the refractive index, is then matched to the experimental value. By applying already existing methods for estimating the thickness of an optically thick sample, the dielectric properties of the sample can be deduced. The method is applied both to the transmission and reflection spectroscopy. A demonstration of the method and a comparison with the previous methods are finally shown.</description>

      <title>Gain-controlled taming of recurrent modulation instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how the recurrence phenomenon characteristic of the nonlinear stage of induced modulational instability in a passive fiber is affected by forcing. An additional linear amplification, even if extremely weak, induces separatrix crossing in correspondence of critical values of the gain around which the recurrence process considerably slows down, switching between dynamical orbits of different kind. We present evidence for such phenomenon in a fiber optics experiment where the gain is finely tuned by means of Raman amplification. A theoretical explanation is also provided that matches almost perfectly with our experimental results.</description>

      <title>Full quantitative near-field characterization of strongly coupled exciton-plasmon polaritons in thin-layered WSe2 on a monocrystalline gold platelet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-plasmon polaritons (EPPs) are attractive both for the exploration of fundamental phenomena and applications in nanophotonics. Previous studies of EPPs mainly relied on far-field characterization. Here, using near-field optical microscopy, we quantitatively characterize the dispersion of EPPs existing in 13-nm-thick tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) deposited on a monocrystalline gold platelet. We extract from our experimental data a Rabi splitting of 81 meV, and an experimental effective polariton loss of 55 meV, demonstrating that our system is in the strong-coupling regime. Furthermore, we measure for the first time at visible wavelengths the propagation length of these EPPs for each excitation energy of the dispersion relation. To demonstrate the quantitative nature of our near-field method to obtain the full complex-valued wavevector of EPPs, we use our near-field measurements to predict, via the transfer matrix method, the far-field reflectivities across the exciton resonance. These predictions are in excellent agreement with our experimental far-field measurements. Our findings open the door towards the full near-field study of light-manipulating devices at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional Ray Polaritons in Twisted Asymmetric Stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of a vast repository of van der Waals (vdW) materials supporting polaritons - light coupled to matter excitations - offers a plethora of different possibilities to tailor electromagnetic waves at the subwavelength-scale. In particular, the development of twistoptics - the study of the optical properties of twisted stacks of vdW materials - allows the directional propagation of phonon polaritons (PhPs) along a single spatial direction, which has been coined as canalization. Here we demonstrate a complementary type of nanoscale unidirectional propagation that naturally emerges thanks to twistoptics: unidirectional ray polaritons (URPs). This natural phenomenon arises in two types of twisted hyperbolic stacks: homostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and heterostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, each with very different thicknesses of its constituents. URPs are characterized by the absence of diffraction and the presence of a single phase of the propagating field. Importantly, we demonstrate that this ray behavior can be tuned by means of both relative twist angle and illumination frequency variations. Additionally, an unprecedented "pinwheel-like" propagation emerges at specific twist angles of the homostructure. We show that URPs emerge due to the twist between asymmetrically stacked biaxial slabs, while the shear effect in monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ is of minor importance. Our findings demonstrate a natural way to excite unidirectional ray-like PhPs and offer a unique platform for controlling the propagation of PhPs at the nanoscale with many potential applications like nanoimaging, (bio)-sensing or polaritonic thermal management.</description>

      <title>Highly confined incident-angle-robust surface phonon polariton bound states in the continuum metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squeezing light into subwavelength dimensions is vital for on-chip integration of photonic technologies. One approach to overcome the diffraction limit is coupling light to material excitations, leading to polariton states. Here, we showcase how low-loss mid-infrared surface phonon polaritons enable metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs) with deeply subwavelength unit cells. Utilizing 100 nm thick free-standing silicon carbide membranes, we achieve highly confined qBIC states with a unit cell volume ~ 10^4 times smaller than the diffraction limit. This results in remarkable robustness of the platform against the incident angle that is unique among qBIC systems. We also demonstrate vibrational strong coupling with a thin layer of spin-coated molecules, leveraging the small mode volume. This work introduces phononic qBICs as a novel ultra-confined nanophotonic platform, paving a way for the miniaturization of mid-infrared devices for molecular sensing and thermal radiation engineering.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Limitations with Sparse Inputs by Variational Frameworks (BLIss) in Terahertz Super-Resolution 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data acquisition, image processing, and image quality are the long-lasting issues for terahertz (THz) 3D reconstructed imaging. Existing methods are primarily designed for 2D scenarios, given the challenges associated with obtaining super-resolution (SR) data and the absence of an efficient SR 3D reconstruction framework in conventional computed tomography (CT). Here, we demonstrate BLIss, a new approach for THz SR 3D reconstruction with sparse 2D data input. BLIss seamlessly integrates conventional CT techniques and variational framework with the core of the adapted Euler-Elastica-based model. The quantitative 3D image evaluation metrics, including the standard deviation of Gaussian, mean curvatures, and the multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), validate the superior smoothness and fidelity achieved with our variational framework approach compared with conventional THz CT modal. Beyond its contributions to advancing THz SR 3D reconstruction, BLIss demonstrates potential applicability in other imaging modalities, such as X-ray and MRI. This suggests extensive impacts on the broader field of imaging applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nanoscale carrier dynamics induced by light excitation is the key to unlocking futuristic devices and innovative functionalities in advanced materials. Optical pump-probe scanning tunneling microscopy (OPP-STM) has opened a window to these phenomena. However, mastering the combination of ultrafast pulsed lasers with STM requires high expertise and effort. We have shattered this barrier and developed a compact OPP-STM system accessible to all. This system precisely controls laser pulse timing electrically and enables stable laser irradiation on sample surfaces. Furthermore, by applying this technique to atomic force microscopy (AFM), we have captured time-resolved force signals with an exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratio. Originating from the dipole-dipole interactions, these signals provide insights into the carrier dynamics on sample surfaces, which are activated by photo-illumination. These technologies are promising as powerful tools for exploring a wide range of photoinduced phenomena in conductive and insulating materials.</description>

      <title>Scaling Enhancement of Photon Blockade in Output Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon blockade enhancement is an exciting and promising subject that has been well studied for photons in cavities. However, whether photon blockade can be enhanced in the output fields remains largely unexplored. We show that photon blockade can be greatly enhanced in the mixing output field of a nonlinear cavity and an auxiliary (linear) cavity, where no direct coupling between the nonlinear and auxiliary cavities is needed. We uncover a biquadratic scaling relation between the second-order correlation of the photons in the output field and intracavity nonlinear interaction strength, in contrast to a quadratic scaling relation for the photons in a nonlinear cavity. We identify that this scaling enhancement of photon blockade in the output field is induced by the destructive interference between two of the paths for two photons passing through the two cavities. We then extend the theory to the experimentally feasible Jaynes-Cummings model consisting of a two-level system strongly coupled to one of the two uncoupled cavities, and also predict a biquadratic scaling law in the mixing output field. Our proposed scheme is universal and can be extended to enhance blockade in other bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Doppler-assisted quantum resonances through swappable excitation pathways in Potassium vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of two additional sub-natural line width quantum interference in the $D_2$ manifold of $^{39}K$ vapor, in addition to the usual single Electromagnetically induced transparency peak. The other two features appear exclusively because $^{39}K$ ground hyperfine splitting is smaller than the Doppler broadened absorption profile. This allows probe and control beams to swap their transition pathways. The control beam detuning captures the nature of the coherence, therefore an unusual phenomenon of conversion from perfect transparency to enhanced absorption is observed and explained by utilizing adiabatic elimination of the excited state in the Master equation. Controlling such dark and bright resonances leads to new applications in quantum technologies viz. frequency offset laser stabilization and long-lived quantum memory.</description>

      <title>Shaping entangled photons through thick scattering media using an advanced wave beacon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entangled photons provide transformative new paths in the fields of communication, sensing, and computing. However, when entangled photons propagate through a complex medium such as a biological tissue or a turbulent atmosphere, their correlations are scrambled. Using wavefront shaping to compensate for the scattering and retrieve the two-photon correlations is challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the two-photon signal. While previous works partly addressed this challenge by using feedback from a strong classical laser beam that co-propagates with the entangled photons, such methods frequently depend on assumptions about the complex medium, limiting the applicability of quantum wavefront shaping. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a new feedback mechanism that is inspired by Klyshko's advanced wave picture, in which the classical laser beam counter-propagates with one of the entangled photons and co-propagates with the other. The new Klyshko feedback allows compensation of scattering in thick samples and even in situations where each photon propagates through a different scattering medium. Since the advanced wave picture applies whenever optical reciprocity is valid, such Klyshko optimization can be utilized across a wide range of configurations, offering a robust and alignment-free setup. We therefore believe this protocol will open the door for real-world applications of quantum wavefront shaping.</description>

Abstract: We show how the area theorem is applicable to the analytical description of the nonlinear interaction of surface plasmon modes with resonant two-level atoms. A closed analytical solution is obtained, which shows that surface plasmons can form long-propagating $2\pi$ pulses when interacting with an optically dense two-level atomic ensemble. The possible applications of the surface pulse area theorem and the conditions for the detection of $2\pi$ surface plasmon pulses are discussed.</description>

      <title>Rapid non-destructive inspection of sub-surface defects in 3D printed alumina through 30 layers with 7 {\mu}m depth resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of additive manufacturing (AM) processes for industrial fabrication has grown rapidly over the last ten years. The most well-known AM technologies are fused deposition modelling and stereolithography techniques. One particular industry where 3D printing is advantageous over traditional fabrication techniques is within ceramic components due to its flexibility. To establish a new and improved level of print quality and reduce resource consumption in the 3D printing ceramics industry, there is a need for fast integrated, sub-surface and non-destructive inspection (NDI) with high resolution. Several techniques have already been developed for high-resolution NDI, such as X-ray computed tomography (XCT), but none of them are both fast, integrable, and non-destructive while allowing deep penetration with high resolution. In this study, we demonstrate sub-surface monitoring of 3D printed alumina parts to a depth of $\sim$0.7 mm in images of 400$\times$2048 pixels with a lateral resolution of 30$~\mu$m and depth (or axial) resolution of 7$~\mu$m . The results were achieved using mid-infrared optical coherence tomography (MIR OCT) based on a MIR supercontinuum laser with a 4$~\mu$m center wavelength. We find that it is possible to detect individual printed ceramic layers and track predefined defects through all four processing steps: green, preconditioned, debinded, and sintered. Our results also demonstrate how a defect in the green phase could affect the final product. Based on the understanding of how defects develop in maturing printed parts, we pave the way for NDI integration in AM, which can be combined with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms for automatic defect classification in volume production of a new standard of high quality ceramic components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.15469v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated photonics has been a promising platform for analog quantum simulation of condensed matter phenomena in strongly correlated systems. To that end, we explore the implementation of all-photonic quantum simulators in coupled cavity arrays with integrated ensembles of spectrally disordered emitters. Our model is reflective of color center ensembles integrated into photonic crystal cavity arrays. Using the Quantum Master Equation and the Effective Hamiltonian approaches, we study energy band formation and wavefunction properties in the open quantum Tavis-Cummings-Hubbard framework. We find conditions for polariton creation and (de)localization under experimentally relevant values of disorder in emitter frequencies, cavity resonance frequencies, and emitter-cavity coupling rates. To quantify these properties, we introduce two metrics, the polaritonic and nodal participation ratios, that characterize the light-matter hybridization and the node delocalization of the wavefunction, respectively. These new metrics combined with the Effective Hamiltonian approach prove to be a powerful toolbox for cavity quantum electrodynamical engineering of solid-state systems.</description>

Abstract: The speed-dependent spectral line profiles collapse into a simple Lorentz profile in the regime dominated by the velocity-changing collisions. We derive general formulas for the effective width and shift of the Lorentzian for arbitrary speed-dependent collisional broadening and shift and velocity-changing collision operators. For a quadratic speed dependence of collisional broadening and shift, and the billiard ball model of velocity-changing collisions, we provide simple analytical expressions for the effective Lorentzian width and shift. We show that the effective Lorentzian width and shift split into components originating from the: well-known Dicke-narrowed Doppler width, speed-averaged collisional broadening and shift, their speed dependencies, and a product term that mixes the contributions of the broadening and shift speed dependencies. We show how the components depend on rates of speed-changing and velocity-changing collisions related to the perturber/absorber mass ratio. We validate analytical formulas numerically on example of H$_{2}$ transition perturbed by He.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic control of nonlinear photonic-crystal polaritons in a monolayer semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integration of 2D semiconductors with photonic crystal slabs provides an attractive approach to achieve strong light--matter coupling and exciton-polariton formation in a planar chip-compatible geometry. However, for the development of practical devices, it is crucial that the polariton excitations in the structure are easily tunable and exhibit strong nonlinear response. Here we study neutral and charged exciton-polaritons in an electrostatically gated planar photonic crystal slab with an embedded monolayer semiconductor MoSe$_2$ and experimentally demonstrate strong polariton nonlinearity, which can be tuned via gate voltage. We find that modulation of dielectric environment within the photonic crystal results in the formation of two distinct resonances with significantly different nonlinear response, which enables optical switching with ultrashort laser pulses. Our results open new avenues towards development of active polaritonic devices in a compact chip-compatible implementation.</description>
