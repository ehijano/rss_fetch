      <title>Variable Stars in M31 Stellar Clusters from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variable stars in stellar clusters can offer key constraints on stellar evolution and pulsation models, utilising estimates of host cluster properties to constrain stellar physical parameters. We present a catalogue of 86 luminous (F814W&lt;19) variable stars in M31 clusters identified by mining the archival Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey using a combination of statistical analysis of sparse PHAT light curves and difference imaging. We determine the evolutionary phases and initial masses of these variable stars by matching them with theoretical isochrones generated using host cluster properties from the literature. We calculate the probability of PHAT photometry being blended due to the highly crowded nature of cluster environments for each cluster-variable star, using these probabilities to inform our level of confidence in the derived properties of each star. Our 86 cluster-variable stars have initial masses between 0.8--67 $M_{\odot}$. Their evolutionary phases span the main sequence, more evolved hydrogen- and helium-burning phases, and the post-asymptotic giant branch. We identify numerous candidate variable star types: RV Tauri variables, red supergiants and slowly pulsating B-type supergiants, along with Wolf Rayet stars, $\alpha$ Cygni and Mira variables, a classical Cepheid and a possible super-asymptotic giant. We characterise 12 cluster-variable stars at higher confidence based on their difference image quality and lower blending probability. Ours is the first systematic study of variable stars in extragalactic stellar clusters leveraging the superior resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope and demonstrating the unique power of stellar clusters in constraining the fundamental properties of variable stars.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Protostellar Outflow Opening Angles and the Implications for the Growth of Protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use 1-4" (300-1200 au) resolution 12CO(2-1) data from the MASSES (Mass Assembly of Stellar Systems and their Evolution with the SMA) project to measure the projected opening angles of 46 protostellar outflows in the Perseus Molecular Cloud, 37 of which are measured with sufficiently high confidence to use in further analysis. We find that there is a statistically significant difference in the distributions of outflow opening angles for Class 0 and Class I outflows, with a distinct lack of both wide-angle Class 0 outflows and highly collimated Class I outflows. Synthesizing our results with several previous studies, we find that outflows widen with age through the Class 0 stage but do not continue to widen in the Class I stage. The maximum projected opening angle reached is approximately 90 degrees +/- 20 degrees, with the transition between widening and remaining constant occurring near the boundary between the Class 0 and Class I phases of evolution. While the volume fractions occupied by these outflows are no more than a few tens of percent of the total core volume, at most, recent theoretical work suggests outflows may still be capable of playing a central role in setting the low star formation efficiencies of 25%-50% observed on core scales.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical shear mixing in subsonic boundary layers and its role in the thermonuclear explosion of classical novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition zone between the white dwarf (WD) envelope and a circumstellar accretion disk in classical novae, the boundary layer, is a region of strong dissipation and intense vorticity. In this strongly sheared layer, the hydrogen-rich accreted gas is expected to mix with the underlying WD outermost layers so the conditions for the onset of the thermonuclear runaway (TNR) in classical nova will be different from the the standard treatment of the onset and subsequent mixing. We applied the critical layer instability (CLI) to the boundary between a disk-accreted H/He zone and the C/O - or O/Ne - rich outer layers of a mass-accreting WD in a cataclysmic binary and then used the resulting structure as input to one-dimensional nuclear-hydrodynamic simulations of the nova outburst. We simulated the subsonic mixing process in two dimensions for conditions appropriate for the inner disk and a CO 0.8 solar mass and CO and ONe 1.25 solar mass WDs using the compressible hydrodynamics code PLUTO. The resulting compositional profile was then imported into the one-dimensional nuclear-hydrodynamics code SHIVA to simulate the triggering and growth rate for the TNR and subsequent envelope ejection. We find that the deep shear-driven mixing changes the triggering and development of the TNR. In particular, the time to reach peak temperature is significantly shorter, and the ejected mass and maximum velocity of the ejecta substantially greater, than the current treatment. The 7Li yield is reduced by about an order of magnitude relative to the current treatments.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the chemical fingerprint of phosphorus-rich stars II. Heavy-element abundances from UVES/VLT spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atmospheres of phosphorus-rich stars have been shown to contain between 10 and 100 times more P than our Sun. Given its crucial role as an essential element for life, it is especially necessary to uncover the origin of P-rich stars to gain insights into the still unknown nucleosynthetic formation pathways of P in our Galaxy. Our objective is to obtain the extensive chemical abundance inventory of four P-rich stars, covering a large range of heavy elements. This characterization will serve as a milestone for the nuclear astrophysics community to uncover the processes that form the unique chemical fingerprint of P-rich stars. We performed a detailed 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium abundance analysis on the optical UVES spectra of four P-rich stars. Our focus lay on the neutron-capture elements, in particular, on the elements between Sr and Ba, as well as on Pb, as they provide valuable constraints to nucleosynthesis calculations. We compare the obtained abundances with three different nucleosynthetic scenarios: a single i-process, a double i-process, and a combination of s- and i-processes. We have performed the most extensive abundance analysis of P-rich stars to date, including the elements between Sr and Ba, such as Ag, which are rarely measured in any type of stars. We found overabundances with respect to solar in the s-process peak elements, accompanied by an extremely high Ba abundance and slight enhancements in some elements between Rb and Sn. No global solution explaining all four stars could be found for the nucleosynthetic origin of the pattern. The model that produces the least number of discrepancies in three of the four stars is a combination of s- and i-processes, but the current lack of extensive multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations to follow the occurrence of the i-process in different types of stars makes this scenario highly uncertain.</description>

      <title>Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries. Paper XX. HO Tel checkout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the detached eclipsing binary system HO Telescopii, which contains two A-type stars in a circular orbit of period 1.613 d. We use light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which observed HO Tel in three sectors, to determine its photometric properties and a precise orbital ephemeris. We augment these results with radial velocity measurements from Surgit et al. to determine the masses and radii of the component stars: M_A = 1.906 +/- 0.031 Msun, M_B = 1.751 +/- 0.034 Msun, R_A = 2.296 +/- 0.027 Rsun and R_B = 2.074 +/- 0.028 Rsun. Combined with temperature measurements from Surgit et al. and optical-infrared apparent magnitudes from the literature, we find a distance to the system of 280.8 +/- 4.6 pc which agrees well with the distance from the Gaia DR3 parallax measurement. Theoretical predictions do not quite match the properties of the system, and there are small discrepancies in measurements of the spectroscopic orbits of the stars. Future observations from Gaia will allow further investigation of these issues.</description>

      <title>The solar beryllium abundance revisited with 3D non-LTE models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present-day abundance of beryllium in the solar atmosphere provides clues about mixing mechanisms within stellar interiors. However, abundance determinations based on the Be II 313.107 nm line are prone to systematic errors due to imperfect model spectra. These errors arise from missing continuous opacity in the UV, a significant unidentified blend at 313.102 nm, departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), and microturbulence and macroturbulence fudge parameters associated with one-dimensional (1D) hydrostatic model atmospheres. Although these factors have been discussed in the literature, no study has yet accounted for all of them simultaneously. To address this, we present 3D non-LTE calculations for neutral and ionised beryllium in the Sun. We used these models to derive the present-day solar beryllium abundance, calibrating the missing opacity on high resolution solar irradiance data and the unidentified blend on the centre-to-limb variation. We find a surface abundance of 1.21 $\pm$ 0.05 dex, which is significantly lower than the value of 1.38 dex that has been commonly adopted since 2004. Taking the protosolar beryllium abundance via CI chondrites, 1.32 $\pm$ 0.04 dex, our result implies that the surface abundance of beryllium has been depleted by 0.11 $\pm$ 0.06 dex, or 22 $\pm$ 11%. This is in tension with standard solar models, which predict negligible depletion, as well as with contemporary solar models that have extra mixing calibrated on the abundances of helium and lithium, which predict excessive depletion. These discrepancies highlight the need for further improvements to the physics in solar and stellar models.</description>

      <title>Impact of HI cooling and study of accretion disks in AGB wind-companion smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution observations reveal that the outflows of evolved low- and intermediate-mass stars harbour complex morphological structures that are linked to the presence of one or multiple companions. Hydrodynamical simulations provide a way to study the impact of a companion on the shaping of the AGB outflow. Using smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations of a mass losing AGB star with a binary companion, we study the impact of including HI atomic line cooling on the flow morphology and on the properties of accretion disks that form around the companion. We perform high-resolution 3D SPH simulations of the interaction of a solar-mass companion with the outflow of an AGB star using different wind velocities and eccentricities. We compare the models properties computed with and without the inclusion of HI cooling. The inclusion of HI cooling produces a large decrease in the temperature up to one order of magnitude in the region closely surrounding the companion star. As a consequence, morphological irregularities and relatively energetic outflows that were obtained without HI cooling no longer appear. In case of an eccentric orbit and low wind velocity, the morphologies are still highly asymmetric, but the same structures recur at every orbital period, making the morphology more regular. Flared accretion disks with a (sub)-Keplerian velocity profile form around the companion in all models, provided the accretion radius is small enough. The disks have radial sizes ranging from about 0.4 to 0.9 au. For the considered wind velocities, mass accretion onto the companion is up to 2 times higher than predicted by the BHL rate, and ranges between 0.04-0.21 times the AGB wind mass loss rate. The lower the wind velocity at the location of the companion, the larger and the more massive the disk, and the higher the mass accretion efficiency.</description>

      <title>Butterfly Diagram and Other Properties of Plage Areas from Kodaikanal Ca II K Photographs Covering 1904-2007</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ca II K observations of the Sun have a great potential for probing the Sun's magnetism and activity, as well as for reconstructing solar irradiance. The Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (KoSO) in India, houses one of the most prominent Ca II K archives, spanning from 1904 to 2007, obtained under the same experimental conditions over a century, a feat very few other sites have achieved. However, the KoSO Ca II K archive suffers from several inconsistencies (e.g., missing/incorrect timestamps of observations and orientation of some images) which have limited the use of the archive. This study is a step towards bringing the KoSO archive to its full potential. We did this by developing an automatic method to orient the images more accurately than in previous studies. Furthermore, we included more data than in earlier studies (considering images that could not previously be analyzed by other techniques as well as 2845 newly digitized images), while also accounting for mistakes in the observational date/time. These images were accurately processed to identify plage regions along with their locations, enabling us to construct the butterfly diagram of plage areas from the entire KoSO Ca II K archive covering 1904-2007. Our butterfly diagram shows significantly fewer data gaps compared to earlier versions due to the larger set of data used in this study. Moreover, our butterfly diagram is consistent with Sp\"orer's law for sunspots, validating our automatic image orientation method. Additionally, we found that the mean latitude of plage areas calculated over the entire period is 20.5%+/-2.0 higher than that of sunspots, irrespective of the phase or the strength of the solar cycle. We also studied the North-South asymmetry showing that the northern hemisphere dominated plage areas during solar cycles 19 and 20, while the southern hemisphere dominated during solar cycles 21--23.</description>

      <title>The JWST/NIRISS Deep Spectroscopic Survey for Young Brown Dwarfs and Free-Floating Planets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery and characterization of free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPMOs) is fundamental to our understanding of star and planet formation. Here we report results from an extremely deep spectroscopic survey of the young star cluster NGC1333 using NIRISS WFSS on the James Webb Space Telescope. The survey is photometrically complete to K~21, and includes useful spectra for objects as faint as K~20.5. The observations cover 19 known brown dwarfs, for most of which we confirm spectral types using NIRISS spectra. We discover six new candidates with L-dwarf spectral types that are plausible planetary-mass members of NGC1333, with estimated masses between 5-15 MJup. One, at ~5 MJup, shows clear infrared excess emission and is a good candidate to be the lowest mass object known to have a disk. We do not find any objects later than mid-L spectral type (M &lt; ~4 MJup). The paucity of Jupiter-mass objects, despite the survey's unprecedented sensitivity, suggests that our observations reach the lowest mass objects formed like stars in NGC1333. Our findings put the fraction of FFPMOs in NGC1333 at ~10% of the number of cluster members, significantly more than expected from the typical log-normal stellar mass function. We also search for wide binaries in our images and report a young brown dwarf with a planetary-mass companion.</description>

      <title>Multi-iron subpopulations in Liller 1 from high resolution H-band spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a high resolution chemical study of a representative sample of 21 luminous giant stars of Liller~1, a complex stellar system in the Galactic bulge, based on H band spectra acquired with the Near InfraRed Spectrograph at KeckII. 15 stars turn out to have a subsolar iron abundance and enhanced [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Al/Fe], likely old that formed early and quickly from gas mainly enriched by type~II supernovae, and 6 stars with supersolar iron and roughly solar-scaled [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Al/Fe], likely younger, thus formed at later epochs from gas also enriched by type~Ia supernovae. Moreover, both subpopulations show enhanced [N/Fe], as in the bulge field, about solar-scaled [V/Fe], and depletion of [C/Fe] and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C with respect to the solar values, indicating the occurrence of significant mixing in the stellar interiors of these evolved stars. The current study has also made evident that the sub-solar subpopulation shows some structuring, and the presence of a third subcomponent with iron content and [$\alpha$/Fe] enhancement somewhat intermediate between the metal-poor and metal-rich main subpopulations, has been statistically assessed, providing the chemical signature of an extended star formation with multiple bursts and of some self-enrichment.</description>

      <title>Peering into the Heart of the Giant Molecular Cloud G148.24+00.41: A Deep Near-infrared View of the Newly Hatched Cluster FSR 655</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed near-infrared study of an embedded cluster located in the hub of the giant molecular cloud G148.24+00.41 of mass $\sim$10$^5$ $M_\odot$, with the TANSPEC instrument mounted on the 3.6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope. The hub is located near the geometric center of the cloud and represents its most massive clump. We studied the central 2 pc $\times$ 2 pc area of the hub with 5$\sigma$ limiting magnitudes of 20.5, 20.1, and 18.6 mag in the $J$, $H$, and $K_s$ bands, respectively. Using the $K_s$-band luminosity function and comparing it with the synthetic clusters, we obtained the age of the cluster as $\sim$0.5 Myr, which was found to corroborate well with the visual extinction versus the age of nearby embedded clusters. We find that the present mass of the cluster is around $\sim$180 $M_\odot$, and the cluster is currently forming stars at a rate of $\sim$330 $M_\odot$ $\rm{Myr}^{-1}$, with an efficiency of $\sim$20%. The cluster is connected to an extended gas reservoir through a filamentary network; thus, we hypothesize that the cluster has the potential to become a richer cluster in a few Myr of time.</description>

      <title>M giants with IGRINS IV. Identification and characterization of a near-IR line of the s-element Barium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron-capture elements represent an important nucleosynthetic channel in the study of the Galactic Chemical Evolution of stellar populations. For stellar populations behind significant extinction, such as those in the Galactic Center and along the Galactic plane, abundance analyses based on near-IR spectra are necessary. Previously, spectral lines from the neutron-capture elements such as copper (Cu), cerium (Ce), neodymium (Nd), and ytterbium (Yb) have been identified in the H band, while yttrium (Y) lines have been identified in the K band. Due to the scarcity of spectral lines from neutron-capture elements in the near-IR, the addition of useful spectral lines from other neutron-capture elements is highly desirable. The aim of this work is to identify and characterise a spectral line suitable for abundance determination from the most commonly used s-process element, namely barium. We observed near-IR spectra of 37 M giants in the solar neighbourhood at high S/N and high spectral resolution using the IGRINS spectrometer on the GEMINI South telescope. Using a manual spectral synthesis method, we determined the stellar parameters for these stars and derived the barium abundance from the Ba line (6s5d $^3$D$_2 \rightarrow$ 6s6p $^3$P$^o_2$) at $\lambda_\mathrm{air}=23\,253.56\,$\AA\ in the K band. We demonstrate that the Ba line in the K band at 2.33\,\mic\ ($\lambda$23253.56) is useful for abundance analysis from spectra of M giants. The line becomes progressively weaker at higher temperatures and is only useful in M giants and the coolest K giants at supersolar metallicities. We can now add Ba to the trends of the heavy elements Cu, Zn, Y, Ce, Nd, and Yb, which can be retrieved from high-resolution H- and K-band spectra. This opens up the study of nucleosynthetic channels, including the s-process and the r-process, in dust-obscured populations such as the Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>The rates and host galaxies of pair-instability supernovae through cosmic time: Predictions from BPASS and IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) have long been predicted to be the final fates of near-zero-metallicity very massive stars ($Z &lt; Z_\odot/3$, $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{ZAMS} \gtrsim 140 \mathrm{M}_\odot$). However, no definite PISN has been observed to date, leaving theoretical modelling validation open. To investigate the observability of these explosive transients, we combine detailed stellar evolution models for PISNe formation, computed from the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis code suite, BPASS, with the star formation history of all individual computational elements in the Illustris-TNG simulation. This allows us to compute comic PISN rates and predict their host galaxy properties. Of particular importance is that IllustrisTNG galaxies do not have uniform metallicities throughout, with metal-enriched galaxies often harbouring metal-poor pockets of gas where PISN progenitors may form. Accounting for the chemical inhomogeneities within these galaxies, we find that the peak redshift of PISNe formation is $z=3.5$ instead of the value of $z=6$ when ignoring chemical inhomogeneities within galaxies. Furthermore, the rate increases by an order of magnitude from 1.9 to 29 PISN Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ at $z=0$, if the chemical inhomogeneities are considered. Using state-of-the-art theoretical PISN light curves, we find an observed rate of $13.8$ (1.2) visible PISNe per year for the Euclid-Deep survey, or $83$ (7.3) over the six-year lifetime of the mission when considering chemically inhomogeneous (homogenous) systems. Interestingly, only 12 per cent of helium PISN progenitors are sufficiently massive to power a super-luminous supernova event, which can potentially explain why PISN identification in time-domain surveys remains elusive and progress requires dedicated strategies.</description>

      <title>Stratified Resistive Tearing Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resistive tearing instabilities are common in fluids that are highly electrically conductive and carry strong currents. We determine the effect of stable stratification on the tearing instability under the Boussinesq approximation. Our results generalise previous work that considered only specific parameter regimes, and we show that the length scale of the fastest growing mode depends non-monotonically on the stratification strength. We confirm our analytical results by solving the linearised equations numerically, and we discuss whether the instability could operate in the solar tachocline.</description>

      <title>The Valuable Long-period Cluster Cepheid KQ Scorpii and other Calibration Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Cepheid KQ Sco is a valuable anchor for the distance scale because of its long pulsation period ($28^{\rm d}.7$) and evidence implying membership in the open cluster UBC 1558. Analyses tied to Gaia DR3 astrometry, photometry, spectroscopy, radial velocities, and 2MASS-VVV photometry indicate a common distance of $2.15\pm0.15$ kpc (\citealt{lin21} DR3 corrections applied). Additional cluster Cepheid candidates requiring follow-up are identified, and it's suggested that a team of international researchers could maintain a cluster Cepheid database to guide the broader community to cases where consensus exists.</description>

      <title>The R-Process Alliance: Fifth Data Release from the Search for R-Process-Enhanced Metal-poor Stars in the Galactic Halo with the GTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the abundance pattern of metal-poor stars and the production of heavy elements through various nucleosynthesis processes offers crucial insights into the chemical evolution of the Milky Way, revealing primary sites and major sources of rapid neutron-capture process ($r$-process) material in the Universe. In this fifth data release from the $R$-Process Alliance, we present the detailed chemical abundances of 41 faint (down to V = 15.8) and extremely metal-poor (down to [Fe/H] = -3.3) halo stars selected from the R-Process Alliance (RPA). We obtained high-resolution spectra for these objects with the HORuS spectrograph on the Gran Telescopio Canarias. We measure the abundances of light, alpha, Fe-peak, and neutron-capture elements. We report the discovery of five CEMP, one limited-$r$, three $r$-I, and four $r$-II stars, and six Mg-poor stars. We also identify one star of a possible globular cluster origin at an extremely low metallicity at [Fe/H] = -3.0. This adds to the growing evidence of a lower limit metallicity floor for globular cluster abundances. We use the abundances of Fe-peak elements and the alpha-elements to investigate the contributions from different nucleosynthesis channels in the progenitor supernovae. We find the distribution of [Mg/Eu] as a function of [Fe/H] to have different enrichment levels, indicating different possible pathways and sites of their production. We also reveal differences in the trends of the neutron-capture element abundances of Sr, Ba, and Eu of various $r$-I and $r$-II stars from the RPA data releases, which provide constraints on their nucleosynthesis sites and subsequent evolution.</description>

      <title>On the Age and Metallicity of Planet-hosting Triple Star Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a statistical analysis of the ages and metallicities of triple stellar systems that are known to host exoplanets. With controversial cases disregarded, so far 27 of those systems have been identified. Our analysis, based on an exploratory approach, shows that those systems are on average notably younger than stars situated in the solar neighborhood. Though the statistical significance of this result is not fully established, the most plausible explanation is a possible double selection effect due to the relatively high mass of planet-hosting stars of those systems (which spend less time on the main-sequence than low-mass stars) and that planets in triple stellar systems may be long-term orbitally unstable. The stellar metallicities are on average solar-like; however, owing to the limited number of data, this result is not inconsistent with the previous finding that stars with planets tend to be metal-rich as the deduced metallicity distribution is relatively broad.</description>

      <title>To Be or not to Be: the role of rotation in modeling Galactic Be X-ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Be X-ray binaries (Be-XRBs) are one of the largest subclasses of high-mass X-ray binaries, comprised of a rapidly rotating Be star and neutron star companion in an eccentric orbit, intermittently accreting material from a decretion disk around the donor. Originating from binary stellar evolution, Be-XRBs are of significant interest to binary population synthesis (BPS) studies, encapsulating the physics of supernovae, common envelope, and mass transfer (MT). Using the state-of-the-art BPS code, POSYDON, which relies on pre-computed grids of detailed binary stellar evolution models, we investigate the Galactic Be-XRB population. POSYDON incorporates stellar rotation self-consistently during MT phases, enabling detailed examination of the rotational distribution of Be stars in multiple phases of evolution. Our fiducial BPS and Be-XRB model align well with the orbital properties of Galactic Be-XRBs, emphasizing the role of rotational constraints. Our modeling reveals a rapidly rotating population ($\omega/\omega_\mathrm{crit} \gtrsim 0.3$) of Be-XRB-like systems with a strong peak at intermediate rotation rates ($\omega/\omega_\mathrm{crit} \simeq 0.6$) in close alignment with observations. All Be-XRBs undergo a MT phase before the first compact object forms, with over half experiencing a second MT phase from a stripped helium companion (Case BB). Computing rotationally-limited MT efficiencies and applying them to our population, we derive a physically motivated MT efficiency distribution, finding that most Be-XRBs have undergone highly non-conservative MT ($\bar{\beta}_\mathrm{rot} \simeq 0.05$). Our study underscores the importance of detailed angular momentum modeling during MT in interpreting Be-XRB populations, emphasizing this population as a key probe for the stability and efficiency of MT in interacting binaries.</description>

      <title>BxC Toolkit: Generating Tailored Turbulent 3D Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent states are ubiquitous in plasmas and the understanding of turbulence is fundamental in modern astrophysics. Numerical simulations, which are the state-of-the-art approach to the study of turbulence, require substantial computing resources. Recently, attention shifted to methods for generating synthetic turbulent magnetic fields, affordably creating fields with parameter-controlled characteristic features of turbulence. In this context, the BxC toolkit was developed and validated against direct numerical simulations (DNS) of isotropic turbulent magnetic fields. Here, we demonstrate novel extensions of BxC to generate realistic turbulent magnetic fields in a fast, controlled, geometric approach. First, we perform a parameter study to determine quantitative relations between the BxC input parameters and desired characteristic features of the turbulent power spectrum, such as the extent of the inertial range, its spectral slope, and the injection and dissipation scale. Second, we introduce in the model a set of structured background magnetic fields B0, as a natural and more realistic extension to the purely isotropic turbulent fields. Third, we extend the model to include anisotropic turbulence properties in the generated fields. With all these extensions combined, our tool can quickly generate any desired structured magnetic field with controlled, anisotropic turbulent fluctuations, faster by orders of magnitude with respect to DNSs. These can be used, e.g., to provide initial conditions for DNS simulations or easily generate synthetic data for many astrophysical settings, all at otherwise unaffordable resolutions.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational field of a clump of ultralight axion like particles (ALPs) in its core with a rotating binary system of dwarf stars is computed. It is established that the induced quadrupole mass moment of the clump is controlled parametrically by the $M_a/M$ mass ratio of the axion clump and the the binary core.</description>
