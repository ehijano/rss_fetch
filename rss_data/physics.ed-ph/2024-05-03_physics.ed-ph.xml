      <title>Bias in physics peer recognition does not explain gaps in perceived recognition</title>

Abstract: Gaining recognition as a physics person from peers is an important contributor to undergraduate students' physics identity and, in turn, their success in physics courses. Previous research has separately demonstrated that women perceive less recognition from peers than men in their physics courses (perceived recognition) and that women receive fewer nominations from their peers as strong in their physics course than men (received recognition). The relationship between perceived and received peer recognition, however, is not well understood. Here we test three plausible models for this relationship. We conduct a large-scale, quantitative study of over 1,600 students enrolled in introductory physics courses at eight different institutions. We directly compare student gender, perceived recognition, and received recognition, controlling for other student demographics and course-level variability. Results show with high precision that, for students receiving the same amount of recognition, and having the same race or ethnicity, academic year, and major, women report significantly lower perceived recognition than men. These findings offer important implications for the design of effective instructional interventions.</description>
