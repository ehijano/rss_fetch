      <title>Computing Systemic Risk Measures with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates systemic risk measures for stochastic financial networks of explicitly modelled bilateral liabilities. We extend the notion of systemic risk measures from Biagini, Fouque, Fritelli and Meyer-Brandis (2019) to graph structured data. In particular, we focus on an aggregation function that is derived from a market clearing algorithm proposed by Eisenberg and Noe (2001). In this setting, we show the existence of an optimal random allocation that distributes the overall minimal bailout capital and secures the network. We study numerical methods for the approximation of systemic risk and optimal random allocations. We propose to use permutation equivariant architectures of neural networks like graph neural networks (GNNs) and a class that we name (extended) permutation equivariant neural networks ((X)PENNs). We compare their performance to several benchmark allocations. The main feature of GNNs and (X)PENNs is that they are permutation equivariant with respect to the underlying graph data. In numerical experiments we find evidence that these permutation equivariant methods are superior to other approaches.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Approach to Stock Price Prediction: Comparing RNN and Mixture of Experts Models Across Different Volatility Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the effectiveness of a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model for stock price prediction by comparing it to a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and a linear regression model. The MoE framework combines an RNN for volatile stocks and a linear model for stable stocks, dynamically adjusting the weight of each model through a gating network. Results indicate that the MoE approach significantly improves predictive accuracy across different volatility profiles. The RNN effectively captures non-linear patterns for volatile companies but tends to overfit stable data, whereas the linear model performs well for predictable trends. The MoE model's adaptability allows it to outperform each individual model, reducing errors such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Future work should focus on enhancing the gating mechanism and validating the model with real-world datasets to optimize its practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Stock Price Prediction and Traditional Models: An Approach to Achieve Short-, Medium- and Long-Term Goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comparative analysis of deep learning models and traditional statistical methods for stock price prediction uses data from the Nigerian stock exchange. Historical data, including daily prices and trading volumes, are employed to implement models such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA). These models are assessed over three-time horizons: short-term (1 year), medium-term (2.5 years), and long-term (5 years), with performance measured by Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The stability of the time series is tested using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. Results reveal that deep learning models, particularly LSTM, outperform traditional methods by capturing complex, nonlinear patterns in the data, resulting in more accurate predictions. However, these models require greater computational resources and offer less interpretability than traditional approaches. The findings highlight the potential of deep learning for improving financial forecasting and investment strategies. Future research could incorporate external factors such as social media sentiment and economic indicators, refine model architectures, and explore real-time applications to enhance prediction accuracy and scalability.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Generative AI for Economic Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use generative AI to extract managerial expectations about their economic outlook from over 120,000 corporate conference call transcripts. The overall measure, AI Economy Score, robustly predicts future economic indicators such as GDP growth, production, and employment, both in the short term and to 10 quarters. This predictive power is incremental to that of existing measures, including survey forecasts. Moreover, industry and firm-level measures provide valuable information about sector-specific and individual firm activities. Our findings suggest that managerial expectations carry unique insights about economic activities, with implications for both macroeconomic and microeconomic decision-making.</description>

      <title>European Football Player Valuation: Integrating Financial Models and Network Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new framework for player valuation in European football, by fusing principles from financial mathematics and network theory. The valuation model leverages a "passing matrix" to encapsulate player interactions on the field, utilizing centrality measures to quantify individual influence. Unlike traditional approaches, such as regressing on past performance-salary data, this model focuses on in-game performance as a player's contributions evolve over time. Consequently, our model provides a dynamic and individualized framework for ascertaining a player's fair market value. The methodology is empirically validated through a case study in European football, employing real-world match and financial data. This cross-disciplinary mechanism for player valuation adapts the effect of connecting pay with performance, first seen in Scully (1974), to include in-game contributions as well as expected present valuation of stochastic variables.</description>
