      <title>The vertical velocity skewness in the atmospheric boundary layer without buoyancy and Coriolis effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main statistical features of near-neutral atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) turbulence is the positive vertical velocity skewness $Sk_w$ above the roughness sublayer or the buffer region in smooth-walls. The $Sk_w$ variations are receiving renewed interest in many climate-related parameterizations of the ABL given their significance to cloud formation and to testing sub-grid schemes for Large Eddy Simulations (LES). The vertical variations of $Sk_w$ are explored here using high Reynolds number wind tunnel and flume experiments collected above smooth, rough, and permeable-walls in the absence of buoyancy and Coriolis effects. These laboratory experiments form a necessary starting point to probe the canonical structure of $Sk_w$ as they deal with a key limiting case (i.e. near-neutral conditions) that has received much less attention compared to its convective counterpart in atmospheric turbulence studies. Diagnostic models based on cumulant expansions, realizability constraints, and the now-popular constant mass flux approach routinely employed in the convective boundary layer as well as prognostic models based on third-order budgets are used to explain variations in $Sk_w$ for the idealized laboratory conditions. The failure of flux-gradient relations to model $Sk_w$ from the gradients of the vertical velocity variance $\sigma_w^2$ are explained and corrections based on models of energy transport offered. Novel links between the diagnostic and prognostic models are also featured, especially for the inertial term in the third order budget of the vertical velocity fluctuation. The co-spectral properties of $w'/\sigma_w$ versus $w'^2/\sigma_w^2$ are also presented for the first time to assess the dominant scales governing $Sk_w$ in the inner and outer layers, where $w'$ is the fluctuating vertical velocity and $\sigma_w$ is the vertical velocity standard deviation.</description>

      <title>RIS-Vis: A Novel Visualization Platform for Seismic, Geodetic, and Weather Data Relevant to Antarctic Cryosphere Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antarctic ice shelves play a vital role in preserving the physical conditions of the Antarctic cryosphere and the Southern Ocean, and beyond. By serving as a buttressing force, ice shelves prevent sea-level rise by restraining the flow of continental ice and glaciers to the sea. Sea-level rise impacts the global environment in multiple ways, including flooding habitats, eroding coastlines, and contaminating soil and groundwater. It is therefore essential to monitor the stability of Antarctic ice shelves, for which a variety of complementary data sources is required. We have developed RIS-Vis, a novel data visualization platform to monitor Antarctic ice shelves. Although focused on the Ross Ice Shelf (RIS), RIS-Vis could be readily scaled to monitor other ice shelves around Antarctica, and elsewhere. Currently, RIS-Vis is capable of analyzing and visualizing seismic, geodetic, and weather data to provide meaningful information for Antarctic cryosphere research. RIS-Vis was built using Python libraries including Obspy, APScheduler, and the Plotly Dash framework, and uses SQLite as the backing database. Visualizations developed on RIS-Vis include filtered seismic waveforms, spectrograms, and power spectral densities, geodetic-based ice-shelf flow, and meteorological variables such as atmospheric temperature and pressure. The dashboard visualization platform abstracts away the time-intensive analysis process of raw data and allows scientists to better concentrate on RIS science.</description>

      <title>Extremes of Dissolved Oxygen in the California Current System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissolved oxygen (DO) is a non-conservative tracer of interactions at the air-sea interface, respiration and photosynthesis, and advection. In this manuscript, we study extremes in the degree of oxygen saturation (SO), the ratio of DO to the maximum concentration given the water's temperature, salinity, and depth with SO=1 critically saturated. We perform the analysis with the California Underwater Glider Network (CUGN), which operates gliders on four lines that extend from the California coast to several hundred kilometers offshore, profiling to 500m depth every 3km. Since ~2017, the gliders have been equipped with a Sea-Bird 63 optode sensor to measure the DO content. We find that parcels with SO&gt;1.1, hyperoxic extrema, occur primarily near-shore in the upper 50m of the water column and during non-winter months. Along Line 90 which originates in San Diego, these hyperoxic events occur primarily in stratified waters with shallow mixed layers. We hypothesize that photosynthesis elevates DO in sub-surface water that can not rapidly ventilate with the surface. Along the three other lines, hyperoxic extrema occur almost exclusively at the surface and are correlated with elevated Chl-a fluorescence suggesting they are primarily driven by blooms of photosynthesis. We also examine hypoxic extrema, finding that parcels with SO&lt;0.9 and z&lt;50m occur most frequently along the northernmost line where upwelling has greatest impact.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing the pattern effect in the atmosphere-ocean coupled system through linear response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy surplus resulting from radiative forcing causes warming of the Earth system. This initial warming drives a myriad of changes including in sea surface temperatures (SSTs), leading to different radiative feedbacks. The relationship between the radiative feedbacks and the pattern of SST changes is referred to as the "pattern effect". The current approach to study the pattern effect relies on diagnosing the response of atmosphere-only models to perturbations in the SST boundary condition. Here, we argue that the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR), together with coarse-graining procedures, is a computationally cheap and theoretically grounded alternative to model experiments. We introduce a protocol to study the pattern effect and present its application in a state-of-the-art coupled climate model. By focusing on the coupled dynamics, we unveil the role of the slow ocean component in setting the pattern effect. We present a new "sensitivity map", representing a first, qualitative prediction of the response of the average top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiative flux to perturbations in the SST field. We find negative sensitivity throughout the tropics, in contrast to the current understanding of a positive-negative dipole of sensitivity in the tropical Pacific. Considering only the shortest time scales, the response is dominated by the fast atmospheric variability and we recover results in qualitative agreement with the literature. Therefore, the difference between our results and previous studies, largely comes from including the atmosphere-ocean coupling. The framework offers a conceptually novel perspective on the pattern effect: feedbacks in the coupled system are encoded in a temporally and spatially dependent response operator, rather than time-independent maps as for previous studies.</description>

      <title>A Deconfounding Approach to Climate Model Bias Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global Climate Models (GCMs) are crucial for predicting future climate changes by simulating the Earth systems. However, GCM outputs exhibit systematic biases due to model uncertainties, parameterization simplifications, and inadequate representation of complex climate phenomena. Traditional bias correction methods, which rely on historical observation data and statistical techniques, often neglect unobserved confounders, leading to biased results. This paper proposes a novel bias correction approach to utilize both GCM and observational data to learn a factor model that captures multi-cause latent confounders. Inspired by recent advances in causality based time series deconfounding, our method first constructs a factor model to learn latent confounders from historical data and then applies them to enhance the bias correction process using advanced time series forecasting models. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of precipitation outputs. By addressing unobserved confounders, our approach offers a robust and theoretically grounded solution for climate model bias correction.</description>

      <title>Climate Bistability at the Inner Edge of the Habitable Zone due to Runaway Greenhouse and Cloud Feedbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the climate dynamics at the inner edge of the habitable zone (HZ) is crucial for predicting the habitability of rocky exoplanets. Previous studies using Global Climate Models (GCMs) have indicated that planets receiving high stellar flux can exhibit climate bifurcations, leading to bistability between a cold (temperate) and a hot (runaway) climate. However, the mechanism causing this bistability has not been fully explained, in part due to the difficulty associated with inferring mechanisms from small numbers of expensive numerical simulations in GCMs. In this study, we employ a two-column (dayside and nightside), two-layer climate model to investigate the physical mechanisms driving this bistability. Through mechanism-denial experiments, we demonstrate that the runaway greenhouse effect, coupled with a cloud feedback on either the dayside or nightside, leads to climate bistability. We also map out the parameters that control the location of the bifurcations and size of the bistability. This work identifies which mechanisms and GCM parameters control the stellar flux at which rocky planets are likely to retain a hot, thick atmosphere if they experience a hot start. This is critical for the prioritization of targets and interpretation of observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Furthermore, our modeling framework can be extended to planets with different condensable species and cloud types.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty estimation of machine learning spatial precipitation predictions from satellite data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Merging satellite and gauge data with machine learning produces high-resolution precipitation datasets, but uncertainty estimates are often missing. We addressed the gap of how to optimally provide such estimates by benchmarking six algorithms, mostly novel even for the more general task of quantifying predictive uncertainty in spatial prediction settings. On 15 years of monthly data from over the contiguous United States (CONUS), we compared quantile regression (QR), quantile regression forests (QRF), generalized random forests (GRF), gradient boosting machines (GBM), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and quantile regression neural networks (QRNN). Their ability to issue predictive precipitation quantiles at nine quantile levels (0.025, 0.050, 0.100, 0.250, 0.500, 0.750, 0.900, 0.950, 0.975), approximating the full probability distribution, was evaluated using quantile scoring functions and the quantile scoring rule. Predictors at a site were nearby values from two satellite precipitation retrievals, namely PERSIANN (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks) and IMERG (Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals), and the site's elevation. The dependent variable was the monthly mean gauge precipitation. With respect to QR, LightGBM showed improved performance in terms of the quantile scoring rule by 11.10%, also surpassing QRF (7.96%), GRF (7.44%), GBM (4.64%) and QRNN (1.73%). Notably, LightGBM outperformed all random forest variants, the current standard in spatial prediction with machine learning. To conclude, we propose a suite of machine learning algorithms for estimating uncertainty in spatial data prediction, supported with a formal evaluation framework based on scoring functions and scoring rules.</description>

      <title>Can AI be enabled to dynamical downscaling? A Latent Diffusion Model to mimic km-scale COSMO5.0\_CLM9 simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Downscaling techniques are one of the most prominent applications of Deep Learning (DL) in Earth System Modeling. A robust DL downscaling model can generate high-resolution fields from coarse-scale numerical model simulations, saving the timely and resourceful applications of regional/local models. Additionally, generative DL models have the potential to provide uncertainty information, by generating ensemble-like scenario pools, a task that is computationally prohibitive for traditional numerical simulations. In this study, we apply a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to downscale ERA5 data over Italy up to a resolution of 2 km. The high-resolution target data consists of 2-m temperature and 10-m horizontal wind components from a dynamical downscaling performed with COSMO_CLM. Our goal is to demonstrate that recent advancements in generative modeling enable DL to deliver results comparable to those of numerical dynamical models, given the same input data, preserving the realism of fine-scale features and flow characteristics. A selection of predictors from ERA5 is used as input to the LDM, and a residual approach against a reference UNET is leveraged in applying the LDM. The performance of the generative LDM is compared with reference baselines of increasing complexity: quadratic interpolation of ERA5, a UNET, and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) built on the same reference UNET. Results highlight the improvements introduced by the LDM architecture and the residual approach over these baselines. The models are evaluated on a yearly test dataset, assessing the models' performance through deterministic metrics, spatial distribution of errors, and reconstruction of frequency and power spectra distributions.</description>
