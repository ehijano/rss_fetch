      <title>Unraveling the mystery of tropical monsoon long-term prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropical monsoons play a critical role in shaping regional and global climate systems, with profound ecological and socio-economic impacts. However, their long-term prediction remains challenging due to the complex interplay of regional dynamics, global climate drivers, and large-scale teleconnections. Here, we introduce a unified network-based framework for predicting monsoon precipitation across diverse tropical regions. By leveraging global 2-meter air temperature fields, this approach captures large-scale climate teleconnections, such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Rossby waves, enabling accurate forecasts for four key monsoon systems: the South American, East Asian, African, and Indian monsoons. Our framework achieves remarkable forecasting accuracy with lead times of 4-10 months, outperforming traditional systems such as SEAS5 and CFSv2. Beyond its predictive capabilities, the framework offers flexibility for application to other regions and climate phenomena, advancing our understanding of global climate dynamics. These findings have far-reaching implications for disaster preparedness, resource management, and sustainable development.</description>

      <title>2D numerical simulation of lunar response to gravitational waves using finite element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous studies of the response of the Moon to gravitational waves have been carried out using analytical or semi-analytical models assuming ideal lunar structures. Such models are advantageous for their high-speed calculation but fail to account for the extremely heterogeneous subsurface and/or interior structures of the Moon. Numerical calculations are needed, but it is challenging to model the topography and lateral heterogeneity of the Moon. In addition, the computational cost is great especially when performing the GW simulation for a long time. As a first step towards overcoming the above difficulties, we employ a two-dimensional finite element method to numerically simulate the lunar response to gravitational waves. We verify our method by comparing our numerical results with those semi-analytical solutions. Based on such comparison, we also analyze the limitation of the two-dimensional simulation. Our work breaks a new way towards the precise simulation of realistic lunar response to gravitational waves in the future and lays down a solid foundation for three-dimensional numerical simulations.</description>
