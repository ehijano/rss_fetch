      <title>Assessing the Impact of Electric Vehicle Charging on Residential Distribution Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve net-zero carbon emissions, electrification in the transportation sector plays an important role. Significant increase of electric vehicles (EV) has been observed nationally and globally. While the transition to EVs presents substantial environmental benefits, it would lead to several challenges to the power grid due to EV charging activities. Growing EVs greatly increase peak loads on residential grids, particularly during evening charging periods. This surge can result in operational challenges, including greater voltage drops, increased power losses, and potential overloading violations, compromising grid reliability and efficiency. This study focuses on determining ampacity violations, and analyzing line loading levels in a 240-bus distribution system with 1120 customers, located in the Midwest U.S. By simulating a range of charging scenarios and evaluating EV chargers with varying power capacities under different distribution system voltage levels, this research aims to identify lines at risk of ampacity violations for various EV charging penetration rates up to 100%. The findings will provide valuable insights for utilities and grid operators, informing strategies for voltage level adjustments and necessary infrastructure reinforcements to effectively accommodate the growing energy demands associated with widespread EV adoption.</description>

      <title>ScAlN-on-SiC Ku-Band Solidly-Mounted Bidimensional Mode Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter reports on Solidly-Mounted Bidimensional Mode Resonators (S2MRs) based on 30% Scandium-doped Aluminum Nitride (ScAlN) on Silicon Carbide (SiC), operating near 16 GHz. Experimental results demonstrate mechanical quality factors (Qm) as high as 380, electromechanical coupling coefficients (kt2) of 4.5%, an overall Figure of Merit (FOM = Qmkt2) exceeding 17, and power handling greater than 20 dBm for devices closely matched to 50 ohm. To the best of the authors' knowledge, S2MRs exhibit the highest Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) among solidly mounted resonators in the Ku band, paving the way for the integration of nanoacoustic devices on fast substrates with high-power electronics, tailored for military and harsh environment applications.</description>

      <title>Weak synchronization in heterogeneous multi-agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new framework for synchronization of heterogeneous multi agent system which we refer to as weak synchronization. This new framework of synchronization is based on achieving the network stability in the absence of any information on communication network including the connectivity. Here by network stability, we mean that in the basic setup of a multi-agent system, we require that the signals exchanged over the network converge to zero. As such if the network happens to have a directed spanning tree then we obtain classical synchronization. Moreover, we design protocols which achieve weak synchronization for any network without making any kind of assumptions on communication network. If the network happens to have a directed spanning tree, then we obtain classical synchronization. However, if this is not the case then we describe in detail in this paper what kind of synchronization properties are preserved in the system and the output of the different agents can behave.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Tubes for Temporal Reach-Avoid-Stay Tasks in Unknown Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper considers the controller synthesis problem for general MIMO systems with unknown dynamics, aiming to fulfill the temporal reach-avoid-stay task, where the unsafe regions are time-dependent, and the target must be reached within a specified time frame. The primary aim of the paper is to construct the spatiotemporal tube (STT) using a sampling-based approach and thereby devise a closed-form approximation-free control strategy to ensure that system trajectory reaches the target set while avoiding time-dependent unsafe sets. The proposed scheme utilizes a novel method involving STTs to provide controllers that guarantee both system safety and reachability. In our sampling-based framework, we translate the requirements of STTs into a Robust optimization program (ROP). To address the infeasibility of ROP caused by infinite constraints, we utilize the sampling-based Scenario optimization program (SOP). Subsequently, we solve the SOP to generate the tube and closed-form controller for an unknown system, ensuring the temporal reach-avoid-stay specification. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through three case studies: an omnidirectional robot, a SCARA manipulator, and a magnetic levitation system.</description>

      <title>Robust Data-Driven Predictive Control for Mixed Platoons under Noise and Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling mixed platoons, which consist of both connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), poses significant challenges due to the uncertain and unknown human driving behaviors. Data-driven control methods offer promising solutions by leveraging available trajectory data, but their performance can be compromised by process noise and adversarial attacks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Robust Data-EnablEd Predictive Leading Cruise Control (RDeeP-LCC) framework based on data-driven reachability analysis. The framework over-approximates system dynamics under noise and attack using a matrix zonotope set derived from data, and develops a stabilizing feedback control law. By decoupling the mixed platoon system into nominal and error components, we employ data-driven reachability sets to recursively compute error reachable sets that account for noise and attacks, and obtain tightened safety constraints of the nominal system. This leads to a robust data-driven predictive control framework, solved in a tube-based control manner. Numerical simulations and human-in-the-loop experiments validate that the RDeeP-LCC method significantly enhances the robustness of mixed platoons, improving mixed traffic stability and safety against practical noise and attacks.</description>

      <title>Fast Stochastic MPC using Affine Disturbance Feedback Gains Learned Offline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel Stochastic Model Predictive Control (MPC) for uncertain linear systems subject to probabilistic constraints. The proposed approach leverages offline learning to extract key features of affine disturbance feedback policies, significantly reducing the computational burden of online optimization. Specifically, we employ offline data-driven sampling to learn feature components of feedback gains and approximate the chance-constrained feasible set with a specified confidence level. By utilizing this learned information, the online MPC problem is simplified to optimization over nominal inputs and a reduced set of learned feedback gains, ensuring computational efficiency. In a numerical example, the proposed MPC approach achieves comparable control performance in terms of Region of Attraction (ROA) and average closed-loop costs to classical MPC optimizing over disturbance feedback policies, while delivering a 10-fold improvement in computational speed.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Trajectory and Power Control in Ultra-Dense UAV Networks: A Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ultra-dense unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, it is challenging to coordinate the resource allocation and interference management among large-scale UAVs, for providing flexible and efficient service coverage to the ground users (GUs). In this paper, we propose a learning-based resource allocation scheme in an ultra-dense UAV communication network, where the GUs' service demands are time-varying with unknown distributions. We formulate the non-cooperative game among multiple co-channel UAVs as a stochastic game, where each UAV jointly optimizes its trajectory, user association, and downlink power control to maximize the expectation of its locally cumulative energy efficiency under the interference and energy constraints. To cope with the scalability issue in a large-scale network, we further formulate the problem as a mean-field game (MFG), which simplifies the interactions among the UAVs into a two-player game between a representative UAV and a mean-field. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium for the MFG, and propose a model-free mean-field reinforcement learning algorithm named maximum entropy mean-field deep Q network (ME-MFDQN) to solve the mean-field equilibrium in both fully and partially observable scenarios. The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm improves the energy efficiency compared with the benchmark algorithms. Moreover, the performance can be further enhanced if the GUs' service demands exhibit higher temporal correlation or if the UAVs have wider observation capabilities over their nearby GUs.</description>

      <title>On PI-control in Capacity-Limited Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns control of a class of systems where multiple dynamically stable agents share a nonlinear and bounded control-interconnection. The agents are subject to a disturbance which is too large to reject with the available control action, making it impossible to stabilize all agents in their desired states. In this nonlinear setting, we consider two different anti-windup equipped proportional-integral control strategies and analyze their properties. We show that a fully decentralized strategy will globally, asymptotically stabilize a unique equilibrium. This equilibrium also minimizes a weighted sum of the tracking errors. We also consider a light addition to the fully decentralized strategy, where rank-1 coordination between the agents is introduced via the anti-windup action. We show that any equilibrium to this closed-loop system minimizes the maximum tracking error for any agent. A remarkable property of these results is that they rely on extremely few assumptions on the interconnection between the agents. Finally we illustrate how the considered model can be applied in a district heating setting, and demonstrate the two considered controllers in a simulation.</description>

      <title>Iteration-Free Cooperative Distributed MPC through Multiparametric Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative Distributed Model Predictive Control (DiMPC) architecture employs local MPC controllers to control different subsystems, exchanging information with each other through an iterative procedure to enhance overall control performance compared to the decentralized architecture. However, this method can result in high communication between the controllers and computational costs. In this work, the amount of information exchanged and the computational costs of DiMPC are reduced significantly by developing novel iteration-free solution algorithms based on multiparametric (mp) programming. These algorithms replace the iterative procedure with simultaneous solutions of explicit mpDiMPC control law functions. The reduced communication among local controllers decreases system latency, which is crucial for real-time control applications. The effectiveness of the proposed iteration-free mpDiMPC algorithms is demonstrated through comprehensive numerical simulations involving groups of coupled linear subsystems, which are interconnected through their inputs and a cooperative plant-wide cost function.</description>

      <title>Lower Dimensional Spherical Representation of Medium Voltage Load Profiles for Visualization, Outlier Detection, and Generative Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the spherical lower dimensional representation for daily medium voltage load profiles, based on principal component analysis. The objective is to unify and simplify the tasks for (i) clustering visualisation, (ii) outlier detection and (iii) generative profile modelling under one concept. The lower dimensional projection of standardised load profiles unveils a latent distribution in a three-dimensional sphere. This spherical structure allows us to detect outliers by fitting probability distribution models in the spherical coordinate system, identifying measurements that deviate from the spherical shape. The same latent distribution exhibits an arc shape, suggesting an underlying order among load profiles. We develop a principal curve technique to uncover this order based on similarity, offering new advantages over conventional clustering techniques. This finding reveals that energy consumption in a wide region can be seen as a continuously changing process. Furthermore, we combined the principal curve with a von Mises-Fisher distribution to create a model capable of generating profiles with continuous mixtures between clusters. The presence of the spherical distribution is validated with data from four municipalities in the Netherlands. The uncovered spherical structure implies the possibility of employing new mathematical tools from directional statistics and differential geometry for load profile modelling.</description>

      <title>Formal Simulation and Visualisation of Hybrid Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and analysis of systems that combine computational behaviour with physical processes' continuous dynamics - such as movement, velocity, and voltage - is a famous, challenging task. Several theoretical results from programming theory emerged in the last decades to tackle the issue; some of which are the basis of a proof-of-concept tool, called Lince, that aids in the analysis of such systems, by presenting simulations of their respective behaviours.
  However being a proof-of-concept, the tool is quite limited with respect to usability, and when attempting to apply it to a set of common, concrete problems, involving autonomous driving and others, it either simply cannot simulate them or fails to provide a satisfactory user-experience.
  The current work complements the aforementioned theoretical approaches with a more practical perspective, by improving Lince along several dimensions: to name a few, richer syntactic constructs, more operations, more informative plotting systems and errors messages, and a better performance overall. We illustrate our improvements via a variety of examples that involve both autonomous driving and electrical systems.</description>

      <title>Joint-repositionable Inner-wireless Planar Snake Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bio-inspired multi-joint snake robots offer the advantages of terrain adaptability due to their limbless structure and high flexibility. However, a series of dozens of motor units in typical multiple-joint snake robots results in a heavy body structure and hundreds of watts of high power consumption. This paper presents a joint-repositionable, inner-wireless snake robot that enables multi-joint-like locomotion using a low-powered underactuated mechanism. The snake robot, consisting of a series of flexible passive links, can dynamically change its joint coupling configuration by repositioning motor-driven joint units along rack gears inside the robot. Additionally, a soft robot skin wirelessly powers the internal joint units, avoiding the risk of wire tangling and disconnection caused by the movable joint units. The combination of the joint-repositionable mechanism and the wireless-charging-enabled soft skin achieves a high degree of bending, along with a lightweight structure of 1.3 kg and energy-efficient wireless power transmission of 7.6 watts.</description>

      <title>A Dataset for Evaluating Online Anomaly Detection Approaches for Discrete Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is challenging due to the lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a small selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data.</description>

      <title>Learning Two-agent Motion Planning Strategies from Generalized Nash Equilibrium for Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an Implicit Game-Theoretic MPC (IGT-MPC), a decentralized algorithm for two-agent motion planning that uses a learned value function that predicts the game-theoretic interaction outcomes as the terminal cost-to-go function in a model predictive control (MPC) framework, guiding agents to implicitly account for interactions with other agents and maximize their reward. This approach applies to competitive and cooperative multi-agent motion planning problems which we formulate as constrained dynamic games. Given a constrained dynamic game, we randomly sample initial conditions and solve for the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) to generate a dataset of GNE solutions, computing the reward outcome of each game-theoretic interaction from the GNE. The data is used to train a simple neural network to predict the reward outcome, which we use as the terminal cost-to-go function in an MPC scheme. We showcase emerging competitive and coordinated behaviors using IGT-MPC in scenarios such as two-vehicle head-to-head racing and un-signalized intersection navigation. IGT-MPC offers a novel method integrating machine learning and game-theoretic reasoning into model-based decentralized multi-agent motion planning.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Aided Policy Tuning for Black-Box Robot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can robots learn and adapt to new tasks and situations with little data? Systematic exploration and simulation are crucial tools for efficient robot learning. We present a novel black-box policy search algorithm focused on data-efficient policy improvements. The algorithm learns directly on the robot and treats simulation as an additional information source to speed up the learning process. At the core of the algorithm, a probabilistic model learns the dependence of the policy parameters and the robot learning objective not only by performing experiments on the robot, but also by leveraging data from a simulator. This substantially reduces interaction time with the robot. Using this model, we can guarantee improvements with high probability for each policy update, thereby facilitating fast, goal-oriented learning. We evaluate our algorithm on simulated fine-tuning tasks and demonstrate the data-efficiency of the proposed dual-information source optimization algorithm. In a real robot learning experiment, we show fast and successful task learning on a robot manipulator with the aid of an imperfect simulator.</description>

      <title>Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning with Exponential Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09010v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While reinforcement learning has shown experimental success in a number of applications, it is known to be sensitive to noise and perturbations in the parameters of the system, leading to high variance in the total reward amongst different episodes in slightly different environments. To introduce robustness, as well as sample efficiency, risk-sensitive reinforcement learning methods are being thoroughly studied. In this work, we provide a definition of robust reinforcement learning policies and formulate a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning problem to approximate them, by solving an optimization problem with respect to a modified objective based on exponential criteria. In particular, we study a model-free risk-sensitive variation of the widely-used Monte Carlo Policy Gradient algorithm and introduce a novel risk-sensitive online Actor-Critic algorithm based on solving a multiplicative Bellman equation using stochastic approximation updates. Analytical results suggest that the use of exponential criteria generalizes commonly used ad-hoc regularization approaches, improves sample efficiency, and introduces robustness with respect to perturbations in the model parameters and the environment. The implementation, performance, and robustness properties of the proposed methods are evaluated in simulated experiments.</description>

      <title>Structured stability analysis of networked systems with uncertain links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An input-output approach to stability analysis is explored for networked systems with uncertain link dynamics. The main result consists of a collection of integral quadratic constraints, which together imply robust stability of the uncertain networked system, under the assumption that stability is achieved with ideal links. The conditions are decentralized inasmuch as each involves only agent and uncertainty model parameters that are local to a corresponding link. This makes the main result, which imposes no restriction on network structure, suitable for the study of large-scale systems.</description>

      <title>To What Extent do Open-loop and Feedback Nash Equilibria Diverge in General-Sum Linear Quadratic Dynamic Games?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic games offer a versatile framework for modeling the evolving interactions of strategic agents, whose steady-state behavior can be captured by the Nash equilibria of the games. Nash equilibria are often computed in feedback, with policies depending on the state at each time, or in open-loop, with policies depending only on the initial state. Empirically, open-loop Nash equilibria (OLNE) could be more efficient to compute, while feedback Nash equilibria (FBNE) often encode more complex interactions. However, it remains unclear exactly which dynamic games yield FBNE and OLNE that differ significantly and which do not. To address this problem, we present a principled comparison study of OLNE and FBNE in linear quadratic (LQ) dynamic games. Specifically, we prove that the OLNE strategies of an LQ dynamic game can be synthesized by solving the coupled Riccati equations of an auxiliary LQ game with perturbed costs. The construction of the auxiliary game allows us to establish conditions under which OLNE and FBNE coincide and derive an upper bound on the deviation between FBNE and OLNE of an LQ game.</description>

      <title>Safe Decentralized Multi-Agent Control using Black-Box Predictors, Conformal Decision Policies, and Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the challenge of safe control in decentralized multi-agent robotic settings, where agents use uncertain black-box models to predict other agents' trajectories. We use the recently proposed conformal decision theory to adapt the restrictiveness of control barrier functions-based safety constraints based on observed prediction errors. We use these constraints to synthesize controllers that balance between the objectives of safety and task accomplishment, despite the prediction errors. We provide an upper bound on the average over time of the value of a monotonic function of the difference between the safety constraint based on the predicted trajectories and the constraint based on the ground truth ones. We validate our theory through experimental results showing the performance of our controllers when navigating a robot in the multi-agent scenes in the Stanford Drone Dataset.</description>

      <title>MERIT: Multimodal Wearable Vital Sign Waveform Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and premature mortality worldwide, with occupational environments significantly influencing CVD risk, underscoring the need for effective cardiac monitoring and early warning systems. Existing methods of monitoring vital signs require subjects to remain stationary, which is impractical for daily monitoring as individuals are often in motion. To address this limitation, we propose MERIT, a multimodality-based wearable system designed for precise ECG waveform monitoring without movement restrictions. Daily activities, involving frequent arm movements, can significantly affect sensor data and complicate the reconstruction of accurate ECG signals. To mitigate motion impact and enhance ECG signal reconstruction, we introduce a deep independent component analysis (Deep-ICA) module and a multimodal fusion module. We conducted experiments with 15 subjects. Our results, compared with commercial wearable devices and existing methods, demonstrate that MERIT accurately reconstructs ECG waveforms during various office activities, offering a reliable solution for fine-grained cardiac monitoring in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Identification of Analytic Nonlinear Dynamical Systems with Non-asymptotic Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the system identification of an important class of nonlinear systems: linearly parameterized nonlinear systems, which enjoys wide applications in robotics and other mechanical systems. We consider two system identification methods: least-squares estimation (LSE), which is a point estimation method; and set-membership estimation (SME), which estimates an uncertainty set that contains the true parameters. We provide non-asymptotic convergence rates for LSE and SME under i.i.d. control inputs and control policies with i.i.d. random perturbations, both of which are considered as non-active-exploration inputs. Compared with the counter-example based on piecewise-affine systems in the literature, the success of non-active exploration in our setting relies on a key assumption on the system dynamics: we require the system functions to be real-analytic. Our results, together with the piecewise-affine counter-example, reveal the importance of differentiability in nonlinear system identification through non-active exploration. Lastly, we numerically compare our theoretical bounds with the empirical performance of LSE and SME on a pendulum example and a quadrotor example.</description>

      <title>Unmanned F/A-18 Aircraft Landing Control on Aircraft Carrier in Adverse Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carrier landings are a difficult control task due to wind disturbances and a changing trajectory. Demand for carrier-based drones is increasing. A robust and accurate landing control system is crucial to meet this demand. Control performance can be improved by using observers to estimate unknown variables and disturbances for feedback. This study applies a nonlinear observer to estimate the combined disturbance in the pitch dynamics of an F/A-18 during carrier landing. Additionally, controllers to regulate the velocity, rate of descent and vertical position are designed. A full model, including the nonlinear flight dynamics, controller, carrier deck motion, wind and measurement noise is modelled numerically and implemented in software. Combined with proportional derivative control, the proposed pitch control method is shown to be very effective converging 85% faster than a PID controller. The simulations, verify that the pitch controller can quickly track a time-varying reference despite noise and disturbances. The positional controller used is found to be ineffective and requires improvement.</description>

      <title>Computing Optimal Joint Chance Constrained Control Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimally controlling stochastic, Markovian systems subject to joint chance constraints over a finite-time horizon. For such problems, standard Dynamic Programming is inapplicable due to the time correlation of the joint chance constraints, which calls for non-Markovian, and possibly stochastic, policies. Hence, despite the popularity of this problem, solution approaches capable of providing provably-optimal and easy-to-compute policies are still missing. We fill this gap by augmenting the dynamics via a binary state, allowing us to characterize the optimal policies and develop a Dynamic Programming based solution method.</description>

      <title>Proximal Gradient Dynamics: Monotonicity, Exponential Convergence, and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter we study the proximal gradient dynamics. This recently-proposed continuous-time dynamics solves optimization problems whose cost functions are separable into a nonsmooth convex and a smooth component. First, we show that the cost function decreases monotonically along the trajectories of the proximal gradient dynamics. We then introduce a new condition that guarantees exponential convergence of the cost function to its optimal value, and show that this condition implies the proximal Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition. We also show that the proximal Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition guarantees exponential convergence of the cost function. Moreover, we extend these results to time-varying optimization problems, providing bounds for equilibrium tracking. Finally, we discuss applications of these findings, including the LASSO problem, certain matrix based problems and a numerical experiment on a feed-forward neural network.</description>

      <title>IC3M: In-Car Multimodal Multi-object Monitoring for Abnormal Status of Both Driver and Passengers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02592v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, in-car monitoring has emerged as a promising technology for detecting early-stage abnormal status of the driver and providing timely alerts to prevent traffic accidents. Although training models with multimodal data enhances the reliability of abnormal status detection, the scarcity of labeled data and the imbalance of class distribution impede the extraction of critical abnormal state features, significantly deteriorating training performance. Furthermore, missing modalities due to environment and hardware limitations further exacerbate the challenge of abnormal status identification. More importantly, monitoring abnormal health conditions of passengers, particularly in elderly care, is of paramount importance but remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we introduce our IC3M, an efficient camera-rotation-based multimodal framework for monitoring both driver and passengers in a car. Our IC3M comprises two key modules: an adaptive threshold pseudo-labeling strategy and a missing modality reconstruction. The former customizes pseudo-labeling thresholds for different classes based on the class distribution, generating class-balanced pseudo labels to guide model training effectively, while the latter leverages crossmodality relationships learned from limited labels to accurately recover missing modalities by distribution transferring from available modalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IC3M outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in accuracy, precision, and recall while exhibiting superior robustness under limited labeled data and severe missing modality.</description>

      <title>Kapitza-Inspired Stabilization of Non-Foster Circuits via Time Modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With his formal analysis in 1951, the physicist Pyotr Kapitza demonstrated that an inverted pendulum with an externally vibrating base can be stable in its upper position, thus overcoming the force of gravity. Kapitza's work is an example that an originally unstable system can become stable after a minor perturbation of its properties or initial conditions is applied. Inspired by his ideas, we show how non-Foster circuits can be stabilized with the application of external \textit{electrical vibration}, i.e., time modulations. Non-Foster circuits are highly appreciated in the engineering community since their bandwidth characteristics are not limited by passive-circuits bounds. Unfortunately, non-Foster circuits are usually unstable and they must be stabilized prior to operation. Here, we focus on the study of non-Foster $L(t)C$ circuits with time-varying inductors and time-invariant negative capacitors. We find an intrinsic connection between Kapitza's inverted pendulum and non-Foster $L(t)C$ resonators. Moreover, we show how positive time-varying modulations of $L(t)&gt;0$ can overcome and stabilize non-Foster negative capacitances $C&lt;0$. These findings open up an alternative manner of stabilizing electric circuits with the use of time modulations, and lay the groundwork for application of, what we coin \textit{Vibrational Electromagnetics}, in more complex media.</description>
