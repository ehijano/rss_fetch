      <title>The sandwich problem for odd-hole-free and even-hole-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a property $\mathcal{P}$ of graphs, the $\mathcal{P}$-\textsc{Sandwich-Problem}, introduced by Golumbic and Shamir (1993), is the following: Given a pair of graphs $(G_1, G_2)$ on the same vertex set $V$, does there exist a graph $G$ such that $V(G)=V$, $E(G_{1})\subseteq E(G) \subseteq E(G_{2})$, and $G$ satisfies $\mathcal{P}$? A {\em hole} in a graph is an induced subgraph which is a cycle of length at least four. An odd (respectively even) hole is a hole of odd (respectively even) length. Given a class of graphs $\mathcal{C}$ and a graph $G$ we say that $G$ is {\em $\mathcal{C}$-free} if it contains no induced subgraph isomorphic to a member of $\mathcal{C}$. In this paper we prove that if $\mathcal{P}$ is the property of being odd-hole-free or the property of being even-hole-free, then the $\mathcal{P}$-\textsc{Sandwich-Problem} is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Chernoff Bounds and Reverse Hypercontractivity on HDX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove optimal concentration of measure for lifted functions on high dimensional expanders (HDX). Let $X$ be a $k$-dimensional HDX. We show for any $i\leq k$ and $f:X(i)\to [0,1]$: \[\Pr_{s\in X(k)}\left[\left|\underset{{t\subseteq s}}{\mathbb{E}}[f(t)]-\mu\right|\geq\varepsilon\right]\leq exp\left(-\varepsilon^2\frac{k}{i}\right).\] Using this fact, we prove that high dimensional expanders are reverse hypercontractive, a powerful functional inequality from discrete analysis implying that for any sets $A,B \subset X(k)$, the probability a $\rho$-correlated pair passes between them is at least \[\Pr_{s,s' \sim T_\rho}[s \in A, s' \in B] \geq \Pr[A]^{O(1)} \Pr[B]^{O(1)}.\] Our results hold under weak spectral assumptions on $X$. Namely we prove exponential concentration of measure for any complex below the `Trickling-Down Threshold' (beyond which concentration may be arbitrarily poor), and optimal concentration for $\sqrt{k}$-skeletons of such complexes. We also show optimal bounds for the top dimension of stronger HDX among other settings. We leverage our inequalities to prove several new agreement testing theorems on high dimensional expanders, including a new 99%-regime test for subsets, and a variant of the `Z-test' achieving inverse exponential soundness under the stronger assumption of $\ell_\infty$-expansion. The latter gives rise to the first optimal testers beyond the complete complex and products, a stepping stone toward the use of HDX in strong soundness PCPs. We also give applications within expansion, analysis, combinatorics, and coding theory, including a proof that two-sided HDX have optimal geometric overlap (giving the first explicit bounded-degree construction), near-optimal double samplers, new super-exponential degree lower bounds for certain HDX, distance-amplified list-decodable and locally testable codes, a Frankl-R\"odl Theorem and more.</description>

      <title>Finding $d$-Cuts in Graphs of Bounded Diameter, Graphs of Bounded Radius and $H$-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $d$-Cut problem is to decide if a graph has an edge cut such that each vertex has at most $d$ neighbours at the opposite side of the cut. If $d=1$, we obtain the intensively studied Matching Cut problem. The $d$-Cut problem has been studied as well, but a systematic study for special graph classes was lacking. We initiate such a study and consider classes of bounded diameter, bounded radius and $H$-free graphs. We prove that for all $d\geq 2$, $d$-Cut is polynomial-time solvable for graphs of diameter $2$, $(P_3+P_4)$-free graphs and $P_5$-free graphs. These results extend known results for $d=1$. However, we also prove several NP-hardness results for $d$-Cut that contrast known polynomial-time results for $d=1$. Our results lead to full dichotomies for bounded diameter and bounded radius and to almost-complete dichotomies for $H$-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Path Energy of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $M,$ path eigenvalues are eigenvalues of its path matrix. The path energy of a simple graph $M$ is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the path eigenvalues of the graph $M$ (Shikare et. al, 2018). We have discovered new upper constraints on path energy in this study, expressed in terms of a graph's maximum degree. Additionally, a relationship between a graph's energy and path energy is given.</description>

      <title>A note on graphs with purely imaginary per-spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1983, Borowiecki and J\'o\'zwiak posed the problem ``Characterize those graphs which have purely imaginary per-spectrum.'' This problem is still open. The most general result, although a partial solution, was given in 2004 by Yan and Zhang, who show that if $G$ is a bipartite graph containing no subgraph which is an even subdivision of $K_{2,3}$, then it has purely imaginary per-spectrum. Zhang and Li in 2012 proved that such graphs are planar and admit a Pfaffian orientation. In this article, we describe how to construct graphs with purely imaginary per-spectrum having a subgraph which is an even subdivision of $K_{2,3}$ (planar and nonplanar) using coalescence of rooted graphs.</description>

      <title>The Upper Clique Transversal Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A clique transversal in a graph is a set of vertices intersecting all maximal cliques. The problem of determining the minimum size of a clique transversal has received considerable attention in the literature. In this paper, we initiate the study of the ''upper'' variant of this parameter, the upper clique transversal number, defined as the maximum size of a minimal clique transversal. We investigate this parameter from the algorithmic and complexity points of view, with a focus on various graph classes. We show that the corresponding decision problem is NP-complete in the classes of chordal graphs, chordal bipartite graphs, cubic planar bipartite graphs, and line graphs of bipartite graphs, but solvable in linear time in the classes of split graphs, proper interval graphs, and cographs, and in polynomial time for graphs of bounded cliquewidth. We conclude the paper with a number of open questions.</description>
