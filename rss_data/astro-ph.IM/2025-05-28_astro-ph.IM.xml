      <title>The Paris Meudon ground based support to the NASA Solar Maximum Mission in the eighties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solar Maximum Mission of NASA was one of the first satellites with on board digitization of observations. It was launched for the solar maximum of cycle 21 (1980) in order to study the solar activity. It carried many instruments, such as coronagraphs, X and $\gamma$ ray detectors, an Ultra Violet spectrometer and a radiometer. Ground based support was offered by many institutes, such as Paris Meudon observatory under the form of systematic observations or coordinated campaigns with specific instruments. We present here the Meudon Solar Tower (MST) and magnetograph which offered in the eighties a major contribution with observations of velocity and magnetic fields of the photosphere and chromosphere, while SMM was observing the transition region and corona above.</description>

      <title>gallifrey: JAX-based Gaussian process structure learning for astronomical time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) have become a common tool in astronomy for analysing time series data, particularly in exoplanet science and stellar astrophysics. However, choosing the appropriate covariance structure for a GP model remains a challenge in many situations, limiting model flexibility and performance. This work provides an introduction to recent advances in GP structure learning methods, which enable the automated discovery of optimal GP kernels directly from the data, with the aim of making these methods more accessible to the astronomical community. We present gallifrey, a JAX-based Python package that implements a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for Bayesian kernel structure learning. This approach defines a prior distribution over kernel structures and hyperparameters, and efficiently samples the GP posterior distribution using a novel involutive Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure. We applied gallifrey to common astronomical time series tasks, including stellar variability modelling, exoplanet transit modelling, and transmission spectroscopy. We show that this methodology can accurately interpolate and extrapolate stellar variability, recover transit parameters with robust uncertainties, and derive transmission spectra by effectively separating the background from the transit signal. When compared with traditional fixed-kernel approaches, we show that structure learning has advantages in terms of accuracy and uncertainty estimation. Structure learning can enhance the performance of GP regression for astronomical time series modelling. We discuss a road map for algorithmic improvements in terms of scalability to larger datasets, so that the methods presented here can be applied to future stellar and exoplanet missions such as PLATO.</description>

      <title>ULULA: An ultra-lightweight 2D hydrodynamics code for teaching and experimentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics is a difficult subject to teach in the classroom because most relevant problems must be solved numerically rather than analytically. While there are numerous public hydrodynamics codes, the complexity of production-level software obscures the underlying physics and can be overwhelming to first-time users. Here we present ULULA, an ultra-lightweight python code to solve hydrodynamics and gravity in 2D. The main goal is for the code to be easy to understand, extend, and experiment with. The simulation framework consists of fewer than 800 active lines of pure python code, but it includes a robust MUSCL-Hancock scheme with exchangeable components such as Riemann solvers, reconstruction schemes, boundary conditions, and equations of state. Numerous well-known hydrodynamics problems are provided and can be run in a few minutes on a laptop. The code is open-source, generously commented, and extensively documented.</description>

      <title>What exactly did the Transformer learn from our physics data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer networks excel in scientific applications. We explore two scenarios in ultra-high-energy cosmic ray simulations to examine what these network architectures learn. First, we investigate the trained positional encodings in air showers which are azimuthally symmetric. Second, we visualize the attention values assigned to cosmic particles originating from a galaxy catalog. In both cases, the Transformers learn plausible, physically meaningful features.</description>

      <title>Proposal for the optical design of three robust and highly performing FPI systems for the European Solar Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a proposal for the optical design of three dual Fabry-Perot based narrowband filter systems for for the future European Solar Telescope (EST). These are intended to constitute the core elements of three imaging spectropolarimeters, foreseen to become amongst the most important science instruments for EST. The designs proposed here rely heavily on the heritage of CRISP and CHROMIS, developed for the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope and described in detail in a companion paper (Scharmer et al. 2025, in prep.). The outstanding performance of these systems, and the simplicity of their designs, provide strong support of our proposal to build similar systems for EST. The design concepts involve i) minimising the FPI clear aperture diameter by means of numerical simulations based on constraints on Strehl and spectral resolution set by the EST Science Advisory Group (SAG); ii) a compact telecentric optical design with an optical path length of less than 4.7 m; iii) a straight-through optical system based on lenses and without any folding mirrors; iv) the combination of a high resolution etalon with high reflectivity and a low reflectivity, low resolution etalon, to mitigate the effects of cavity errors (Scharmer 2006, Scharmer et al. 2025); v) flexibility in terms of image scale by simple replacement of the last lens (the camera lens) of the FPI system. We propose to compensate for the focus curve of ESTs Pier Optical Path (POP) by focusing the camera lenses of the FPI systems. s.
  The proposed systems should offer several advantages over other much more complex systems, including manufacture, alignment, stability, flexibility of changes of image scale, and costs. The underlying design concepts also make the proposed FPI systems robust and highly performing in terms of image quality, overall transmission, and fidelity of the spectral transmission profile.</description>

      <title>A machine learning-enabled search for binary black hole mergers in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRAs third observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a search for stellar-mass binary black hole mergers in gravitational-wave data collected by the LIGO detectors during the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) third observing run (O3). Our search uses a machine learning (ML) based method, Aframe, an alternative to traditional matched filtering search techniques. The O3 observing run has been analyzed by the LVK collaboration, producing GWTC-3, the most recent catalog installment which has been made publicly available in 2021. Various groups outside the LVK have re-analyzed O3 data using both traditional and ML-based approaches. Here, we identify 38 candidates with probability of astrophysical origin ($p_\mathrm{astro}$) greater than 0.5, which were previously reported in GWTC-3. This is comparable to the number of candidates reported by individual matched-filter searches. In addition, we compare Aframe candidates with catalogs from research groups outside of the LVK, identifying three candidates with $p_\mathrm{astro} &gt; 0.5$. No previously un-reported candidates are identified by Aframe. This work demonstrates that Aframe, and ML based searches more generally, are useful companions to matched filtering pipelines.</description>

      <title>robostrategy: Field and Target Assignment Optimization in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithmic method for efficiently planning a long-term, large-scale multi-object spectroscopy program. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) Focal Plane System performs multi-object spectroscopy using 500 robotic positioners to place fibers feeding optical and infrared spectrographs across a wide field. SDSS-V uses this system to observe targets throughout the year at two observatories in support of the science goals of its Milky Way Mapper and Black Hole Mapper programs. These science goals require observations of objects over time with preferred temporal spacinges (referred to as "cadences"), which can differ from object to object even in the same area of sky. robostrategy is the software we use to construct our planned observations so that they can best achieve the desired goals given the time available as a function of sky brightness and local sidereal time, and to assign fibers to targets during specific observations. We use linear programming techniques to seek optimal allocations of time under the constraints given. We present the methods and example results obtained with this software.</description>

      <title>Measurement of cosmic muon-induced events in an HPGe detector using time-coincidence technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detailed understanding and suppression of backgrounds are among the key challenges faced by Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE\ensuremath{\nu}NS) experiments. The sensitivity of these experiments is largely determined by the background levels arising from various sources. Above-ground and shallow-overburden neutrino experiments typically employ passive shielding, primarily composed of lead (Pb), to suppress environmental $\gamma$ background. However, such shielding can introduce additional backgrounds that are particularly challenging for CE\ensuremath{\nu}NS experiments. These backgrounds arise mainly from $\gamma$ and neutrons produced by cosmic muon interactions in the shielding, and their contribution can become significant depending on the amount of Pb shielding used. In the current work, we measure the yield of secondary particles originating from Pb as a result of high-energy cosmic muon interaction, using a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector and plastic scintillators. A time-coincidence technique is used to identify and reject these secondary background events from the experimental data. The obtained mean characteristic time of these residual background events is 11 $\pm$ 4 $\mu$s, which is consistent with the Geant4-based MC simulation result of 11 $\pm$ 1 $\mu$s. The measured efficiency-corrected rate of muon-induced events in the HPGe detector is 34 $\pm$ 1 (stat.) $\pm$ 3 (sys.) day$^{-1}$kg$^{-1}$ within the energy range of 30 keV to 2000 keV. The yield of muon-induced secondary backgrounds in 10 cm thick Pb shielding is evaluated to be $(11 \pm 1 (\text{stat.}) \pm 1 (\text{sys.}))$ secondary events$\thinspace\text{kg}^{-1}\thinspace\mathrm{m^{-2}}\thinspace\text{muon}^{-1}$ at sea level.</description>

      <title>Highlights from Exoplanet Observations by the James Webb Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has started a revolution in exoplanetary science. From studying in exquisite detail the chemical inventories and physical processes in gas giant exoplanets, the structure and chemical diversity of the enigmatic sub-Neptune population to even providing constraints on the atmospheric make-up of rocky exoplanets, the observatory is enabling cutting-edge science that is touching virtually every sub-area in the field. In this review Chapter, we showcase key highlights from exoplanet science being conducted with this state-of-the-art space observatory, which we believe is representative of the transformational science it is producing. One of the key takeaways from these pioneering JWST observations is how they are starting to reshape not only how we think, study and interpret exoplanet observations -- but how they are also reshaping our intuition about our very own Solar System planets.</description>

      <title>AstroVisBench: A Code Benchmark for Scientific Computing and Visualization in Astronomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20538v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being explored for applications in scientific research, including their capabilities to synthesize literature, answer research questions, generate research ideas, and even conduct computational experiments. Ultimately, our goal is for these to help scientists derive novel scientific insights. In many areas of science, such insights often arise from processing and visualizing data to understand its patterns. However, evaluating whether an LLM-mediated scientific workflow produces outputs conveying the correct scientific insights is challenging to evaluate and has not been addressed in past work. We introduce AstroVisBench, the first benchmark for both scientific computing and visualization in the astronomy domain. AstroVisBench judges a language model's ability to both (1) create astronomy-specific workflows to process and analyze data and (2) visualize the results of these workflows through complex plots. Our evaluation of visualizations uses a novel LLM-as-a-judge workflow, which is validated against annotation by five professional astronomers. Using AstroVisBench we present an evaluation of state-of-the-art language models, showing a significant gap in their ability to engage in astronomy research as useful assistants. This evaluation provides a strong end-to-end evaluation for AI scientists that offers a path forward for the development of visualization-based workflows, which are central to a broad range of domains from physics to biology.</description>

      <title>Continuous Habitable Zone Metric for Prioritizing Habitable Worlds Observatory Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future direct imaging space telescopes, such as NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), will be the first capable of both detecting and characterizing terrestrial exoplanets in the habitable zones (HZ) of nearby Sun-like stars. Since this will require a significant amount of time and resources for even a single system or exoplanet, the likelihood that a system will host detectable life should be considered when prioritizing observations. One method of prioritization is to estimate the likelihood that an exoplanet has remained continuously within the HZ long enough for life to emerge and make a detectable impact on the atmosphere. We utilize a Bayesian method to calculate the likelihood that a given orbital radius around a star is currently in the 2 Gyr continuous habitable zone (CHZ$_2$), the approximate time it took life on Earth to significantly oxygenate the atmosphere. We apply this method to the 164 stars in the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program Mission Star List (EMSL) for HWO, representing a preliminary sample of Sun-like stars with HZs most accessible to a future direct imaging mission. By considering the CHZ$_2$ likelihood at all orbital radii outside a hypothetical inner working angle for HWO, we define a metric for prioritizing targets according to the accessibility and total extent of the CHZ$_2$. We find that the CHZ$_2$ metric peaks between $3-4$ Gyr for late-F and early-G dwarfs, but tentatively determine that stars earlier than $\sim {F3}$ or hotter than $\sim 6600$ K are unlikely to have a CHZ$_2$ at the time of observation.</description>

      <title>The Extreme Universe Observatory on a Super-Pressure Balloon II: Mission, Payload, and Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) is a pathfinder mission toward a space-based observatory such as the Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA). The aim of POEMMA is the observation of Ultra High Energy COsmic Rays (UHECRs) in order to elucidate their nature and origins and to discover $\gtrsim$ 20 PeV very high energy neutrinos that originate from transient and steady astrophysical sources. EUSO-SPB2 was launched from W\=anaka New Zealand on May 13th, 2023 as a NASA Balloon Program Office test flight. The mission goals included making the first near-space altitude observations of the fluorescence emission from UHECR-induced extensive air showers (EASs) and making the first direct Cherenkov light emission from PeV cosmic rays traversing Earth's atmosphere. In addition, a Target of Opportunity program was developed for selecting and scheduling observations of potential neutrino sources as they passed just below the Earth's limb. Although a leaky balloon forced termination over the Pacific Ocean after 37 hours, data was collected to demonstrate the successful commissioning and operation of the instruments. This paper includes a description of the payload and the key instruments, pre-flight instrument characterizations in the lab and in the desert, flight operations and examples of the data collected. The flight was too short to catch a UHECR event via fluorescence, however about 10 candidate EAS events from cosmic rays were recorded via Cherenkov light.</description>

      <title>A numerical approach for modelling the polarisation signals of strong resonance lines with partial frequency redistribution. Numerical applications to two-term atoms and plane-parallel atmospheres</title>

Abstract: Aims. The main goal of this paper is to present an accurate and efficient numerical strategy for solving the radiative transfer problem for polarised radiation in strong resonance lines forming out of local thermodynamic equilibrium, taking angle-dependent (AD) partial frequency redistribution (PRD) effects and J-state interference into account. We consider the polarisation produced both by the Zeeman effect and by the scattering of anisotropic radiation, along with its sensitivity to the Hanle and magneto-optical effects. Methods. We introduce a formalism that allows treating both a two-level and a two-term atom in the presence of arbitrary magnetic and bulk velocity fields. The problem is formulated by treating the population of the lower level/term as a fixed input parameter. This approach makes the problem linear with respect to the radiation field, enabling the application of efficient matrix-free preconditioned iterative methods for its solution. Additionally, the computation of the scattering emissivity in the comoving frame, together with a careful choice of the angular and spectral quadrature nodes, allow us to speed up the calculations by reducing the number of evaluations of the redistribution functions. Results. The proposed solution strategy is applied to synthesise the Stokes profiles of the Mg ii h&amp;k doublet and the H i Ly-{\alpha} line in 1D semi-empirical models. The results demonstrate that the method is both fast and accurate. A comparison with calculations from HanleRT-TIC displays an overall good agreement, thereby validating our solution strategy. Moreover, for the wavelength-integrated polarisation profiles of the H i Ly-{\alpha} line, we find an excellent agreement between the results obtained including PRD effects in their general AD description and those obtained considering the angle-averaged simplifying approximation.</description>

      <title>Parameter inference of microlensed gravitational waves using neural spline flows</title>

Abstract: When gravitational waves (GWs) propagate near massive objects, they undergo gravitational lensing that imprints lens model dependent modulations on the waveform. This effect provides a powerful tool for cosmological and astrophysical studies. However, conventional Bayesian parameter inference methods for GWs are computationally expensive, especially for lensed events with additional lens parameters, necessitating more efficient approaches. In this work, we explore the use of neural spline flows (NSFs) for posterior inference of microlensed GWs, and successfully apply NSFs to the inference of 13-dimensional lens parameters. Our results demonstrate that compared with traditional methods like Bilby dynesty that rely on Bayesian inference, the NSF network we built not only achieves inference accuracy comparable to traditional methods for the main parameters, but also can reduce the inference time from approximately 3 days to 0.8 s on average. Additionally, the network exhibits strong generalization for the spin parameters of GW sources. It is anticipated to become a powerful tool for future low-latency searches for lensed GW signals.</description>

      <title>Kilonova modelling and parameter inference: Understanding uncertainties and evaluating compatibility between observations and models</title>

Abstract: In the study of optical transients, parameter inference is the process of extracting physical information, i.e. constraints on the source's characteristics, by comparing the observed lightcurves to the predictions of different models and finding the model and parameter combination that make the closest match. In the developing field of the study of kilonovae (KNe), systematic uncertainties in modelling are still very large, and many models struggle to fit satisfactorily the whole multi-wavelength dataset of the AT2017gfo kilonova, associated to the Binary Neutron Star (BNS) merger GW170817. In a multi-messenger context, we sometime observe tensions between KN-only inference results and constraints from other messengers. In order to discuss the compatibility of KN models with observations and with the information derived from other messengers, we detail the process of Bayesian parameter inference, identifying the many sources of uncertainty embedded in KN analyses. We highlight the systematic error margin hyperparameter $\sigma_{\rm sys}$, which can be exploited as a metric for a model's goodness-of-fit. We then discuss how to assess the performance of parameter inference analyses by quantifying the information gain using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between prior and posterior. Using the example of the Bu2019lm model with the NMMA Bayesian inference framework, we showcase the expected performance that dedicated KN follow-ups with telescope networks could reasonably reach, highlighting the different factors (observational cadence, error margins) that influence such inference performances. We finally apply our KN analysis to the dataset of AT2017gfo to validate our performance predictions and discuss the complementarity of multi-messenger approaches.</description>

      <title>Calibration requirement for Epoch of Reionization 21-cm signal observation -- III. Bias and variance in uGMRT ELAIS-N1 field power spectrum</title>

Abstract: Power spectrum of \HI 21-cm radiation is one of the promising probes to study large scale structure of the universe and understand galaxy formation and evolution. The presence of foregrounds, that are orders of magnitude larger in the same frequency range of the redshifted 21-cm signal has been one of the largest observational challenges. The foreground contamination also hinders the calibration procedures and introduces residual calibration errors in the interferometric data. It has been shown that the calibration errors can introduce bias in the 21-cm power spectrum estimates and introduce additional systematics. In this work, we assess the efficacy of 21-cm power spectrum estimation for the uGMRT Band-3 observations of the ELAIS-N1 field. We first evaluate the statistics of the residual gain errors and perform additional flagging based on these statistics. We then use an analytical method to estimate the bias and variance in the power spectrum. We found that (a) the additional flagging based on calibration accuracy help reduce the bias and systematics in the power spectrum, (b) the majority of the systematics at the lower angular scales, $\ell &lt; 6000$, are due to the residual gain errors, (c) for the uGMRT baseline configuration and system parameters, the variance is always higher than the bias in the power spectrum estimates. Based on our analysis we observe that for an angular multipole of $\ell \sim3000$, $2000$ hours of `on source time' is required with the uGMRT to detect redshifted 21-cm signal at $3-\sigma$ significance from a redshift of $2.55$. In this work we only consider the power spectrum measurement in the plane of the sky, an assessment of residual gain statistics and its effect on multifrequency angular power spectrum estimation for the uGMRT and the SKA like telescopes will be presented in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Proton Flux Measurement from Neutron Monitor Data Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate measurements of cosmic ray proton flux are essential for studying the modulation processes of cosmic rays during the solar activity cycle. A proton flux measurement method, based on ground-based neutron monitor (NM) data and deep learning techniques, is presented. After the necessary pre-processing of ground-based NM data using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, we simulate the relationship between NM observations and proton flux measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS). The daily proton flux data, ranging from 1 GV to 100 GV, are obtained for the period from 2011 to 2024, showing strong agreement with the observed values. In addition, daily proton flux measurements are provided for periods when AMS data were unavailable due to operational reasons. For the first time, hourly proton fluxes as a function of rigidity are calculated dedicated to the short-time solar activity studies.</description>

      <title>Calibration requirements for Epoch of Reionization 21-cm signal observations -- IV. Bias and variance with time and frequency correlated residual gains</title>

Abstract: Observation of multifrequency angular power spectrum of the redshifted 21-cm brightness temperature fluctuation from the neutral hydrogen holds the key to understand the structure formation and its evolution during the reionization and post-reionization era. A major challenge in observing the neutral hydrogen arises from presence of strong foreground signals in the frequency range of interest. Mitigating the direct effect of foregrounds are being addressed through various techniques in literature. An additional second order effect arises, in presence of foreground, with limited accuracy in time and frequency dependent gain calibrations. This manifests as the residual gain and bandpass error in the observed data, introduces bias and increases uncertainty in the estimates of multifrequency angular power spectrum. In this work, we present an analytic method to estimate the bias and excess uncertainty in the estimates of multifrequency angular power spectrum in presence of residual gain and bandpass errors. We use this framework to estimate the effect of these errors for detection of redshifted 21-cm emission from a redshift of $\sim 8$ with the upcoming SKA1-Low. Due to the high baseline density at the required range of angular multipoles, the SKA1-Low is found to be a tuned instrument for the redshifted 21-cm signal detection. We find that, there are scenario with residual gain and bandpass errors where there can be significant bias in these estimates. Certain foreground mitigation strategies, is expected to reduce a part of the bias. The detailed study of different aspects of gain and bandpass errors and their relative effects are discussed. We find, with assumed models of gain and bandpass errors, signal detection is possible at this redshift with $128$ hours of observations. However, to achieve this one needs to have better calibration accuracy than present day interferometers.</description>
