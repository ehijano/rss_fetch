      <title>Beyond traditional box-covering: Determining the fractal dimension of complex networks using a fixed number of boxes of flexible diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel box-covering algorithm for analyzing the fractal properties of complex networks. Unlike traditional algorithms that impose a predefined box size, our approach assigns nodes to boxes identified by the nearest local hubs without rigid distance constraints. This flexibility directly relates to the recently proposed scaling theory of fractal complex networks and is clearly consistent with the idea of hidden metric spaces in which network nodes are embedded. It also allows us to determine the box dimension of various real and model-based complex networks more accurately, including those previously unrecognized as fractal, such as the Internet at the level of autonomous systems. We show that our algorithm not only significantly reduces computational complexity compared to the classical greedy coloring method but also enables more precise determination of various scaling exponents describing the structure of fractal networks.</description>

      <title>Electric transport as a probe to unveil microscopic aspects of oxygen-depleted YBCO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the characterization of Pt-YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ interfaces, focusing on how oxygen vacancies content ($\delta$) affects electrical transport mechanisms. Our study examines four Pt-YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ samples with varying $\delta$ (0.12 $\leq \delta \leq$ 0.56) using voltage-current measurements across a temperature range. We successfully model the electrical behavior using a Poole-Frenkel conduction framework, revealing that oxygen vacancies create potential wells that trap carriers, directly influencing conduction. We observe that the energy of these traps increases as $\delta$ rises, in agreement with a peak previously detected in optical conductivity measurements. This result supports earlier interpretations, strengthening the proposed connection between oxygen vacancies and the ionization energy associated with impurity bands in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$.</description>

      <title>Engineering-Oriented Design of Drift-Resilient MTJ Random Number Generator via Hybrid Control Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the quest for secure and reliable random number generation, Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) have emerged as a promising technology due to their unique ability to exploit the stochastic nature of magnetization switching. This paper presents an engineering-oriented design of a drift-resilient MTJ-based True Random Number Generator (TRNG) utilizing a hybrid control strategy. We address the critical issue of switching probability drift, which can compromise the randomness and bias the output of MTJ-based TRNGs. Our approach combines a self-stabilization strategy, which dynamically adjusts the driving voltage based on real-time feedback, with pulse width modulation to enhance control over the switching probability. Through comprehensive experimental and simulation results, we demonstrate significant improvements in the stability, uniformity, and quality of the random numbers generated. The proposed system offers flexibility and adaptability for diverse applications, making it a reliable solution for high-quality randomness in cryptography, secure communications, and beyond.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Optimal Self-Distillation in Noisy Gaussian Mixture Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-distillation (SD), a technique where a model refines itself from its own predictions, has garnered attention as a simple yet powerful approach in machine learning. Despite its widespread use, the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of hyperparameter-tuned multi-stage SD in binary classification tasks with noisy labeled Gaussian mixture data, utilizing a replica theory. Our findings reveals that the primary driver of SD's performance improvement is denoising through hard pseudo-labels, with the most notable gains observed in moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate the efficacy of practical heuristics, such as early stopping for extracting meaningful signal and bias fixation for imbalanced data. These results provide both theoretical guarantees and practical insights, advancing our understanding and application of SD in noisy settings.</description>

      <title>From scale-free to Anderson localization: a size-dependent transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scale-free localization in non-Hermitian systems is a distinctive type of localization where the localization length of certain eigenstates, known as scale-free localized (SFL) states, scales proportionally with the system size. Unlike skin states, where the localization length is independent of the system size, SFL states maintain a spatial profile that remains invariant as the system size changes. We consider a model involving a single non-Hermitian impurity in an otherwise Hermitian one-dimensional lattice. Introducing disorder into this system transforms SFL states into Anderson-localized states. In contrast to the Hatano-Nelson model, where disorder typically leads to the localization of skin states and a size-independent Anderson transition, the scale-free localization in our model causes a size-dependent Anderson transition.</description>

      <title>Microscopic dynamics and Bose-Einstein condensation in liquid helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.06323v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review fundamental problems involved in liquid theory including both classical and quantum liquids. Understanding classical liquids involves exploring details of their microscopic dynamics and its consequences. Here, we apply the same general idea to quantum liquids. We discuss momentum condensation in liquid helium which is consistent with microscopic dynamics in liquids and high mobility of liquid atoms. We propose that mobile transit atoms accumulate in the finite-energy state where the transit speed is close to the speed of sound. In this state, the transit energy is close to the zero-point energy. In momentum space, the accumulation operates on a sphere with the radius set by interatomic spacing and corresponds to zero net momentum. We show that this picture is supported by experiments, including the kinetic energy of helium atoms below the superfluid transition and sharp peaks of scattered intensity at predicted energy. We discuss the implications of this picture including the macroscopic wave function and superfluidity. The superfluid transition temperature is evaluated to be within 15% of the experimental value.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Noise-Robust Losses for Large-Scale Noisy Data Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large annotated datasets inevitably contain noisy labels, which poses a major challenge for training deep neural networks as they easily memorize the labels. Noise-robust loss functions have emerged as a notable strategy to counteract this issue, but it remains challenging to create a robust loss function which is not susceptible to underfitting. Through a quantitative approach, this paper explores the limited overlap between the network output at initialization and regions of non-vanishing gradients of bounded loss functions in the initial learning phase. Using these insights, we address underfitting of several noise robust losses with a novel method denoted as logit bias, which adds a real number $\epsilon$ to the logit at the position of the correct class. The logit bias enables these losses to achieve state-of-the-art results, even on datasets like WebVision, consisting of over a million images from 1000 classes. In addition, we demonstrate that our method can be used to determine optimal parameters for several loss functions -- without having to train networks. Remarkably, our method determines the hyperparameters based on the number of classes, resulting in loss functions which require zero dataset or noise-dependent parameters.</description>

      <title>Nonuniversality in random criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $N$ two-dimensional Ising models coupled in presence of quenched disorder and use scale invariant scattering theory to exactly show the presence of a line of renormalization group fixed points for any fixed value of $N$ other than 1. We show how this result relates to perturbative studies and sheds light on numerical simulations. We also observe that the limit $N\to 1$ may be of interest for the Ising spin glass, and point out potential relevance for nonuniversality in other contexts of random criticality.</description>

      <title>On the time complexity analysis of numerical percolation threshold estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of percolation theory is to model phase transitions in a variety of random systems, which is highly valuable in fields related to materials physics, biology, or otherwise unrelated areas like oil extraction or even quantum computing. Thus, one of the problems encountered is the calculation of the threshold at which such transition occurs, known as percolation threshold. Since there are no known closed forms to determine the threshold in an exact manner in systems with particular properties, it is decided to rely on numerical methods as the Monte Carlo approach, which provides a sufficiently accurate approximation to serve as a valid estimate in the projects or research where it is involved. However, in order to achieve an exact characterization of the threshold in two-dimensional systems with site percolation, in this work it is performed an analysis of the complexity, both temporal and spatial, of an algorithm that implements its computation from the aforementioned numerical method. Specifically, the conduction of an accurate analysis of the cost of such algorithm implies a deep enough knowledge about certain metrics regarding its duration, or work completed per iteration, which along with its formalization may contribute to the determination of the threshold based on these metrics. Nevertheless, as a result, various bounds are achieved for the best, average and worst cases of the execution on systems spanning several dimensions, revealing that in 1 and 2 the complexity is directly conditioned by the duration, although from 3 onwards no proof for this point has been found, notwithstanding the evidence suggesting its compliance. Furthermore, based on the average case, several methods are proposed that could be applied to characterize the threshold, although they have not been thoroughly explored beyond what is necessary for the complexity analysis.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Quantum and Thermal Fluctuations in Two-Dimensional Randomly Pinned Charge Density Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations in the presence of quenched random disorder is a long-standing open theoretical problem which has been made more urgent by advances in modern experimental techniques. The fragility of charge density wave order to impurities makes this problem of particular interest in understanding a host of real materials, including the cuprate high-temperature superconductors. To address this question, we consider the quantum version of an exactly solvable classical model of two-dimensional randomly pinned incommensurate charge density waves first introduced by us in a recent work, and use the large-$N$ technique to obtain the phase diagram and order parameter correlations. Our theory considers quantum and thermal fluctuations and disorder on equal footing by accounting for all effects non-perturbatively, which reveals a novel crossover between under-damped and over-damped dynamics of the fluctuations of the charge density wave order parameter.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking in mixed states emerging from the quantum Ising model under multiple decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Specific types of decoherence applied to typical quantum many-body states can induce a novel kind of mixed state accompanying characteristic symmetry orders, which has no counterparts in pure many-body states. We study phenomena generated by interplay between two types of decoherence applied to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM). We show that in the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decoherence can be described by filtering operation applied to matrix product states (MPS) defined in the doubled Hilbert system. The filtering operation induces specific deformation of the MPS, which approximates the ground state of a certain parent Hamiltonian in the doubled Hilbert space. In the present case, such a parent Hamiltonian is the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, having a rich phase diagram with a critical lines and quantum phase transitions. By investigating the deformed MPS, we find various types of mixed states emergent from the ground states of the TFIM, and clarify phase transitions between them. In that study, strong and weak $Z_2$ symmetries play an important role, for which we introduce efficient order parameters, such as R\'{e}nyi-2 correlators, entanglement entropy, etc., in the doubled Hilbert space.</description>
