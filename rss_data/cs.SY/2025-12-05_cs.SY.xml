      <title>Quantum-Embedded Dynamic Security Control using Hybrid Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic security control (DSC) is considered a pivotal step for the future power grid, which is increasingly penetrated by inverter-based resources. However, the efficiency of such practices, whether governed by automatic generation control or virtual inertia scheduling, can be intractable due to the complexity of the problem and the need to solve the differentialalgebraic equation in a timely manner with the required accuracy. In this regard, the model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm demonstrates reliable performance. In addition, the introduction of fault-tolerant and near-term quantum computing terminologies, i.e., noisy intermediate-scale quantum, opens avenues for improving the performance of model-free algorithms leveraging quantum capabilities. This paper provides an organized framework and assesses its dependability by evaluating the performance of a quantum-embedded algorithm on the DSC of the IEEE 39-bus test system. Hence, the obtained results demonstrate promising applications, along with shortcomings that can be addressed and further developed later.</description>

      <title>PINN vs LSTM: A Comparative Study for Steam Temperature Control in Heat Recovery Steam Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a direct comparative study of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for adaptive steam temperature control in Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSGs), particularly under valve leakage faults. Maintaining precise steam temperature in HRSGs is critical for efficiency and safety, yet traditional control strategies struggle with nonlinear, fault-induced dynamics. Both architectures are designed to adaptively tune the gains of a PI-plus-feedforward control law in real-time. The LSTM controller, a purely data-driven approach, was trained offline on historical operational data, while the PINN controller integrates fundamental thermodynamic laws directly into its online learning process through a physics-based loss function. Their performance was evaluated using a model validated with data from a combined cycle power plant, under normal load changes and a challenging valve leakage fault scenario. Results demonstrate that while the LSTM controller offers significant improvement over conventional methods, its performance degrades under the unseen fault. The PINN controller consistently delivered superior robustness and performance, achieving a 54\% reduction in integral absolute error compared to the LSTM under fault conditions. This study concludes that embedding physical knowledge into data-driven control is essential for developing reliable, fault-tolerant autonomous control systems in complex industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Configuration-Constrained Tube MPC for Periodic Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic operation often emerges as the economically optimal mode in industrial processes, particularly under varying economic or environmental conditions. This paper proposes a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework for uncertain systems modeled as polytopic linear differential inclusions (LDIs), where the dynamics evolve as convex combinations of finitely many affine control systems with additive disturbances. The robust control problem is reformulated as a convex optimization program by optimizing over configuration-constrained polytopic tubes and tracks a periodic trajectory that is optimal for a given economic criterion. Artificial variables embedded in the formulation ensure recursive feasibility and robust constraint satisfaction when the economic criterion is updated online, while guaranteeing convergence to the corresponding optimal periodic tube when the criterion remains constant. To improve computational efficiency, we introduce a quadratic over-approximation of the periodic cost under a Lipschitz continuity assumption, yielding a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation that preserves the above theoretical guarantees. The effectiveness and scalability of the approach are demonstrated on a benchmark example and a ball-plate system with eight states.</description>

      <title>Stability of Lyapunov redesign trajectory tracking control with unbounded perturbations -- A tube-based stability analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering a nonlinear system in Byrnes-Isidori form that is subject to unbounded perturbations, we apply Lyapunov redesign via feedback linearisation for trajectory tracking. Leveraging the ideas of tube-based geometric characterisation of the invariance properties of the closed loop, we generalise the classical stability criterion from the~literature from constant to nonconstant reference trajectories. The proposed analysis is tailored to the Lyapunov redesign and the tracking problem insofar as we incorporate the reference trajectory and the transient decrease of the tracking error enforced by the controller. In particular, we exploit that the Lyapunov function of the tracking error satisfies a differential inequality, thereby guaranteeing that the solution of the closed loop remains in a contracting tube along the reference trajectory.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Dynamic Line Rating with Line Graph Convolutional LSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic line rating (DLR) is an effective approach to enhancing the utilization of existing transmission line infrastructure by adapting line ratings according to real-time weather conditions. Accurate DLR forecasts are essential for grid operators to effectively schedule generation, manage transmission congestion, and lower operating costs. As renewable generation becomes increasingly variable and weather-dependent, accurate DLR forecasts are also crucial for improving renewable utilization and reducing curtailment during congested periods. Deterministic forecasts, however, often inadequately represent actual line capacities under uncertain weather conditions, leading to operational risks and costly real-time adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel network-wide probabilistic DLR forecasting model that leverages both spatial and temporal information, significantly reducing the operational risks and inefficiencies inherent in deterministic methods. Case studies on a synthetic Texas 123-bus system demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances grid reliability by effectively capturing true DLR values, but also substantially reduces operational costs.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Accelerated Deep Reinforcement Learning for Frequency Regulation Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern power systems, frequency regulation is a fundamental prerequisite for ensuring system reliability and assessing the robustness of expansion projects. Conventional feedback control schemes, however, exhibit limited accuracy under varying operating conditions because their gains remain static. Consequently, deep reinforcement learning methods are increasingly employed to design adaptive controllers that can be generalized to diverse frequency control tasks. At the same time, recent advances in quantum computing provide avenues for embedding quantum capabilities into such critical applications. In particular, the potential of quantum algorithms can be more effectively explored and harnessed on near-term quantum devices by leveraging insights from active controller design. In this work, we incorporate a quantum circuit together with an ansatz into the operation of a deep deterministic policy gradient agent. The simulation results of the IEEE 14-bus test system demonstrate the potential of this integrated approach that can achieve reliable, robust performance across diverse real-world challenges.</description>

      <title>Optimizing DER Aggregate Flexibility via Network Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aggregate flexibility region of distributed energy resources (DERs) quantifies the aggregate power shaping capabilities of DERs. It characterizes the distribution network's potential for wholesale market participation and grid service provision at the transmission level. To enhance flexibility and fully exploit the potential of DERs, this paper proposes a method to optimize the aggregate flexibility region through distribution network reconfiguration. First, we formulate the ellipsoidal aggregate flexibility region characterization problem as a two-stage adaptive robust optimization problem and derive an exact convex reformulation with a large number of second-order cone constraints. By exploiting the problem structure, we propose a scalable Benders decomposition algorithm with provable finite convergence to the optimal solution. Finally, we propose an optimal reconfiguration problem for aggregate flexibility region optimization and solve it using the custom Benders decomposition. Numerical simulations on the IEEE 123-bus test feeder demonstrate that, compared to existing approaches, substantial improvements in the aggregate flexibility region can be achieved over multiple scenarios with the optimized topology.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Time-Domain Harmonic Control for Noise-Vibration-Harshness Reduction of Electric Drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing Noise, Vibration, and Harshness (NVH) in electric drives is crucial for applications such as electric vehicle drivetrains and heat-pump compressors, where strict NVH requirements directly affect user satisfaction and component longevity. This work presents the integration of an adaptive time-domain harmonic controller into an existing electric-drive control loop to attenuate harmonic disturbances. Three control structures are proposed and analyzed, along with a modified parameter-estimation scheme that reduces computational effort while preserving estimation accuracy, making the method suitable for embedded real-time implementation. To cope with fast operating-point changes, a delta-learning approach combines adaptive control with a lookup-table-based feedforward estimator, ensuring fast convergence and robustness. The proposed controller architectures are validated through simulation and testbench experiments on a permanent-magnet synchronous machine drive, demonstrating substantial NVH reductions across operating conditions. The results confirm that time-domain adaptive harmonic control offers a practical and theoretically grounded solution for real-time NVH mitigation in electric drives.</description>

      <title>Efficient Safety Verification of Autonomous Vehicles with Neural Network Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When autonomous vehicles encounter untrained scenarios, ensuring safety hinges on effective safety verification to prevent accidents stemming from unexpected model decisions. Reachability analysis, a method of safety verification, offers relatively high precision but at the cost of significant computational complexity. Our method leverages end-to-end neural network operators to compute reachable sets, replacing traditional mathematical set operators, thereby achieving higher efficiency in safety verification without substantially compromising accuracy or increasing conservativeness. We define vehicle dynamics on discrete time series and detail the safety verification process and safety standard based on reachable sets. Experimental evaluations conducted in several typical road driving scenarios demonstrate the superior efficiency performance of our proposed operator over classical methods.</description>

      <title>Adapt and Stabilize, Then Learn and Optimize: A New Approach to Adaptive LQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on adaptive control of the discrete-time linear quadratic regulator (adaptive LQR). Recent literature has made significant contributions in proving non-asymptotic convergence rates, but existing approaches have a few drawbacks that pose barriers for practical implementation. These drawbacks include (i) a requirement of an initial stabilizing controller, (ii) a reliance on exploration for closed-loop stability, and/or (iii) computationally intensive algorithms. This paper proposes a new algorithm that overcomes these drawbacks for a particular class of discrete-time systems. This algorithm leverages direct Model-Reference Adaptive Control (direct MRAC) and combines it with an epoch-based approach in order to address the drawbacks (i)-(iii) with a provable high-probability regret bound comparable to existing literature. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach yields regrets that are comparable to those from existing methods when the conditions (i) and (ii) are met, and yields regrets that are significantly smaller when either of these two conditions is not met.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Newton accelerated MPPI Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control is a sampling-based optimization method that has recently attracted attention, particularly in the robotics and reinforcement learning communities. MPPI has been widely applied as a GPU-accelerated random search method to deterministic direct single-shooting optimal control problems arising in model predictive control (MPC) formulations. MPPI offers several key advantages, including flexibility, robustness, ease of implementation, and inherent parallelizability. However, its performance can deteriorate in high-dimensional settings since the optimal control problem is solved via Monte Carlo sampling. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an enhanced MPPI method that incorporates a Jacobian reconstruction technique and the second-order Generalized Gauss-Newton method. This novel approach is called \textit{Gauss-Newton accelerated MPPI}. The numerical results show that the Gauss-Newton accelerated MPPI approach substantially improves MPPI scalability and computational efficiency while preserving the key benefits of the classical MPPI framework, making it a promising approach even for high-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Strategies for zero boil-off liquid hydrogen transfer: an export terminal case-study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To ensure economic viability, LH2 export terminals must minimize boil-off losses. We show two strategies to achieve zero boil-off losses for the transfer of 160 000 m3 LH2 (11 248 tons) using a centrifugal pump. In the first strategy, a pump with variable speed drive (VSD) and split-range control for the flow rate achieves losses from 0 wt% to 0.24 wt% in an uncertainty analysis. A pump efficiency approaching 70% is the most important factor to minimize losses. In contrast, a fixed-speed pump has unacceptably high losses ranging from 0.76 wt% to 1.06 wt% (119 tons per ship). The second strategy is to increase the maximum pressure in the seaborne tank (base case is 1.15 bara). Zero loss is achieved for the fixed speed pump if the maximum pressure is increased to 1.35 bara, while 1.22 bara is required for the pump with VSD assuming an efficiency of 60%.</description>

      <title>Auto-Optimization with Active Learning in Uncertain Environment: A Predictive Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an auto-optimal model predictive control (MPC) framework enhanced with active learning, designed to autonomously track optimal operational conditions in an unknown environment,where the conditions may dynamically adjust to environmental changes. First, an exploitation-oriented MPC (EO-MPC) is proposed, integrating real-time sampling data with robust set-based parameter estimation techniques to address the critical challenge of parameter identification. By introducing virtual excitation signals into the terminal constraint and establishing a validation mechanism for persistent excitation condition, the EO-MPC effectively resolves the issue of insufficient persistent excitation in parameter identification. Building upon this foundation, an active learning MPC (AL-MPC) approach is developed to integrate both available and virtual future data to resolve the fundamental conflict between tracking an unknown optimal operational condition and parameter identification. The recursive feasibility and convergence of the proposed methods are rigorously established, and numerous examples substantiate the reliability and effectiveness of the approach in practical applications.</description>

      <title>A Unified Low-rank ADI Framework with Shared Linear Solves for Simultaneously Solving Multiple Lyapunov, Sylvester, and Riccati Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known in the literature that the low-rank ADI method for Lyapunov equations is a Petrov-Galerkin projection algorithm that implicitly performs model order reduction. In this paper, we show that the low-rank ADI methods for Sylvester and Riccati equations are also Petrov-Galerkin projection algorithms that implicitly perform model order reduction. By observing that the ADI methods for Lyapunov, Sylvester, and Riccati equations differ only in pole placement and not in their interpolatory nature, we show that the shifted linear solves-which constitute the bulk of the computational cost-can be shared. The pole-placement step involves only small-scale operations and is therefore inexpensive. We propose a unified ADI framework that requires only two shifted linear solves per iteration to simultaneously solve six Lyapunov equations, one Sylvester equation, and ten Riccati equations, thus substantially increasing the return on investment for the computational cost spent on the linear solves. All operations needed to extract the individual solutions from these shared linear solves are small-scale and inexpensive.
  Since all ADI methods implicitly perform model order reduction when solving these linear matrix equations, we show that the resulting reduced-order models can be obtained as an additional byproduct. These models not only interpolate the original transfer function at the mirror images of the ADI shifts but also preserve important system properties such as stability, minimum-phase property, positive-realness, bounded-realness, and passivity. Consequently, the proposed unified ADI framework also serves as a recursive, interpolation-based model order reduction method, which can preserve several important properties of the original model in the reduced-order model.</description>

      <title>Pick-to-Learn for Systems and Control: Data-driven Synthesis with State-of-the-art Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven methods have become paramount in modern systems and control problems characterized by growing levels of complexity. In safety-critical environments, deploying these methods requires rigorous guarantees, a need that has motivated much recent work at the interface of statistical learning and control. However, many existing approaches achieve this goal at the cost of sacrificing valuable data for testing and calibration, or by constraining the choice of learning algorithm, thus leading to suboptimal performances. In this paper, we describe Pick-to-Learn (P2L) for Systems and Control, a framework that allows any data-driven control method to be equipped with state-of-the-art safety and performance guarantees. P2L enables the use of all available data to jointly synthesize and certify the design, eliminating the need to set aside data for calibration or validation purposes. In presenting a comprehensive version of P2L for systems and control, this paper demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of core problems, including optimal control, reachability analysis, safe synthesis, and robust control. In many of these applications, P2L delivers designs and certificates that outperform commonly employed methods, and shows strong potential for broad applicability in diverse practical settings.</description>

      <title>Constrained Control of PDE Traffic Flow via Spatial Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a constrained control approach to variable speed limit (VSL) control for macroscopic partial differential equations (PDE) traffic models is developed. Control Lyapunov function (CLF) theory for ordinary differential equations (ODE) is extended to account for spatially and temporally varying states and control inputs. The stabilizing CLF is then unified with safety constraints through the introduction of spatially varying control barrier functions (sCBF). These methods are applied to in-domain VSL control of the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model to regulate traffic density to a desired profile while ensuring the density remains below prescribed limits enforced by the sCBF. Results show that incorporating constrained control minimally affects the stabilizing control input while successfully maintaining the density with the defined safe set.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Explanations for Power System Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhanced computational capabilities of modern decision-making software have allowed us to solve increasingly sophisticated optimisation problems. But in complex socio-economic, technical environments such as electricity markets, transparent operation is key to ensure a fair treatment of all parties involved, particularly regarding dispatch decisions. We address this issue by building on the concept of counterfactual explanations, answering questions such as "Why was this generator not dispatched?" by identifying minimum changes in the input parameters that would have changed the optimal solution. Both DC Optimal Power Flow and Unit Commitment problems are considered, wherein the variable parameters are the spatial and temporal demand profiles, respectively. The thereby obtained explanations allow users to identify the most important differences between the real and expected market outcomes and observe which constraints have led to the solution. The framework uses a bilevel optimisation problem to find the counterfactual demand scenarios. State-of-the-art methods are compared with data-driven heuristics on the basis of computational efficiency and explanation accuracy. Results show that leveraging historical data from previously solved instances can provide significant speed benefits and allows us to derive explanations in cases where conventional methods would not be tractable.</description>

      <title>Safe model-based Reinforcement Learning via Model Predictive Control and Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal control strategies are often combined with safety certificates to ensure both performance and safety in safety-critical systems. A prominent example is combining Model Predictive Control (MPC) with Control Barrier Functions (CBF). Yet, efficient tuning of MPC parameters and choosing an appropriate class $\mathcal{K}$ function in the CBF is challenging and problem dependent. This paper introduces a safe model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework where a parametric MPC controller incorporates a CBF constraint with a parameterized class $\mathcal{K}$ function and serves as a function approximator to learn improved safe control policies from data. Three variations of the framework are introduced, distinguished by the way the optimization problem is formulated and the class $\mathcal{K}$ function is parameterized, including neural architectures. Numerical experiments on a discrete double-integrator with static and dynamic obstacles demonstrate that the proposed methods improve performance while ensuring safety.</description>

      <title>Stability-Guaranteed Dual Kalman Filtering for Electrochemical Battery State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and stable state estimation is critical for battery management. Although dual Kalman filtering can jointly estimate states and parameters, the strong coupling between filters may cause divergence under large initialization errors or model mismatch. This paper proposes a Stability Guaranteed Dual Kalman Filtering (SG-DKF) method. A Lyapunov-based analysis yields a sufficient stability condition, leading to an adaptive dead-zone rule that suspends parameter updates when the innovation exceeds a stability bound. Applied to an electrochemical battery model, SG-DKF achieves accuracy comparable to a dual EKF and reduces state of charge RMSE by over 45% under large initial state errors.</description>

      <title>Small-Signal Stability Oriented Real-Time Operation of Power Systems with a High Penetration of Inverter-Based Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a control strategy to ensure the safe operation of modern power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) within an optimal operation framework. The objective is to obtain operating points that satisfy the optimality conditions of a predefined problem while guaranteeing small-signal stability. The methodology consists of two stages. First, an offline analysis of a set of operating points is performed to derive a data-driven regression-based expression that captures a damping-based stability index as a function of the operating conditions. Second, an Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controller is employed to drive the system toward an optimal operating point while maintaining a secure distance from the instability region. The proposed strategy is evaluated on an academic test case based on a modified version of the IEEE 9-bus system, in which synchronous generators are replaced by IBRs operating under both grid-following and grid-forming control modes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and are discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>A Randomized Scheduling Framework for Privacy-Preserving Multi-robot Rendezvous given Prior Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy has become a critical concern in modern multi-robot systems, driven by both ethical considerations and operational constraints. As a result, growing attention has been directed toward privacy-preserving coordination in dynamical multi-robot systems. This work introduces a randomized scheduling mechanism for privacy-preserving robot rendezvous. The proposed approach achieves improved privacy even at lower communication rates, where privacy is quantified via pointwise maximal leakage. We show that lower transmission rates provide stronger privacy guarantees and prove that rendezvous is still achieved under the randomized scheduling mechanism. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>The Evolving Landscape of Interactive Surface Sensing Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive surfaces have evolved from capacitive touch and IR based systems into a diverse ecosystem of sensing technologies that support rich and expressive human computer interaction. This survey traces that progression, beginning with infrared vision based approaches, such as FTIR and diffuse illumination, and the rise of capacitive touch as the dominant technology in modern devices, to focusing on contemporary modalities including vision and acoustic sensing. New technologies under development are also discussed, including mmWave radar, and vibration based techniques. Each sensing technique is examined in terms of its operating principles, resolution, scalability, and applications, along with discussions of multimodal integration. By comparing tradeoffs between sensing modalities, the survey highlights the technical and design factors that shape interactive surface performance and user experience. The review concludes by identifying persistent challenges, including sensing accuracy, power constraints, and privacy concerns, and outlines how emerging sensing modalities can enable future interactive environments to be ubiquitous and intelligent.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Safety under Arbitrary Disturbance Distributions using Piecewise-Affine Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple safety filter design for stochastic discrete-time systems based on piecewise affine probabilistic control barrier functions, providing an appealing balance between modeling flexibility and computational complexity. Exact evaluation of the safety filter consists of solving a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) if the dynamics are control-affine (or a mixed-integer nonlinear program in general). We propose a heuristic search method that replaces this by a small number of small-scale quadratic programs (QPs), or nonlinear programs (NLPs) respectively. The proposed approach provides a flexible framework in which arbitrary (data-driven) quantile estimators can be used to bound the probability of safety violations. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate improvements in conservatism and computation time with respect to existing methods, and we illustrate the flexibility of the method for modeling complex safety sets.

      <title>Sliding Mode Control and Subspace Stabilization Methodology for the Orbital Stabilization of Periodic Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a combined sliding-mode control and subspace stabilization methodology for orbital stabilization of periodic trajectories in underactuated mechanical systems with one degree of underactuation. The approach starts with partial feedback linearization and stabilization. Then, transverse linearization along the reference orbit is computed, resulting in a periodic linear time-varying system with a stable subspace. Sliding-mode control drives trajectories toward this subspace. The proposed design avoids solving computationally intensive periodic LQR problems and improves robustness to matched disturbances. The methodology is validated through experiments on the Butterfly robot.</description>

      <title>Experimental Sensitivity Enhancement of a Quantum Rydberg Atom-Based RF Receiver with a Metamaterial GRIN Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate enhanced sensitivity of an atom-based Rydberg radio frequency (RF) receiver integrated with a gradient refractive index (GRIN) Luneburg-type metamaterial lens. By analyzing the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect in Cesium vapor, we compare receiver performance with and without the GRIN lens under a 2.2~GHz and a 3.6~GHz far-field excitation. Our measurements reveal a significant amplification of the EIT transparency window when the lens is introduced, consistent with the theoretical prediction that the local E-field enhancement at the vapor cell reduces the minimum detectable electric field and increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the Rydberg RF receiver. This experimental validation highlights the potential of metamaterial-assisted quantum sensing to overcome the inherent bandwidth and sensitivity limitations of bare Rydberg receivers for a variety of applications, such as electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing, quantum radar, and wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Universal Quantum Interconnects via Phase-Coherent Four-Wave Mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum transduction, which enables the coherent conversion of quantum information between disparate physical platforms, is a cornerstone for realizing scalable and interoperable quantum networks. Among various approaches, parametric frequency mixing processes such as four-wave mixing (FWM) offer a promising pathway toward efficient and low-noise transduction. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of coherent quantum state transfer by indirectly verifying high-fidelity wavefunction's phase mapping (&gt;99%) from the input field to the generated output field wave. Using a gas-filled hollow-core capillary fiber, we systematically investigate spectral phase evolution across a broad range, including infrared (IR) to ultraviolet (UV) transitions, as well as conversions from telecom-band (1550 nm) to visible (516 nm) and deep-UV (308 nm) wavelengths. Our results reveal that strong phase coherence can be maintained throughout these diverse conversion regimes. Because quantum properties such as coherence and entanglement are intrinsically encoded in both the amplitude and phase of a photonic wavefunction, preserving spectral phase is essential for faithful quantum information transfer. We further show that efficient and phase-preserving transduction can be achieved by tuning system parameters, offering valuable insights into nonlinear coupling dynamics. These findings establish a promising foundation for advancing FWM-based quantum transduction schemes and open new avenues for integrating heterogeneous quantum systems across wide spectral domains within future quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Distributed Articulation Point Identification in Time-Varying Undirected Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying articulation points (APs) is fundamental to assessing the robustness of time-varying networks. In such dynamic environments, topological changes including edge additions and deletions can instantly alter the set of APs, demanding rapid and efficient re-assessment. This paper proposes a fully distributed algorithm for identifying APs and monitoring biconnectivity. Our core contribution is an incremental update protocol. Unlike static methods that require global re-initialization which incurs high communication overhead, our algorithm propagates information from the site of the change, updating only the affected nodes' state values. This approach, which builds upon a maximum consensus protocol, not only ensures convergence to the correct AP set following topological changes but also preserves network privacy by preventing nodes from reconstructing the global topology. We provide rigorous proofs of correctness for this eventual convergence and demonstrate its applicability and efficiency through experiments.</description>

      <title>Vision-Language-Action Models for Selective Robotic Disassembly: A Case Study on Critical Component Extraction from Desktops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automating disassembly of critical components from end-of-life (EoL) desktops, such as high-value items like RAM modules and CPUs, as well as sensitive parts like hard disk drives, remains challenging due to the inherent variability and uncertainty of these products. Moreover, their disassembly requires sequential, precise, and dexterous operations, further increasing the complexity of automation. Current robotic disassembly processes are typically divided into several stages: perception, sequence planning, task planning, motion planning, and manipulation. Each stage requires explicit modeling, which limits generalization to unfamiliar scenarios. Recent development of vision-language-action (VLA) models has presented an end-to-end approach for general robotic manipulation tasks. Although VLAs have demonstrated promising performance on simple tasks, the feasibility of applying such models to complex disassembly remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we collected a customized dataset for robotic RAM and CPU disassembly and used it to fine-tune two well-established VLA approaches, OpenVLA and OpenVLA-OFT, as a case study. We divided the whole disassembly task into several small steps, and our preliminary experimental results indicate that the fine-tuned VLA models can faithfully complete multiple early steps but struggle with certain critical subtasks, leading to task failure. However, we observed that a simple hybrid strategy that combines VLA with a rule-based controller can successfully perform the entire disassembly operation. These findings highlight the current limitations of VLA models in handling the dexterity and precision required for robotic EoL product disassembly. By offering a detailed analysis of the observed results, this study provides insights that may inform future research to address current challenges and advance end-to-end robotic automated disassembly.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Game Management Decisions: A Fuzzy Logic Approach to Real-Time Substituitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In elite soccer, substitution decisions entail significant financial and sporting consequences yet remain heavily reliant on intuition or predictive models that merely mimic historical biases. This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the "FAGNER Paradox" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the "Lukaku Paradox", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions.</description>

      <title>An accelerated proximal bundle method for convex optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proximal bundle method (PBM) is a powerful and widely used approach for minimizing nonsmooth convex functions. However, for smooth objectives, its best-known convergence rate remains suboptimal, and whether PBM can be accelerated remains open. In this work, we present the first accelerated proximal bundle method that achieves the optimal $\mathscr{O}(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ iteration complexity for obtaining an $\epsilon$-accurate solution in smooth convex optimization. The proposed method is conceptually simple, which differs from Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent by only a single line and retains all key structural properties of the classical PBM. In particular, it relies on the same minimal assumptions on model approximations and preserves the standard bundle testing criterion. Numerical experiments confirm the accelerated $\mathscr{O}(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ convergence rate predicted by our theory.</description>

Abstract: The adoption of reinforcement learning for critical infrastructure defense introduces a vulnerability where sophisticated attackers can strategically exploit the defense algorithm's learning dynamics. While prior work addresses this vulnerability in the context of repeated normal-form games, its extension to the stochastic games remains an open research gap. We close this gap by examining stochastic security games between an RL defender and an omniscient attacker, utilizing a tractable linear influence network model. To overcome the structural limitations of prior methods, we propose and apply neuro-dynamic programming. Our experimental results demonstrate that the omniscient attacker can significantly outperform a naive defender, highlighting the critical vulnerability introduced by the learning dynamics and the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description>

      <title>Timely Information for Strategic Persuasion</title>

Abstract: This work investigates a dynamic variant of Bayesian persuasion, in which a strategic sender seeks to influence a receiver's belief over time through controlling the timing of the information disclosure, under resource constraints. We consider a binary information source (i.e., taking values 0 or 1), where the source's state evolve according to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this setting, the receiver aims to estimate the source's state as accurately as possible. In contrast, the sender seeks to persuade the receiver to estimate the state to be 1, regardless of whether this estimate reflects the true state. This misalignment between their objectives naturally leads to a Stackelberg game formulation where the sender, acting as the leader, chooses an information-revelation policy, and the receiver, as the follower, decides whether to follow the sender's messages. As a result, the sender's objective is to maximize the long-term average time that the receiver's estimate equals 1, subject to a total sampling constraint and a constraint for the receiver to follow the sender's messages called incentive compatibility (IC) constraint. We first consider the single-source problem and show that the sender's optimal policy is to allocate a minimal sampling rate to the undesired state 0 (just enough to satisfy the IC constraint) and assign the remaining sampling rate to the desired state 1. Next, we extend the analysis to the multi-source case, where each source has a different minimal sampling rate. Our results show that the sender can leverage the timeliness of the revealed information to influence the receiver, thereby achieving a higher utility.</description>

      <title>Neural Policy Composition from Free Energy Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to compose acquired skills to plan and execute behaviors is a hallmark of natural intelligence. Yet, despite remarkable cross-disciplinary efforts, a principled account of how task structure shapes gating and how such computations could be delivered in neural circuits, remains elusive. Here we introduce GateMod, an interpretable theoretically grounded computational model linking the emergence of gating to the underlying decision-making task, and to a neural circuit architecture. We first develop GateFrame, a normative framework casting policy gating into the minimization of the free energy. This framework, relating gating rules to task, applies broadly across neuroscience, cognitive and computational sciences. We then derive GateFlow, a continuous-time energy based dynamics that provably converges to GateFrame optimal solution. Convergence, exponential and global, follows from a contractivity property that also yields robustness and other desirable properties. Finally, we derive a neural circuit from GateFlow, GateNet. This is a soft-competitive recurrent circuit whose components perform local and contextual computations consistent with known dendritic and neural processing motifs. We evaluate GateMod across two different settings: collective behaviors in multi-agent systems and human decision-making in multi-armed bandits. In all settings, GateMod provides interpretable mechanistic explanations of gating and quantitatively matches or outperforms established models. GateMod offers a unifying framework for neural policy gating, linking task objectives, dynamical computation, and circuit-level mechanisms. It provides a framework to understand gating in natural agents beyond current explanations and to equip machines with this ability.</description>

      <title>Embodied Co-Design for Rapidly Evolving Agents: Taxonomy, Frontiers, and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-body co-evolution enables animals to develop complex behaviors in their environments. Inspired by this biological synergy, embodied co-design (ECD) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for creating intelligent agents-from virtual creatures to physical robots-by jointly optimizing their morphologies and controllers rather than treating control in isolation. This integrated approach facilitates richer environmental interactions and robust task performance. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of recent advances in ECD. We first formalize the concept of ECD and position it within related fields. We then introduce a hierarchical taxonomy: a lower layer that breaks down agent design into three fundamental components-controlling brain, body morphology, and task environment-and an upper layer that integrates these components into four major ECD frameworks: bi-level, single-level, generative, and open-ended. This taxonomy allows us to synthesize insights from more than one hundred recent studies. We further review notable benchmarks, datasets, and applications in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Finally, we identify significant challenges and offer insights into promising future research directions. A project associated with this survey has been created at https://github.com/Yuxing-Wang-THU/SurveyBrainBody.</description>

      <title>TEMPO-VINE: A Multi-Temporal Sensor Fusion Dataset for Localization and Mapping in Vineyards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, precision agriculture has been introducing groundbreaking innovations in the field, with a strong focus on automation. However, research studies in robotics and autonomous navigation often rely on controlled simulations or isolated field trials. The absence of a realistic common benchmark represents a significant limitation for the diffusion of robust autonomous systems under real complex agricultural conditions. Vineyards pose significant challenges due to their dynamic nature, and they are increasingly drawing attention from both academic and industrial stakeholders interested in automation. In this context, we introduce the TEMPO-VINE dataset, a large-scale multi-temporal dataset specifically designed for evaluating sensor fusion, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and place recognition techniques within operational vineyard environments. TEMPO-VINE is the first multi-modal public dataset that brings together data from heterogeneous LiDARs of different price levels, AHRS, RTK-GPS, and cameras in real trellis and pergola vineyards, with multiple rows exceeding 100 m in length. In this work, we address a critical gap in the landscape of agricultural datasets by providing researchers with a comprehensive data collection and ground truth trajectories in different seasons, vegetation growth stages, terrain and weather conditions. The sequence paths with multiple runs and revisits will foster the development of sensor fusion, localization, mapping and place recognition solutions for agricultural fields. The dataset, the processing tools and the benchmarking results will be available at the dedicated webpage upon acceptance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel adaptive online optimization algorithm tailored to the management of microgrids with high renewable energy penetration, which can be formulated as a constrained, online optimization problem. The proposed algorithm is characterized by a control-based design that applies the internal model principle, and a system identification routine tasked with identifying such internal model. In addition, in order to ensure the constraints are verified, we integrate a projection onto the constraint set. We showcase promising numerical results for the microgrid use case, highlighting in particular the enhanced adaptability of the proposed algorithm to changes in the internal model. The performance of the proposed algorithm is shown to outperform state-of-the-art alternative in the long-term, ensuring efficient management of the grid.</description>

      <title>On Disturbance-Aware Minimum-Time Trajectory Planning: Evidence from Tests on a Dynamic Driving Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates how disturbance-aware, robustness-embedded reference trajectories translate into driving performance when executed by professional drivers in a dynamic simulator. Three planned reference trajectories are compared against a free-driving baseline (NOREF) to assess trade-offs between lap time (LT) and steering effort (SE): NOM, the nominal time-optimal trajectory; TLC, a track-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening margins to the track edges; and FLC, a friction-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening against axle and tire saturation. All trajectories share the same minimum lap-time objective with a small steering-smoothness regularizer and are evaluated by two professional drivers using a high-performance car on a virtual track. The trajectories derive from a disturbance-aware minimum-lap-time framework recently proposed by the authors, where worst-case disturbance growth is propagated over a finite horizon and used to tighten tire-friction and track-limit constraints, preserving performance while providing probabilistic safety margins. LT and SE are used as performance indicators, while RMS lateral deviation, speed error, and drift angle characterize driving style. Results show a Pareto-like LT-SE trade-off: NOM yields the shortest LT but highest SE; TLC minimizes SE at the cost of longer LT; FLC lies near the efficient frontier, substantially reducing SE relative to NOM with only a small LT increase. Removing trajectory guidance (NOREF) increases both LT and SE, confirming that reference trajectories improve pace and control efficiency. Overall, the findings highlight reference-based and disturbance-aware planning, especially FLC, as effective tools for training and for achieving fast yet stable trajectories.</description>

      <title>Using Dynamic Safety Margins as Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01445v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to design control barrier functions (CBFs) for arbitrary state and input constraints using tools from the reference governor literature. In particular, it is shown that dynamic safety margins (DSMs) are CBFs for an augmented system obtained by concatenating the state with a virtual reference. The proposed approach is agnostic to the relative degree and can handle multiple state and input constraints using the control-sharing property of CBFs. The construction of CBFs using Lyapunov-based DSMs is then investigated in further detail. Numerical simulations show that the method outperforms existing DSM-based approaches, while also guaranteeing safety and persistent feasibility of the associated optimization program.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Lane Planning for Connected Electric Vehicles in Urban Traffic: Design and Vehicle-in-the-Loop Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban driving with connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) offers potential for energy savings, yet most eco-driving strategies focus solely on longitudinal speed control within a single lane. This neglects the significant impact of lateral decisions, such as lane changes, on overall energy efficiency, especially in environments with traffic signals and heterogeneous traffic flow. To address this gap, we propose a novel energy-aware motion planning framework that jointly optimizes longitudinal speed and lateral lane-change decisions using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Our approach estimates long-term energy costs using a graph-based approximation and solves short-horizon optimal control problems under traffic constraints. Using a data-driven energy model calibrated to an actual battery electric vehicle, we demonstrate with vehicle-in-the-loop experiments that our method reduces motion energy consumption by up to 24 percent compared to a human driver, highlighting the potential of connectivity-enabled planning for sustainable urban autonomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a spatiotemporal tube (STT)-based control framework for satisfying Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications in unknown control-affine systems. We formulate STL constraints as a robust optimization problem (ROP) and recast it as a scenario optimization program (SOP) to construct STTs with formal correctness guarantees. We also propose a closed-form control law that operates independently of the system dynamics, and ensures the system trajectory evolves within the STTs, thereby satisfying the STL specifications. The proposed approach is validated through case studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior computational efficiency, trajectory quality, and applicability to complex STL tasks.</description>

      <title>Baseline-improved Economic Model Predictive Control for Optimal Microgrid Dispatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As opposed to stabilizing to a reference trajectory or state, Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) optimizes economic performance over a prediction horizon, making it particularly attractive for economic microgrid (MG) dispatch. However, as load and generation forecasts are only known 24-48 h in advance, economically optimal steady states or periodic trajectories are not available and the EMPC-based works that rely on these signals are inadequate. In addition, demand charges, based on maximum monthly grid import power of the MG, cannot be easily casted as an additive cost, which prevents the application of the principle of optimality if introduced naively. In this work, we propose to close this mismatch between the EMPC prediction horizon and existing monthly timescales by means of an appropriately generated baseline reference trajectory. To do this, we first propose an EMPC formulation for a generic deterministic discrete non-linear time-varying system subject to hard state and input constraints. We then show that, under mild assumptions on the terminal cost and region, the asymptotic average economic cost of the proposed method is no worse than a baseline given by any arbitrary reference trajectory that is only known online. In particular, this results into a practical, finite-time upper bound on the average economic cost difference with the baseline that decreases linearly to zero as time goes to infinity. We then show how the proposed EMPC framework can be used to solve optimal MG dispatch problems, introducing various costs and constraints that conform to the required assumptions. By means of this framework, we conduct realistic simulations with data from the Port of San Diego MG, which demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce monthly electricity costs in closed-loop with respect to established baseline reference trajectories.</description>

Abstract: As neurostimulation devices increasingly incorporate closed-loop functionality, the greater design complexity brings additional requirements for risk management and special considerations to optimise benefit. This manuscript creates a common framework upon which all current and planned neuromodulation-based physiological closed-loop controllers (PCLCs) can be mapped including integration of the Technical Considerations of Medical Devices with Physiologic Closed-Loop Control Technology guidance published in 2023 by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a classification of feedback (reactive) and feedforward (predictive) biomarkers, and control systems theory. We explain risk management in the context of this framework and illustrate its applications for three exemplary technologies. This manuscript serves as guidance to the emerging field of PCLCs in neuromodulation, mitigating risk through standardized nomenclature and a systematic outline for rigorous device development, testing, and implementation.</description>

      <title>Flight-Ready Precise and Robust Carrier-Phase GNSS Navigation Software for Distributed Space Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the full requirements analysis, design, development, and testing of high-precision navigation flight software for Distributed Space Systems (DSS) using Carrier Phase Differential GNSS (CDGNSS). Five main contributions are made. First, a survey of flown and upcoming DSS missions with stringent precision requirements is conducted, from which a thorough requirements analysis is distilled to guide development and testing. Second, a real-time navigation functional architecture is designed, and adopts a sparse and regularized Consider Kalman Filter with options for numerical stability in-flight. The filter rigorously accounts for uncertainties in process noise, measurement noise, and biases. It tracks float ambiguities with integer resolution where possible. The covariance correlation structure is preserved under all navigation modes, including contingencies and outages. Third, a lightweight, memoryless Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery (FDIR) module is developed to guard against anomalous measurements, providing statistical screening and ensuring robust navigation. Fourth, the software architecture is proposed for ease of integration, with strategies presented for modularity and computational efficiency tailored to constrained flight systems. Fifth, a comprehensive test campaign is conducted, mapped to a requirements verification matrix, spanning unit, interface, software-in-the-loop, and real-time hardware-in-the-loop tests, emphasizing gradual test fidelity for efficient fault isolation. Finally, flight-like results are demonstrated using the VISORS mission, due to the generalizability of the VISORS navigation operations, and the stringency which demands sub-centimeter relative position and sub-millimeter-per-second velocity accuracy. This architecture aims to serve as a reference for next-generation DSS missions adopting CDGNSS.</description>

      <title>Analytical Phasor-Based Fault Location Enhancement for Wind Farm Collector Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing integration of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) is reshaping fault current characteristics, presenting significant challenges to traditional protection and fault location methods. This paper addresses a key limitation in fault location within wind farm collector networks, i.e., one-terminal phasor-based methods become inaccurate when IBRs are electrically located downstream from the fault. In such cases, the voltage drop caused by IBR fault current injections is not captured by the Intelligent Electronic Device, resulting in a systematic overestimation of fault distance. To mitigate this issue, a general compensation framework was proposed by augmenting classical loop formulations with a distance-dependent voltage correction term. The methodology was derived analytically using a sequence-domain representation and generalized to multiple fault types through a unified notation. It maintains the simplicity and interpretability of conventional approaches and can be implemented using only local measurements. The method was evaluated through EMT simulations in PSCAD using a realistic wind farm model. Results show significant improvements in location accuracy, with average and maximum errors notably reduced, especially for ground-involved faults where reductions exceed 90\%. Furthermore, the compensation eliminates sensitivity to wind penetration levels and ensures uniform performance across feeders, positioning the method as a practical solution for modern renewable-dominated grids.</description>

      <title>Joint Scheduling of Workload Demand and Energy Supply in Low-carbon Data Centers with Decision-Dependent Uncertainty Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the joint scheduling problem of stochastic workloads and a hydrogen-enabled distributed energy system in a low-carbon Internet data centers (IDC). Although such workloads can be shifted over temporal and spatial horizons, it poses challenges when they cannot be accurately predicted, resulting in significant efficiency degradation and high operational cost of the energy system. The problem becomes even more difficult when the workload shifting decisions would influence their randomness, which is natural for the IDC workloads. To tackle these issues, we propose a workload classification model based on the decision-dependent uncertainty set, where the spatiotemporal elasticity of different types of random workloads are clearly identified and the decision dependencies are explicitly described as linear constraints. Thus, a mixed integer program is then established for the optimal scheduling of both workload demand and energy supply. To enhance system resilience against high volatility scenarios, a rolling horizon algorithm is developed to ensure nonanticipativity and full-scenario feasibility. Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits effective workload scheduling decisions with dramatic energy operational cost reductions compared to the benchmarks under most of the uncertain scenarios.</description>

      <title>CaFTRA: Frequency-Domain Correlation-Aware Feedback-Free MIMO Transmission and Resource Allocation for 6G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental design of wireless systems toward AI-native 6G and beyond is driven by the need for ever-increasing demand of mobile data traffic, extreme spectral efficiency, and adaptability across diverse service scenarios. To overcome the limitations posed by feedback-based multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) transmission, we propose a novel frequency-domain Correlation-aware Feedback-free MIMO Transmission and Resource Allocation (CaFTRA) framework tailored for fully-decoupled radio access networks (FD-RAN) to meet the emerging requirements of AI-Native 6G and beyond. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), CaFTRA effectively eliminates real-time uplink feedback by predicting channel state information (CSI) based solely on user geolocation. We introduce a Learnable Queries-driven Transformer Network for CSI mapping from user geolocation, which utilizes multi-head attention and learnable query embeddings to accurately capture frequency-domain correlations among resource blocks (RBs), thereby significantly improving the precision of CSI prediction. Once base stations (BSs) adopt feedback-free transmission, their downlink transmission coverage can be significantly expanded due to the elimination of frequent uplink feedback. To enable efficient resource scheduling under such extensive-coverage scenarios, we apply a low-complexity many-to-one matching theory-based algorithm for efficient multi-BS association and multi-RB resource allocation, which is proven to converge to a stable matching within limited iterations. Simulation results demonstrate that CaFTRA achieves stable matching convergence and significant gains in spectral efficiency and user fairness compared to 5G, underscoring its potential value for 6G standardization efforts.</description>

      <title>An Information Theory of Finite Abstractions and their Fundamental Scalability Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite abstractions are discrete approximations of dynamical systems, such that the set of abstraction trajectories contains, in a formal sense, all system trajectories. There is a consensus that abstractions suffer from the curse of dimensionality: for the same ``accuracy" (how closely the abstraction represents the system), the abstraction size scales poorly with system dimensions. And, yet, after decades of research on abstractions, there are no formal results concerning their accuracy-size tradeoff. In this work, we derive a statistical, quantitative theory of abstractions' accuracy-size tradeoff and uncover fundamental limits on their scalability, through rate-distortion theory -- the branch of information theory studying lossy compression. Abstractions are viewed as encoder-decoder pairs, encoding trajectories of dynamical systems in a higher-dimensional ambient space. Rate represents abstraction size, while distortion describes abstraction accuracy, defined as the spatial average deviation between abstract trajectories and system ones. We obtain a fundamental lower bound on the minimum abstraction distortion, given the system dynamics and a threshold on abstraction size. The bound depends on the complexity of the dynamics, through generalized entropy. We demonstrate the bound's tightness on certain dynamical systems. Finally, we showcase how the developed theory can be employed to construct optimal abstractions, in terms of the size-accuracy tradeoff, through an example on a chaotic system.</description>

      <title>Digital requirements engineering with an INCOSE-derived SysML meta-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional requirements engineering tools do not readily access the SysML-defined system architecture model, often resulting in ad-hoc duplication of model elements that lacks the connectivity and expressive detail possible in a SysML-defined model. Further integration of requirements engineering activities with MBSE contributes to the Authoritative Source of Truth while facilitating deep access to system architecture model elements for V&amp;V activities. We explore the application of MBSE to requirements engineering by extending the Model-Based Structured Requirement SysML Profile to comply with the INCOSE Guide to Writing Requirements while conforming to the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 standard requirement statement patterns. Rules, Characteristics, and Attributes were defined in SysML according to the Guide to facilitate requirements definition, verification &amp; validation. The resulting SysML Profile was applied in two system architecture models at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, allowing us to assess its applicability and value in real-world project environments. Initial results indicate that INCOSE-derived Model-Based Structured Requirements may rapidly improve requirement expression quality while complementing the NASA Systems Engineering Handbook checklist and guidance, but typical requirement management activities still have challenges related to automation and support in the system architecture modeling software.</description>

      <title>EmbedGenius: Towards Automated Software Development for Generic Embedded IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embedded IoT system development is crucial for enabling seamless connectivity and functionality across a wide range of applications. However, such a complex process requires cross-domain knowledge of hardware and software and hence often necessitates direct developer involvement, making it labor-intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone. To address this challenge, this paper introduces EmbedGenius, the first fully automated software development platform for general-purpose embedded IoT systems. The key idea is to leverage the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and embedded system expertise to automate the hardware-in-the-loop development process. The main methods include a component-aware library resolution method for addressing hardware dependencies, a library knowledge generation method that injects utility domain knowledge into LLMs, and an auto-programming method that ensures successful deployment. We evaluate EmbedGenius's performance across 71 modules and four mainstream embedded development platforms with over 350 IoT tasks. Experimental results show that EmbedGenius can generate codes with an accuracy of 95.7% and complete tasks with a success rate of 86.5%, surpassing human-in-the-loop baselines by 15.6%--37.7% and 25.5%--53.4%, respectively. We also show EmbedGenius's potential through case studies in environmental monitoring and remote control systems development.</description>

      <title>VoLUT: Efficient Volumetric streaming enhanced by LUT-based super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D volumetric video provides immersive experience and is gaining traction in digital media. Despite its rising popularity, the streaming of volumetric video content poses significant challenges due to the high data bandwidth requirement. A natural approach to mitigate the bandwidth issue is to reduce the volumetric video's data rate by downsampling the content prior to transmission. The video can then be upsampled at the receiver's end using a super-resolution (SR) algorithm to reconstruct the high-resolution details. While super-resolution techniques have been extensively explored and advanced for 2D video content, there is limited work on SR algorithms tailored for volumetric videos.
  To address this gap and the growing need for efficient volumetric video streaming, we have developed VoLUT with a new SR algorithm specifically designed for volumetric content. Our algorithm uniquely harnesses the power of lookup tables (LUTs) to facilitate the efficient and accurate upscaling of low-resolution volumetric data. The use of LUTs enables our algorithm to quickly reference precomputed high-resolution values, thereby significantly reducing the computational complexity and time required for upscaling. We further apply adaptive video bit rate algorithm (ABR) to dynamically determine the downsampling rate according to the network condition and stream the selected video rate to the receiver. Compared to related work, VoLUT is the first to enable high-quality 3D SR on commodity mobile devices at line-rate. Our evaluation shows VoLUT can reduce bandwidth usage by 70% , boost QoE by 36.7% for volumetric video streaming and achieve
  3D SR speed-up with no quality compromise.</description>

      <title>System-level Analysis of Dual-Mode Networked Sensing: ISAC Integration &amp; Coordination Gains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper characterizes integration and coordination gains in dense millimeter-wave ISAC networks through a dual-mode framework that combines monostatic and multistatic sensing. A comprehensive system-level analysis is conducted, accounting for base station (BS) density, power allocation, antenna misalignment, radar cross-section (RCS) fluctuations, clutter, bistatic geometry, channel fading, and self-interference cancellation (SIC) efficiency. Using stochastic geometry, coverage probabilities and ergodic rates for sensing and communication are derived, revealing tradeoffs among BS density, beamwidth, and power allocation. It is shown that the communication performance sustained reliable operation despite the overlaid sensing functionality. In contrast, the results reveal the foundational role of spatial sensing diversity, driven by the dual-mode operation, to compensate for the weak sensing reflections and vulnerability to imperfect SIC along with interference and clutter. To this end, we identify a system transition from monostatic to multistatic-dominant sensing operation as a function of the SIC efficiency. In the latter case, using six multistatic BSs instead of a single bistatic receiver improved sensing coverage probability by over 100%, highlighting the coordination gain. Moreover, comparisons with pure communication networks confirm substantial integration gain. Specifically, dual-mode networked sensing with four cooperative BSs can double throughput, while multistatic sensing alone improves throughput by over 50%.</description>

      <title>Dual-Objective Reinforcement Learning with Novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hard constraints in reinforcement learning (RL) often degrade policy performance. Lagrangian methods offer a way to blend objectives with constraints, but require intricate reward engineering and parameter tuning. In this work, we extend recent advances that connect Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations with RL to propose two novel value functions for dual-objective satisfaction. Namely, we address: 1) the Reach-Always-Avoid (RAA) problem -- of achieving distinct reward and penalty thresholds -- and 2) the Reach-Reach (RR) problem -- of achieving thresholds of two distinct rewards. In contrast with temporal logic approaches, which typically involve representing an automaton, we derive explicit, tractable Bellman forms in this context via decomposition. Specifically, we prove that the RAA and RR problems may be rewritten as compositions of previously studied HJ-RL problems. We leverage our analysis to propose a variation of Proximal Policy Optimization (DOHJ-PPO), and demonstrate that it produces distinct behaviors from previous approaches, outcompeting a number of baselines in success, safety and speed across a range of tasks for safe-arrival and multi-target achievement.</description>

      <title>An Accelerated Distributed Optimization with Equality and Inequality Coupling Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies distributed convex optimization with both affine equality and nonlinear inequality couplings through the duality analysis. We first formulate the dual of the coupling-constraint problem and reformulate it as a consensus optimization problem over a connected network. To efficiently solve this dual problem and hence the primal problem, we design an accelerated linearized algorithm that, at each round, a look-ahead linearization of the separable objective is combined with a quadratic penalty on the Laplacian constraint, a proximal step, and an aggregation of iterations. On the theory side, we prove non-ergodic rates for both the primal optimality error and the feasibility error. On the other hand, numerical experiments show a faster decrease of optimality error and feasibility residual than augmented-Lagrangian tracking and distributed subgradient baselines under the same communication budget.</description>
