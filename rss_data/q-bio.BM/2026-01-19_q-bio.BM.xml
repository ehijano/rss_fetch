      <title>Effects of 2.45 GHz radiofrequency upon Leuconostoc mesenteroides Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzymatic activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this report we evaluate the effect in the enzyme activity of Glucose 6-phosphate Dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides by irradiation with 2.45 GHz radiofrequency at a power output of 0.1 W during a 91 h period. The results show that the RF irradiation preserves the activity of treated samples of this enzyme with respect to a non-treated sample that instead suffer an increased rate of activity loss. Our estimates indicate that the enzyme activation is due to a non-thermal effect. The results are consistent with reports about the effect of 2.45 GHz radiation upon other enzymatic systems.</description>

      <title>Principles of Client Enrichment in Multicomponent Biomolecular Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are commonly organized by a small number of scaffold molecules that drive phase separation together with client molecules that do not condense on their own but become selectively recruited into the dense phase. A central open question is how client recruitment feeds back on scaffold interactions to determine condensate composition. Here we address this problem in a reconstituted focal adhesion system composed of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and phosphorylated p130Cas (Cas) as scaffolds and the adaptor protein paxillin (PXN) as a client. We show that both FAK phosphorylation and PXN recruitment produce a common compositional response in which FAK becomes enriched while Cas is depleted within the condensate. To interpret these observations, we develop two complementary theoretical descriptions. First, within a two-component Flory-Huggins framework, we show that phosphorylation can be captured by either strengthening heterotypic FAK-Cas interactions or increasing the effective number of interaction-relevant segments on FAK, both of which bias partitioning toward FAK-rich condensates. Second, we introduce a minimal three-component Flory-Huggins theory without an explicit solvent and map it onto an effective two-component description, demonstrating that client recruitment renormalizes homotypic and heterotypic scaffold interactions. Analytical predictions for the location of the critical point are tested in reconstituted multicomponent systems through PXN addition, showing that client recruitment alone tunes proximity to criticality and reshapes condensate composition. Together, our results reveal distinct yet convergent physical routes by which post-translational modification and client recruitment control scaffold composition in multicomponent condensates.</description>

      <title>De novo emergence of metabolically active protocells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A continuous route from a disordered soup of simple chemical feedstocks to a functional protocell -- a compartment that metabolizes, grows, and propagates -- remains elusive. Here, we show that a homogeneous aqueous chemical mixture containing phosphorus, iron, molybdenum salts and formaldehyde spontaneously self-organizes into compartments that couple robust non-equilibrium chemical dynamics to their own growth. These structures mature to a sustained, dissipative steady state and support an organic synthetic engine, producing diverse molecular species including many core biomolecular classes. Internal spherules that are themselves growth-competent are produced within the protocells, establishing a rudimentary mode of self-perpetuation. The chemical dynamics we observe in controlled laboratory conditions also occur in reaction mixtures exposed to natural day-night cycles. Strikingly, the morphology and chemical composition of the protocells in our experiments closely resemble molybdenum-rich microspheres recently discovered in current oceanic environments. Our work establishes a robust, testable route to de novo protocell formation. The emergence of life-like spatiotemporal organization and chemical dynamics from minimal initial conditions is more facile than previously thought and could be a recurring natural phenomenon.</description>

      <title>HERMES: Holographic Equivariant neuRal network model for Mutational Effect and Stability prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06703v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the stability and fitness effects of amino acid mutations in proteins is a cornerstone of biological discovery and engineering. Various experimental techniques have been developed to measure mutational effects, providing us with extensive datasets across a diverse range of proteins. By training on these data, traditional computational modeling and more recent machine learning approaches have advanced significantly in predicting mutational effects. Here, we introduce HERMES, a 3D rotationally equivariant structure-based neural network model for mutational effect and stability prediction. Pre-trained to predict amino acid propensity from its surrounding 3D structure, HERMES can be fine-tuned for mutational effects using our open-source code. We present a suite of HERMES models, pre-trained with different strategies, and fine-tuned to predict the stability effect of mutations. Benchmarking against other models shows that HERMES often outperforms or matches their performance in predicting mutational effect on stability, binding, and fitness. HERMES offers versatile tools for evaluating mutational effects and can be fine-tuned for specific predictive objectives.</description>

      <title>The Protective Effects of the Ethyl Acetate Part of Er Miao San on Adjuvant Arthritis Rats by Regulating the Function of Bone Marrow-Derived Dendritic Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims. /e aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effects of Er Miao San (EMS) and the regulative function of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) on adjuvant arthritis (AA) in rats. Methods. /e ethyl acetate part of EMS (3 g/kg, 1.5 g/kg, and 0.75 g/kg) was orally administered from day 15 after immunization to day 29. /e polyarthritis index and paw swelling were measured, the ankle joint pathological changes were observed using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, and the spleen and thymus index were determined. Moreover, T and B cell proliferation were determined using the CCK-8 assay. /e expression of BMDC surface costimulatory molecules and inflammatory factors were determined using flow cytometry and ELISA kits, respectively. Results. Compared with the AA model rats, the ethyl acetate fraction of EMS obviously reduced paw swelling (from 1.0 to 0.7) and the polyarthritis index (from 12 to 9) (P &lt; 0.01) and improved the severity of histopathology (P &lt; 0.01). /e treatment using ethyl acetate fraction of EMS significantly reduced the spleen and thymus index (P &lt; 0.01) and inhibited T and B cell proliferation (P &lt; 0.01). Moreover, EMS significantly modulated the expression of surface costimulatory molecules in BMDCs, including CD40, CD80, CD86, and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) (P &lt; 0.01). /e results also showed that the ethyl acetate part of EMS significant inhibited the levels of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin- (IL-) 23 tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) {\alpha} and inflammatory factor prostaglandin (PG) E2 in the supernatant of BMDCs. However, the level of antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 was significantly increased (P &lt; 0.01). Conclusion. /ese results suggest that the ethyl acetate part of EMS has better protective effects on AA rats, probably by regulating the function of BMDCs and modulating the balance of cytokines.</description>

      <title>ProteinGuide: On-the-fly property guidance for protein sequence generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04823v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequence generative models are transforming protein engineering. However, no principled framework exists for conditioning these models on auxiliary information, such as experimental data, without additional training of a generative model. Herein, we present ProteinGuide, a method for such "on-the-fly" conditioning, amenable to a broad class of protein generative models including Masked Language Models (e.g. ESM3), any-order auto-regressive models (e.g. ProteinMPNN) as well as diffusion and flow matching models (e.g. MultiFlow). ProteinGuide stems from our unifying view of these model classes under a single statistical framework. As proof of principle, we perform several in silico experiments. We first guide pre-trained generative models to design proteins with user-specified properties, such as higher stability or activity. Next, we design for optimizing two desired properties that are in tension with each other. Finally, we apply our method in the wet lab, using ProteinGuide to increase the editing activity of an adenine base editor in vivo with data from only a single pooled library of 2,000 variants. We find that a single round of ProteinGuide achieves a higher editing efficiency than was previously achieved using seven rounds of directed evolution.</description>
