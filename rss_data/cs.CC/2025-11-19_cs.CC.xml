      <title>New Algebrization Barriers to Circuit Lower Bounds via Communication Complexity of Missing-String</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The *algebrization barrier*, proposed by Aaronson and Wigderson (STOC '08, ToCT '09), captures the limitations of many complexity-theoretic techniques based on arithmetization. Notably, several circuit lower bounds that overcome the relativization barrier (Buhrman--Fortnow--Thierauf, CCC '98; Vinodchandran, TCS '05; Santhanam, STOC '07, SICOMP '09) remain subject to the algebrization barrier.
  In this work, we establish several new algebrization barriers to circuit lower bounds by studying the communication complexity of the following problem, called XOR-Missing-String: For $m &lt; 2^{n/2}$, Alice gets a list of $m$ strings $x_1, \dots, x_m\in\{0, 1\}^n$, Bob gets a list of $m$ strings $y_1, \dots, y_m\in\{0, 1\}^n$, and the goal is to output a string $s\in\{0, 1\}^n$ that is not equal to $x_i\oplus y_j$ for any $i, j\in [m]$.
  1. We construct an oracle $A_1$ and its multilinear extension $\widetilde{A_1}$ such that ${\sf PostBPE}^{\widetilde{A_1}}$ has linear-size $A_1$-oracle circuits on infinitely many input lengths.
  2. We construct an oracle $A_2$ and its multilinear extension $\widetilde{A_2}$ such that ${\sf BPE}^{\widetilde{A_2}}$ has linear-size $A_2$-oracle circuits on all input lengths.
  3. Finally, we study algebrization barriers to circuit lower bounds for $\sf MA_E$. Buhrman, Fortnow, and Thierauf proved a *sub-half-exponential* circuit lower bound for $\sf MA_E$ via algebrizing techniques. Toward understanding whether the half-exponential bound can be improved, we define a natural subclass of $\sf MA_E$ that includes their hard $\sf MA_E$ language, and prove the following result: For every *super-half-exponential* function $h(n)$, we construct an oracle $A_3$ and its multilinear extension $\widetilde{A_3}$ such that this natural subclass of ${\sf MA}_{\sf E}^{\widetilde{A_3}}$ has $h(n)$-size $A_3$-oracle circuits on all input lengths.</description>

      <title>Hardness of Range Avoidance and Proof Complexity Generators from Demi-Bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a circuit $G: \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^m$ with $m &gt; n$, the *range avoidance* problem ($\text{Avoid}$) asks to output a string $y\in \{0, 1\}^m$ that is not in the range of $G$. Besides its profound connection to circuit complexity and explicit construction problems, this problem is also related to the existence of *proof complexity generators* -- circuits $G: \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^m$ where $m &gt; n$ but for every $y\in \{0, 1\}^m$, it is infeasible to prove the statement "$y\not\in\mathrm{Range}(G)$" in a given propositional proof system.
  This paper connects these two problems with the existence of *demi-bits generators*, a fundamental cryptographic primitive against nondeterministic adversaries introduced by Rudich (RANDOM '97).
  $\bullet$ We show that the existence of demi-bits generators implies $\text{Avoid}$ is hard for nondeterministic algorithms. This resolves an open problem raised by Chen and Li (STOC '24). Furthermore, assuming the demi-hardness of certain LPN-style generators or Goldreich' PRG, we prove the hardness of $\text{Avoid}$ even when the instances are constant-degree polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_2$.
  $\bullet$ We show that the dual weak pigeonhole principle is unprovable in Cook's theory $\mathsf{PV}_1$ under the existence of demi-bits generators secure against $\mathbf{AM}$, thereby separating Jerabek's theory $\mathsf{APC}_1$ from $\mathsf{PV}_1$.
  $\bullet$ We transform demi-bits generators to proof complexity generators that are *pseudo-surjective* with nearly optimal parameters.
  Our constructions build on the recent breakthroughs on the hardness of $\text{Avoid}$ by Ilango, Li, and Williams (STOC '23) and Chen and Li (STOC '24). We use *randomness extractors* to significantly simplify the construction and the proof.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Distributions from Shallow Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the symmetric distributions that can be (approximately) generated by shallow Boolean circuits. More precisely, let $f\colon \{0,1\}^m \to \{0,1\}^n$ be a Boolean function where each output bit depends on at most $d$ input bits. Suppose the output distribution of $f$ evaluated on uniformly random input bits is close in total variation distance to a symmetric distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over $\{0,1\}^n$. Then $\mathcal{D}$ must be close to a mixture of the uniform distribution over $n$-bit strings of even Hamming weight, the uniform distribution over $n$-bit strings of odd Hamming weight, and $\gamma$-biased product distributions for $\gamma$ an integer multiple of $2^{-d}$. Moreover, the mixing weights are determined by low-degree, sparse $\mathbb{F}_2$-polynomials. This extends the previous classification for generating symmetric distributions that are also uniform over their support.</description>

      <title>Tighter Bounds for the Randomized Polynomial-Time Simplex Algorithm for Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14244v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a randomized polynomial-time simplex algorithm with higher probability and tighter bounds for linear programming by applying improved quasi-convex properties, a logarithmic rounding on a given polytope and its logarithmic perturbation. We base our work on the first randomized polynomial-time simplex method by Jonathan A. Kelner and Daniel A. Spielman [KS06].
  We obtain stronger bounds for the expected number of edges in the projection of a perturbed polytope onto a two-dimensional shadow plane. In the $k$-round case, we obtain a bound of $16 \sqrt{2} \pi k (1 + \lambda H_n) \sqrt{d} n / 3 \lambda$. In the non-$k$-round case, we obtain a bound of $26 \pi t (1 + \lambda H_n) \sqrt{d} n / \lambda \rho$. To achieve this, we provide a slightly lower bound of $3 \sqrt{2} \lambda / (16 n \sqrt{d})$ on the expected edge length that appears in the shadow. Another tool we employ is a tighter bound for $1$-quasi-concave minimization and $1$-quasi-convex maximization. In the $k$-round case, we obtain a quasi-convex bound of $(d - 2) \epsilon^2 / 2$. In the non-$k$-round case, we obtain a quasi-convex bound of $3.4 \epsilon^2 / \rho^2$.
  We propose a modification of the Kelner and Spielman randomized simplex algorithm (STOC'06) [KS06] that achieves a higher success probability. To accomplish this, we apply our tighter bounds with a new expected value of $\lambda = c \log n$ for independent exponentially distributed random variables and with $\log(k)$-rounding. The desired properties resulting from the construction of an artificial vertex during initialization hold with a higher probability of at least $1 - (d + 2), e^{-\log n}$. The pivot rule of the randomized simplex modification holds with a probability of at least $3/4$.</description>

      <title>The Solver's Paradox in Formal Problem Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how global decision problems over arithmetically represented domains acquire reflective structure through class-quantification. Arithmetization forces diagonal fixed points whose verification requires reflection beyond finitary means, producing Feferman-style obstructions independent of computational technique. We use this mechanism to analyze uniform complexity statements, including $\mathsf{P}$ vs. $\mathsf{NP}$, showing that their difficulty stems from structural impredicativity rather than methodological limitations. The focus is not on deriving separations but on clarifying the logical status of such arithmetized assertions.</description>

      <title>Graph Irregularity via Edge Deletions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We pursue the study of edge-irregulators of graphs, which were recently introduced in [Fioravantes et al. Parametrised Distance to Local Irregularity. IPEC, 2024]. That is, we are interested in the parameter Ie(G), which, for a given graph G, denotes the smallest k &gt;= 0 such that G can be made locally irregular (i.e., with no two adjacent vertices having the same degree) by deleting k edges. We exhibit notable properties of interest of the parameter Ie, in general and for particular classes of graphs, together with parameterized algorithms for several natural graph parameters.
  Despite the computational hardness previously exhibited by this problem (NP-hard, W[1]-hard w.r.t. feedback vertex number, W[1]-hard w.r.t. solution size), we present two FPT algorithms, the first w.r.t. the solution size plus Delta and the second w.r.t. the vertex cover number of the input graph.
  Finally, we take important steps towards better understanding the behaviour of this problem in dense graphs. This is crucial when considering some of the parameters whose behaviour is still uncharted in regards to this problem (e.g., neighbourhood diversity, distance to clique). In particular, we identify a subfamily of complete graphs for which we are able to provide the exact value of Ie(G). These investigations lead us to propose a conjecture that Ie(G) should always be at most m/3 + c, where $m$ is the number of edges of the graph $G$ and $c$ is some constant. This conjecture is verified for various families of graphs, including trees.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Time Algorithms for Abelian Group Isomorphism and Basis Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problems of abelian group isomorphism and basis construction in two models. In the {\it partially specified model} (PS-model), the algorithm does not know the group size but can access randomly chosen elements of the group along with the Cayley table of those elements, which provides the result of the binary operation for every pair of selected elements. In the stronger {\it fully specified model} (FS-model), the algorithm knows the size of the group and has access to its elements and Cayley table.
  Given two abelian groups, $G$, and $H$, we present an algorithm in the PS-model (and hence in the FS-model) that runs in time $\tilde O(\sqrt{|G|})$ and decides if they are isomorphic. This improves on Kavitha's linear-time algorithm and gives the first sublinear-time solution for this problem. We then prove the lower bound $\Omega(|G|^{1/4})$ for the FS-model and the tight bound $\Omega(\sqrt{|G|})$ for the PS-model. This is the first known lower bound for this problem. We obtain similar results for finding a basis for abelian groups. For deterministic algorithms, a simple $\Omega(|G|)$ lower bound is given.</description>

      <title>Fast polynomial computations with space constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The works presented in this habilitation concern the algorithmics of polynomials. This is a central topic in computer algebra, with numerous applications both within and outside the field - cryptography, error-correcting codes, etc. For many problems, extremely efficient algorithms have been developed since the 1960s. Here, we are interested in how this efficiency is affected when space constraints are introduced.
  The first part focuses on the time-space complexity of fundamental polynomial computations - multiplication, division, interpolation, ... While naive algorithms typically have constant space complexity, fast algorithms generally require linear space. We develop algorithms that are both time- and space-efficient. This leads us to discuss and refine definitions of space complexity for function computation.
  In the second part, the space constraints are put on the inputs and outputs. Algorithms for polynomials assume in general a dense representation for the polynomials, that is storing the full list of coefficients. In contrast, we work with sparse polynomials, in which most coefficients vanish. In particular, we describe the first quasi-linear algorithm for sparse interpolation, which plays a role analogous to the Fast Fourier Transform in the sparse settings. We also explore computationally hard problems concerning divisibility and factorization of sparse polynomials.</description>

      <title>Taming Barren Plateaus in Arbitrary Parameterized Quantum Circuits without Sacrificing Expressibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have enabled a wide range of applications on near-term quantum devices. However, existing PQC architectures face several challenges, among which the ``barren plateaus" phenomenon is particularly prominent. In such cases, the loss function concentrates exponentially with increasing system size, thereby hindering effective parameter optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a general and hardware-efficient method for eliminating barren plateaus in an arbitrary PQC. Specifically, our approach achieves this by inserting a layer of easily implementable quantum channels into the original PQC, each channel requiring only one ancilla qubit and four additional gates, yielding a modified PQC (MPQC) that is provably at least as expressive as the original PQC and, under mild assumptions, is guaranteed to be free from barren plateaus. Furthermore, by appropriately adjusting the structure of MPQCs, we rigorously prove that any parameter in the original PQC can be made trainable. Importantly, the absence of barren plateaus in MPQCs is robust against realistic noise, making our approach directly applicable to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Numerically, we demonstrate the practicality of our method by modifying a commonly used PQC for thermal-state preparation. The results show that {barren plateaus are effectively eliminated} in this class of circuits with up to 100 qubits and 2400 layers, whereas the original ansatz suffers from severe gradient vanishing.</description>
