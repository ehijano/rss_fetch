      <title>Reliability of three-state k-out-of-n:G system with non-homogeneous Markov dependent components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the reliability of a three-state k-out-of-n:G system. We consider the situation where the system components are non-homogeneous Markov dependent, and we derive a closed-form formula for the system reliability, including increasing three-state k-out-of-n:G system and decreasing three-state k-out-of-n:G system. Our study is based on the probability generating function method. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the use of the formula.</description>

      <title>Existence of Periodic and Stationary Solutions to Distribution-Dependent SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the periodic and stationary solutions of distribution-dependent stochastic differential equations. While generally, the semigroups associated with the equations are nonlinear, we show that the methods of weak convergence and Lyapunov functions can be combined to give efficient criteria for the existence of periodic and stationary solutions. Concrete examples are presented to illustrate the novel criteria.</description>

      <title>A diffusion limit for a model of interacting spins/queues with log-linear interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish a diffusion limit for an interacting spin model defined in terms of a multi-component Markov chain whose components (spins) are indexed by vertices of a finite graph. The spins take values in a finite set of non-negative integers and evolve subject to a graph based log-linear interaction. We show that if the set of possible spin values expands to the set of all non-negative integers, then a time-scaled and normalised version of the Markov chain converges to a system of interacting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes reflected at the origin. This limit is akin to heavy traffic limits in queueing (and our model can be naturally interpreted as a queueing model). Our proof draws on developments in queueing theory and relies on martingale methods.</description>

      <title>On reflected L\'evy processes with collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a L\'evy process reflected at the origin with additional i.i.d. collapses that occur at Poisson epochs, where a collapse is a jump downward to a state which is a random fraction of the state just before the jump. We first study the general case, then specialize to the case where the L\'evy process is spectrally positive and finally we specialize further to the two cases where the L\'evy process is a Brownian motion and a compound Poisson process with exponential jumps minus a linear slope.</description>

Abstract: We characterize some asymptotic properties of edge exchangeable random graphs in terms of the measure used to generate them. In particular, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for eventual forever connectedness, a sufficient condition for asymptotic normality of the vertex count, and a necessary and sufficient condition for the produced graph to be eventually forever almost complete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a multiparameter Poisson process (MPP). In a particular case, it is observed that the MPP has a unique representation. Its subordination with the multivariate subordinator and inverse subordinator are studied in detail. Also, we consider a multivariate multiparameter Poisson process and establish its connection with the MPP. An integral of the MPP is defined, and its asymptotic distribution is obtained. Later, we study some properties of the multiparameter martingales. Moreover, the multiparameter martingale characterizations for the MPP and its subordinated variants are derived.</description>

      <title>SIR on locally converging dynamic random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the trajectory of a classic SIR epidemic on a family of dynamic random graphs of fixed size, whose set of edges continuously evolves over time. We set general infection and recovery times, and start the epidemic from a positive, yet small, proportion of vertices. We show that in such a case, the spread of an infectious disease around a typical individual can be approximated by the spread of the disease in a local neighbourhood of a uniformly chosen vertex. We formalize this by studying general dynamic random graphs that converge dynamically locally in probability and demonstrate that the epidemic on these graphs converges to the epidemic on their dynamic local limit graphs. We provide a detailed treatment of the theory of dynamic local convergence, which remains a relatively new topic in the study of random graphs. One main conclusion of our paper is that a specific form of dynamic local convergence is required for our results to hold.</description>

      <title>Peierls bounds from random Toom contours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For deterministic monotone cellular automata on the $d$-dimensional integer lattice, Toom (1980) has given necessary and sufficient conditions for the all-one fixed point to be stable against small random perturbations. We are interested in the open problem of extending Toom's result to monotone cellular automata with intrinsic randomness, where the unperturbed evolution is random with i.i.d. update rules attached to the space-time points. For some applications it is also desirable to consider a more general graph structure, so we assume that the underlying lattice is an arbitrary countable group. Toom's proof of stability is based on a Peierls argument. In previous work, we demonstrated that this Peierls argument can also be used to prove stability for cellular automata with intrinsic randomness, but in this case estimating the Peierls sum becomes much harder than in the deterministic case. In the present paper, we develop a method based on random contours to estimate the Peierls sum and apply it to prove new stability results for monotone cellular automata with intrisic randomness. We also demonstrate the limitations of the method by constructing an example where the Peierls sum is infinite for arbitrary small perturbations even though stability is believed to hold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Dean-Kawasaki-type stochastic partial differential equation $$\partial \rho= \nabla\cdot (\sqrt{\rho\,}\, \xi) + \nabla\cdot \left(\rho\, H(\rho)\right)$$ with vector-valued space-time white noise $\xi$, does not admit solutions for any initial measure and any vector-valued bounded measurable function $H$ on the space of measures. This applies in particular to the pure-noise Dean-Kawasaki equation ($H\equiv 0$). The result is sharp, in the sense that solutions are known to exist for some unbounded $H$.</description>

Abstract: We study the error arising in the numerical approximation of FBSDEs and related PIDEs by means of a deep learning-based method. Our results focus on decoupled FBSDEs with jumps and extend the seminal work of HAn and Long (2020) analyzing the numerical error of the deep BSDE solver proposed in E et al. (2017). We provide a priori and a posteriori error estimates for the finite and infinite activity case.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of clusters in hierarchical species sampling models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a sample of size $N$ from a population governed by a hierarchical species sampling model. We study the large $N$ asymptotic behavior of the number ${\bf K}_N$ of clusters and the number ${\bf M}_{r,N}$ of clusters with frequency $r$ in the sample. In particular, we show almost sure and $L^p$ convergence for ${\bf M}_{r,N}$, obtain Gaussian fluctuation theorems for ${\bf K}_N$, and establish large deviation principles for both ${\bf K}_N$ and ${\bf M}_{r,N}$. Our approach relies on a random sample size representation of the number of clusters through the corresponding non-hierarchical species sampling model.</description>

      <title>Generative Models with ELBOs Converging to Entropy Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evidence lower bound (ELBO) is one of the most central objectives for probabilistic unsupervised learning. For the ELBOs of several generative models and model classes, we here prove convergence to entropy sums. As one result, we provide a list of generative models for which entropy convergence has been shown, so far, along with the corresponding expressions for entropy sums. Our considerations include very prominent generative models such as probabilistic PCA, sigmoid belief nets or Gaussian mixture models. However, we treat more models and entire model classes such as general mixtures of exponential family distributions. Our main contributions are the proofs for the individual models. For each given model we show that the conditions stated in Theorem 1 or Theorem 2 of [arXiv:2209.03077] are fulfilled such that by virtue of the theorems the given model's ELBO is equal to an entropy sum at all stationary points. The equality of the ELBO at stationary points applies under realistic conditions: for finite numbers of data points, for model/data mismatches, at any stationary point including saddle points etc, and it applies for any well behaved family of variational distributions.</description>

      <title>Least-Squares Problem Over Probability Measure Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the variational problem $$\rho_x^\ast = \text{argmin}_{\rho_x} D(G\#\rho_x, \rho_y)\,, $$ where $D$ quantifies the difference between two probability measures, and ${G}$ is a forward operator that maps a variable $x$ to $y=G(x)$. This problem can be regarded as an analogue of its counterpart in linear spaces (e.g., Euclidean spaces), $\text{argmin}_x \|G(x) - y\|^2$. Similar to how the choice of norm $\|\cdot\|$ influences the optimizer in $\mathbb R^d$ or other linear spaces, the minimizer in the probabilistic variational problem also depends on the choice of $D$. Our findings reveal that using a $\phi$-divergence for $D$ leads to the recovery of a conditional distribution of $\rho_y$, while employing the Wasserstein distance results in the recovery of a marginal distribution.</description>

      <title>Universal geometric non-embedding of random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Delta \ge 3$ be fixed, $n \ge n_\Delta$ be a large integer. It is a classical result that $\Delta$--regular expanders on $n$ vertices are not embeddable as geometric (distance) graphs into Euclidean space of dimension less than $c \log n$, for some universal constant $c$. We show that for typical $\Delta$-regular graphs, this obstruction is universal with respect to the choice of norm. More precisely, for a uniform random $\Delta$-regular graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, it holds with high probability: there is no normed space of dimension less than $c\log n$ which admits a geometric graph isomorphic to $G$. The proof is based on a seeded multiscale $\varepsilon$--net argument.</description>

      <title>Formalising the intentional stance 2: a coinductive approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a stochastic process with inputs and outputs, how might its behaviour be related to pursuit of a goal? We model this using 'transducers', objects that capture only the external behaviour of a system and not its internal state. A companion paper summarises our results for cognitive scientists; the current paper gives formal definitions and proofs.
  To formalise the concept of a system that behaves as if it were pursuing a goal, we consider what happens when a transducer (a 'policy') is coupled to another transducer that comes equipped with a success condition (a 'teleo-environment'). An optimal policy is identified with a transducer that behaves as if it were perfectly rational in the pursuit of a goal; our framework also allows us to model constrained rationality.
  Optimal policies obey a version of Bellman's principle: a policy that's optimal in one time step will again be optimal in the next time step, but with respect to a different teleo-environment (obtained from the original one by a modified version of Bayesian filtering). This property sometimes also applies to the bounded-rational case; we give a sufficient condition.
  A policy is deterministic if and only if there exists a teleo-environment for which it is uniquely optimal among the set of all policies; we relate this to classical representation theorems from decision theory. This result need not hold in the bounded-rational case; we give an example related to the absent-minded driver problem. The formalism is defined using coinduction, following the style proposed by Czajka.</description>

      <title>Predicting the depth of the most recent common ancestor of a random sample of $k$ species: the impact of phylogenetic tree shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the following question: how close to the ancestral root of a phylogenetic tree is the most recent common ancestor of $k$ species randomly sampled from the tips of the tree? For trees having shapes predicted by the Yule-Harding model, it is known that the most recent common ancestor is likely to be close to (or equal to) the root of the full tree, even as $n$ becomes large (for $k$ fixed). However, this result does not extend to models of tree shape that more closely describe phylogenies encountered in evolutionary biology. We investigate the impact of tree shape (via the Aldous $\beta-$splitting model) to predict the number of edges that separate the most recent common ancestor of a random sample of $k$ tip species and the root of the parent tree they are sampled from. Both exact and asymptotic results are presented. We also briefly consider a variation of the process in which a random number of tip species are sampled.</description>

      <title>Faber-Krahn inequality for the heat content on quantum graphs via random walk expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the heat content on quantum graphs and investigate whether an analogon of the Rayleigh-Faber-Krahn inequality holds. This means that heat content at time $T$ among graphs of equal volume would be maximized by intervals (the graph analogon of balls as in the classic Rayleigh-Faber-Krahn inequality). We prove that this holds at extremal times, that is at small and at large times. For this, we employ two complementary approaches: In the large time regime, we rely on a spectral-theoretic approach, using Mercer's theorem whereas the small-time regime is dealt with by a random walk approach using the Feynman-Kac formula and Brownian motions on metric graphs. In particular, in proving the latter, we develop a new expression for the heat content as a positive linear combination of expected return times of (discrete) random walks - a formulation which seems to yield additional insights compared to previously available methods such as the celebrated Roth formula and which is crucial for our proof. The question whether a Rayleigh-Faber-Krahn inequality for the heat content on metric graphs holds at all times remains open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.10999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For deterministic monotone cellular automata on the $d$-dimensional integer lattice, Toom has given necessary and sufficient conditions for the all-one fixed point to be stable against small random perturbations. The proof of sufficiency is based on an intricate Peierls argument. We present a simplified version of this Peierls argument. Our main motivation is the open problem of determining stability of monotone cellular automata with intrinsic randomness, in which for the unperturbed evolution the local update rules at different space-time points are chosen in an i.i.d. fashion according to some fixed law. We apply Toom's Peierls argument to prove stability of a class of cellular automata with intrinsic randomness and also derive lower bounds on the critical parameter for some deterministic cellular automata.</description>

      <title>The fuzzy Potts model in the plane: Scaling limits and arm exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a critical Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) percolation with cluster weight $q \in [1,4)$ in the plane, and color its clusters in red (respectively blue) with probability $r \in (0,1)$ (respectively $1-r$), independently of each other. We study the resulting fuzzy Potts model, which corresponds to the critical Ising model in the special case $q=2$ and $r=1/2$. We show that under the assumption that the critical FK percolation converges to a conformally invariant scaling limit (which is known to hold for the FK-Ising model, i.e. $q=2$), the obtained coloring converges to variants of Conformal Loop Ensembles constructed, described and studied by Miller, Sheffield and Werner. Based on discrete considerations, we also show that the arm exponents for this coloring in the discrete model are identical to the ones of the continuum model. Using the values of these arm exponents in the continuum, we determine the arm exponents for the fuzzy Potts model.</description>

      <title>Variance Inequalities for Transformed Fr\'echet Means in Hadamard Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fr\'echet mean (or barycenter) generalizes the expectation of a random variable to metric spaces by minimizing the expected squared distance to the random variable. Similarly, the median can be generalized by its property of minimizing the expected absolute distance. We consider the class of transformed Fr\'echet means with nondecreasing, convex transformations that have a concave derivative. This class includes the Fr\'echet median, the Fr\'echet mean, the Huber loss-induced Fr\'echet mean, and other statistics related to robust statistics in metric spaces. We study variance inequalities for these transformed Fr\'echet means. These inequalities describe how the expected transformed distance grows when moving away from a minimizer, i.e., from a transformed Fr\'echet mean. Variance inequalities are useful in the theory of estimation and numerical approximation of transformed Fr\'echet means. Our focus is on variance inequalities in Hadamard spaces - metric spaces with globally nonpositive curvature. Notably, some results are new also for Euclidean spaces. Additionally, we are able to characterize uniqueness of transformed Fr\'echet means, in particular of the Fr\'echet median.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, the quantitative entropy-cost type propagation of chaos for mean field interacting particle system is obtained, where the interaction is bounded and the initial distribution of mean field interacting particles converges to that of corresponding McKean-Vlasov SDEs in $L^1$-transportation cost $\W_1^\Psi$ induced by some cost function $\Psi$. The mean field interacting particle system with common noise is also investigated and the quantitative entropy-cost type conditional propagation of chaos is established.</description>

      <title>Noise-like analytic properties of imaginary chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we continue the study of imaginary multiplicative chaos $\mu_\beta := \exp(i \beta \Gamma)$, where $\Gamma$ is a two-dimensional continuum Gaussian free field. We concentrate here on the fine-scale analytic properties of $|\mu_\beta(Q(x,r))|$ as $r \to 0$, where $Q(x,r)$ is a square of side-length $2r$ centred at $x$. More precisely, we prove monofractality of this process, a law of the iterated logarithm as $r \to 0$ and analyse its exceptional points, which have a close connection to fast points of Brownian motion. Some of the technical ideas developed to address these questions also help us pin down the exact Besov regularity of imaginary chaos, a question left open in [JSW20]. All the mentioned properties illustrate the noise-like behaviour of the imaginary chaos. We conclude by proving that the processes $x \mapsto |\mu_\beta(Q(x,r))|^2$, when normalised additively and multiplicatively, converge as $r \to 0$ in law, but not in probability, to white noise; this suggests that all the information of the multiplicative chaos is contained in the angular parts of $\mu_\beta(Q(x,r))$.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time bounds for a stochastic hybrid system with fast periodic sampling and small white-noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior, uniform-in-time, of a non-linear dynamical system under the combined effects of fast periodic sampling with period $\delta$ and small white noise of size $\varepsilon,\thinspace 0&lt;\varepsilon,\delta \ll 1$. The dynamics depend on both the current and recent measurements of the state, and as such it is not Markovian. Our main results can be interpreted as Law of Large Numbers (LLN) and Central Limit Theorem (CLT) type results. LLN type result shows that the resulting stochastic process is close to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) uniformly in time as $\varepsilon,\delta \searrow 0.$ Further, in regards to CLT, we provide quantitative and uniform-in-time control of the fluctuations process. The interaction of the small parameters provides an additional drift term in the limiting fluctuations, which captures both the sampling and noise effects. As a consequence, we obtain a first-order perturbation expansion of the stochastic process along with time-independent estimates on the remainder. The zeroth- and first-order terms in the expansion are given by an ODE and SDE, respectively. Simulation studies that illustrate and supplement the theoretical results are also provided.</description>

Abstract: We study a random graph model with preferential edge attachment and detachment through the embedding into a generalized Yule model. We show that the in-degree distribution of a vertex chosen uniformly at random follows a power law in the supercritical regime but has an exponential decay in the subcritical. We provide the corresponding asymptotics. In the critical regime we observe an intermediate decay. The regimes are clearly defined in terms of parameter ranges.</description>

      <title>An upper tail field of the KPZ fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The KPZ fixed point is a (1+1)-dimensional space-time random field conjectured to be the universal limit for models within the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. We consider the KPZ fixed point with the narrow-wedge initial condition, conditioning on a large value at a specific point. By zooming in the neighborhood of this high point appropriately, we obtain a limiting random field, which we call an upper tail field of the KPZ fixed point. Different from the KPZ fixed point, where the time parameter has to be nonnegative, the upper tail field is defined in the full $2$-dimensional space. Especially, if we zoom out the upper tail field appropriately, it behaves like a Brownian-type field in the negative time regime, and the KPZ fixed point in the positive time regime. One main ingredient of the proof is an upper tail estimate of the joint tail probability functions of the KPZ fixed point near the given point, which generalizes the well known one-point upper tail estimate of the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution.</description>

      <title>On the components of random geometric graphs in the dense limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the geometric graph on $n$ independent uniform random points in a connected compact region $A$ of ${\bf R}^d, d \geq 2$ with $C^2$ boundary, or in the unit square, with distance parameter $r_n$. Let $K_n$ be the number of components of this graph, and $R_n$ the number of vertices not in the giant component. Let $S_n$ be the number of isolated vertices. We show that if $r_n$ is chosen so that $nr_n^d$ tends to infinity but slowly enough that ${\bf E}[S_n]$ also tends to infinity, then $K_n$, $R_n$ and $S_n$ are all asymptotic to $\mu_n$ in probability as $n \to \infty$ where (with $|A|$, $\theta_d$ and $|\partial A|$ denoting the volume of $A$, of the unit $d$-ball, and the perimeter of $A$ respectively) $\mu_n := ne^{-\pi n r_n^d/|A|}$ if $d=2$ and $\mu_n := ne^{-\theta_d n r_n^d/|A|} + \theta_{d-1}^{-1} |\partial A| r_n^{1-d} e^{- \theta_d n r_n^d/(2|A|)}$ if $d\geq 3$. We also give variance asymptotics and central limit theorems for $K_n$ and $R_n$ in this limiting regime when $d \geq 3$, and for Poisson input with $d \geq 2$. We extend these results (substituting ${\bf E}[S_n]$ for $\mu_n$) to a class of non-uniform distributions on $A$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contributions we are interested in the homogenization property of stochastic non-homogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with fast oscillation in a smooth bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d=2,3$, and driven by multiplicative cylindrical Wiener noise. Using two-scale convergence, stochastic compactness and the martingale representative theory, we show the solutions of original equations converge to a solution of stochastic non-homogeneous incompressible version with constant coefficients. The paper also includes a corrector result which improves the two-scale convergence in the weak sense to strong one in regularity space. The main obstacles arise from the random effect and the lower regularity caused by density function.</description>

Abstract: Consider the chiral non-Hermitian random matrix ensemble with parameters $n$ and $v$ and the non Hermiticity parameter $\tau=0$ and let $(\zeta_i)_{1\le i\le n}$ be its $n$ eigenvalues with positive $x$-coordinate. Set $$X_n:=\sqrt{\log s_n}\left(\frac{2n \max_{1\le i\le n}|\zeta_i|^2-2\sqrt{n(n+v)}}{\sqrt{2n+v}}-a(s_{n})\right)$$ with $s_n=n(n+v)/(2n+v)$ and $a(s_n)=\sqrt{\log s_n}-\frac{\log(\sqrt{2\pi}\log s_n)}{\sqrt{\log s_n}}.$ It was proved in \cite{JQ} that $X_n$ converges weakly to the Gumbel distribution $\Lambda$. In this paper, we give in further that $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\log s_n}{(\log\log s_n)^2}W_1\left(F_n, \Lambda\right)=\frac{1}{2}$$ and the Berry-Esseen bound $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\log s_n}{(\log\log s_n)^2}\sup_{x\in\mathbb{R}}|F_n(x)-e^{-e^{-x}}|=\frac{1}{2e}.$$
  Here, $F_n$ is the distribution (function) of $X_n.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider genealogies arising from a Markov population process in which individuals are categorized into a discrete collection of compartments, with the requirement that individuals within the same compartment are statistically exchangeable. When equipped with a sampling process, each such population process induces a time-evolving tree-valued process defined as the genealogy of all sampled individuals. We provide a construction of this genealogy process and derive exact expressions for the likelihood of an observed genealogy in terms of filter equations. These filter equations can be numerically solved using standard Monte Carlo integration methods. Thus, we obtain statistically efficient likelihood-based inference for essentially arbitrary compartment models based on an observed genealogy of individuals sampled from the population.</description>

      <title>Free energy equivalence between mean-field models and nonsparsely diluted mean-field models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied nonsparsely diluted mean-field models that differ from sparsely diluted mean-field models, such as the Viana--Bray model. When the existence probability of each edge follows a Bernoulli distribution, we rigorously prove that the free energy of nonsparsely diluted mean-field models with appropriate parameterization coincides exactly with that of the corresponding mean-field models in ferromagnetic and spin-glass models composed of any discrete spin $S$ in the thermodynamic limit. Our results is a broad generalization of the result of a previous study [Bovier and Gayrard, J. Stat. Phys. 72, 643 (1993)], where the densely diluted mean-field ferromagnetic Ising model (diluted Curie--Weiss model) with appropriate parameterization was analyzed rigorously, and it was proven that its free energy was exactly equivalent to that of the corresponding mean-field model (Curie--Weiss model).</description>

Abstract: We consider search problems with nonobligatory inspection and single-item or combinatorial selection. A decision maker is presented with a number of items, each of which contains an unknown price, and can pay an inspection cost to observe the item's price before selecting it. Under single-item selection, the decision maker must select one item; under combinatorial selection, the decision maker must select a set of items that satisfies certain constraints. In our nonobligatory inspection setting, the decision maker can select items without first inspecting them. It is well-known that search with nonobligatory inspection is harder than the well-studied obligatory inspection case, for which the optimal policy for single-item selection (Weitzman, 1979) and approximation algorithms for combinatorial selection (Singla, 2018) are known.
  We introduce a technique, local hedging, for constructing policies with good approximation ratios in the nonobligatory inspection setting. Local hedging transforms policies for the obligatory inspection setting into policies for the nonobligatory inspection setting, at the cost of an extra factor in the approximation ratio. The factor is instance-dependent but is at most 4/3. We thus obtain the first approximation algorithms for a variety of combinatorial selection problems, including matroid basis, matching, and facility location.</description>
