      <title>On homotopy elements represented by quotients of Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the quotient $G/B$ of a simple matrix Lie group $G$ by a subgroup $B$ isomorphic to a direct product of some of $S^1$s and $S^3$s such that its adjoint representation can be extended over $G$. Then it naturally inherits a stable framing from a twisted left invariant framing $\mathscr{L}^\alpha$ of $G$ where $\alpha$ is the realization of a complex representation of $G$. In this note we want to add some homotopy elements represented by such quotient framed manifolds to those presented in a table of [E. Ossa 1982].</description>

      <title>Counting Components of Hurwitz Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$, we obtain asymptotics for the number of connected components of Hurwitz spaces of marked $G$-covers (of both the affine and projective lines) whose monodromy classes are constrained in a certain way, when the number of branch points grows to infinity. More precisely, we compute both the degree and (in many cases) the coefficient of the leading monomial in the count of components of marked $G$-covers whose monodromy group is a given subgroup of $G$. By the work of Ellenberg, Tran, Venkatesh and Westerland, these asymptotics are related to the distribution of field extensions of $\mathbb{F}_q(T)$ with Galois group $G$.</description>

      <title>Random Abstract Cell Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a model for random (abstract) cell complexes (CCs), similiar to the well-known Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model for graphs and its extensions for simplicial complexes. To build a random cell complex, we first draw from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph, and consecutively augment the graph with cells for each dimension with a specified probability. As the number of possible cells increases combinatorially -- e.g., 2-cells can be represented as cycles, or permutations -- we derive an approximate sampling algorithm for this model limited to two-dimensional abstract cell complexes. As a basis for this algorithm, we first introduce a spanning-tree-based method that samples simple cycles and allows the efficient approximation of various properties, most notably the probability of occurence of a given cycle. This approximation is of independent interest as it enables the approximation of a wide variety of cycle-related graph statistics using importance sampling. We use this to approximate the number of cycles of a given length on a graph, allowing us to calculate the sampling probability to arrive at a desired expected number of sampled 2-cells. The probability approximation also trivially leads to a sampling algorithm for $2$-cells with a desired sampling probability. We provide some initial analysis into the properties of random CCs drawn from this model. We further showcase practical applications for our random CCs as null models, and in the context of (random) liftings of graphs to cell complexes. The cycle sampling, cycle count estimation, and combined cell sampling algorithms are available in the package `py-raccoon` on the Python Packaging Index.</description>
