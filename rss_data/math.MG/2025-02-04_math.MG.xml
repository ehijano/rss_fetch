      <title>A gasket construction of the Koch snowflake and variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a construction of the Koch snowflake that is not inherently six-way symmetrical, based on iteratively placing similar rhombi. This construction naturally splits the snowflake into four identical self-similar curves, in contrast to the typical decomposition into three Koch curves. Varying the shape of the rhombi creates a continuous family of new fractal curves with rectangular symmetry. We compute the Hausdorff dimension of the generalized curve and show that it attains a maximum at the original Koch snowflake.</description>

      <title>Duality for the gradient of a $p$-harmonic function and the existence of gradient curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every convex optimization problem has a dual problem. The $p$-Dirichlet problem in metric measure spaces is an optimization problem whose solutions are $p$-harmonic functions. What is its dual problem? In this paper, we give an answer to this problem in the following form. We give a generalized modulus problem whose solution is the gradient of the $p$-harmonic function for metric measure spaces. Its dual problem is an optimization problem for measures on curves and we show exact duality and the existence of minimizers for this dual problem under appropriate assumptions. When applied to $p$-harmonic functions the minimizers of this dual problem are supported on gradient curves, yielding a natural concept associated to such functions that has yet to be studied. This process defines a natural dual metric current and proves the existence of gradient curves. These insights are then used to construct a counter example answering the old ``sheaf problem'' on metric spaces: in contrast to Euclidean spaces, in general metric spaces being $p$-harmonic is not strictly speaking a local property.</description>

      <title>Minkowski tensors for voxelized data: robust, asymptotically unbiased estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minkowski tensors, also known as tensor valuations, provide robust $n$-point information for a wide range of random spatial structures. Local estimators for voxelized data, however, are unavoidably biased even in the limit of infinitely high resolution. Here, we substantially improve a recently proposed, asymptotically unbiased algorithm to estimate Minkowski tensors for voxelized data. Our improved algorithm is more robust and efficient. Moreover we generalize the theoretical foundations for an asymptotically bias-free estimation of the interfacial tensors to the case of finite unions of compact sets with positive reach, which is relevant for many applications like rough surfaces or composite materials. As a realistic test case, we consider, among others, random (beta) polytopes. We first derive explicit expressions of the expected Minkowski tensors, which we then compare to our simulation results. We obtain precise estimates with relative errors of a few percent for practically relevant resolutions. Finally, we apply our methods to real data of metallic grains and nanorough surfaces, and we provide an open-source python package, which works in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Homotopy connectivity of \v{C}ech complexes of spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S^n$ be the $n$-sphere with the geodesic metric and of diameter $\pi$. The intrinsic \v{C}ech complex of $S^n$ at scale $r$ is the nerve of all open balls of radius $r$ in $S^n$. In this paper, we show how to control the homotopy connectivity of \v{C}ech complexes of spheres at each scale between $0$ and $\pi$ in terms of coverings of spheres. Our upper bound on the connectivity, which is sharp in the case $n=1$, comes from the chromatic numbers of Borsuk graphs of spheres. Our lower bound is obtained using the conicity (in the sense of Barmak) of \v{C}ech complexes of the sufficiently dense, finite subsets of $S^n$. Our bounds imply the new result that for $n\ge 1$, the homotopy type of the \v{C}ech complex of $S^n$ at scale $r$ changes infinitely many times as $r$ varies over $(0,\pi)$; we conjecture only countably many times. Additionally, we lower bound the homological dimension of \v{C}ech complexes of finite subsets of $S^n$ in terms of their packings.</description>

      <title>Sharp regularity of sub-Riemannian length-minimizing curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A longstanding open question in sub-Riemannian geometry is the smoothness of (the arc-length parameterization of) length-minimizing curves. In [6], this question is negative answered, with an example of a $C^2$ but not $C^3$ length-minimizer of a real-analytic (even polynomial) sub-Riemannian structure. In this paper, we study a class of examples of sub-Riemannian structures that generalizes that presented in [6], and we prove that length-minimizing curves must be at least of class $C^2$ within these examples. In particular, we prove that Theorem 1.1 in [6] is sharp.</description>

Abstract: The ACF-monotonicity formula is a powerful tool in the study of two-phase free boundary problems, which was introduced by Alt, Caffarelli, and Friedman[1]. In this paper, we extend it to RCD(0,N) metric measure cones. As an application, we give a rigidity result for RCD(0,N) metric measure cones.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz Decompositions of Finite $\ell_{p}$ Metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lipschitz decomposition is a useful tool in the design of efficient algorithms involving metric spaces. While many bounds are known for different families of finite metrics, the optimal parameters for $n$-point subsets of $\ell_p$, for $p &gt; 2$, remained open, see e.g. [Naor, SODA 2017]. We make significant progress on this question and establish the bound $\beta=O(\log^{1-1/p} n)$. Building on prior work, we demonstrate applications of this result to two problems, high-dimensional geometric spanners and distance labeling schemes. In addition, we sharpen a related decomposition bound for $1&lt;p&lt;2$, due to Filtser and Neiman [Algorithmica 2022].</description>

      <title>The Polytope of Probability Functions on a Finite Poset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01604v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kim, Kim, and Neggers (2019) defined probability functions on a poset, by listing some very natural conditions that a function \(\pi: P \times P \to [0,1]\) should satisfy in order to capture the intuition of "the likelihood that \(a\) precedes \(b\) in \(P\)". In particular, this generalizes the common notion of poset probability for finite posets, where \(\pi(a,b)\) is the proportion of linear extensions of \(P\) in which \(a\) precedes \(b\).
  They constructed a family of such functions for posets embedded in the ordered plane; that is two say, for posets of order dimension at most two.
  We study probability functions of a finite poset \(P\) by constructing an ancillary poset \(\tilde{P}\), that we call *probability functions posets*. The relations of this new poset encodes the restrictions imposed on probability functions of the original poset by the conditions of the definition. Then, we define the probability functions polytope, which parameterizes the probability functions on \(P\), and show that it can be realized as the order polytope of \(\tilde{P}\) intersected by a certain affine subspace.
  We give a partial description of the vertices of probability functions polytope and show that, in contrast to the order polytope, it is not always a lattice polytope.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a compact $M \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and $l &gt; 0$. A maximal distance minimizer problem is to find a connected compact set $\Sigma$ of the length (one-dimensional Hausdorff measure $\mathcal H$) at most $l$ that minimizes \[ \max_{y \in M} dist (y, \Sigma), \] where $dist$ stands for the Euclidean distance.
  We give a survey on the results on the maximal distance minimizers and related problems. Also we fill some natural gaps by showing NP-hardness of the maximal distance minimizing problem, establishing its $\Gamma$-convergence, considering the penalized form and discussing uniqueness of a solution. We finish with open questions.</description>

      <title>Higher rank antipodality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by general probability theory, we say that the set $S$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is \emph{antipodal of rank $k$}, if for any $k+1$ elements $q_1,\ldots q_{k+1}\in S$, there is an affine map from $\mathrm{conv}(S)$ to the $k$-dimensional simplex $\Delta_k$ that maps $q_1,\ldots q_{k+1}$ bijectively onto the $k+1$ vertices of $\Delta_k$. For $k=1$, it coincides with the well-studied notion of (pairwise) antipodality introduced by Klee. We consider the following natural generalization of Klee's problem on antipodal sets: What is the maximum size of an antipodal set of rank $k$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$? We present a geometric characterization of antipodal sets of rank $k$ and adapting the argument of Danzer and Gr\"unbaum originally developed for the $k=1$ case, we prove an upper bound which is exponential in the dimension. We show that this problem can be connected to a classical question in computer science on finding perfect hashes, and it provides a lower bound on the maximum size, which is also exponential in the dimension. By connecting rank-$k$ antipodality to $k$-neighborly polytopes, we obtain another upper bound when $k&gt;d/2$.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral surfaces in flat (2+1)-spacetimes and balanced cellulations on hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first prove that given a hyperbolic metric $h$ on a closed surface $S$, any flat metric on $S$ with negative singular curvatures isometrically embeds as a convex polyhedral Cauchy surface in a unique future-complete flat globally hyperbolic maximal (2+1)-spacetime whose linear part of the holonomy is given by $h$. The Gauss map allows to translate this statement to a purely 2-dimensional problem of finding a balanced geodesic cellulation on the hyperbolic surface, from which the flat metric can be easily recovered.
  We show next that given two such flat metrics on the surface, there exists a unique pair of future- and past-complete flat globally hyperbolic maximal (2+1)-spacetimes with the same holonomy, in which the flat metrics embed respectively as convex polyhedral Cauchy surfaces. The proof follows from convexity properties of the total length of the associated balanced geodesic cellulations over Teichm\"uller space.</description>

      <title>A sharp isoperimetric-type inequality for Lorentzian spaces satisfying timelike Ricci lower bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper establishes a sharp and rigid isoperimetric-type inequality in Lorentzian signature under the assumption of Ricci curvature bounded below in the timelike directions. The inequality is proved in the high generality of Lorentzian pre-length spaces satisfying timelike Ricci lower bounds in a synthetic sense via optimal transport, the so-called $\mathsf{TCD}^e_p(K,N)$ spaces. The results are new already for smooth Lorentzian manifolds. Applications include an upper bound on the area of achronal hypersurfaces inside the interior of a black hole (original already in Schwarzschild) and an upper bound on the area of achronal hypersurfaces in cosmological spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem whether regular polygons and cycle graphs can be identified by the magnitude or the discrete Riesz energy. We give an affirmative answer for a finite number of cases when the number of vertices is small and a negative answer for an infinite number of wide cases by giving a way to construct non-isometric spaces, which we call isomers, with the same magnitude or the discrete Riesz energy. We study whether isomers can be distinguished by the magnitude homology groups.</description>

      <title>Reducing the Large Set Threshold for Oertel's Conjecture on the Mixed-Integer Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1960, Gr\"{u}nbaum proved that for any convex body $C\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ and every halfspace $H$ containing the centroid of $C$, one has that the volume of $H\cap C$ is at least a $\frac{1}{e}$-fraction of the volume of $C$. Recently, in 2014, Oertel conjectured that a similar result holds for mixed-integer convex sets. Concretely, he proposed that for any convex body $C\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+d}$, there should exist a point $\mathbf{x} \in S=C\cap(\mathbb{Z}^{n}\times\mathbb{R}^d)$ such that for every halfspace $H$ containing $\mathbf{x}$, one has that
  \[
  \mathcal{H}_d(H\cap S) \geq \frac{1}{2^n}\frac{1}{e}\mathcal{H}_d(S),
  \]
  where $\mathcal{H}_d$ denotes the $d$-dimensional Hausdorff measure. While the conjecture remains open, Basu and Oertel proved in 2017 that the above inequality holds true for sufficiently large sets, in terms of a measure known as the \emph{lattice width} of a set. In this work, by following a geometric approach, we improve this result by substantially reducing the threshold at which a set can be considered large. We reduce this threshold from an exponential to a polynomial dependency on the dimension, therefore significantly enlarging the family of mixed-integer convex sets over which Oertel's conjecture holds true.</description>

      <title>Universal geometric non-embedding of random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Delta \ge 3$ be fixed, $n \ge n_\Delta$ be a large integer. It is a classical result that $\Delta$--regular expanders on $n$ vertices are not embeddable as geometric (distance) graphs into Euclidean space of dimension less than $c \log n$, for some universal constant $c$. We show that for typical $\Delta$-regular graphs, this obstruction is universal with respect to the choice of norm. More precisely, for a uniform random $\Delta$-regular graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, it holds with high probability: there is no normed space of dimension less than $c\log n$ which admits a geometric graph isomorphic to $G$. The proof is based on a seeded multiscale $\varepsilon$--net argument.</description>

      <title>On the kissing number of the cross-polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new upper bound $\kappa_T(K_n)\leq 2.9162^{(1+o(1))n}$ for the translative kissing number of the $n$-dimensional cross-polytope $K_n$ is proved, improving on Hadwiger's bound $\kappa_T(K_n)\leq 3^n-1$ from 1957. Furthermore, it is shown that there exist kissing configurations satisfying $\kappa_T(K_n)\geq 1.1637^{(1-o(1))n}$, which improves on the previous best lower bound $ \kappa_T(K_n)\geq 1.1348^{(1-o(1))n}$ by Talata. It is also shown that the lattice kissing number satisfies $\kappa_L(K_n)&lt; 12(2^n-1)$ for all $n\geq 1$, and that the lattice $D_4^+$ is the unique lattice, up to signed permutations of coordinates, attaining the maximum lattice kissing number $\kappa_L(K_4)=40$ in four dimensions.</description>

      <title>An analysis of Euclid's geometrical foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial techniques developed in Euclid's Elements, well before the use of the parallel postulate, are reexamined in order to clarify even the most obscure details, particularly those related to equality, superposition and angle comparison. Some commentary on modern developments is included. The known but often misunderstood implicit handling of betweenness and points of intersection is briefly treated. We also sketch a rigorous treatment of absolute geometry in a spirit similar to Euclid's, one that allows properties of angles and triangles to be derived from two simple axioms on right angles, which then leads to rigid motions of certain planar geometries.</description>

      <title>Self-embedding similitudes of Bedford-McMullen carpets with dependent ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that any non-degenerate Bedford-McMullen carpet does not allow oblique self-embedding similitudes; that is, if $f$ is a similitude sending the carpet into itself, then the image of the $x$-axis under $f$ must be parallel to one of the principal axes. We also establish a logarithmic commensurability result on the contraction ratios of such embeddings. This completes a previous study of Algom and Hochman [Ergod. Th. &amp; Dynam. Sys. 39 (2019), 577--603] on Bedford-McMullen carpets generated by multiplicatively independent exponents, together with a new proof on their non-obliqueness statement.
  For the self-similar case, however, we construct a generalized Sierpinski carpet that is symmetric with respect to an appropriate oblique line and hence allows a reflectional oblique self-embedding. As a complement, we prove that if a generalized Sierpinski carpet satisfies the strong separation condition and permits an oblique rotational self-embedding similitude, then the tangent of the rotation angle takes values $\pm 1$.</description>

      <title>Realizations of planar graphs as Poincar'e-Reeb graphs of refined algebraic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algebraic domains are regions in the plane surrounded by mutually disjoint non-singular real algebraic curves. Poincar'e-Reeb Graphs of them are graphs they naturally collapse: such graphs are formally formulated by Sorea, for example, around 2020. Their studies found that nicely embedded planar graphs are Poincar'e-Reeb graphs of some algebraic domains. These graphs are generic with respect to the projection to the horizontal axis. Problems, methods and results are elementary and natural and they apply natural approximations nicely for example.
  We present our new approach to extension of the result to a non-generic case and an answer. We first formulate generalized algebraic domains, surrounded by non-singular real algebraic curves which may intersect with normal crossings. Such domains and certain classes of them appear in related studies of graphs and regions surrounded by algebraic curves explicitly.</description>
