      <title>First-order phase transition in atom-molecule quantum degenerate mixtures with coherent three-body recombination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We map the phase diagram of a two-mode atom-molecule Bose-Einstein condensate with Fano-Feshbach and coherent three-body recombination (cTBR) terms. The standard second order phase transition observed as the molecular energy is tuned through the Feshbach resonance, is replaced by a first order transition when cTBR becomes prominent, due to a double-well structure in the free energy landscape. This transition is associated with atom-molecule entanglement, bistability, and molecular metastability. Our results establish cTBR as a powerful knob for quantum state engineering and control of reaction dynamics in ultracold chemistry.</description>

      <title>Proposal for realizing unpaired Weyl points in a three-dimensional periodically driven optical Raman lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In static lattice systems, the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem enforces the pairing of Weyl points with opposite chiralities, which precludes the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in equilibrium. Periodic driving provides a viable route to circumvent this no-go constraint. Here, we propose a scheme to realize and control unpaired Weyl points using ultracold atoms in a three-dimensional (3D) optical Raman lattice under continuous periodic driving. By engineering distinct relative symmetries between the lattice and multiple Raman potentials, the configuration generates an effective 3D spin-orbit coupling and yields a tunable topological-insulator phase. Through adiabatic periodic modulation of this system, we show that eight Weyl points emerge in the quasienergy spectrum of the low-energy sector, whose net chirality can be precisely tuned. A nonzero total chirality directly corresponds to the formation of unpaired Weyl points. Furthermore, by implementing a synthetic magnetic field via laser-assisted tunneling in this setup, we demonstrate that the chirality imbalance drives a quantized charge current in the weak-field regime, providing a direct signature of the CME. We verify that the adiabatic condition of the driving protocol, as well as the proposed experimental preparation and detection techniques, are within reach of current ultracold-atom experiments. This work establishes a realistic and controllable platform for exploring chiral-anomaly physics and nonequilibrium topological phenomena linked to Weyl fermions.</description>

      <title>Two-photon-assisted collisions in ultracold gases of polar molecules II : Optical shielding of ultracold polar molecular collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the collisions between ultracold polar molecules in the presence of two lasers ensuring a Raman resonant transition on individual molecules to suppress photon scattering, taking the example of bosonic $^{23}$Na$^{39}$K molecules. By varying laser detunings and intensities, we enable a repulsive long-range interaction potential between molecules. After solving a set of coupled Schr\"odinger equations with the Hamiltonian written in the basis of laser-dressed states of the molecule pair at infinite distance, we identify quasi-resonant conditions under which elastic collisions are favored over inelastic and reactive ones, by a factor of about 2, thus demonstrating a promising pathway for efficient two-photon optical shielding of ultracold molecular collisions. The results are analyzed in terms of scattering length of the colliding laser-dressed molecules, which exhibit prominent resonances assigned to the interaction of the entrance channel with other specific channels, consistent with the existence of a quasi-bound level of the long-range molecular pair induced by the lasers.</description>

      <title>Protocols for a many-body phase microscope: From coherences and d-wave superconductivity to Green's functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum gas microscopes probe quantum many-body lattice states via projective measurements in the occupation basis, enabling access to various density and spin correlations. Phase information, however, cannot be directly obtained in these setups. Recent experiments went beyond this by measuring local current operators and local phase fluctuations. Here we propose how Fourier-space manipulation in a matter-wave microscope allows access to various long-range off-diagonal correlators in experimentally realistic settings, realizing a many-body phase microscope. We demonstrate in particular how the fermionic d-wave superconducting order parameter in arbitrary Hubbard-type models, the non-equal time Green's function yielding the spectral function, or the hidden order of composite bosons in a fractional Chern insulator can be directly measured. Our results show the great potential of matter-wave microscopy for accessing exotic correlators including phases and coherences and characterizing intriguing quantum many-body states.</description>

      <title>Second excited state of ${}^4\mathrm{He}$ tetramer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The four-boson universality suggests the existence of the second excited tetramer state in a system of cold ${}^4\mathrm{He}$ atoms. It is not bound but could be seen as a resonance in the atom-trimer scattering. This process is rigorously calculated using the momentum-space transition operator framework with two realistic interatomic potentials. The $S$-wave phase shift and cross section show a resonant behavior below the excited trimer threshold, but there are sizable nonresonant contributions from $P$ and $D$ waves as well. The position and width of the resonant state is determined, and for the latter significant finite-range effects are found.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Expansion Method for few-body states in two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of trions in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) monolayers using the Gaussian Expansion Method (GEM) adapted to two-dimensional systems. Excitons and trions in monolayer TMDCs with the chemical composition MX$_2$ in the 2H phase are studied systematically. We computed the associated exciton and trion binding energies. We find in addition to the known $J = 0$ trion the existence of a bound state with orbital angular momentum $J = 1$. The results for $J = 0$ are benchmarked against existing calculations from the Stochastic Variational Method (SVM) and Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). Furthermore, we analyze the trion internal structure and geometry through their probability density distributions, accounting for the effects of different material shows that GEM -- widely used in studies of strongly interacting few-body systems -- is well adapted to allow comprehensive and computationally efficient investigations of trions and potentially other weakly bound few-body states in layered materials. In addition, we systematically exploit the effect of strain and dieletric environment in the $J = 1$ trion predictions, illustrated for the MoS$_2$ monolayer example.</description>

      <title>Experimental challenges and prospects for quantum-enhanced energy conversion: Stationary Fano coherence in V-type qutrits interacting with polarized incoherent radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum coherence offers potential for energy conversion technologies. It influences light absorption and emission, affecting energy conversion limits and efficiency. As a result, quantum coherence is being harnessed to boost performance in quantum heat engines, photocells, and photosynthetic-inspired platforms. Of particular interest in this context is the generation of Fano coherences, i.e., the formation of quantum coherences due to the interaction with the continuum of modes characterizing an incoherent process. We aim to formalize mathematically the possibility of achieving steady-state Fano coherence in a V-type three-level quantum system using polarized incoherent radiation, without requiring the energy difference between the excited levels to tend to zero. We perform this analysis by deriving the Bloch-Redfield equation from first-principles by quantizing the incoherent radiation. The resulting reduced dynamics of the system are analysed, so as to determine the lifetime of Fano coherence and identify the conditions under which it becomes stationary. We characterise distinct dynamical regimes, ranging from weak to strong pumping, in which steady-state Fano coherence emerges, and we quantitatively determine its magnitude. For each regime, we analyse the generation of Fano coherence as a function of both the intensity of the incoherent pumping and the energy splitting between the excited levels. We also assess how obtaining Fano coherence is modified by symmetric or asymmetric decay rates. These findings indicate that a three-level quantum system driven by polarized incoherent light can act as a robust resource for coherence-assisted energy conversion and storage. Finally, we discuss the experimental challenges associated with the implementation of the proposed model using an ensemble of Rubidium atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a dilute quantum gas of interacting spin-1/2 fermions in the thermodynamic limit. For a trial state that resolves the ground state energy up to the precision of the Huang--Yang formula, we rigorously derive its momentum distribution. Our result agrees with the formal perturbative argument of Belyakov (Sov. Phys. JETP 13: 850--851 (1961)).</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram and dynamical phases of self organization of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a transversely pumped red-detuned cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a transversely pumped atomic Bose-Einstein Condensate coupled to a single-mode optical cavity, where effective atom-atom interactions are mediated by pump and cavity photons. A number of experiments and theoretical works have shown the formation of a superradiant state in this setup, where interference of pump and cavity light leads to an optical lattice in which atoms self-consistently organize. This self-organization has been extensively studied using the approximate Dicke model (truncating to two momentum states), as well as through numerical Gross-Pitaevskii simulations in one and two dimensions. Here, we perform a full mean-field analysis of the system, including all relevant atomic momentum states and the cavity field. We map out the steady-state phase diagram vs pump strength and cavity detuning, and provide an in-depth understanding of the instabilities that are linked to the emergence of spatio-temporal patterns. We find and describe parameter regimes where mean-field predicts bistability, regimes where the dynamics form chaotic trajectories, instabilities caused by resonances between normal mode excitations, and states with atomic dynamics but vanishing cavity field.</description>

      <title>Properties of Bose-Einstein condensates with altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a weakly interacting two-component Bose--Einstein condensate in the miscible regime in the presence of \emph{altermagnetism}, i.e., a collinear and globally compensated magnetic order that breaks spin-rotation symmetry while maintaining zero net magnetization. Within Bogoliubov theory, we derive the quasiparticle spectrum and coherence factors and show that altermagnetic order generically induces an angular dependence of the low-energy excitations. As a result, the sound velocity, momentum-resolved magnetization in the quantum depletion, and density--spin response functions acquire anisotropic components. We show that these anisotropic contributions vanish after angular averaging, consistent with the defining feature of altermagnetism: nontrivial local spin polarization without a global magnetization. Finally, we evaluate the Lee--Huang--Yang correction to the ground-state energy in the altermagnetic phase. Our results should be testable with ultracold-atom experiments in the foreseeable future.</description>
