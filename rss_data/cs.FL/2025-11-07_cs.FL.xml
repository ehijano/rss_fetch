      <title>State Complexity of Multiple Concatenation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe witness languages meeting the upper bound on the state complexity of the multiple concatenation of $k$ regular languages over an alphabet of size $k+1$ with a significantly simpler proof than that in the literature. We also consider the case where some languages may be recognized by two-state automata. Then we show that one symbol can be saved, and we define witnesses for the multiple concatenation of $k$ languages over a $k$-letter alphabet. This solves an open problem stated by Caron et al. [2018, Fundam. Inform. 160, 255--279]. We prove that for the concatenation of three languages, the ternary alphabet is optimal. We also show that a trivial upper bound on the state complexity of multiple concatenation is asymptotically tight for ternary languages, and that a lower bound remains exponential in the binary case. Finally, we obtain a tight upper bound for unary cyclic languages and languages recognized by unary automata that do not have final states in their tails.</description>

      <title>Explorability in Pushdown Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study explorability, a measure of nondeterminism in pushdown automata, which generalises history-determinism. An automaton is k-explorable if, while reading the input, it suffices to follow k concurrent runs, built step-by-step based only on the input seen so far, to construct an accepting one, if it exists. We show that the class of explorable PDAs lies strictly between history-deterministic and fully nondeterministic PDAs in terms of both expressiveness and succinctness. In fact increasing explorability induces an infinite hierarchy: each level k defines a strictly more expressive class than level k-1, yet the entire class remains less expressive than general nondeterministic PDAs. We then introduce a parameterized notion of explorability, where the number of runs may depend on input length, and show that exponential explorability precisely captures the context-free languages. Finally, we prove that explorable PDAs can be doubly exponentially more succinct than history-deterministic ones, and that the succinctness gap between deterministic and 2-explorable PDAs is not recursively enumerable. These results position explorability as a robust and operationally meaningful measure of nondeterminism for pushdown systems.</description>

      <title>Attractors Is All You Need: Parity Games In Polynomial Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a polynomial-time algorithm for solving parity games that runs in $\mathcal{O}(n^{2}\cdot(n + m))$ time-ending a search that has taken decades. Unlike previous attractor-based algorithms, the presented algorithm only removes regions with a determined winner. The paper introduces a new type of attractor that can guarantee finding the minimal dominion of a parity game. The attractor runs in polynomial time and can peel the graph empty.</description>

      <title>Overview and Performance Evaluation of Supervisory Controller Synthesis with Eclipse ESCET v4.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervisory controllers control cyber-physical systems to ensure their correct and safe operation. Synthesis-based engineering (SBE) is an approach to largely automate their design and implementation. SBE combines model-based engineering with computer-aided design, allowing engineers to focus on 'what' the system should do (the requirements) rather than 'how' it should do it (design and implementation). In the Eclipse Supervisory Control Engineering Toolkit (ESCET) open-source project, a community of users, researchers, and tool vendors jointly develop a toolkit to support the entire SBE process, particularly through the CIF modeling language and tools. In this paper, we first provide a description of CIF's symbolic supervisory controller synthesis algorithm, and thereby include aspects that are often omitted in the literature, but are of great practical relevance, such as the prevention of runtime errors, handling different types of requirements, and supporting input variables (to connect to external inputs). Secondly, we introduce and describe CIF's benchmark models, a collection of 23 freely available industrial and academic models of various sizes and complexities. Thirdly, we describe recent improvements between ESCET versions v0.8 (December 2022) and v4.0 (June 2024) that affect synthesis performance, evaluate them on our benchmark models, and show the current practical synthesis performance of CIF. Fourthly, we briefly look at multi-level synthesis, a non-monolithic synthesis approach, evaluate its gains, and show that while it can help to further improve synthesis performance, further performance improvements are still needed to synthesize complex models.</description>

      <title>Exact Expressive Power of Transformers with Padding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain of thought is a natural inference-time method for increasing the computational power of transformer-based large language models (LLMs), but comes at the cost of sequential decoding. Are there more efficient alternatives to expand a transformer's expressive power without adding parameters? We consider transformers with padding tokens as a form of parallelizable test-time compute. We show that averaging-hard-attention, masked-pre-norm transformers with polynomial padding recognize precisely the class $\mathsf{FO}$-uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ of extremely parallelizable problems. While the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ upper bound was known, proving a matching lower bound had been elusive. Further, our novel analysis reveals the precise expanded power of padded transformers when coupled with another form of inference-time compute, namely dynamically increasing depth via looping. Our core technical contribution is to show how padding helps bring the notions of complete problems and reductions, which have been a cornerstone of classical complexity theory, to the formal study of transformers. Armed with this new tool, we prove that padded transformers with $O(\log^d n)$ looping on inputs of length $n$ recognize exactly the class $\mathsf{FO}$-uniform $\mathsf{TC}^d$ of moderately parallelizable problems. Thus, padding and looping together systematically expand transformers' expressive power: with polylogarithmic looping, polynomially padded transformers recognize precisely the class $\mathsf{FO}$-uniform $\mathsf{NC}$, the best that could be expected without losing parallelism (unless $\mathsf{NC} = \mathsf{P}$). Our results thus motivate further exploration of padding and looping as parallelizable alternatives to chain of thought for test-time compute.</description>

      <title>FATE: A Formal Benchmark Series for Frontier Algebra of Multiple Difficulty Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in formal theorem proving, particularly on contest-based mathematical benchmarks like the IMO. However, these contests do not reflect the depth, breadth, and abstraction of modern mathematical research. To bridge this gap, we introduce FATE (Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation), a new benchmark series in formal algebra designed to chart a course toward advanced mathematical reasoning. We present two new components, FATE-H and FATE-X, each with 100 problems in abstract and commutative algebra. The FATE series spans a difficulty spectrum from undergraduate exercises to problems exceeding PhD qualifying exams. Notably, FATE-X is the first formal benchmark to surpass both PhD-level exam difficulty and the coverage of the Mathlib library. Our evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM provers on this new benchmark reveal a stark performance gap compared to contest math: the best model achieves only 3% (pass@64) accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. Our two-stage evaluation reveals that models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their ability to formalize this reasoning. We systematically classify the common errors that arise during this formalization process. Furthermore, a comparative study shows that a specialized prover can exhibit less effective reflection than general-purpose models, reducing its accuracy at the natural-language stage. We believe FATE provides a robust and challenging benchmark that establishes essential checkpoints on the path toward research-level formal mathematical reasoning.</description>
