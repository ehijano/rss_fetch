      <title>Stochastic Stefan problem on moving hypersurfaces: an approach by a new framework of nonhomogeneous monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish the well-posedness of the stochastic Stefan problem on moving hypersurfaces. Through a specially designed transformation, it turns out we need to solve stochastic partial differential equations on a fixed hypersurface with a new kind of nonhomogeneous monotonicity involving a family of time-dependent operators. This new class of SPDEs is of independent interest and can also be applied to solve many other interesting models such as the stochastic $p$-Laplacian equations, stochastic Allen-Cahn equation and stochastic heat equations on time-dependent domains or hypersurfaces. (Monotone) Operator-valued calculus and geometric analysis of moving hypersurfaces play important roles in the study. Moreover, a forthcoming result on the well-posedness of stochastic 2D Navier-Stokes equation on moving domains is also based on our framework.</description>

      <title>The $\ell_{\infty}$ Directed Spanning Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\ell_{\infty}$\textit{ directed spanning forest}(DSF), which is a directed forest with vertex set given by a homogeneous Poisson point process such that each Poisson point connects to the nearest Poisson point (in $\ell_{\infty}$ distance) with a strictly larger $y$-coordinate. In this paper, we prove that the $\ell_{\infty}$ DSF is connected and we find optimal estimates on the tail distribution of coalescing time of two $\ell_{\infty}$ DSF paths. Similar estimates were earlier obtained in \cite{coupier20212d} for the $\ell_2$ (Euclidean) DSF and showed that when properly scaled, it converges in distribution to the Brownian web. The geometry of $\ell_\infty$ balls compel us to develop new argument.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic fluctuations of smooth linear statistics of independently perturbed lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the hyperuniform model of d-dimensional integer lattice perturbed by independent random variables and we investigate the large scale asymptotic fluctuations of smoothed versions of the usual counting statistics, specifically of linear statistics associated to a smooth function with rapid decay at infinity. We highlight three distinct classes of limit, depending on the dimension d and on the tails of the perturbations. On the one hand, we establish that for dimensions larger than two, central limit theorems hold under mild assumptions on the perturbations. This confirms numerical observations from physics, suggesting that even for highly correlated hyperuniform models, large dimensions favor asymptotic normality. On the other hand, in dimension one, the limiting distribution can be Gaussian, non-Gaussian with finite moments of all orders, or stable with parameter strictly between one and two. These two latter results represent rare examples of non-Gaussian limits for smooth linear statistics of hyperuniform point processes of Classes I and II.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic regularity in the discrete log-Sobolev inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chain rule lies at the heart of the powerful Gamma calculus for Markov diffusions on manifolds, providing remarkable connections between several fundamental notions such as Bakry-\'Emery curvature, entropy decay, and hypercontractivity. For Markov chains on finite state spaces, approximate versions of this chain rule have recently been put forward, with an extra cost that depends on the log-Lipschitz regularity of the considered observable. Motivated by those findings, we here investigate the regularity of extremizers in the discrete log-Sobolev inequality. Specifically, we show that their log-Lipschitz constant is bounded by a universal multiple of $\log d$, where $d$ denotes the inverse of the smallest non-zero transition probability. As a consequence, we deduce that the log-Sobolev constant of any reversible Markov chain on a finite state space is at least a universal multiple of $\kappa/\log d$, where $\kappa$ is the Bakry-\'Emery curvature. This is a sharp discrete analogue of what is perhaps the most emblematic application of the Bakry-\'Emery theory for diffusions. We also obtain a very simple proof of the main result in \cite{MR4620718}, which asserts that the log-Sobolev constant and its modified version agree up to a $\log d$ factor. Our work consolidates the role of the sparsity parameter $\log d$ as a universal cost for transferring results from Markov diffusions to discrete chains.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of SLE(0+) variants in the capacity parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove large deviation principles (LDPs) for full chordal, radial, and multichordal SLE(0+) curves parameterized by capacity. The rate function is given by the appropriate variant of the Loewner energy. There are two key novelties in the present work. First, we strengthen the topology in the known chordal LDPs into the topology of full parameterized curves including all curve endpoints. We also obtain LDPs in the space of unparameterized curves. Second, we address the radial case, which requires in part different methods from the chordal case, due to the different topological setup. We establish our main results via proving an exponential tightness property and combining it with detailed curve return probability estimates, in the spirit of exponentially good approximations in LDP theory. Notably, since we manage to prove a finite-time LDP in a better topology than in earlier literature, return energy estimates follow as a consequence of the return probability estimates.</description>

      <title>Function-Coherent Gambles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The desirable gambles framework provides a foundational approach to imprecise probability theory but relies heavily on linear utility assumptions. This paper introduces {\em function-coherent gambles}, a generalization that accommodates non-linear utility while preserving essential rationality properties. We establish core axioms for function-coherence and prove a representation theorem that characterizes acceptable gambles through continuous linear functionals. The framework is then applied to analyze various forms of discounting in intertemporal choice, including hyperbolic, quasi-hyperbolic, scale-dependent, and state-dependent discounting. We demonstrate how these alternatives to constant-rate exponential discounting can be integrated within the function-coherent framework. This unified treatment provides theoretical foundations for modeling sophisticated patterns of time preference within the desirability paradigm, bridging a gap between normative theory and observed behavior in intertemporal decision-making under genuine uncertainty.</description>

      <title>A hybrid model of sulphation reactions: stochastic particles in a random continuum environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hybrid stochastic-continuum model to study the sulphation of calcium carbonate and the consequent formation of gypsum, a key phenomenon driving marble deterioration. While calcium carbonate and gypsum are continuous random fields evolving according to random ordinary differential equations, the dynamics of sulfuric acid particles follows It\^o-type stochastic differential equations. The particle evolution incorporates both strong repulsion between particles via the Lennard-Jones potential, and non-local interactions with the continuum environment. The particle-continuum coupling is also achieved through the chemical reaction, modeled as a Poisson counting process. We simulate the spatiotemporal evolution of this corrosion process using the Euler-Maruyama algorithm with varying initial data combined with finite elements to take care of the spatial discretization. Despite symmetric initial data, our simulations highlight an uneven progression of corrosion due to the stochastic influences in the model.</description>

      <title>Conjunctions of Three "Euler Constants" in Poisson-Related Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02054v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three mathematical constants bear the name of the venerable Leonhard Euler: Euler's number, $e=2.718281\ldots$; the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $\gamma=0.577216\ldots$; and the Euler-Gompertz constant, $\delta=0.596347\ldots$. In the present work, we consider two joint appearances of these constants, one in a well-known equation of Hardy (interpretable in connection with inverse second moments of the Poisson probability distribution), and the other from a sequence of probabilities generated by recursively conditional Exponential (i.e., Poisson-event waiting-time) distributions. In both cases, we explore extensions of the initial observations to offer more comprehensive results.</description>

      <title>Random Variables, Conditional Independence and Categories of Abstract Sample Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two high-level "pictures" of probability theory have emerged: one that takes as central the notion of random variable, and one that focuses on distributions and probability channels (Markov kernels). While the channel-based picture has been successfully axiomatized, and widely generalized, using the notion of Markov category, the categorical semantics of the random variable picture remain less clear. Simpson's probability sheaves are a recent approach, in which probabilistic concepts like random variables are allowed vary over a site of sample spaces. Simpson has identified rich structure on these sites, most notably an abstract notion of conditional independence, and given examples ranging from probability over databases to nominal sets. We aim bring this development together with the generality and abstraction of Markov categories: We show that for any suitable Markov category, a category of sample spaces can be defined which satisfies Simpson's axioms, and that a theory of probability sheaves can be developed purely synthetically in this setting. We recover Simpson's examples in a uniform fashion from well-known Markov categories, and consider further generalizations.</description>

      <title>On the optimal stopping problem for diffusions and an approximation result for stopping times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the classical finite-horizon optimal stopping problem for multidimensional diffusions through an approach that differs from what is typically found in the literature. More specifically, we first prove a key equality for the value function from which a series of results easily follow. This equality enables us to prove that the classical stopping time, at which the value function equals the terminal gain, is the smallest optimal stopping time, without resorting to the martingale approach and relying on the Snell envelope. Moreover, this equality allows us to rigorously demonstrate the dynamic programming principle, thus showing that the value function is the viscosity solution to the corresponding variational inequality. Such an equality also shows that the value function does not change when the class of stopping times varies. To prove this equality, we use an approximation result for stopping times, which is of independent interest and can find application in other stochastic control problems involving stopping times, as switching or impulsive problems, also of mean field type.</description>

      <title>Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations in the Wasserstein Space for the Optimal Control of the Kushner-Stratonovich Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a comparison theorem for viscosity solutions of a new class of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations, which is used to solve the separated problem governed by the K-S equation in the Wasserstein space. A distinctive feature of these HJB equations is the simultaneous presence of variational and Lions derivatives, an inevitable consequence of a nonzero observation function. Moreover, the presence of state-dependent correlated noise adds further complexity to the analysis, making the proof of the comparison theorem more challenging. The core proof strategy for the comparison theorem is to introduce a novel adaptation of the doubling variables argument, specifically tailored to tackle the challenges posed by the Wasserstein space. To this end, we construct an entirely new bivariate functional that combines viscosity sub/supsolutions, a smooth gauge-type function, and two Gaussian regularized entropy penalizations. The gauge-type function compensates for the non-differentiability (in the Lions sense) of the 2-Wasserstein distance, while the entropy penalizations ensure that the maximal point of the functional is well-behaved. Another major contribution of this paper is the derivation of the second-order variational and Lions derivatives of the gauge-type function and entropy functional, which are crucial for dealing with the second-order HJB equation. Meanwhile, the simple structure and pleasing regularity of these derivatives make the methodologies developed in this paper applicable within a wider range of theoretical settings. This paper gives the first result concerning the uniqueness of viscosity solutions for second-order HJB equations with variational derivatives in the Wasserstein space.</description>

      <title>Random sampling of partitions and contingency tables: Two practical examples of the Burnside process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Burnside process is a general algorithm for sampling a uniformly chosen orbit of a finite group $G$ acting on a finite set $\mathcal{X}$. For example, if $\mathcal{X} = G$ and $G$ acts on itself by conjugation ($s^t = t^{-1}st$), then the orbits are conjugacy classes. When $G$ is the symmetric group $S_n$, the conjugacy classes are indexed by partitions of $n$, so the Burnside process gives a way to sample partitions. If $\mathcal{X}=S_n$ and $G$ is a product of symmetric groups, then the orbits are labeled by contingency tables: non-negative integer arrays with given row and column sums. Actually carrying out the Burnside process requires new combinatorics and group theory. This is worked out and illustrated for these two examples. For partitions, we also developed a new Markov chain called the reflected Burnside process which greatly improves the mixing of the Burnside process.</description>

      <title>Statistics for random representations of Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate how a typical, large-dimensional representation looks for a complex Lie algebra. In particular, we study the family $\mathfrak{sl}_{r+1}(\mathbb{C})$ of Lie algebras for $r \geq 2$ and derive asymptotic probability distributions for the multiplicity of small irreducible representations, as well as the largest dimension, the largest height, and the total number of irreducible representations appearing in the decomposition of a representation sampled uniformly from all representations with the same dimension. This provides a natural generalization to the similar statistical studies of integer partitions, which forms the case $r=1$ of our considerations and where one has a rich toolkit ranging from combinatorial methods to approaches utilizing the theory of modular forms. We perform our analysis by extending the statistical mechanics inspired approaches in the case of partitions to the infinite family here.</description>

      <title>The distance to the border of a random tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a Galton-Watson process conditioned to have total progeny equal to $n$, we study the asymptotic probability that this conditioned Galton-Watson process has distance to the border bigger or equal than $k$, as the number of nodes $n \rightarrow \infty$.
  A problem which is akin to this one was solved by R\'enyi and Szekeres for Cayley trees, de Bruijn, Knuth, and Rice for plane trees and Flajolet, Gao, Odlyzko, and Richmond for binary trees. The distance to the border is dual, in a certain sense, to the height. The first of these distances is the minimum of the distances from the root to the leaves. The second is the maximum of the distances from the root to the leaves. These are two extreme complementary cases.</description>

      <title>Berry-Esseen Theorem for Sample Quantiles with Locally Dependent Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem for the sample quantiles based on locally dependent random variables with explicit convergence rate. Our approach is based on converting the problem to a sum of indicator random variables, applying Stein's method for local dependence, and bounding the distance between two normal distributions. We also generalize this approach to the joint convergence of sample quantiles with an explicit convergence rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish lower tail bounds for the height, and upper tail bounds for the width, of critical size-conditioned Bienaym\'e trees. Our bounds are optimal at this level of generality. We also obtain precise asymptotics for offspring distributions within the domain of attraction of a Cauchy distribution, under a local regularity assumption. Finally, we pose some questions on the possible asymptotic behaviours of the height and width of critical size-conditioned Bienaym\'e trees.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of quenched and annealed random walks under the effect of disorder in strongly mixing environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we establish the existence of large deviation principles of random walk in strongly mixing environments. The quenched and annealed rate functions have the same zero set whose shape is either a singleton point or a line segment, with an illustrative example communicated and given by F. Rassoul-Agha. Whenever the level of disorder is controlled, the two rate functions agree on compact sets at the boundary and in the interior both under strongly mixing conditions. Along the line we also indicate that under slightly more refined monotonicity conditions, there is a phase transition of the difference of two rate functions.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit for the cover time of the $\lambda$-biased random walk on a binary tree with $\lambda&lt;1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\lambda$-biased random walk on a binary tree of depth $n$ is the continuous-time Markov chain that has unit mean holding times and, when at a vertex other than the root or a leaf of the tree in question, has a probability of jumping to the parent vertex that is $\lambda$ times the probability of jumping to a particular child. (From the root, it chooses one of the two children with equal probability.) For this process, when $\lambda&lt;1$, we derive an $n\rightarrow \infty$ scaling limit for the cover time, that is, the time taken to visit every vertex. The distributional limit is described in terms of a jump process on a Cantor set that can be seen as the asymptotic boundary of the tree. This conclusion complements previous results obtained when $\lambda\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>It\^o formula for planarly branched rough paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The It\^o formula, originated by K. It\^o, is focus on the stochastic calculus, where many stochastic processes can be placed under the framework of rough paths. In rough path theory, It\^o formulas have been proved for rough paths with roughness $\frac{1}{3}&lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{2}$ and branched rough paths with roughness $0&lt; \alpha \leq 1$. Planarly branched rough paths contain more random processes than rough paths and branched rough paths. In the present paper, we prove the It\^o formula for planarly branched rough paths with roughness $\frac{1}{4}&lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Interacting Particle Langevin Algorithm for Maximum Marginal Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13429v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a class of interacting particle systems for implementing a maximum marginal likelihood estimation (MMLE) procedure to estimate the parameters of a latent variable model. We achieve this by formulating a continuous-time interacting particle system which can be seen as a Langevin diffusion over an extended state space of parameters and latent variables. In particular, we prove that the parameter marginal of the stationary measure of this diffusion has the form of a Gibbs measure where number of particles acts as the inverse temperature parameter in classical settings for global optimisation. Using a particular rescaling, we then prove geometric ergodicity of this system and bound the discretisation error in a manner that is uniform in time and does not increase with the number of particles. The discretisation results in an algorithm, termed Interacting Particle Langevin Algorithm (IPLA) which can be used for MMLE. We further prove nonasymptotic bounds for the optimisation error of our estimator in terms of key parameters of the problem, and also extend this result to the case of stochastic gradients covering practical scenarios. We provide numerical experiments to illustrate the empirical behaviour of our algorithm in the context of logistic regression with verifiable assumptions. Our setting provides a straightforward way to implement a diffusion-based optimisation routine compared to more classical approaches such as the Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithm, and allows for especially explicit nonasymptotic bounds.</description>

      <title>On the strong Feller property of the heat equation on quantum graphs with Kirchoff noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a so-called quantum graph with standard continuity and Kirchhoff vertex conditions where the Kirchhoff vertex condition is perturbed by Gaussian noise. We show that the quantum graph setting is very different from the classical one dimensional boundary noise setting, where the transition semigroup is known to be strong Feller, by giving examples and counterexamples to the strong Feller property. In particular, when the graph is a tree, and there is noise present in all but one of the boundary vertices, then the transition semigroup associated with the problem is strong Feller at any time $T&gt;0$. This turns out to be also a necessary condition for equilateral star graphs. We also comment on the existence and uniqueness of the invariant measure and the regularity of the solution.</description>

      <title>Learning Mixtures of Gaussians Using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new algorithm for learning mixtures of $k$ Gaussians (with identity covariance in $\mathbb{R}^n$) to TV error $\varepsilon$, with quasi-polynomial ($O(n^{\text{poly\,log}\left(\frac{n+k}{\varepsilon}\right)})$) time and sample complexity, under a minimum weight assumption. Our results extend to continuous mixtures of Gaussians where the mixing distribution is supported on a union of $k$ balls of constant radius. In particular, this applies to the case of Gaussian convolutions of distributions on low-dimensional manifolds, or more generally sets with small covering number, for which no sub-exponential algorithm was previously known. Unlike previous approaches, most of which are algebraic in nature, our approach is analytic and relies on the framework of diffusion models. Diffusion models are a modern paradigm for generative modeling, which typically rely on learning the score function (gradient log-pdf) along a process transforming a pure noise distribution, in our case a Gaussian, to the data distribution. Despite their dazzling performance in tasks such as image generation, there are few end-to-end theoretical guarantees that they can efficiently learn nontrivial families of distributions; we give some of the first such guarantees. We proceed by deriving higher-order Gaussian noise sensitivity bounds for the score functions for a Gaussian mixture to show that that they can be inductively learned using piecewise polynomial regression (up to poly-logarithmic degree), and combine this with known convergence results for diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic and Macroscopic Entropy Balance Equations in a Stochastic Dynamics and Its Deterministic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entropy, its production, and its change in a dynamical system can be understood from either a fully stochastic dynamic description or from a deterministic dynamics exhibiting chaotic behavior. By taking the former approach based on the general diffusion process with diffusion $\tfrac{1}{\alpha}{\bf D}(\bf x)$ and drift $\bf b(\bf x)$, where $\alpha$ represents the ``size parameter'' of a system, we show that there are two distinctly different entropy balance equations. One reads ${\rm d} S^{(\alpha)}/{\rm d} t = e^{(\alpha)}_p + Q^{(\alpha)}_{ex}$ for all $\alpha$. However, the leading $\alpha$-order, ``extensive'', terms of the entropy production rate $e^{(\alpha)}_p$ and heat exchange rate $Q^{(\alpha)}_{ex}$ are exactly cancelled. Therefore, in the asymptotic limit of $\alpha\to\infty$, there is a second, local ${\rm d} S/{\rm d} t = \nabla\cdot{\bf b}({\bf x}(t))+\left({\bf D}:{\bf \Sigma}^{-1}\right)({\bf x}(t))$ on the order of $O(1)$, where $\tfrac{1}{\alpha}{\bf D}(\bf x(t))$ represents the randomness generated in the dynamics usually represented by metric entropy, and $\tfrac{1}{\alpha}{\bf \Sigma}({\bf x}(t))$ is the covariance matrix of the local Gaussian description at ${\bf x}(t)$, which is a solution to the ordinary differential equation $\dot{\bf x}={\bf b}(\bf x)$ at time $t$. This latter equation is akin to the notions of volume-preserving conservative dynamics and entropy production in the deterministic dynamic approach to nonequilibrium thermodynamics {\it \`{a} la} D. Ruelle. As a continuation of [17], mathematical details with sufficient care are given in four Appendices.</description>
