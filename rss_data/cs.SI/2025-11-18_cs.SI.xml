      <title>Dynamic Graph Recommendation via Sparse Augmentation and Singular Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic recommendation, focusing on modeling user preference from historical interactions and providing recommendations on current time, plays a key role in many personalized services. Recent works show that pre-trained dynamic graph neural networks (GNNs) can achieve excellent performance. However, existing methods by fine-tuning node representations at large scales demand significant computational resources. Additionally, the long-tail distribution of degrees leads to insufficient representations for nodes with sparse interactions, posing challenges for efficient fine-tuning. To address these issues, we introduce GraphSASA, a novel method for efficient fine-tuning in dynamic recommendation systems. GraphSASA employs test-time augmentation by leveraging the similarity of node representation distributions during hierarchical graph aggregation, which enhances node representations. Then it applies singular value decomposition, freezing the original vector matrix while focusing fine-tuning on the derived singular value matrices, which reduces the parameter burden of fine-tuning and improves the fine-tuning adaptability. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale datasets.</description>

      <title>Quantifying and Minimizing Perception Gap in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media has transformed global communication, yet its network structure can systematically distort perceptions through effects like the majority illusion and echo chambers. We introduce the perception gap index, a graph-based measure that quantifies local-global opinion divergence, which can be viewed as a generalization of the majority illusion to continuous settings. Using techniques from spectral graph theory, we demonstrate that higher connectivity makes networks more resilient to perception distortion. Our analysis of stochastic block models, however, shows that pronounced community structure increases vulnerability. We also study the problem of minimizing the perception gap via link recommendation with a fixed budget. We prove that this problem does not admit a polynomial-time algorithm for any bounded approximation ratio, unless P = NP. However, we propose a collection of efficient heuristic methods that have been demonstrated to produce near-optimal solutions on real-world network data.</description>

      <title>Learning to Control Misinformation: a Closed-loop Approach for Misinformation Mitigation over Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern social networks rely on recommender systems that inadvertently amplify misinformation by prioritizing engagement over content veracity. We present a control framework that mitigates misinformation spread while maintaining user engagement by penalizing content characteristics commonly exploited by false information, specifically, extreme negative sentiment and novelty. We extend the closed-loop Friedkin-Johnsen model to incorporate the mitigation of misinformation together with the maximization of user engagement. Both model-free and model-based control strategies demonstrate up to 76% reduction in misinformation propagation across diverse network configurations, validated through simulations using the LIAR2 dataset with sentiment features extracted via large language models. Analysis of engagement-misinformation trade-offs reveals that in networks with radical users, median engagement improves even as misinformation decreases, suggesting content moderation enhances discourse quality for non-extremist users. The framework provides practical guidance for platform operators in balancing misinformation suppression with engagement objectives.</description>

      <title>Designed to Spread: Generative Approaches to Enhance Information Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media has fundamentally transformed how people access information and form social connections, with content expression playing a critical role in driving information diffusion. While prior research has focused largely on network structures and tipping point identification, it provides limited tools for automatically generating content tailored for virality within a specific audience. To fill this gap, we propose the novel task of DOCG and introduce an information enhancement algorithm for generating content optimized for diffusion. Our method includes an influence indicator that enables content-level diffusion assessment without requiring access to network topology, and an information editor that employs reinforcement learning to explore interpretable editing strategies. The editor leverages generative models to produce semantically faithful, audience-aware textual or visual content. Experiments on real-world social media datasets and user study demonstrate that our approach significantly improves diffusion effectiveness while preserving the core semantics of the original content.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the filter bubble? Developing a research agenda for the protective filter bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filter bubbles and echo chambers have received global attention from scholars, media organizations, and the general public. Filter bubbles have primarily been regarded as intrinsically negative, and many studies have sought to minimize their influence. The detrimental influence of filter bubbles is well-studied. Filter bubbles may, for example, create information silos, amplify misinformation, and promote hatred and extremism. However, comparatively few studies have considered the other side of the filter bubble; its protective benefits, particularly to marginalized communities and those living in countries with low levels of press freedom. Through a review of the literature on digital safe spaces and protective filter bubbles, this commentary suggests that there may be a need to rethink the filter bubble, and it proposes several areas for future research.</description>

      <title>Unifying points of interest taxonomies: mapping OpenStreetMap tags to the Foursquare category system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heterogeneity of Point of Interest (POI) taxonomies is a persistent challenge for the integration of urban datasets and the development of location-based services. OpenStreetMap (OSM) adopts a flexible, community-driven tagging system, while Foursquare (FS) relies on a curated hierarchical structure. Here we present an openly available benchmark and mapping framework that aligns OSM tags with the FS taxonomy. This resource integrates the richness of community-driven OSM data with the hierarchical structure of FS, enabling reproducible and interoperable urban analytics. The dataset is complemented by an evaluation of embedding and LLM-based alignment strategies and a pipeline that supports scalable updates as OSM evolves. Together, these elements provide both a robust reference resource and a practical tool for the community. Our approach is structured around three components: the construction of a manually curated benchmark as a gold standard, the evaluation of pretrained text embedding models for semantic alignment between OSM tags and FS categories, and an LLM-based refinement stage that enhances robustness and adaptability. The proposed methodology provides a scalable and reproducible solution for taxonomy unification, with direct applications to urban analytics, mobility studies, and smart city services.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Road Safety Through Multi-Camera Image Segmentation with Post-Encroachment Time Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic safety analysis at signalized intersections is vital for reducing vehicle and pedestrian collisions, yet traditional crash-based studies are limited by data sparsity and latency. This paper presents a novel multi-camera computer vision framework for real-time safety assessment through Post-Encroachment Time (PET) computation, demonstrated at the intersection of H Street and Broadway in Chula Vista, California. Four synchronized cameras provide continuous visual coverage, with each frame processed on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier devices using YOLOv11 segmentation for vehicle detection. Detected vehicle polygons are transformed into a unified bird's-eye map using homography matrices, enabling alignment across overlapping camera views. A novel pixel-level PET algorithm measures vehicle position without reliance on fixed cells, allowing fine-grained hazard visualization via dynamic heatmaps, accurate to 3.3 sq-cm. Timestamped vehicle and PET data is stored in an SQL database for long-term monitoring. Results over various time intervals demonstrate the framework's ability to identify high-risk regions with sub-second precision and real-time throughput on edge devices, producing data for an 800 x 800 pixel logarithmic heatmap at an average of 2.68 FPS. This study validates the feasibility of decentralized vision-based PET analysis for intelligent transportation systems, offering a replicable methodology for high-resolution, real-time, and scalable intersection safety evaluation.</description>

      <title>Task-Aware Retrieval Augmentation for Dynamic Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic recommendation systems aim to provide personalized suggestions by modeling temporal user-item interactions across time-series behavioral data. Recent studies have leveraged pre-trained dynamic graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn user-item representations over temporal snapshot graphs. However, fine-tuning GNNs on these graphs often results in generalization issues due to temporal discrepancies between pre-training and fine-tuning stages, limiting the model's ability to capture evolving user preferences. To address this, we propose TarDGR, a task-aware retrieval-augmented framework designed to enhance generalization capability by incorporating task-aware model and retrieval-augmentation. Specifically, TarDGR introduces a Task-Aware Evaluation Mechanism to identify semantically relevant historical subgraphs, enabling the construction of task-specific datasets without manual labeling. It also presents a Graph Transformer-based Task-Aware Model that integrates semantic and structural encodings to assess subgraph relevance. During inference, TarDGR retrieves and fuses task-aware subgraphs with the query subgraph, enriching its representation and mitigating temporal generalization issues. Experiments on multiple large-scale dynamic graph datasets demonstrate that TarDGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with extensive empirical evidence underscoring its superior accuracy and generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Tokenize Once, Recommend Anywhere: Unified Item Tokenization for Multi-domain LLM-based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based recommender systems have achieved high-quality performance by bridging the discrepancy between the item space and the language space through item tokenization. However, existing item tokenization methods typically require training separate models for each item domain, limiting generalization. Moreover, the diverse distributions and semantics across item domains make it difficult to construct a unified tokenization that preserves domain-specific information. To address these challenges, we propose UniTok, a Unified item Tokenization framework that integrates our own mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with a series of codebooks to convert items into discrete tokens, enabling scalable tokenization while preserving semantic information across multiple item domains. Specifically, items from different domains are first projected into a unified latent space through a shared encoder. They are then routed to domain-specific experts to capture the unique semantics, while a shared expert, which is always active, encodes common knowledge transferable across domains. Additionally, to mitigate semantic imbalance across domains, we present a mutual information calibration mechanism, which guides the model towards retaining similar levels of semantic information for each domain. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed UniTok framework is (a) highly effective: achieving up to 51.89% improvements over strong benchmarks, (b) theoretically sound: showing the analytical validity of our architectural design and optimization; and (c) highly generalizable: demonstrating robust performance across diverse domains without requiring per-domain retraining, a capability not supported by existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Seeding with Differentially Private Network Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16590v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In public health interventions such as distributing preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention, decision makers often use seeding algorithms to identify key individuals who can amplify intervention impact. However, building a complete sexual activity network is typically infeasible due to privacy concerns. Instead, contact tracing can provide influence samples, observed sequences of sexual contacts, without full network reconstruction. This raises two challenges: protecting individual privacy in these samples and adapting seeding algorithms to incomplete data. We study differential privacy guarantees for influence maximization when the input consists of randomly collected cascades. Building on recent advances in costly seeding, we propose privacy-preserving algorithms that introduce randomization in data or outputs and bound the privacy loss of each node. Theoretical analysis and simulations on synthetic and real-world sexual contact data show that performance degrades gracefully as privacy budgets tighten, with central privacy regimes achieving better trade-offs than local ones.</description>

      <title>QuanTaxo: A Quantum Approach to Self-Supervised Taxonomy Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A taxonomy is a hierarchical graph containing knowledge to provide valuable insights for various web applications. However, the manual construction of taxonomies requires significant human effort. As web content continues to expand at an unprecedented pace, existing taxonomies risk becoming outdated, struggling to incorporate new and emerging information effectively. As a consequence, there is a growing need for dynamic taxonomy expansion to keep them relevant and up-to-date. Existing taxonomy expansion methods often rely on classical word embeddings to represent entities. However, these embeddings fall short of capturing hierarchical polysemy, where an entity's meaning can vary based on its position in the hierarchy and its surrounding context. To address this challenge, we introduce QuanTaxo, a quantum-inspired framework for taxonomy expansion that encodes entities in a Hilbert space and models interference effects between them, yielding richer, context-sensitive representations. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets show that QuanTaxo significantly outperforms classical embedding models, achieving substantial improvements of 12.3% in accuracy, 11.2% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and 6.9% in Wu &amp; Palmer (Wu&amp;P) metrics across nine classical embedding-based baselines.</description>

      <title>Multilayer Artificial Benchmark for Community Detection (mABCD)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most persistent challenges in network science is the development of various synthetic graph models to support subsequent analyses. Among the most notable frameworks addressing this issue is the Artificial Benchmark for Community Detection (ABCD) model, a random graph model with community structure and power-law distribution for both degrees and community sizes. The model generates graphs similar to the well-known LFR model but it is faster, more interpretable, and can be investigated analytically. In this paper, we use the underlying ingredients of ABCD and introduce its variant, mABCD, thereby addressing the gap in models capable of generating multilayer networks. The uniqueness of the proposed approach lies in its flexibility at both levels of modelling: the internal structure of individual layers and the inter-layer dependencies, which together make the network a coherent structure rather than a collection of loosely coupled graphs. In addition to the conceptual description of the framework, we provide a comprehensive analysis of its efficient Julia implementation. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of mABCD to one of the most prominent problems in the area of complex systems: spreading phenomena analysis.</description>

      <title>HiLoMix: Robust High- and Low-Frequency Graph Learning Framework for Mixing Address Association</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As mixing services are increasingly being exploited by malicious actors for illicit transactions, mixing address association has emerged as a critical research task. A range of approaches have been explored, with graph-based models standing out for their ability to capture structural patterns in transaction networks. However, these approaches face two main challenges: label noise and label scarcity, leading to suboptimal performance and limited generalization. To address these, we propose HiLoMix, a graph-based learning framework specifically designed for mixing address association. First, we construct the Heterogeneous Attributed Mixing Interaction Graph (HAMIG) to enrich the topological structure. Second, we introduce frequency-aware graph contrastive learning that captures complementary structural signals from high- and low-frequency graph views. Third, we employ weak supervised learning that assigns confidence-based weighting to noisy labels. Then, we jointly train high-pass and low-pass GNNs using both unsupervised contrastive signals and confidence-based supervision to learn robust node representations. Finally, we adopt a stacking framework to fuse predictions from multiple heterogeneous models, further improving generalization and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that HiLoMix outperforms existing methods in mixing address association.</description>

      <title>Deep Clustering via Gradual Community Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep clustering is an essential task in modern artificial intelligence, aiming to partition a set of data samples into a given number of homogeneous groups (i.e., clusters). Recent studies have proposed increasingly advanced deep neural networks and training strategies for deep clustering, effectively improving performance. However, deep clustering generally remains challenging due to the inadequacy of supervision signals. Building upon the existing representation learning backbones, this paper proposes a novel clustering strategy of gradual community detection. It initializes clustering by partitioning samples into many pseudo-communities and then gradually expands clusters by community merging. Compared with the existing clustering strategies, community detection factors in the new perspective of cluster network analysis in the clustering process. The new perspective can effectively leverage global structural characteristics to enhance cluster pseudo-label purity, which is critical to the performance of self-supervision. We have implemented the proposed approach based on the popular backbones and evaluated its efficacy on benchmark image datasets. Our extensive experiments have shown that the proposed clustering strategy can effectively improve the SOTA performance. Our ablation study also demonstrates that the new network perspective can effectively improve community pseudo-label purity, resulting in improved self-supervision.</description>

Abstract: Traditional user profiling techniques rely on browsing history or purchase records to identify users' willingness to pay. This enables sellers to offer personalized prices to profiled users while charging only a uniform price to non-profiled users. However, the emergence of privacy-enhancing technologies has caused users to actively avoid on-site data tracking. Today, major online sellers have turned to public platforms such as online social networks to better track users' profiles from their product-related discussions. This paper presents the first analytical study on how users should best manage their social activities against potential personalized pricing, and how a seller should strategically adjust her pricing scheme to facilitate user profiling in social networks. We formulate a dynamic Bayesian game played between the seller and users under asymmetric information. The key challenge of analyzing this game comes from the double couplings between the seller and the users as well as among the users. Furthermore, the equilibrium analysis needs to ensure consistency between users' revealed information and the seller's belief under random user profiling. We address these challenges by alternately applying backward and forward induction, and successfully characterize the unique perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) in closed form. Our analysis reveals that as the accuracy of profiling technology improves, the seller tends to raise the equilibrium uniform price to motivate users' increased social activities and facilitate user profiling. However, this results in most users being worse off after the informed consent policy is imposed to ensure users' awareness of data access and profiling practices by potential sellers. This finding suggests that recent regulatory evolution towards enhancing users' privacy awareness may have unintended consequences of reducing users' payoffs.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Dyadic Barrier: Rethinking Fairness in Link Prediction Beyond Demographic Parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06568</link>

Abstract: Link prediction is a fundamental task in graph machine learning with applications, ranging from social recommendation to knowledge graph completion. Fairness in this setting is critical, as biased predictions can exacerbate societal inequalities. Prior work adopts a dyadic definition of fairness, enforcing fairness through demographic parity between intra-group and inter-group link predictions. However, we show that this dyadic framing can obscure underlying disparities across subgroups, allowing systemic biases to go undetected. Moreover, we argue that demographic parity does not meet desired properties for fairness assessment in ranking-based tasks such as link prediction. We formalize the limitations of existing fairness evaluations and propose a framework that enables a more expressive assessment. Additionally, we propose a lightweight post-processing method combined with decoupled link predictors that effectively mitigates bias and achieves state-of-the-art fairness-utility trade-offs.</description>
