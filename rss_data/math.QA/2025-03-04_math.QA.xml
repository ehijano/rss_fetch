      <title>Classification of states on certain orthomodular structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define various type of states on implicative involutive BE algebras (Jauch-Piron state, (P)-state, (B)-state, subadditive state, valuation), and we investigate the relationships between these states. Moreover, we introduce the unital, full and rich sets of states, and we prove certain properties involving these notions. In the case when an implicative involutive BE algebra possesses a rich or a full set of states, we prove that it is an implicative-orthomodular lattice. If an implicative involutive BE algebra possesses a rich set of (P)-states or a full set of valuations, then it is an implicative-Boolean algebra. Additionally, based on their deductive systems, we give characterizations of implicative-orthomodular lattices and implicative-Boolean algebras.</description>

      <title>Stated Skein Theory and Double Affine Hecke Algebra Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we explore the representation theory of double affine Hecke algebras (DAHAs) through the lens of stated skein theory. Over the past decade, there have been several works establishing robust connections between skein algebras and DAHAs. Particularly, Samuelson proved that a spherical subalgebra of the type $A_1$ DAHA can be realized as a quotient of the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of the torus with boundary, $K_q(T^2 \setminus D^2)$. Since the $A_1$ double affine Hecke algebra is Morita equivalent to its spherical subalgebra, discovering modules for $K_q(T^2 \setminus D^2)$ immediately provides us with modules for the $A_1$ DAHA.
  Stated skein theory enhances traditional Kauffman bracket skein theory by incorporating the boundary components of manifolds, thereby offering additional properties such as excision that enrich the algebraic structure. Furthermore, Kauffman bracket skein algebras embed into their stated counterparts, showing that stated skein algebras are extensions of Kauffman bracket skein algebras. We use this extended framework to further develop the representation theory of the $A_1$ DAHA.
  After identifying generators for the stated skein algebra of $T^2 \setminus D^2$, we embed this algebra into a quantum $6$-torus and leverage the nice representation-theoretic properties of quantum tori to construct a module of Laurent polynomials. Additionally, as $T^2$ is the boundary of any knot complement, we discuss how to construct a more topologically-defined module from various knots and provide an explicit example for the unknot. This approach builds upon the ideas of Berest and Samuelson, who showed that there exists a natural DAHA action on the Kauffman bracket skein module of knot complements.</description>

      <title>Path Subgoupoids of Weyl Groupoids, Rainbow Boomerang Graphs and Verma Modules for Nichols Algebras of Diagonal Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the exchange property of Weyl groupoids, as formulated by Heckenberger and Yamane, to a newly introduced class called path subgroupoids of Weyl groupoids. This extension provides a combinatorial interpretation of why the odd reflections of basic Lie superalgebras satisfy the exchange property, viewing it as a consequence of the underlying Weyl groupoid structure.
  Furthermore, we establish an analogous result within this framework for Nichols algebras of diagonal type, thereby generalizing our previous findings on homomorphisms between Verma modules with the same character but associated with different Borel subalgebras in the case of basic Lie superalgebras.</description>

      <title>Multispecies inhomogeneous $t$-PushTASEP from antisymmetric fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the recently introduced inhomogeneous $n$-species $t$-PushTASEP, a long-range stochastic process on a periodic lattice. A Baxter-type formula is established, expressing the Markov matrix as an alternating sum of commuting transfer matrices over all the fundamental representations of $U_t(\widehat{sl}_{n+1})$. This superposition acts as an inclusion-exclusion principle, selectively extracting the sequential particle transitions characteristic of the PushTASEP, while canceling forbidden channels. The homogeneous specialization connects the PushTASEP to ASEP, showing that the two models share eigenstates and a common integrability structure.</description>

      <title>Hormander-Mikhlin type theorem on non-commutative spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a Fourier-type formalism on non-commutative spaces. As a result, we obtain two versions of Hormander-Mikhlin Lp-multiplier theorem: on locally compact Kac groups and on semi-finite von Neumann algebras, respectively. In the simplest case our result coincides with a sharp version of the classical Hormander Lp-multiplier theorem, which was obtained by Grafakos and Slavikova in [11]. Finally, we present some applications to the evolution equation in non-commutative setting.</description>

      <title>Analogs of the lower and upper central series in skew braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skew brace is a ring-like and group-like algebraic structure that was introduced in the study of set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. In this paper, we shall give a survey on the left series, right series, socle series, and annihilator series of skew braces. They are analogs of the lower and upper central series of groups. Other than the well-known facts regarding these series, we shall also prove several new results about the relationship among their terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum metric structure arising from length functions on quantum groups and show that for coamenable quantum groups of Kac type, the quantum metric information is captured by the algebra of central functions. Using this, we provide the first examples of length functions on (genuine) quantum groups which give rise to compact quantum metric spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper works as an appendix of the paper titled Geometry of Associated Quantum Vector Bundles and the Quantum Gauge Group. Here, we are going to prove four statements in the theory of quantum principal bundles:: 1) The universal differential envelope $\ast$--calculus of a matrix (compact) Lie group, for the classical bicovariant $\ast$--First Order Differential Calculus, is the algebra of differential forms. 2) An example of a quantum principal bundle in which the space of base forms is not generated by the base space. 3) The group isomorphism between convolution-invertible maps and covariant left module isomorphisms at the level of differential calculus 4) The way the maps $\{T^V_k \}$ from Remark 3.1 look in differential geometry.</description>

      <title>Frobenius subalgebra lattices in tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines Frobenius subalgebra posets in abelian monoidal categories and shows that they form lattices under certain conditions, including all fusion categories. It then extends Watatani's theorem on the finiteness of intermediate subfactors, proving that these lattices are finite under specific positivity constraints, encompassing all pseudo-unitary fusion categories. The primary tools employed in this study are semisimplification and a concept of formal angle. Additionally, we have broadened several intermediate results, such as the exchange relation theorem and Landau's theorem, to apply to abelian monoidal categories.
  Key applications of our findings include a stronger version of the Ino-Watatani result: we show that the finiteness of intermediate C*-algebras holds in a finite-index unital irreducible inclusion of C*-algebras without requiring the simple assumption. Moreover, for a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H, we demonstrate that H* contains a finite number of Frobenius subalgebra objects in Rep(H). Finally, we explore a range of applications, including abstract spin chains, vertex operator algebras, and speculations on quantum arithmetic involving the generalization of Ore's theorem, Euler's totient and sigma functions, and RH.</description>

      <title>Unipotent quantum coordinate ring and cominuscule prefundamental representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of realization of the prefundamental modules $L_{r,a}^{\pm}$, introduced by Hernandez and Jimbo, in terms of unipotent quantum coordinate rings as in [J-Kwon-Park, Int. Math. Res. Not., 2023]. We show that the ordinary character of $L_{r,a}^{\pm}$ is equal to that of the unipotent quantum coordinate ring $U_q^-(w_r)$ associated to fundamental $r$-th coweight. When $r$ is cominuscule, we prove that there exists a $U_q(\mathfrak{b})$-module structure on $U_q^-(w_r)$, which is isomorphic to $L_{r,a\eta_r}^\pm$ for some $\eta_r \in \mathbb{C}^\times$.</description>

      <title>Transposes in the $q$-deformed modular group and their applications to $q$-deformed rational numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (right) \textit{q}-deformed rational numbers was originally introduced by Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko, and its left variant by Bapat, Becker and Licata. These notions are based on continued fractions and the \textit{q}-deformed modular group actions. For any matrix in this group, Leclere and Morier-Genoud showed that its trace is a palindromic polynomial whose coefficients are all non-negative (up to $\pm q^{N}$ times ). In this paper, we define the \textit{$q$-transpose} for matrices in this group. Using this, we give new proofs of the above result and some others. We also give arithmetic properties on the left \textit{q}-rational numbers. Finally, we show that the conjecture of Kantarc{\i} O\u{g}uz on circular fence posets implies a conjecture on the normalized Jones polynomials of rational links.</description>

      <title>Constructing equivalences between fusion categories of quantum groups and of vertex operator algebras via quantum gauge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explain the structure of proof of our results on a problem that Sergio Doplicher posed in the 90s in the setting of conformal nets, and on a related problem posed by Yi-Zhi Huang in the setting of vertex operator algebras. The latter asks to find a direct construction of an equivalence due to Finkelberg between the quantum group modular fusion category at certain roots of unity and the fusion categories of affine vertex operator algebras at positive integer levels. The former asks for the construction of a quantum gauge group and field algebra for the category of localized endomorphisms of a conformal net, extending Doplicher-Roberts theory of the compact gauge group and field algebra in high dimensional AQFT. We mostly focus on the affine VOA aspects. We solve Huang's problem for all the Lie types for which it is known that the centralizer algebra of the truncated tensor powers of the given generating object V listed by Hans Wenzl in 1998 for the quantum group fusion categories is generated by the representation of braid group associated to the R-matrix and for Huang-Lepowsky ribbon braided tensor structure. In the classical type A, this property becomes the classical Schur-Weyl duality and was used by Doplicher and Roberts to construct SU(d) as a special case of their unique compact gauge group and field algebra in algebraic QFT. Presently, known results in the literature allow to construct the full equivalence for the Lie types A, B, C, D, G_2 and partial equivalence for braiding and associativity morphisms in the Lie types E and F. We also solve a question posed by Frenkel and Zhu in 1992 on the quantum group structure on the Zhu algebra for all Lie types. Our main tool is the construction of a quantum gauge group and a Drinfeld twist method. The structures we find in both contexts extend Doplicher-Roberts symmetric functors which played a central role in their duality theory.</description>
