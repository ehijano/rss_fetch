      <title>Toward P != NP: An Observer-Theoretic Separation via SPDP Rank and a ZFC-Equivalent Foundation within the N-Frame Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a self-contained separation framework for P vs NP developed entirely within ZFC. The approach consists of: (i) a deterministic, radius-1 compilation from uniform polynomial-time Turing computation to local sum-of-squares (SoS) polynomials with polylogarithmic contextual entanglement width (CEW); (ii) a formal Width-to-Rank upper bound for the resulting SPDP matrices at matching parameters; (iii) an NP-side identity-minor lower bound in the same encoding; and (iv) a rank-monotone, instance-uniform extraction map from the compiled P-side polynomials to the NP family. Together these yield a contradiction under the assumption P = NP, establishing a separation.
  We develop a correspondence between CEW, viewed as a quantitative measure of computational contextuality, and SPDP rank, yielding a unified criterion for complexity separation. We prove that bounded-CEW observers correspond to polynomial-rank computations (the class P), while unbounded CEW characterizes the class NP. This implies that exponential SPDP rank for #3SAT and related hard families forces P != NP within the standard framework of complexity theory.
  Key technical components include: (1) constructive lower bounds on SPDP rank via Ramanujan-Tseitin expander families; (2) a non-circular reduction from Turing-machine computation to low-rank polynomial evaluation; (3) a codimension-collapse lemma ensuring that rank amplification cannot occur within polynomial resources; and (4) proofs of barrier immunity against relativization, natural proofs, and algebrization. The result is a complete ZFC proof architecture whose primitives and compositions are fully derived, with community verification and machine-checked formalization left as future work.</description>

      <title>Bounded Dynamic Level Maintenance for Efficient Logic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logic optimization constitutes a critical phase within the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) flow, essential for achieving desired circuit power, performance, and area (PPA) targets. These logic circuits are typically represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), where the structural depth, quantified by node level, critically correlates with timing performance. Modern optimization strategies frequently employ iterative, local transformation heuristics (\emph{e.g.,} \emph{rewrite}, \emph{refactor}) directly on this DAG structure. As optimization continuously modifies the graph locally, node levels require frequent dynamic updates to guide subsequent decisions. However, a significant gap exists: existing algorithms for incrementally updating node levels are unbounded to small changes. This leads to a total of worst complexity in $O(|V|^2)$ for given local subgraphs $\{\Delta G_i\}_{i=1}^{|V|}$ updates on DAG $G(V,E)$. This unbounded nature poses a severe efficiency bottleneck, hindering the scalability of optimization flows, particularly when applied to large circuit designs prevalent today. In this paper, we analyze the dynamic level maintenance problem endemic to iterative logic optimization, framing it through the lens of partial topological order. Building upon the analysis, we present the first bounded algorithm for maintaining level constraints, with $O(|V| \Delta \log \Delta)$ time for a sequence $|V|$ of updates $\{\Delta G_i\}$, where $\Delta = \max_i \|\Delta G_i\|$ denotes the maximum extended size of $\Delta G_i$. Experiments on comprehensive benchmarks show our algorithm enables an average 6.4$\times$ overall speedup relative to \rw and \rf, driven by a 1074.8$\times$ speedup in the level maintenance, all without any quality sacrifice.</description>

      <title>3-Query RLDCs are Strictly Stronger than 3-Query LDCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct $3$-query relaxed locally decodable codes (RLDCs) with constant alphabet size and length $\tilde{O}(k^2)$ for $k$-bit messages. Combined with the lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(k^3)$ of [Alrabiah, Guruswami, Kothari, Manohar, STOC 2023] on the length of locally decodable codes (LDCs) with the same parameters, we obtain a separation between RLDCs and LDCs, resolving an open problem of [Ben-Sasson, Goldreich, Harsha, Sudan and Vadhan, SICOMP 2006].
  Our RLDC construction relies on two components. First, we give a new construction of probabilistically checkable proofs of proximity (PCPPs) with $3$ queries, quasi-linear size, constant alphabet size, perfect completeness, and small soundness error. This improves upon all previous PCPP constructions, which either had a much higher query complexity or soundness close to $1$. Second, we give a query-preserving transformation from PCPPs to RLDCs.
  At the heart of our PCPP construction is a $2$-query decodable PCP (dPCP) with matching parameters, and our construction builds on the HDX-based PCP of [Bafna, Minzer, Vyas, Yun, STOC 2025] and on the efficient composition framework of [Moshkovitz, Raz, JACM 2010] and [Dinur, Harsha, SICOMP 2013]. More specifically, we first show how to use the HDX-based construction to get a dPCP with matching parameters but a large alphabet size, and then prove an appropriate composition theorem (and related transformations) to reduce the alphabet size in dPCPs.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism Indistinguishability, Multiplicity Automata Equivalence, and Polynomial Identity Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two graphs $G$ and $H$ are homomorphism indistinguishable over a graph class $\mathcal{F}$ if they admit the same number of homomorphisms from every graph $F \in \mathcal{F}$. Many graph isomorphism relaxations such as (quantum) isomorphism and cospectrality can be characterised as homomorphism indistinguishability over specific graph classes. Thereby, the problems $\textrm{HomInd}(\mathcal{F})$ of deciding homomorphism indistinguishability over $\mathcal{F}$ subsume diverse graph isomorphism relaxations whose complexities range from logspace to undecidable. Establishing the first general result on the complexity of $\textrm{HomInd}(\mathcal{F})$, Seppelt (MFCS 2024) showed that $\textrm{HomInd}(\mathcal{F})$ is in randomised polynomial time for every graph class $\mathcal{F}$ of bounded treewidth that can be defined in counting monadic second-order logic $\mathsf{CMSO}_2$.
  We show that this algorithm is conditionally optimal, i.e. it cannot be derandomised unless polynomial identity testing is in $\mathsf{PTIME}$. For $\mathsf{CMSO}_2$-definable graph classes $\mathcal{F}$ of bounded pathwidth, we improve the previous complexity upper bound for $\textrm{HomInd}(\mathcal{F})$ from $\mathsf{PTIME}$ to $\mathsf{C}_=\mathsf{L}$ and show that this is tight. Secondarily, we establish a connection between homomorphism indistinguishability and multiplicity automata equivalence which allows us to pinpoint the complexity of the latter problem as $\mathsf{C}_=\mathsf{L}$-complete.</description>

      <title>A Distance Amplification Lemma for Monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a procedure that, given oracle access to a function $f\colon \{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$, produces oracle access to a function $f'\colon \{0,1\}^{n'}\to\{0,1\}$ such that if $f$ is monotone, then $f'$ is monotone, and if $f$ is $\varepsilon$-far from monotone, then $f'$ is $\Omega(1)$-far from monotone. Moreover, $n' \leq n 2^{O(1/\varepsilon)}$ and each oracle query to $f'$ can be answered by making $2^{O(1/\varepsilon)}$ oracle queries to $f$.
  Our lemma is motivated by a recent result of [Chen, Chen, Cui, Pires, Stockwell, arXiv:2511.04558], who showed that for all $c&gt;0$ there exists $\varepsilon_c&gt;0$, such that any (even two-sided, adaptive) algorithm distinguishing between monotone functions and $\varepsilon_c$-far from monotone functions, requires $\Omega(n^{1/2-c})$ queries. Combining our lemma with their result implies a similar result, except that the distance from monotonicity is an absolute constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and the lower bound is $\Omega(n^{1/2-o(1)})$ queries.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuits for permutation matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two different algorithms are presented for generating a quantum circuit realization of a matrix representing a permutation on $2^n$ letters. All circuits involve $n$ qubits and only use multi--controlled Toffoli gates. The first algorithm constructs a circuit from any decomposition of the permutation into a product of transpositions, but uses one ancilla line. The second, which uses no ancillae, constructs a circuit from a decomposition into a product of transpositions that have a Hamming distance of one. We show that any permutation admits such a decomposition, and we give a strategy for reducing the number of transpositions involved.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Error Mitigation with Neighbor-Informed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise in quantum hardware is the primary obstacle to realizing the transformative potential of quantum computing. Quantum error mitigation (QEM) offers a promising pathway to enhance computational accuracy on near-term devices, yet existing methods face a difficult trade-off between performance, resource overhead, and theoretical guarantees. In this work, we introduce neighbor-informed learning (NIL), a versatile and scalable QEM framework that unifies and strengthens existing methods such as zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) and probabilistic error cancellation (PEC), while offering improved flexibility, accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.
  NIL learns to predict the ideal output of a target quantum circuit from the noisy outputs of its structurally related ``neighbor'' circuits. A key innovation is our 2-design training method, which generates training data for our machine learning model. In contrast to conventional learning-based QEM protocols that create training circuits by replacing non-Clifford gates with uniformly random Clifford gates, our approach achieves higher accuracy and efficiency, as demonstrated by both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. Furthermore, we prove that the required size of the training set scales only \emph{logarithmically} with the total number of neighbor circuits, enabling NIL to be applied to problems involving large-scale quantum circuits. Our work establishes a theoretically grounded and practically efficient framework for QEM, paving a viable path toward achieving quantum advantage on noisy hardware.</description>

      <title>Kernelization dichotomies for hitting minors under structural parameterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a finite collection of connected graphs $\mathcal{F}$, the $\mathcal{F}$-MINOR-DELETION problem consists in, given a graph $G$ and an integer $\ell$, deciding whether $G$ contains a vertex set of size at most $\ell$ whose removal results in an $\mathcal{F}$-minor-free graph. We lift the existence of (approximate) polynomial kernels for $\mathcal{F}$-MINOR-DELETION by the solution size to (approximate) polynomial kernels parameterized by the vertex-deletion distance to graphs of bounded elimination distance to $\mathcal{F}$-minor-free graphs. This results in exact polynomial kernels for every family $\mathcal{F}$ that contains a planar graph, and an approximate polynomial kernel for PLANAR VERTEX DELETION. Moreover, combining our result with a previous lower bound, we obtain the following infinite set of dichotomies, assuming $NP \not\subseteq coNP/poly$: for any finite set $\mathcal{F}$ of biconnected graphs on at least three vertices containing a planar graph, and any minor-closed class of graphs $\mathcal{C}$, $\mathcal{F}$-MINOR-DELETION admits a polynomial kernel parameterized by the vertex-deletion distance to $\mathcal{C}$ if and only if $\mathcal{C}$ has bounded elimination distance to $\mathcal{F}$-minor-free graphs. For instance, this yields dichotomies for CACTUS VERTEX DELETION, OUTERPLANAR VERTEX DELETION, and TREEWIDTH-$t$ VERTEX DELETION for every integer $t \geq 0$. Prior to our work, such dichotomies were only known for the particular cases of VERTEX COVER and FEEDBACK VERTEX SET. Our approach builds on the techniques developed by Jansen and Pieterse [Theor. Comput. Sci. 2020] and also uses adaptations of some of the results by Jansen, de Kroon, and Wlodarczyk [STOC 2021].</description>

      <title>Fair Coordination in Strategic Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a scheduling problem of strategic agents representing jobs of different weights. Each agent has to decide on one of a finite set of identical machines to get their job processed. In contrast to the common and exclusive focus on makespan minimization, we want the outcome to be fair under strategic considerations of the agents. Two natural properties are credibility, which ensures that the assignment is a Nash equilibrium and equality, requiring that agents with equal-weight jobs are assigned to machines of equal load. We combine these two with a hierarchy of fairness properties based on envy-freeness together with several relaxations based on the idea that envy seems more justified towards agents with a higher weight. We present a complete complexity landscape for satisfiability and decision versions of these properties, alone or in combination, and study them as structural constraints under makespan optimization. For our positive results, we develop a unified algorithmic approach, where we achieve different properties by fine-tuning key subroutines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study "space efficient" FPT algorithms for graph problems with limited memory. Let n be the size of the input graph and k be the parameter. We present algorithms that run in time f(k)*poly(n) and use g(k)*polylog(n) working space, where f and g are functions of k alone, for k-Path, MaxLeaf SubTree and Multicut in Trees. These algorithms are motivated by big-data settings where very large problem instances must be solved, and using poly(n) memory is prohibitively expensive. They are also theoretically interesting, since most of the standard methods tools, such as deleting a large set of vertices or edges, are unavailable, and we must a develop different way to tackle them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonuniform families of polynomial-size finite automata and pushdown automata respectively have strong connections to nonuniform-NL and nonuniform-LOGCFL. We examine the behaviors of unambiguous and co-nondeterministic computations produced by such families of automata operating multiple counters, where a counter is a stack using only a single non-bottom symbol. As immediate consequences, we obtain various collapses of the complexity classes of families of promise problems solvable by finite and pushdown automata families when all valid instances are limited to either polynomially long strings or unary strings. A key technical ingredient of our proofs is an inductive counting of reachable vertices of each computation graph of finite and pushdown automata that operate multiple counters simultaneously.</description>

      <title>A Parameterized Study of Secluded Structures in Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an undirected graph $G$ and an integer $k$, the Secluded $\Pi$-Subgraph problem asks you to find a maximum size induced subgraph that satisfies a property $\Pi$ and has at most $k$ neighbors in the rest of the graph. This problem has been extensively studied; however, there is no prior study of the problem in directed graphs. This question has been mentioned by Jansen et al. [ISAAC'23].
  In this paper, we initiate the study of Secluded Subgraph problem in directed graphs by incorporating different notions of neighborhoods: in-neighborhood, out-neighborhood, and their union. Formally, we call these problems $\{\text{In}, \text{Out}, \text{Total}\}$-Secluded $\Pi$-Subgraph, where given a directed graph $G$ and integers $k$, we want to find an induced subgraph satisfying $\Pi$ of maximum size that has at most $k$ in/out/total-neighbors in the rest of the graph, respectively. We investigate the parameterized complexity of these problems for different properties $\Pi$. In particular, we prove the following parameterized results: - We design an FPT algorithm for the Total-Secluded Strongly Connected Subgraph problem when parameterized by $k$.
  - We show that the In/Out-Secluded $\mathcal{F}$-Free Subgraph problem with parameter $k+w$ is W[1]-hard, where $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of directed graphs except any subgraph of a star graph whose edges are directed towards the center. This result also implies that In/Out-Secluded DAG is W[1]-hard, unlike the undirected variants of the two problems, which are FPT.
  - We design an FPT-algorithm for In/Out/Total-Secluded $\alpha$-Bounded Subgraph when parameterized by $k$, where $\alpha$-bounded graphs are a superclass of tournaments.
  - For undirected graphs, we improve the best-known FPT algorithm for Secluded Clique by providing a faster FPT algorithm that runs in time $1.6181^kn^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$.</description>

Abstract: A language L is low for a relativizable complexity class C, if C$^L$ = C. For the classes #P, GapP, and SpanP the exact low classes of languages are known: Low(#P) = UP $\cap$ coUP, Low(GapP) = SPP, and Low(SpanP) = NP $\cap$ coNP. In this paper, we prove that Low(TotP) = P, and give characterizations of low function classes for #P, GapP, TotP, and SpanP. In particular, we prove that Low$_f$(#P) = UPSV$_t$ and Low$_f$(SpanP) = NPSV$_t$. We establish the inclusion relations between NPSV$_t$, UPSV$_t$, and the counting function classes by giving for each of these inclusions an equivalent inclusion between language classes. We also prove that SpanP $\subseteq$ GapP if and only if NP $\subseteq$ SPP, and the inclusion GapP$_+$ $\subseteq$ SpanP implies PH = $\Sigma_{2}^{P}$. For the class #P we prove that its closure under left composition with FP$_+$ is equivalent to #P = UPSV$_t$, and for SpanP this closure is equivalent to SpanP = NPSV$_t$. For the classes #P, GapP, TotP, and SpanP we summarize the known results and show that each of these classes is closed under left composition with FP$_+$ if and only if it collapses to its low class of functions. We also prove that a NPTM with a #P oracle can always make at most one query to the oracle without changing the number of accepting paths.</description>

      <title>The Optimal Approximation Factor in Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.05876v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the following problem: given two arbitrary densities $q_1,q_2$ and a sample-access to an unknown target density $p$, find which of the $q_i$'s is closer to $p$ in total variation.
  A remarkable result due to Yatracos shows that this problem is tractable in the following sense: there exists an algorithm that uses $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples from $p$ and outputs~$q_i$ such that with high probability, $TV(q_i,p) \leq 3\cdot\mathsf{opt} + \epsilon$, where $\mathsf{opt}= \min\{TV(q_1,p),TV(q_2,p)\}$. Moreover, this result extends to any finite class of densities $\mathcal{Q}$: there exists an algorithm that outputs the best density in $\mathcal{Q}$ up to a multiplicative approximation factor of 3.
  We complement and extend this result by showing that: (i) the factor 3 can not be improved if one restricts the algorithm to output a density from $\mathcal{Q}$, and (ii) if one allows the algorithm to output arbitrary densities (e.g.\ a mixture of densities from $\mathcal{Q}$), then the approximation factor can be reduced to 2, which is optimal. In particular this demonstrates an advantage of improper learning over proper in this setup.
  We develop two approaches to achieve the optimal approximation factor of 2: an adaptive one and a static one. Both approaches are based on a geometric point of view of the problem and rely on estimating surrogate metrics to the total variation. Our sample complexity bounds exploit techniques from {\it Adaptive Data Analysis}.</description>

      <title>Finding One Local Optimum Is Easy -- but What About Two?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07524v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The class PLS (Polynomial Local Search) captures the complexity of finding a solution that is locally optimal and has proven to be an important concept in the theory of local search. It has been shown that local search versions of various combinatorial optimization problems, such as Maximum Independent Set and Max Cut, are complete for this class. Such computational intractability typically arises in local search problems allowing arbitrary weights; in contrast, for unweighted problems, locally optimal solutions can be found in polynomial time under standard settings. In this paper, we pursue the complexity of local search problems from a different angle: We show that computing two locally optimal solutions is NP-hard for various natural unweighted local search problems, including Maximum Independent Set, Minimum Dominating Set, Max SAT, and Max Cut. We also discuss several tractable cases for finding two (or more) local optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>Solvability Complexity Index Classification For Koopman Operator Spectra In $L^p$ For $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the computation of the approximate point spectrum and the approximate point $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum of bounded Koopman operators acting on $L^p(\mathcal{X},\omega)$ for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and a compact metric space $(\mathcal{X}, d_{\mathcal{X}})$ with finite Borel measure $\omega$. Building on finite sections in a computable unconditional Schauder basis of $L^p(\mathcal{X},\omega)$, we design residual tests that use only finitely many evaluations of the underlying map and produce compact sets on a planar grid, that converge in the Hausdorff metric to the target spectral sets, without spectral pollution. From these constructions we obtain a complete classification, in the sense of the Solvability Complexity Index. Also we analyze the sufficiency and existence of a Wold-von Neumann decomposition analog, that was used in the special $L^2$-case.
  The main difficulty in extending from the already analyzed Hilbert setting $(p=2)$ to general $L^p$ is the loss of orthogonality and Hilbertian structure: there is no orthonormal basis with orthogonal coordinate projections in general, the canonical truncations $E_n$ in a computable Schauder dictionary need not be contractive (and may oscillate) and the Wold-von Neumann reduction has no directly computable analog in $L^p$. We overcome these obstacles by working with computable unconditional dictionaries adapted to dyadic/Lipschitz filtrations and proving stability of residual tests under non-orthogonal truncations.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Barrier in Uniform Class Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a strong structural obstruction to Uniform Separation in constructive arithmetic. The mechanism is independent of semantic content; it emerges whenever two distinct evaluator predicates are sustained in parallel and inference remains uniformly representable in an extension of HA. Under these conditions, any putative Uniform Class Separation principle becomes a distinguished instance of a fixed point construction. The resulting limitation is stricter in scope than classical separation barriers (Baker; Rudich; Aaronson et al.) insofar as it constrains the logical form of uniform separation within HA, rather than limiting particular relativizing, naturalizing, or algebrizing techniques.</description>
