      <title>Learning Speech Representations with Variational Predictive Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being the best known objective for learning speech representations, the HuBERT objective has not been further developed and improved. We argue that it is the lack of an underlying principle that stalls the development, and, in this paper, we show that predictive coding under a variational view is the principle behind the HuBERT objective. Due to its generality, our formulation provides opportunities to improve parameterization and optimization, and we show two simple modifications that bring immediate improvements to the HuBERT objective. In addition, the predictive coding formulation has tight connections to various other objectives, such as APC, CPC, wav2vec, and BEST-RQ. Empirically, the improvement in pre-training brings significant improvements to four downstream tasks: phone classification, f0 tracking, speaker recognition, and automatic speech recognition, highlighting the importance of the predictive coding interpretation.</description>

      <title>Neural Brain Fields: A NeRF-Inspired Approach for Generating Nonexistent EEG Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) data present unique modeling challenges because recordings vary in length, exhibit very low signal to noise ratios, differ significantly across participants, drift over time within sessions, and are rarely available in large and clean datasets. Consequently, developing deep learning methods that can effectively process EEG signals remains an open and important research problem. To tackle this problem, this work presents a new method inspired by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). In computer vision, NeRF techniques train a neural network to memorize the appearance of a 3D scene and then uses its learned parameters to render and edit the scene from any viewpoint. We draw an analogy between the discrete images captured from different viewpoints used to learn a continuous 3D scene in NeRF, and EEG electrodes positioned at different locations on the scalp, which are used to infer the underlying representation of continuous neural activity. Building on this connection, we show that a neural network can be trained on a single EEG sample in a NeRF style manner to produce a fixed size and informative weight vector that encodes the entire signal. Moreover, via this representation we can render the EEG signal at previously unseen time steps and spatial electrode positions. We demonstrate that this approach enables continuous visualization of brain activity at any desired resolution, including ultra high resolution, and reconstruction of raw EEG signals. Finally, our empirical analysis shows that this method can effectively simulate nonexistent electrodes data in EEG recordings, allowing the reconstructed signal to be fed into standard EEG processing networks to improve performance.</description>

      <title>IKFST: IOO and KOO Algorithms for Accelerated and Precise WFST-based End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition has become the dominant paradigm in both academia and industry. To enhance recognition performance, the Weighted Finite-State Transducer (WFST) is widely adopted to integrate acoustic and language models through static graph composition, providing robust decoding and effective error correction. However, WFST decoding relies on a frame-by-frame autoregressive search over CTC posterior probabilities, which severely limits inference efficiency. Motivated by establishing a more principled compatibility between WFST decoding and CTC modeling, we systematically study the two fundamental components of CTC outputs, namely blank and non-blank frames, and identify a key insight: blank frames primarily encode positional information, while non-blank frames carry semantic content. Building on this observation, we introduce Keep-Only-One and Insert-Only-One, two decoding algorithms that explicitly exploit the structural roles of blank and non-blank frames to achieve significantly faster WFST-based inference without compromising recognition accuracy. Experiments on large-scale in-house, AISHELL-1, and LibriSpeech datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art recognition accuracy with substantially reduced decoding latency, enabling truly efficient and high-performance WFST decoding in modern speech recognition systems.</description>

      <title>Latent Flow Matching for Expressive Singing Voice Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE)-based singing voice synthesis provides efficient inference and strong audio quality by learning a score-conditioned prior and a recording-conditioned posterior latent space. However, because synthesis relies on prior samples while training uses posterior latents inferred from real recordings, imperfect distribution matching can cause a prior-posterior mismatch that degrades fine-grained expressiveness such as vibrato and micro-prosody. We propose FM-Singer, which introduces conditional flow matching (CFM) in latent space to learn a continuous vector field transporting prior latents toward posterior latents along an optimal-transport-inspired path. At inference time, the learned latent flow refines a prior sample by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) before waveform generation, improving expressiveness while preserving the efficiency of parallel decoding. Experiments on Korean and Chinese singing datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, including lower mel-cepstral distortion and fundamental-frequency error and higher perceptual scores on the Korean dataset. Code, pretrained checkpoints, and audio demos are available at https://github.com/alsgur9368/FM-Singer</description>

      <title>MR-DAW: Towards Collaborative Digital Audio Workstations in Mixed Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) are central to modern music production but often encumber the musician's workflow, tethering them to a desk and hindering natural interaction with their instrument. Furthermore, effective remote collaboration remains a significant challenge, with existing solutions hampered by network latency and asynchronous file sharing. This paper investigates the potential of Mixed Reality (MR) to overcome these barriers, creating an intuitive environment for real-time, remote musical collaboration. We employ qualitative and speculative design techniques to better understand: 1) how players currently use DAWs, and 2) to imagine a speculative future of collaborative MR-DAWs. To facilitate this discussion, we developed and evaluated the usability of a design probe, MR-DAW. An MR system enabling multiple, geographically dispersed users to control a single, shared DAW instance while moving freely in their local spaces. Our networked system enables each remote musician to use a physical foot pedal for collaborative looping, merging a familiar, hands-free interaction with a shared virtual session. Based on interviews and system evaluations with 20 musicians, we analyze current practices, report on the user experience with our MR system, and speculate on the future of musical collaboration in MR. Our results highlight the affordances of MR for unencumbered musical interaction and provide a speculative outlook on the future of remote collaborative DAWs in the Musical Metaverse.</description>

      <title>A Language-Agnostic Hierarchical LoRA-MoE Architecture for CTC-based Multilingual ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale multilingual ASR (mASR) models such as Whisper achieve strong performance but incur high computational and latency costs, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. In this study, we propose a lightweight and language-agnostic multilingual ASR system based on a CTC architecture with domain adaptation. Specifically, we introduce a Language-agnostic Hierarchical LoRA-MoE (HLoRA) framework integrated into an mHuBERT-CTC model, enabling end-to-end decoding via LID-posterior-driven LoRA routing. The hierarchical design consists of a multilingual shared LoRA for learning language-invariant acoustic representations and language-specific LoRA experts for modeling language-dependent characteristics. The proposed routing mechanism removes the need for prior language identity information or explicit language labels during inference, achieving true language-agnostic decoding. Experiments on MSR-86K and the MLC-SLM 2025 Challenge datasets demonstrate that HLoRA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art two-stage inference methods using only single-pass decoding, significantly improving decoding efficiency for low-resource mASR applications.</description>
