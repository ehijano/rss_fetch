      <title>Blockchain-Based Decentralized Domain Name System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure faces critical vulnerabilities including poisoning attacks, censorship mechanisms, and centralized points of failure that compromise internet freedom and security. Recent incidents such as DNS poisoning attacks on ISP customers highlight the urgent need for resilient alternatives. This paper presents a novel blockchain-based Decentralized Domain Name System (DDNS). We designed a specialized Proof-of-Work blockchain to maximize support for DNS-related protocols and achieve node decentralization. The system integrates our blockchain with IPFS for distributed storage, implements cryptographic primitives for end-to-end trust signatures, and achieves Never Trust, Always Verify zero-trust verification. Our implementation achieves 15-second domain record propagation times, supports 20 standard DNS record types, and provides perpetual free .ddns domains. The system has been deployed across distributed infrastructure in San Jose, Los Angeles, and Orange County, demonstrating practical scalability and resistance to traditional DNS manipulation techniques. Performance evaluation shows the system can handle up to Max Theor. TPS 1,111.1 tx/s (minimal transactions) and Max Theor. TPS 266.7 tx/s (regular transactions) for domain operations while maintaining sub-second query resolution through intelligent caching mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Universally Unfiltered and Unseen:Input-Agnostic Multimodal Jailbreaks against Text-to-Image Model Safeguards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05658v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various (text) prompt filters and (image) safety checkers have been implemented to mitigate the misuse of Text-to-Image (T2I) models in creating Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. In order to expose potential security vulnerabilities of such safeguards, multimodal jailbreaks have been studied. However, existing jailbreaks are limited to prompt-specific and image-specific perturbations, which suffer from poor scalability and time-consuming optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Universally Unfiltered and Unseen (U3)-Attack, a multimodal jailbreak attack method against T2I safeguards. Specifically, U3-Attack optimizes an adversarial patch on the image background to universally bypass safety checkers and optimizes a safe paraphrase set from a sensitive word to universally bypass prompt filters while eliminating redundant computations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our U3-Attack on both open-source and commercial T2I models. For example, on the commercial Runway-inpainting model with both prompt filter and safety checker, our U3-Attack achieves $~4\times$ higher success rates than the state-of-the-art multimodal jailbreak attack, MMA-Diffusion.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs effectively provide game-theoretic-based scenarios for cybersecurity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Game theory has long served as a foundational tool in cybersecurity to test, predict, and design strategic interactions between attackers and defenders. The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers new tools and challenges for the security of computer systems; In this work, we investigate whether classical game-theoretic frameworks can effectively capture the behaviours of LLM-driven actors and bots. Using a reproducible framework for game-theoretic LLM agents, we investigate two canonical scenarios -- the one-shot zero-sum game and the dynamic Prisoner's Dilemma -- and we test whether LLMs converge to expected outcomes or exhibit deviations due to embedded biases. Our experiments involve four state-of-the-art LLMs and span five natural languages, English, French, Arabic, Vietnamese, and Mandarin Chinese, to assess linguistic sensitivity. For both games, we observe that the final payoffs are influenced by agents characteristics such as personality traits or knowledge of repeated rounds. Moreover, we uncover an unexpected sensitivity of the final payoffs to the choice of languages, which should warn against indiscriminate application of LLMs in cybersecurity applications and call for in-depth studies, as LLMs may behave differently when deployed in different countries. We also employ quantitative metrics to evaluate the internal consistency and cross-language stability of LLM agents, to help guide the selection of the most stable LLMs and optimising models for secure applications.</description>

      <title>DINA: A Dual Defense Framework Against Internal Noise and External Attacks in Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and generative AI become increasingly integrated into customer service and moderation applications, adversarial threats emerge from both external manipulations and internal label corruption. In this work, we identify and systematically address these dual adversarial threats by introducing DINA (Dual Defense Against Internal Noise and Adversarial Attacks), a novel unified framework tailored specifically for NLP. Our approach adapts advanced noisy-label learning methods from computer vision and integrates them with adversarial training to simultaneously mitigate internal label sabotage and external adversarial perturbations. Extensive experiments conducted on a real-world dataset from an online gaming service demonstrate that DINA significantly improves model robustness and accuracy compared to baseline models. Our findings not only highlight the critical necessity of dual-threat defenses but also offer practical strategies for safeguarding NLP systems in realistic adversarial scenarios, underscoring broader implications for fair and responsible AI deployment.</description>

      <title>Towards Effective Offensive Security LLM Agents: Hyperparameter Tuning, LLM as a Judge, and a Lightweight CTF Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in LLM agentic systems have improved the automation of offensive security tasks, particularly for Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges. We systematically investigate the key factors that drive agent success and provide a detailed recipe for building effective LLM-based offensive security agents. First, we present CTFJudge, a framework leveraging LLM as a judge to analyze agent trajectories and provide granular evaluation across CTF solving steps. Second, we propose a novel metric, CTF Competency Index (CCI) for partial correctness, revealing how closely agent solutions align with human-crafted gold standards. Third, we examine how LLM hyperparameters, namely temperature, top-p, and maximum token length, influence agent performance and automated cybersecurity task planning. For rapid evaluation, we present CTFTiny, a curated benchmark of 50 representative CTF challenges across binary exploitation, web, reverse engineering, forensics, and cryptography. Our findings identify optimal multi-agent coordination settings and lay the groundwork for future LLM agent research in cybersecurity. We make CTFTiny open source to public https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/CTFTiny along with CTFJudge on https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/CTFJudge.</description>

      <title>Principle-Guided Verilog Optimization: IP-Safe Knowledge Transfer via Local-Cloud Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed growing interest in adopting large language models (LLMs) for Register Transfer Level (RTL) code optimization. While powerful cloud-based LLMs offer superior optimization capabilities, they pose unacceptable intellectual property (IP) leakage risks when processing proprietary hardware designs. In this paper, we propose a new scenario where Verilog code must be optimized for specific attributes without leaking sensitive IP information. We introduce the first IP-preserving edge-cloud collaborative framework that leverages the benefits of both paradigms. Our approach employs local small LLMs (e.g., Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B) to perform secure comparative analysis between paired high-quality target designs and novice draft codes, yielding general design principles that summarize key insights for improvements. These principles are then used to query stronger cloud LLMs (e.g., Deepseek-V3) for targeted code improvement, ensuring that only abstracted and IP-safe guidance reaches external services. Our experimental results demonstrate that the framework achieves significantly higher optimization success rates compared to baseline methods. For example, combining Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B and Deepseek-V3 achieves a 66.67\% optimization success rate for power utilization, outperforming Deepseek-V3 alone (49.81\%) and even commercial models like GPT-4o (55.81\%). Further investigation of local and cloud LLM combinations reveals that different model pairings exhibit varying strengths for specific optimization objectives, with interesting trends emerging when varying the number of comparative code pairs. Our work establishes a new paradigm for secure hardware design optimization that balances performance gains with IP protection.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Attacks on Reinforcement Learning-based Medical Questionnaire Systems: Input-level Perturbation Strategies and Medical Constraint Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RL-based medical questionnaire systems have shown great potential in medical scenarios. However, their safety and robustness remain unresolved. This study performs a comprehensive evaluation on adversarial attack methods to identify and analyze their potential vulnerabilities. We formulate the diagnosis process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the state is the patient responses and unasked questions, and the action is either to ask a question or to make a diagnosis. We implemented six prevailing major attack methods, including the Fast Gradient Signed Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Carlini &amp; Wagner Attack (C&amp;W) attack, Basic Iterative Method (BIM), DeepFool, and AutoAttack, with seven epsilon values each. To ensure the generated adversarial examples remain clinically plausible, we developed a comprehensive medical validation framework consisting of 247 medical constraints, including physiological bounds, symptom correlations, and conditional medical constraints. We achieved a 97.6% success rate in generating clinically plausible adversarial samples. We performed our experiment on the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) dataset (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/), which consists of 182,630 samples, to predict the participant's 4-year mortality rate. We evaluated our attacks on the AdaptiveFS framework proposed in arXiv:2004.00994. Our results show that adversarial attacks could significantly impact the diagnostic accuracy, with attack success rates ranging from 33.08% (FGSM) to 64.70% (AutoAttack). Our work has demonstrated that even under strict medical constraints on the input, such RL-based medical questionnaire systems still show significant vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>Selection-Based Vulnerabilities: Clean-Label Backdoor Attacks in Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active learning(AL), which serves as the representative label-efficient learning paradigm, has been widely applied in resource-constrained scenarios. The achievement of AL is attributed to acquisition functions, which are designed for identifying the most important data to label. Despite this success, one question remains unanswered: is AL safe? In this work, we introduce ALA, a practical and the first framework to utilize the acquisition function as the poisoning attack surface to reveal the weakness of active learning. Specifically, ALA optimizes imperceptibly poisoned inputs to exhibit high uncertainty scores, increasing their probability of being selected by acquisition functions. To evaluate ALA, we conduct extensive experiments across three datasets, three acquisition functions, and two types of clean-label backdoor triggers. Results show that our attack can achieve high success rates (up to 94%) even under low poisoning budgets (0.5%-1.0%) while preserving model utility and remaining undetectable to human annotators. Our findings remind active learning users: acquisition functions can be easily exploited, and active learning should be deployed with caution in trusted data scenarios.</description>

      <title>MM-FusionNet: Context-Aware Dynamic Fusion for Multi-modal Fake News Detection with Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of multi-modal fake news on social media poses a significant threat to public trust and social stability. Traditional detection methods, primarily text-based, often fall short due to the deceptive interplay between misleading text and images. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer promising avenues for multi-modal understanding, effectively fusing diverse modal information, especially when their importance is imbalanced or contradictory, remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces MM-FusionNet, an innovative framework leveraging LVLMs for robust multi-modal fake news detection. Our core contribution is the Context-Aware Dynamic Fusion Module (CADFM), which employs bi-directional cross-modal attention and a novel dynamic modal gating network. This mechanism adaptively learns and assigns importance weights to textual and visual features based on their contextual relevance, enabling intelligent prioritization of information. Evaluated on the large-scale Multi-modal Fake News Dataset (LMFND) comprising 80,000 samples, MM-FusionNet achieves a state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.938, surpassing existing multi-modal baselines by approximately 0.5% and significantly outperforming single-modal approaches. Further analysis demonstrates the model's dynamic weighting capabilities, its robustness to modality perturbations, and performance remarkably close to human-level, underscoring its practical efficacy and interpretability for real-world fake news detection.</description>

      <title>Leveraging large language models for SQL behavior-based database intrusion detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Database systems are extensively used to store critical data across various domains. However, the frequency of abnormal database access behaviors, such as database intrusion by internal and external attacks, continues to rise. Internal masqueraders often have greater organizational knowledge, making it easier to mimic employee behavior effectively. In contrast, external masqueraders may behave differently due to their lack of familiarity with the organization. Current approaches lack the granularity needed to detect anomalies at the operational level, frequently misclassifying entire sequences of operations as anomalies, even though most operations are likely to represent normal behavior. On the other hand, some anomalous behaviors often resemble normal activities, making them difficult for existing detection methods to identify. This paper introduces a two-tiered anomaly detection approach for Structured Query Language (SQL) using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, specifically DistilBERT, a more efficient, pre-trained version. Our method combines both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to accurately identify anomalous activities while minimizing the need for data labeling. First, the unsupervised method uses ensemble anomaly detectors that flag embedding vectors distant from learned normal patterns of typical user behavior across the database (out-of-scope queries). Second, the supervised method uses fine-tuned transformer-based models to detect internal attacks with high precision (in-scope queries), using role-labeled classification, even on limited labeled SQL data. Our findings make a significant contribution by providing an effective solution for safeguarding critical database systems from sophisticated threats.</description>

      <title>AuthPrint: Fingerprinting Generative Models Against Malicious Model Providers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models are increasingly adopted in high-stakes domains, yet current deployments offer no mechanisms to verify the origin of model outputs. We address this gap by extending model fingerprinting techniques beyond the traditional collaborative setting to one where the model provider may act adversarially. To our knowledge, this is the first work to evaluate fingerprinting for provenance attribution under such a threat model. The methods rely on a trusted verifier that extracts secret fingerprints from the model's output space, unknown to the provider, and trains a model to predict and verify them. Our empirical evaluation shows that our methods achieve near-zero FPR@95%TPR for instances of GAN and diffusion models, even when tested on small modifications to the original architecture and training data. Moreover, the methods remain robust against adversarial attacks that actively modify the outputs to bypass detection. Source codes are available at https://github.com/PSMLab/authprint.</description>

      <title>DMFI: Dual-Modality Fine-Tuning and Inference Framework for LLM-Based Insider Threat Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insider threat detection (ITD) poses a persistent and high-impact challenge in cybersecurity due to the subtle, long-term, and context-dependent nature of malicious insider behaviors. Traditional models often struggle to capture semantic intent and complex behavior dynamics, while existing LLM-based solutions face limitations in prompt adaptability and modality coverage. To bridge this gap, we propose DMFI, a dual-modality framework that integrates semantic inference with behavior-aware fine-tuning. DMFI converts raw logs into two structured views: (1) a semantic view that processes content-rich artifacts (e.g., emails, https) using instruction-formatted prompts; and (2) a behavioral abstraction, constructed via a 4W-guided (When-Where-What-Which) transformation to encode contextual action sequences. Two LoRA-enhanced LLMs are fine-tuned independently, and their outputs are fused via a lightweight MLP-based decision module. We further introduce DMFI-B, a discriminative adaptation strategy that separates normal and abnormal behavior representations, improving robustness under severe class imbalance. Experiments on CERT r4.2 and r5.2 datasets demonstrate that DMFI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. Our approach combines the semantic reasoning power of LLMs with structured behavior modeling, offering a scalable and effective solution for real-world insider threat detection. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining LLM reasoning with structured behavioral modeling, offering a scalable and deployable solution for modern insider threat detection.</description>

      <title>MambaITD: An Efficient Cross-Modal Mamba Network for Insider Threat Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enterprises are facing increasing risks of insider threats, while existing detection methods are unable to effectively address these challenges due to reasons such as insufficient temporal dynamic feature modeling, computational efficiency and real-time bottlenecks and cross-modal information island problem. This paper proposes a new insider threat detection framework MambaITD based on the Mamba state space model and cross-modal adaptive fusion. First, the multi-source log preprocessing module aligns heterogeneous data through behavioral sequence encoding, interval smoothing, and statistical feature extraction. Second, the Mamba encoder models long-range dependencies in behavioral and interval sequences, and combines the sequence and statistical information dynamically in combination with the gated feature fusion mechanism. Finally, we propose an adaptive threshold optimization method based on maximizing inter-class variance, which dynamically adjusts the decision threshold by analyzing the probability distribution, effectively identifies anomalies, and alleviates class imbalance and concept drift. Compared with traditional methods, MambaITD shows significant advantages in modeling efficiency and feature fusion capabilities, outperforming Transformer-based methods, and provides a more effective solution for insider threat detection.</description>

      <title>Log2Sig: Frequency-Aware Insider Threat Detection via Multivariate Behavioral Signal Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insider threat detection presents a significant challenge due to the deceptive nature of malicious behaviors, which often resemble legitimate user operations. However, existing approaches typically model system logs as flat event sequences, thereby failing to capture the inherent frequency dynamics and multiscale disturbance patterns embedded in user behavior. To address these limitations, we propose Log2Sig, a robust anomaly detection framework that transforms user logs into multivariate behavioral frequency signals, introducing a novel representation of user behavior. Log2Sig employs Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (MVMD) to extract Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), which reveal behavioral fluctuations across multiple temporal scales. Based on this, the model further performs joint modeling of behavioral sequences and frequency-decomposed signals: the daily behavior sequences are encoded using a Mamba-based temporal encoder to capture long-term dependencies, while the corresponding frequency components are linearly projected to match the encoder's output dimension. These dual-view representations are then fused to construct a comprehensive user behavior profile, which is fed into a multilayer perceptron for precise anomaly detection. Experimental results on the CERT r4.2 and r5.2 datasets demonstrate that Log2Sig significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and F1 score.</description>

      <title>System Security Framework for 5G Advanced /6G IoT Integrated Terrestrial Network-Non-Terrestrial Network (TN-NTN) with AI-Enabled Cloud Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Terrestrial Networks (TN) and Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), including 5G Advanced/6G and the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, using Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, high-altitude platforms (HAPS), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), is redefining the landscape of global connectivity. This paper introduces a new system-level security framework for 5G Advanced/6G IoT-integrated TN-NTN architectures with AI-native-enabled cloud security. Due to the heterogeneity, scale, and distributed nature of these networks, new security challenges have emerged. Leveraging AI-native cloud platforms offers powerful capabilities for real-time threat detection, security automation, and intelligent policy enforcement. The NTN satellite access function enhances security for discontinuous coverage via satellite connections. In addition, this paper explores the security risks associated with integrated 5G Advanced/6G IoT TN-NTN systems, including full network segmentation, network slicing, and the cloudification of the RAN and core. We present a comprehensive AI-enabled cloud security framework and conclude with proposals for implementing AI-powered, satellite-based NTN within future 5G Advanced/6G IoT networks. Our approach emphasizes zero-trust principles, federated learning, secure orchestration, a layered security framework, and resilience against adversarial threats.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twin technology has gained increasing attention across various sectors due to its ability to create virtual replicas of physical systems, enabling real-time monitoring, optimization, and simulation. This paper explores the integration of digital twins within defence applications, focusing on key use cases ranging from system design and development, operational planning and training, to mission execution and debriefing. By examining the application of digital twin technologies across defense platforms, we highlight their key advantages such as enhanced operational performance, predictive capabilities, and increased system uptime. Additionally, we introduce a novel characterization framework for digital twins that aims to standardize and unify their application across different defence domains to facilitate interoperability. Thereafter, we discuss the main challenges, gaps and limitations in implementing and adopting digital twins within defence organizations by analyzing a combination of scientific literature, current industry practices, governmental strategies, and the findings from a comprehensive survey of industrial stakeholders and ministries of defense. Finally, we outline future research directions and development opportunities, emphasizing the need for robust frameworks and interdisciplinary collaborations to fully realize the potential of digital twins in the defence sector.</description>

      <title>Secure and Scalable Blockchain Voting: A Comparative Framework and the Role of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain technology offers a promising foundation for modernizing E-Voting systems by enhancing transparency, decentralization, and security. Yet, real-world adoption remains limited due to persistent challenges such as scalability constraints, high computational demands, and complex privacy requirements. This paper presents a comparative framework for analyzing blockchain-based E-Voting architectures, consensus mechanisms, and cryptographic protocols. We examine the limitations of prevalent models like Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Delegated Proof of Stake, and propose optimization strategies that include hybrid consensus, lightweight cryptography, and decentralized identity management. Additionally, we explore the novel role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in smart contract generation, anomaly detection, and user interaction. Our findings offer a foundation for designing secure, scalable, and intelligent blockchain-based E-Voting systems suitable for national-scale deployment. This work lays the groundwork for building an end-to-end blockchain E-Voting prototype enhanced by LLM-guided smart contract generation and validation, supported by a systematic framework and simulation-based analysis.</description>

      <title>Fact2Fiction: Targeted Poisoning Attack to Agentic Fact-checking System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art fact-checking systems combat misinformation at scale by employing autonomous LLM-based agents to decompose complex claims into smaller sub-claims, verify each sub-claim individually, and aggregate the partial results to produce verdicts with justifications (explanatory rationales for the verdicts). The security of these systems is crucial, as compromised fact-checkers, which tend to be easily underexplored, can amplify misinformation. This work introduces Fact2Fiction, the first poisoning attack framework targeting such agentic fact-checking systems. Fact2Fiction mirrors the decomposition strategy and exploits system-generated justifications to craft tailored malicious evidences that compromise sub-claim verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fact2Fiction achieves 8.9\%--21.2\% higher attack success rates than state-of-the-art attacks across various poisoning budgets. Fact2Fiction exposes security weaknesses in current fact-checking systems and highlights the need for defensive countermeasures.</description>

      <title>A Game-Theoretic Foundation for Bitcoin's Price: A Security-Utility Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06071v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a structural game-theoretic model to value decentralized digital assets like Bitcoin. Instead of relying on speculative beliefs, it frames the asset's price within a Rational-Expectations Security-Utility Nash Equilibrium (RESUNE). This equilibrium is a fixed point where the market-clearing price dictates the hash rate through a free-entry mining model, which in turn endogenously sets the network's security. The security, defined as one minus the probability of a 51% attack, is determined via a global games model of attacker coordination, providing a unique and continuous security function. We prove the existence of a RESUNE and offer conditions for its uniqueness and stability. The model predicts that the stabilizing direct effect of price on demand must outweigh the potentially destabilizing feedback from price to security. The framework generates testable predictions, such as a protocol halving causing a contraction in both hash rate and price. A structural Vector Autoregression (VAR) model is proposed to test this mechanism. The model decomposes Bitcoin's value into transactional utility, security, and speculative components and explains the observed unidirectional causality from price to hash rate.</description>

      <title>ProvX: Generating Counterfactual-Driven Attack Explanations for Provenance-Based Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Provenance graph-based intrusion detection systems are deployed on hosts to defend against increasingly severe Advanced Persistent Threat. Using Graph Neural Networks to detect these threats has become a research focus and has demonstrated exceptional performance. However, the widespread adoption of GNN-based security models is limited by their inherent black-box nature, as they fail to provide security analysts with any verifiable explanations for model predictions or any evidence regarding the model's judgment in relation to real-world attacks. To address this challenge, we propose ProvX, an effective explanation framework for exlaining GNN-based security models on provenance graphs. ProvX introduces counterfactual explanation logic, seeking the minimal structural subset within a graph predicted as malicious that, when perturbed, can subvert the model's original prediction. We innovatively transform the discrete search problem of finding this critical subgraph into a continuous optimization task guided by a dual objective of prediction flipping and distance minimization. Furthermore, a Staged Solidification strategy is incorporated to enhance the precision and stability of the explanations. We conducted extensive evaluations of ProvX on authoritative datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that ProvX can locate critical graph structures that are highly relevant to real-world attacks and achieves an average explanation necessity of 51.59\%, with these metrics outperforming current SOTA explainers. Furthermore, we explore and provide a preliminary validation of a closed-loop Detection-Explanation-Feedback enhancement framework, demonstrating through experiments that the explanation results from ProvX can guide model optimization, effectively enhancing its robustness against adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Backtracking for Privacy Protection in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preservation of privacy has emerged as a critical topic in the era of artificial intelligence. However, current work focuses on user-oriented privacy, overlooking severe enterprise data leakage risks exacerbated by the Retrieval-Augmented Generation paradigm. To address this gap, our paper introduces a novel objective: enterprise-oriented privacy concerns. Achieving this objective requires overcoming two fundamental challenges: existing methods such as data sanitization severely degrade model performance, and the field lacks public datasets for evaluation. We address these challenges with several solutions. (1) To prevent performance degradation, we propose ABack, a training-free mechanism that leverages a Hidden State Model to pinpoint the origin of a leakage intention and rewrite the output safely. (2) To solve the lack of datasets, we construct PriGenQA, a new benchmark for enterprise privacy scenarios in healthcare and finance. To ensure a rigorous evaluation, we move beyond simple static attacks by developing a powerful adaptive attacker with Group Relative Policy Optimization. Experiments show that against this superior adversary, ABack improves the overall privacy utility score by up to 15\% over strong baselines, avoiding the performance trade-offs of prior methods.</description>

      <title>Simulation in Cybersecurity: Understanding Techniques, Applications, and Goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling and simulation are widely used in cybersecurity research to assess cyber threats, evaluate defense mechanisms, and analyze vulnerabilities. However, the diversity of application areas, the variety of cyberattacks scenarios, and the differing objectives of these simulations makes it difficult to identify methodological trends. Existing reviews often focus on specific modeling techniques or application domains, making it challenging to analyze the field as a whole. To address these limitations, we present a comprehensive review of the current state of the art, classifying the selected papers based on four dimensions: the application domain, the types of cyber threats represented, the simulation techniques employed, and the primary goals of the simulation. The review discusses the strengths and limitations of different approaches, identifies which cyber threats are the most suited for simulation-based investigations, and analyzes which modeling paradigms are most appropriate for specific cybersecurity challenges.</description>

      <title>SLIP: Soft Label Mechanism and Key-Extraction-Guided CoT-based Defense Against Instruction Backdoor in APIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of customized large language model (LLM) agents, a new threat of black-box backdoor attacks has emerged, where malicious instructions are injected into hidden system prompts. These attacks easily bypass existing defenses that rely on white-box access, posing a serious security challenge. To address this, we propose SLIP, a Soft Label mechanism and key-extraction-guided CoT-based defense against Instruction backdoors in APIs. SLIP is designed based on two key insights. First, to counteract the model's oversensitivity to triggers, we propose a Key-extraction-guided Chain-of-Thought (KCoT). Instead of only considering the single trigger or the input sentence, KCoT prompts the agent to extract task-relevant key phrases. Second, to guide the LLM toward correct answers, our proposed Soft Label Mechanism (SLM) prompts the agent to quantify the semantic correlation between key phrases and candidate answers. Crucially, to mitigate the influence of residual triggers or misleading content in phrases extracted by KCoT, which typically causes anomalous scores, SLM excludes anomalous scores deviating significantly from the mean and subsequently averages the remaining scores to derive a more reliable semantic representation. Extensive experiments on classification and question-answer (QA) tasks demonstrate that SLIP is highly effective, reducing the average attack success rate (ASR) from 90.2% to 25.13% while maintaining high accuracy on clean data and outperforming state-of-the-art defenses. Our code are available in https://github.com/CAU-ISS-Lab/Backdoor-Attack-Defense-LLMs/tree/main/SLIP.</description>

      <title>Anti-Tamper Protection for Unauthorized Individual Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of personalized image generation technologies, concerns about forgery attacks that infringe on portrait rights and privacy are growing. To address these concerns, protection perturbation algorithms have been developed to disrupt forgery generation. However, the protection algorithms would become ineffective when forgery attackers apply purification techniques to bypass the protection. To address this issue, we present a novel approach, Anti-Tamper Perturbation (ATP). ATP introduces a tamper-proof mechanism within the perturbation. It consists of protection and authorization perturbations, where the protection perturbation defends against forgery attacks, while the authorization perturbation detects purification-based tampering. Both protection and authorization perturbations are applied in the frequency domain under the guidance of a mask, ensuring that the protection perturbation does not disrupt the authorization perturbation. This design also enables the authorization perturbation to be distributed across all image pixels, preserving its sensitivity to purification-based tampering. ATP demonstrates its effectiveness in defending forgery attacks across various attack settings through extensive experiments, providing a robust solution for protecting individuals' portrait rights and privacy. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Seeyn/Anti-Tamper-Perturbation .</description>

      <title>When AIOps Become "AI Oops": Subverting LLM-driven IT Operations via Telemetry Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI for IT Operations (AIOps) is transforming how organizations manage complex software systems by automating anomaly detection, incident diagnosis, and remediation. Modern AIOps solutions increasingly rely on autonomous LLM-based agents to interpret telemetry data and take corrective actions with minimal human intervention, promising faster response times and operational cost savings.
  In this work, we perform the first security analysis of AIOps solutions, showing that, once again, AI-driven automation comes with a profound security cost. We demonstrate that adversaries can manipulate system telemetry to mislead AIOps agents into taking actions that compromise the integrity of the infrastructure they manage. We introduce techniques to reliably inject telemetry data using error-inducing requests that influence agent behavior through a form of adversarial reward-hacking; plausible but incorrect system error interpretations that steer the agent's decision-making. Our attack methodology, AIOpsDoom, is fully automated--combining reconnaissance, fuzzing, and LLM-driven adversarial input generation--and operates without any prior knowledge of the target system.
  To counter this threat, we propose AIOpsShield, a defense mechanism that sanitizes telemetry data by exploiting its structured nature and the minimal role of user-generated content. Our experiments show that AIOpsShield reliably blocks telemetry-based attacks without affecting normal agent performance.
  Ultimately, this work exposes AIOps as an emerging attack vector for system compromise and underscores the urgent need for security-aware AIOps design.</description>

      <title>ScamAgents: How AI Agents Can Simulate Human-Level Scam Calls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive fluency and reasoning capabilities, but their potential for misuse has raised growing concern. In this paper, we present ScamAgent, an autonomous multi-turn agent built on top of LLMs, capable of generating highly realistic scam call scripts that simulate real-world fraud scenarios. Unlike prior work focused on single-shot prompt misuse, ScamAgent maintains dialogue memory, adapts dynamically to simulated user responses, and employs deceptive persuasion strategies across conversational turns. We show that current LLM safety guardrails, including refusal mechanisms and content filters, are ineffective against such agent-based threats. Even models with strong prompt-level safeguards can be bypassed when prompts are decomposed, disguised, or delivered incrementally within an agent framework. We further demonstrate the transformation of scam scripts into lifelike voice calls using modern text-to-speech systems, completing a fully automated scam pipeline. Our findings highlight an urgent need for multi-turn safety auditing, agent-level control frameworks, and new methods to detect and disrupt conversational deception powered by generative AI.</description>

      <title>Voting-Based Semi-Parallel Proof-of-Work Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocols are suggested to improve the safety guarantees, transaction throughput and confirmation latencies of Nakamoto consensus. In this work, we first consider the existing parallel PoW protocols and develop hard-coded incentive attack structures. Our theoretical results and simulations show that the existing parallel PoW protocols are more vulnerable to incentive attacks than the Nakamoto consensus, e.g., attacks have smaller profitability threshold and they result in higher relative rewards. Next, we introduce a voting-based semi-parallel PoW protocol that outperforms both Nakamoto consensus and the existing parallel PoW protocols from most practical perspectives such as communication overheads, throughput, transaction conflicts, incentive compatibility of the protocol as well as a fair distribution of transaction fees among the voters and the leaders. We use state-of-the-art analysis to evaluate the consistency of the protocol and consider Markov decision process (MDP) models to substantiate our claims about the resilience of our protocol against incentive attacks.</description>

      <title>Random Walk Learning and the Pac-Man Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random walk (RW)-based algorithms have long been popular in distributed systems due to low overheads and scalability, with recent growing applications in decentralized learning. However, their reliance on local interactions makes them inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigate an adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a malicious node probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behavior gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we propose the Average Crossing (AC) algorithm--a fully decentralized mechanism for duplicating RWs to prevent RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our theoretical analysis establishes that (i) the RW population remains almost surely bounded under AC and (ii) RW-based stochastic gradient descent remains convergent under AC, even in the presence of Pac-Man, with a quantifiable deviation from the true optimum. Our extensive empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate our theoretical findings. Furthermore, they uncover a phase transition in the extinction probability as a function of the duplication threshold. We offer theoretical insights by analyzing a simplified variant of the AC, which sheds light on the observed phase transition.</description>

      <title>Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Residual Perturbation Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples while suffering from incorrect predictions via imperceptible perturbations. Transfer-based attacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these examples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that adversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability to alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook the influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability. In this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation Attack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction to guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function. Specifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input gradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which encompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying on the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation direction, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient and the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation direction. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of ResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the transferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current input transformation methods. The code is available at https://github.com/ZezeTao/ResPA.</description>

      <title>Membership Inference Attack with Partial Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models have been shown to be susceptible to membership inference attack, which can be used to determine whether a given sample appears in the training data. Existing membership inference methods commonly assume that the adversary has full access to the features of the target sample. This assumption, however, does not hold in many real-world scenarios where only partial features information is available, thereby limiting the applicability of these methods. In this work, we study an inference scenario where the adversary observes only partial features of each sample and aims to infer whether this observed subset was present in the training set of the target model. We define this problem as Partial Feature Membership Inference (PFMI). To address this problem, we propose MRAD (Memory-guided Reconstruction and Anomaly Detection), a two-stage attack framework. In the first stage, MRAD optimizes the unknown feature values to minimize the loss of the sample. In the second stage, it measures the deviation between the reconstructed sample and the training distribution using anomaly detection. Empirical results demonstrate that MRAD is effective across a range of datasets, and maintains compatibility with various off-the-shelf anomaly detection techniques. For example, on STL-10, our attack achieves an AUC of around 0.6 even with 40% of the missing features.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data Generation and Differential Privacy using Tensor Networks' Matrix Product States (MPS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data generation is a key technique in modern artificial intelligence, addressing data scarcity, privacy constraints, and the need for diverse datasets in training robust models. In this work, we propose a method for generating privacy-preserving high-quality synthetic tabular data using Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS). We benchmark the MPS-based generative model against state-of-the-art models such as CTGAN, VAE, and PrivBayes, focusing on both fidelity and privacy-preserving capabilities. To ensure differential privacy (DP), we integrate noise injection and gradient clipping during training, enabling privacy guarantees via R\'enyi Differential Privacy accounting. Across multiple metrics analyzing data fidelity and downstream machine learning task performance, our results show that MPS outperforms classical models, particularly under strict privacy constraints. This work highlights MPS as a promising tool for privacy-aware synthetic data generation. By combining the expressive power of tensor network representations with formal privacy mechanisms, the proposed approach offers an interpretable and scalable alternative for secure data sharing. Its structured design facilitates integration into sensitive domains where both data quality and confidentiality are critical.</description>

      <title>DP-SPRT: Differentially Private Sequential Probability Ratio Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit Wald's celebrated Sequential Probability Ratio Test for sequential tests of two simple hypotheses, under privacy constraints. We propose DP-SPRT, a wrapper that can be calibrated to achieve desired error probabilities and privacy constraints, addressing a significant gap in previous work. DP-SPRT relies on a private mechanism that processes a sequence of queries and stops after privately determining when the query results fall outside a predefined interval. This OutsideInterval mechanism improves upon naive composition of existing techniques like AboveThreshold, potentially benefiting other sequential algorithms. We prove generic upper bounds on the error and sample complexity of DP-SPRT that can accommodate various noise distributions based on the practitioner's privacy needs. We exemplify them in two settings: Laplace noise (pure Differential Privacy) and Gaussian noise (R\'enyi differential privacy). In the former setting, by providing a lower bound on the sample complexity of any $\epsilon$-DP test with prescribed type I and type II errors, we show that DP-SPRT is near optimal when both errors are small and the two hypotheses are close. Moreover, we conduct an experimental study revealing its good practical performance.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Kubernetes' Image Pull Implementation to Deny Node Availability</title>

Abstract: Kubernetes (K8s) has grown in popularity over the past few years to become the de-facto standard for container orchestration in cloud-native environments. While research is not new to topics such as containerization and access control security, the Application Programming Interface (API) interactions between K8s and its runtime interfaces have not been studied thoroughly. In particular, the CRI-API is responsible for abstracting the container runtime, managing the creation and lifecycle of containers along with the downloads of the respective images. However, this decoupling of concerns and the abstraction of the container runtime renders K8s unaware of the status of the downloading process of the container images, obstructing the monitoring of the resources allocated to such process. In this paper, we discuss how this lack of status information can be exploited as a Denial of Service attack in a K8s cluster. We show how such attacks can impact worker nodes, generating up to 95% average CPU usage, prevent downloads of new container images, and increase I/O and network usage for a potentially unlimited amount of time. We argue that solving this problem would require a radical architectural change in the relationship between K8s and the CRI-API, which would be unfeasible in the short term. Thus, as a stopgap solution, we propose MAGI: an eBPF-based, proof-of-concept mitigation that detects and terminates potential attacks.</description>

      <title>Towards More Realistic Extraction Attacks: An Adversarial Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models are prone to memorizing their training data, making them vulnerable to extraction attacks. While existing research often examines isolated setups, such as a single model or a fixed prompt, real-world adversaries have a considerably larger attack surface due to access to models across various sizes and checkpoints, and repeated prompting. In this paper, we revisit extraction attacks from an adversarial perspective -- with multi-faceted access to the underlying data. We find significant churn in extraction trends, i.e., even unintuitive changes to the prompt, or targeting smaller models and earlier checkpoints, can extract distinct information. By combining multiple attacks, our adversary doubles ($2 \times$) the extraction risks, persisting even under mitigation strategies like data deduplication. We conclude with four case studies, including detecting pre-training data, copyright violations, extracting personally identifiable information, and attacking closed-source models, showing how our more realistic adversary can outperform existing adversaries in the literature.</description>

      <title>SoK: The Security-Safety Continuum of Multimodal Foundation Models through Information Flow and Game-Theoretic Defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal foundation models (MFMs) integrate diverse data modalities to support complex and wide-ranging tasks. However, this integration also introduces distinct safety and security challenges. In this paper, we unify the concepts of safety and security in the context of MFMs by identifying critical threats that arise from both model behavior and system-level interactions. We propose a taxonomy grounded in information theory, evaluating risks through the concepts of channel capacity, signal, noise, and bandwidth. This perspective provides a principled way to analyze how information flows through MFMs and how vulnerabilities can emerge across modalities. Building on this foundation, we investigate defense mechanisms through the lens of a minimax game between attackers and defenders, highlighting key gaps in current research. In particular, we identify insufficient protection for cross-modal alignment and a lack of systematic and scalable defense strategies. Our work offers both a theoretical and practical foundation for advancing the safety and security of MFMs, supporting the development of more robust and trustworthy systems.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Guided Extraction of Knowledge Base from Retrieval-Augmented LLM Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) expands the knowledge boundary of large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge bases, whose construction is often time-consuming and laborious. If an adversary extracts the knowledge base verbatim, it not only severely infringes the owner's intellectual property but also enables the adversary to replicate the application's functionality for unfair competition. Previous works on knowledge base extraction are limited either by low extraction coverage (usually less than 4%) in query-based attacks or by impractical assumptions of white-box access in embedding-based optimization methods. In this work, we propose CopyBreakRAG, an agent-based black-box attack that reasons from feedback and adaptively generates new adversarial queries for progressive extraction. By balancing exploration and exploitation through curiosity-driven queries and feedback-guided query refinement, our method overcomes the limitations of prior approaches and achieves significantly higher extraction coverage in realistic black-box settings. Experimental results show that CopyBreakRAG outperforms the state-of-the-art black-box approach by 45% on average in terms of chunk extraction ratio from applications built with mainstream RAG frameworks, and extracts over 70% of the data from the knowledge base in applications on commercial platforms including OpenAI's GPTs and ByteDance's Coze when essential protection is in place.</description>

      <title>LeakAgent: RL-based Red-teaming Agent for LLM Privacy Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have discovered that large language models (LLM) may be ``fooled'' to output private information, including training data, system prompts, and personally identifiable information, under carefully crafted adversarial prompts. Existing red-teaming approaches for privacy leakage either rely on manual efforts or focus solely on system prompt extraction, making them ineffective for severe risks of training data leakage. We propose LeakAgent, a novel black-box red-teaming framework for LLM privacy leakage. Our framework trains an open-source LLM through reinforcement learning as the attack agent to generate adversarial prompts for both training data extraction and system prompt extraction. To achieve this, we propose a novel reward function to provide effective and fine-grained rewards and design novel mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation during learning and enhance the diversity of adversarial prompts. Through extensive evaluations, we first show that LeakAgent significantly outperforms existing rule-based approaches in training data extraction and automated methods in system prompt leakage. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of LeakAgent in extracting system prompts from real-world applications in OpenAI's GPT Store. We further demonstrate LeakAgent's effectiveness in evading the existing guardrail defense and its helpfulness in enabling better safety alignment. Finally, we validate our customized designs through a detailed ablation study. We release our code here https://github.com/rucnyz/LeakAgent.</description>

      <title>EVA-S2PLoR: Decentralized Secure 2-party Logistic Regression with A Subtly Hadamard Product Protocol (Full Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The implementation of accurate nonlinear operators (e.g., sigmoid function) on heterogeneous datasets is a key challenge in privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML). Most existing frameworks approximate it through linear operations, which not only result in significant precision loss but also introduce substantial computational overhead. This paper proposes an efficient, verifiable, and accurate security 2-party logistic regression framework (EVA-S2PLoR), which achieves accurate nonlinear function computation through a subtly secure hadamard product protocol and its derived protocols. All protocols are based on a practical semi-honest security model, which is designed for decentralized privacy-preserving application scenarios that balance efficiency, precision, and security. High efficiency and precision are guaranteed by the asynchronous computation flow on floating point numbers and the few number of fixed communication rounds in the hadamard product protocol, where robust anomaly detection is promised by dimension transformation and Monte Carlo methods. EVA-S2PLoR outperforms many advanced frameworks in terms of precision, improving the performance of the sigmoid function by about 10 orders of magnitude compared to most frameworks. Moreover, EVA-S2PLoR delivers the best overall performance in secure logistic regression experiments with training time reduced by over 47.6% under WAN settings and a classification accuracy difference of only about 0.5% compared to the plaintext model.</description>

      <title>ActMiner: Applying Causality Tracking and Increment Aligning for Graph-based Cyber Threat Hunting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To defend against Advanced Persistent Threats on the endpoint, threat hunting employs security knowledge such as cyber threat intelligence to continuously analyze system audit logs through retrospective scanning, querying, or pattern matching, aiming to uncover attack patterns/graphs that traditional detection methods (e.g., recognition for Point of Interest) fail to capture. However, existing threat hunting systems based on provenance graphs face challenges of high false negatives, high false positives, and low efficiency when confronted with diverse attack tactics and voluminous audit logs. To address these issues, we propose a system called Actminer, which constructs query graphs from descriptive relationships in cyber threat intelligence reports for precise threat hunting (i.e., graph alignment) on provenance graphs. First, we present a heuristic search strategy based on equivalent semantic transfer to reduce false negatives. Second, we establish a filtering mechanism based on causal relationships of attack behaviors to mitigate false positives. Finally, we design a tree structure to incrementally update the alignment results, significantly improving hunting efficiency. Evaluation on the DARPA Engagement dataset demonstrates that compared to the SOTA POIROT, Actminer reduces false positives by 39.1%, eliminates all false negatives, and effectively counters adversarial attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern cybersecurity landscapes increasingly demand sophisticated detection frameworks capable of identifying evolving threats with precision and adaptability. The proposed Zero-Space Detection framework introduces a novel approach that dynamically identifies latent behavioral patterns through unsupervised clustering and advanced deep learning techniques. Designed to address the limitations of signature-based and heuristic methods, it operates effectively in high-velocity environments by integrating multi-phase filtering and ensemble learning for refined decision-making. Experimental evaluation reveals high detection rates across diverse ransomware families, including LockBit, Conti, REvil, and BlackMatter, while maintaining low false positive rates and scalable performance. Computational overhead remains minimal, with average processing times ensuring compatibility with real-time systems even under peak operational loads. The framework demonstrates resilience against adversarial strategies such as obfuscation and encryption speed variability, which frequently challenge conventional detection systems. Analysis across multiple data sources highlights its versatility in handling diverse file types and operational contexts. Comprehensive metrics, including detection probability, latency, and resource efficiency, validate its efficacy under real-world conditions. Through its modular architecture, the framework achieves seamless integration with existing cybersecurity infrastructures without significant reconfiguration. The results demonstrate its robustness and scalability, offering a transformative paradigm for ransomware identification in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing sophistication of encryption-based ransomware has demanded innovative approaches to detection and mitigation, prompting the development of a hierarchical framework grounded in probabilistic cryptographic analysis. By focusing on the statistical characteristics of encryption patterns, the proposed methodology introduces a layered approach that combines advanced clustering algorithms with machine learning to isolate ransomware-induced anomalies. Through comprehensive testing across diverse ransomware families, the framework demonstrated exceptional accuracy, effectively distinguishing malicious encryption operations from benign activities while maintaining low false positive rates. The system's design integrates dynamic feedback mechanisms, enabling adaptability to varying cryptographic complexities and operational environments. Detailed entropy-based evaluations revealed its sensitivity to subtle deviations in encryption workflows, offering a robust alternative to traditional detection methods reliant on static signatures or heuristics. Computational benchmarks confirmed its scalability and efficiency, achieving consistent performance even under high data loads and complex cryptographic scenarios. The inclusion of real-time clustering and anomaly evaluation ensures rapid response capabilities, addressing critical latency challenges in ransomware detection. Performance comparisons with established methods highlighted its improvements in detection efficacy, particularly against advanced ransomware employing extended key lengths and unique cryptographic protocols.</description>

Abstract: Model fingerprinting is a widely adopted approach to safeguard the intellectual property rights of open-source models by preventing their unauthorized reuse. It is promising and convenient since it does not necessitate modifying the protected model. In this paper, we revisit existing fingerprinting methods and reveal that they are vulnerable to false claim attacks where adversaries falsely assert ownership of any third-party model. We demonstrate that this vulnerability mostly stems from their untargeted nature, where they generally compare the outputs of given samples on different models instead of the similarities to specific references. Motivated by these findings, we propose a targeted fingerprinting paradigm (i.e., FIT-Print) to counteract false claim attacks. Specifically, FIT-Print transforms the fingerprint into a targeted signature via optimization. Building on the principles of FIT-Print, we develop bit-wise and list-wise black-box model fingerprinting methods, i.e., FIT-ModelDiff and FIT-LIME, which exploit the distance between model outputs and the feature attribution of specific samples as the fingerprint, respectively. Extensive experiments on benchmark models and datasets verify the effectiveness, conferrability, and resistance to false claim attacks of our FIT-Print.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of cyber threats has outpaced traditional detection methodologies, necessitating innovative approaches capable of addressing the adaptive and complex behaviors of modern adversaries. A novel framework was introduced, leveraging Temporal-Correlation Graphs to model the intricate relationships and temporal patterns inherent in malicious operations. The approach dynamically captured behavioral anomalies, offering a robust mechanism for distinguishing between benign and malicious activities in real-time scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrated the framework's effectiveness across diverse ransomware families, with consistently high precision, recall, and overall detection accuracy. Comparative evaluations highlighted its better performance over traditional signature-based and heuristic methods, particularly in handling polymorphic and previously unseen ransomware variants. The architecture was designed with scalability and modularity in mind, ensuring compatibility with enterprise-scale environments while maintaining resource efficiency. Analysis of encryption speeds, anomaly patterns, and temporal correlations provided deeper insights into the operational strategies of ransomware, validating the framework's adaptability to evolving threats. The research contributes to advancing cybersecurity technologies by integrating dynamic graph analytics and machine learning for future innovations in threat detection. Results from this study underline the potential for transforming the way organizations detect and mitigate complex cyberattacks.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Cryptographic Signature Mapping for Ransomware Classification: A Structural Decomposition Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Encryption-based cyber threats continue to evolve, leveraging increasingly sophisticated cryptographic techniques to evade detection and persist within compromised systems. A hierarchical classification framework designed to analyze structural cryptographic properties provides a novel approach to distinguishing malicious encryption from legitimate cryptographic operations. By systematically decomposing encryption workflows into hierarchical layers, the classification method enhances the ability to recognize distinct patterns across diverse threat variants, reducing the dependence on predefined signatures that often fail against rapidly mutating threats. The study examines how cryptographic feature mapping facilitates improved classification accuracy, highlighting the role of entropy, key exchange mechanisms, and algorithmic dependencies in distinguishing harmful encryption activities. Through experimental validation, the framework demonstrated a high degree of precision across multiple attack families, outperforming conventional classification techniques while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for large-scale cybersecurity applications. The layered structural analysis further enhances forensic investigations, enabling security analysts to dissect encryption workflows to trace attack origins and identify commonalities across different campaigns. The methodology strengthens proactive threat mitigation efforts, offering a scalable and adaptable solution that accounts for both known and emerging encryption-based cyber threats. Comparative evaluations illustrate the advantages of structural decomposition in mitigating false positives and negatives, reinforcing the reliability of cryptographic signature classification in real-world security environments.</description>

      <title>Neural Encrypted State Transduction for Ransomware Classification: A Novel Approach Using Cryptographic Flow Residuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Encrypted behavioral patterns provide a unique avenue for classifying complex digital threats without reliance on explicit feature extraction, enabling detection frameworks to remain effective even when conventional static and behavioral methodologies fail. A novel approach based on Neural Encrypted State Transduction (NEST) is introduced to analyze cryptographic flow residuals and classify threats through their encrypted state transitions, mitigating evasion tactics employed through polymorphic and obfuscated attack strategies. The mathematical formulation of NEST leverages transduction principles to map state transitions dynamically, enabling high-confidence classification without requiring direct access to decrypted execution traces. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves improved detection accuracy across multiple ransomware families while exhibiting resilience against adversarial perturbations and previously unseen attack variants. The model maintains competitive processing efficiency, offering a practical balance between classification performance and computational resource constraints, making it suitable for large-scale security deployments. Comparative assessments reveal that NEST consistently outperforms baseline classification models, particularly in detecting ransomware samples employing delayed encryption, entropy-based obfuscation, and memory-resident execution techniques. The capacity to generalize across diverse execution environments reinforces the applicability of encrypted transduction methodologies in adversarial classification tasks beyond conventional malware detection pipelines. The integration of residual learning mechanisms within the transduction layers further enhances classification robustness, minimizing both false positives and misclassification rates across varied operational contexts.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Entropy Disruption for Ransomware Detection: A Computationally-Driven Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of encryption-based threats has rendered conventional detection mechanisms increasingly ineffective against sophisticated attack strategies. Monitoring entropy variations across hierarchical system levels offers an alternative approach to identifying unauthorized data modifications without relying on static signatures. A framework leveraging hierarchical entropy disruption was introduced to analyze deviations in entropy distributions, capturing behavioral anomalies indicative of malicious encryption operations. Evaluating the framework across multiple ransomware variants demonstrated its capability to achieve high detection accuracy while maintaining minimal computational overhead. Entropy distributions across different system directories revealed that encryption activities predominantly targeted user-accessible files, aligning with observed attacker strategies. Detection latency analysis indicated that early-stage identification was feasible, mitigating potential data loss before critical system impact occurred. The framework's ability to operate efficiently in real-time environments was validated through an assessment of resource utilization, confirming a balanced trade-off between detection precision and computational efficiency. Comparative benchmarking against established detection methods highlighted the limitations of conventional approaches in identifying novel ransomware variants, whereas entropy-based anomaly detection provided resilience against obfuscation techniques.</description>

      <title>HoneySat: A Network-based Satellite Honeypot Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellites are the backbone of several mission-critical services that enable our modern society to function, for example, GPS. For years, satellites were assumed to be secure because of their indecipherable architectures and the reliance on security by obscurity. However, technological advancements have made these assumptions obsolete, paving the way for potential attacks, and sparking interest in satellite security. Unfortunately, to this day, there is no efficient way to collect data on adversarial techniques for satellites, hurting the generation of security intelligence that can lead to the development of effective countermeasures. In this paper, we present HoneySat, the first high-interaction satellite honeypot framework, fully capable of convincingly simulating a real-world CubeSat, a type of Small Satellite (SmallSat). To provide evidence of HoneySat's effectiveness, we surveyed experienced SmallSat operators in charge of in-orbit satellites and deployed HoneySat over the Internet to entice adversaries. Our results show that 90% of satellite operators agreed that HoneySat provides a realistic and engaging simulation of a SmallSat mission. Additionally, HoneySat successfully deceived human adversaries in the wild and collected 22 real-world satellite-specific adversarial interactions. Finally, in a major demonstration of HoneySat's robustness, we collaborated with an aerospace company to perform a hardware-in-the-loop operation that resulted in HoneySat successfully communicating with an in-orbit, operational SmallSat mission.</description>

      <title>DAVSP: Safety Alignment for Large Vision-Language Models via Deep Aligned Visual Safety Prompt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive progress across various applications but remain vulnerable to malicious queries that exploit the visual modality. Existing alignment approaches typically fail to resist malicious queries while preserving utility on benign ones effectively. To address these challenges, we propose Deep Aligned Visual Safety Prompt (DAVSP), which is built upon two key innovations. First, we introduce the Visual Safety Prompt, which appends a trainable padding region around the input image. It preserves visual features and expands the optimization space. Second, we propose Deep Alignment, a novel approach to train the visual safety prompt through supervision in the model's activation space. It enhances the inherent ability of LVLMs to perceive malicious queries, achieving deeper alignment than prior works. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks on two representative LVLMs demonstrate that DAVSP effectively resists malicious queries while preserving benign input utility. Furthermore, DAVSP exhibits great cross-model generation ability. Ablation studies further reveal that both the Visual Safety Prompt and Deep Alignment are essential components, jointly contributing to its overall effectiveness. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangyitonggg/DAVSP.</description>

      <title>Scalable Differentially Private Sketches under Continual Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear sketches are fundamental tools in data stream analytics. They are notable for supporting both approximate frequency queries and heavy hitter detection with bounded trade-offs for error and memory. Importantly, on streams that contain sensitive information, linear sketches can be easily privatized with the injection of a suitable amount of noise. This process is efficient in the single release model, where the output is released only at the end of the stream. In this setting, it suffices to add noise to the sketch once.
  In contrast, in the continual observation model, where the output is released at every time-step, fresh noise needs to be added to the sketch before each release. This creates an additional computational overhead. To address this, we introduce Lazy Sketch, a novel differentially private sketching method that employs lazy updates, perturbing and modifying only a small portion of the sketch at each step. Compared to prior work, we reduce the update complexity by a factor of $O(w)$, where $w$ is the width of the sketch. Experiments demonstrate that our method increases throughput by up to 250x over prior work, making continual observation differential privacy practical for high-speed streaming applications.
  In addition, for heavy hitter detection, we present a new sketch-based algorithm that leverages lazy updates to achieve a per-update complexity of $O(d \log (T/w) + \log w)$, for linear sketches with dimension $d\times w$ and streams of length $T$. This marks a significant improvement over prior approaches in the streaming continual observation model, which require recomputing frequency estimates for every item in the input domain at each time step.</description>

      <title>AICrypto: A Comprehensive Benchmark For Evaluating Cryptography Capabilities of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains. However, their applications in cryptography, which serves as a foundational pillar of cybersecurity, remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{AICrypto}, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the cryptographic capabilities of LLMs. The benchmark comprises 135 multiple-choice questions, 150 capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges, and 18 proof problems, covering a broad range of skills from factual memorization to vulnerability exploitation and formal reasoning. All tasks are carefully reviewed or constructed by cryptography experts to ensure correctness and rigor. To support automated evaluation of CTF challenges, we design an agent-based framework. To gain deeper insight into the current state of cryptographic proficiency in LLMs, we introduce human expert performance baselines for comparison across all task types. Our evaluation of 17 leading LLMs reveals that state-of-the-art models match or even surpass human experts in memorizing cryptographic concepts, exploiting common vulnerabilities, and routine proofs. However, they still lack a deep understanding of abstract mathematical concepts and struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning and dynamic analysis. We hope this work could provide insights for future research on LLMs in cryptographic applications. Our code and dataset are available at https://aicryptobench.github.io.</description>

      <title>FairDAG: Consensus Fairness over Multi-Proposer Causal Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum has driven interest in blockchain database technology, with smart contracts enabling the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi). However, research has shown that adversaries exploit transaction ordering to extract profits through attacks like front-running, sandwich attacks, and liquidation manipulation. This issue affects blockchain databases in which block proposers have full control over transaction ordering. To address this, a more fair approach to transaction ordering is essential.
  Existing fairness protocols, such as Pompe and Themis, operate on leader-based consensus protocols, which not only suffer from low throughput, but also allow adversaries to manipulate transaction ordering. To address these limitations, we propose FairDAG-AB and FairDAG-RL that run fairness protocols on top of DAG-based consensus protocols, which improve protocol performance in both throughput and fairness quality, leveraging the multi-proposer design and validity of DAG-based consensus protocols.
  We conducted a comprehensive analytical and experimental evaluation of our protocols. The results show that FairDAG-AB and FairDAG-RL outperform the prior fairness protocols in both throughput and fairness quality.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Network Security Policies via Belief Aggregation and Rollout</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolving security vulnerabilities and shifting operational conditions require frequent updates to network security policies. These updates include adjustments to incident response procedures and modifications to access controls, among others. Reinforcement learning methods have been proposed for automating such policy adaptations, but most of the methods in the research literature lack performance guarantees and adapt slowly to changes. In this paper, we address these limitations and present a method for computing security policies that is scalable, offers theoretical guarantees, and adapts quickly to changes. It assumes a model or simulator of the system and comprises three components: belief estimation through particle filtering, offline policy computation through aggregation, and online policy adaptation through rollout. Central to our method is a new feature-based aggregation technique, which improves scalability and flexibility. We analyze the approximation error of aggregation and show that rollout efficiently adapts policies to changes under certain conditions. Simulations and testbed results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, including CAGE-2.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Noise and Crosstalk in Neutral Atom Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores and evaluates noise and crosstalk in neutral atom quantum computers. Neutral atom quantum computers are a promising platform for analog Hamiltonian simulations, which rely on a sequence of time-dependent Hamiltonians to model the dynamics of a larger system and are particularly useful for problems in optimization, physics, and molecular dynamics. However, the viability of running multiple simulations in a co-located or multi-tenant environment is limited by noise and crosstalk. This work conducts an analysis of how noise faced by simulations changes over time, and investigates the effects of spatial co-location on simulation fidelity. Findings of this work demonstrate that the close proximity of concurrent simulations can increase crosstalk between them. To mitigate this issue, a Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategy is proposed and evaluated. The results confirm that the MTD is a viable technique for enabling safe and reliable co-location of simulations on neutral atom quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Resource-Efficient Automatic Software Vulnerability Assessment via Knowledge Distillation and Particle Swarm Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems has led to a surge in cybersecurity vulnerabilities, necessitating efficient and scalable solutions for vulnerability assessment. However, the deployment of large pre-trained models in real-world scenarios is hindered by their substantial computational and storage demands. To address this challenge, we propose a novel resource-efficient framework that integrates knowledge distillation and particle swarm optimization to enable automated vulnerability assessment. Our framework employs a two-stage approach: First, particle swarm optimization is utilized to optimize the architecture of a compact student model, balancing computational efficiency and model capacity. Second, knowledge distillation is applied to transfer critical vulnerability assessment knowledge from a large teacher model to the optimized student model. This process significantly reduces the model size while maintaining high performance. Experimental results on an enhanced MegaVul dataset, comprising 12,071 CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) v3 annotated vulnerabilities, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our approach achieves a 99.4% reduction in model size while retaining 89.3% of the original model's accuracy. Furthermore, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 1.7% in accuracy with 60% fewer parameters. The framework also reduces training time by 72.1% and architecture search time by 34.88% compared to traditional genetic algorithms.</description>
