      <title>CAD-Integrated Electrostatic Boundary Element Simulations with Non-Conforming Higher-Order Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a design through analysis workflow that enables virtual prototyping of electric devices. A CAD plugin establishes the interaction between design and analysis, allowing the preparation of analysis models and the visualization of its results within the design environment. The simulations utilize a fast boundary element method (BEM) that allows for non-conforming and higher-order meshes. Our numerical experiments investigate the accuracy of the approach and its sensitivity to the initial CAD representation. Overall, the workflow enables a close link between design and analysis, where the non-conforming higher-order BEM approach provides accurate results and significantly simplifies the interaction.</description>

      <title>Improved design of an active landing gear for a passenger aircraft using multi-objective optimization technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The landing gear system is a major aircraft subsystem that must withstand extreme forces during ground maneuvers and absorb vibrations. While traditional systems perform well under normal conditions, their efficiency drops under varying landing and runway scenarios. This study addresses this issue by simultaneously optimizing controller coefficients, parameters of a nonlinear hydraulic actuator integrated into the traditional shock absorber, and a vibration absorber using a bee-inspired multi-objective algorithm. To demonstrate adaptability, the paper includes sensitivity analysis for three-point landings affected by added payload and touchdown speed, and robustness analysis for one- and two-point landings under emergency wind conditions. The dynamic flight equations of an Airbus A320-200 during landing are derived and solved numerically. Results show that the active shock absorber system, optimized via two bee-based algorithms, outperforms the passive system in reducing bounce and pitch displacements and momenta, suspension travel, and impact force in both time and frequency domains. This leads to significantly improved passenger comfort and potentially longer structural fatigue life, demonstrating industrial applicability.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of spectral-element modeling of wave propagation through the anatomy of marine mammals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces the first 3D spectral-element method (SEM) simulation of ultrasonic wave propagation in a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) head. Unlike traditional finite-element methods (FEM), which struggle with high-frequency simulations due to costly linear-system inversions and slower convergence, SEM offers exponential convergence and efficient parallel computation. Using Computed Tomography (CT) scan data, we developed a detailed hexahedral mesh capturing complex anatomical features, such as acoustic fats and jaws. Our simulations of plane and spherical waves confirm SEM's effectiveness for ultrasonic time-domain modeling. This approach opens new avenues for marine biology, contributing to research in echolocation, the impacts of anthropogenic marine noise pollution and the biophysics of hearing and click generation in marine mammals. By overcoming FEM's limitations, SEM provides a powerful scalable tool to test hypotheses about dolphin bioacoustics, with significant implications for conservation and understanding marine mammal auditory systems under increasing environmental challenges.</description>

      <title>SparStencil: Retargeting Sparse Tensor Cores to Scientific Stencil Computations via Structured Sparsity Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Tensor Cores offer exceptional performance gains for AI workloads by exploiting structured 2:4 sparsity. However, their potential remains untapped for core scientific workloads such as stencil computations, which exhibit irregular sparsity patterns.This paper presents SparStencil, the first system to retarget sparse TCUs for scientific stencil computations through structured sparsity transformation. SparStencil introduces three key techniques: (1) Adaptive Layout Morphing, which restructures stencil patterns into staircase-aligned sparse matrices via a flatten-and-crush pipeline; (2) Structured Sparsity Conversion, which formulates transformation as a graph matching problem to ensure compatibility with 2:4 sparsity constraints; (3) Automatic Kernel Generation, which compiles transformed stencils into optimized sparse MMA kernels via layout search and table-driven memory mapping. Evaluated on 79 stencil kernels spanning diverse scientific domains, SparStencil achieves up to 7.1x speedup (3.1x on average) over state-of-the-art framework while reducing code complexity and matching or exceeding expert-tuned performance in both compute throughput and memory efficiency.</description>

      <title>Towards a better approach to the Vehicle Routing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a fundamental challenge in logistics management research, given its substantial influence on transportation efficiency, cost minimization, and service quality. As a combinatorial optimization problem, VRP plays a crucial role in a wide range of real world applications, particularly in transportation, logistics, and delivery systems, due to its diverse formulations and numerous extensions. Over the years, researchers have introduced various VRP variants to address specific operational constraints, emerging industry requirements and optimize specific objectives, making it one of the most extensively studied problems in operations research. This article provides a comprehensive overview of VRP by exploring its theoretical foundations, discussing the limitations of its classical model, and introducing its key extensions. By systematically reviewing the diverse constraints, objectives, and variants examined in recent literature, this study aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of VRP while highlighting its ongoing evolution and relevance in modern optimization and decision making processes.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Multiscale Topology Optimization of Spinodoid Architected Materials with Controllable Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spinodoid architected materials have drawn significant attention due to their unique nature in stochasticity, aperiodicity, and bi-continuity. Compared to classic periodic truss-, beam- and plate-based lattice architectures, spinodoids are insensitive to manufacturing defects, scalable for high throughput production, functionally graded by tunable local properties, and material failure resistant due to low-curvature morphology. However, the design of spinodoids is often hindered by the curse of dimensionality with extremely large design space of spinodoid types, material density, orientation, continuity, and anisotropy. From a design optimization perspective, while genetic algorithms are often beyond the reach of computing capacity, gradient-based topology optimization is challenged by the intricate mathematical derivation of gradient fields with respect to various spinodoid parameters. To address such challenges, we propose a data-driven multiscale topology optimization framework. Our framework reformulates the design variables of spinodoid materials as the parameters of neural networks, enabling automated computation of topological gradients. Additionally, it incorporates a Gaussian Process surrogate for spinodoid constitutive models, eliminating the need for repeated computational homogenization and enhancing the scalability of multiscale topology optimization. Compared to 'black-box' deep learning approaches, the proposed framework provides clear physical insights into material distribution. It explicitly reveals why anisotropic spinodoids with tailored orientations are favored in certain regions, while isotropic spinodoids are more suitable elsewhere. This interpretability helps to bridge the gap between data-driven design with mechanistic understanding.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Multiscale Topology Optimization of Soft Functionally Graded Materials with Large Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs) made of soft constituents have emerged as promising material-structure systems in potential applications across many engineering disciplines, such as soft robots, actuators, energy harvesting, and tissue engineering. Designing such systems remains challenging due to their multiscale architectures, multiple material phases, and inherent material and geometric nonlinearities. The focus of this paper is to propose a general topology optimization framework that automates the design innovation of multiscale soft FGMs exhibiting nonlinear material behaviors under large deformations. Our proposed topology optimization framework integrates several key innovations: (1) a novel microstructure reconstruction algorithm that generates composite architecture materials from a reduced design space using physically interpretable parameters; (2) a new material homogenization approach that estimates effective properties by combining the stored energy functions of multiple soft constituents; (3) a neural network-based topology optimization that incorporates data-driven material surrogates to enable bottom-up, simultaneous optimization of material and structure; and (4) a generic nonlinear sensitivity analysis technique that computes design sensitivities numerically without requiring explicit gradient derivation. To enhance the convergence of the nonlinear equilibrium equations amid topology optimization, we introduce an energy interpolation scheme and employ a Newton-Raphson solver with adaptive step sizes and convergence criteria. Numerical experiments show that the proposed framework produces distinct topological designs, different from those obtained under linear elasticity, with spatially varying microstructures.</description>

      <title>Exploring Artificial Intelligence Tutor Teammate Adaptability to Harness Discovery Curiosity and Promote Learning in the Context of Interactive Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of an Artificial Intelligence tutor teammate (AI) on student curiosity-driven engagement and learning effectiveness during Interactive Molecular Dynamics (IMD) tasks on the Visual Molecular Dynamics platform. It explores the role of the AI's curiosity-triggering and response behaviors in stimulating and sustaining student curiosity, affecting the frequency and complexity of student-initiated questions. The study further assesses how AI interventions shape student engagement, foster discovery curiosity, and enhance team performance within the IMD learning environment. Using a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm, a human experimenter dynamically adjusts the AI tutor teammate's behavior through a large language model. By employing a mixed-methods exploratory design, a total of 11 high school students participated in four IMD tasks that involved molecular visualization and calculations, which increased in complexity over a 60-minute period. Team performance was evaluated through real-time observation and recordings, whereas team communication was measured by question complexity and AI's curiosity-triggering and response behaviors. Cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA) metrics reflected structural alignment in coordination and were linked to communication behaviors. High-performing teams exhibited superior task completion, deeper understanding, and increased engagement. Advanced questions were associated with AI curiosity-triggering, indicating heightened engagement and cognitive complexity. CRQA metrics highlighted dynamic synchronization in student-AI interactions, emphasizing structured yet adaptive engagement to promote curiosity. These proof-of-concept findings suggest that the AI's dual role as a teammate and educator indicates its capacity to provide adaptive feedback, sustaining engagement and epistemic curiosity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual, Augmented, and eXtended Reality (VR/AR/XR) technologies are increasingly recognized for their applications in training, diagnostics, and psychological research, particularly in high-risk and highly regulated environments. In this panel we discuss how immersive systems enhance human performance across multiple domains, including clinical psychology, space exploration, and medical education. In psychological research and training, XR can offer a controlled yet ecologically valid setting for measuring cognitive and affective processes. In space exploration, we discuss the development of VR-based astronaut training and diagnostic systems, allowing astronauts to perform real-time health assessments. In medical education and rehabilitation, we cover procedural training and patient engagement. From virtual surgical simulations to gamified rehabilitation exercises, immersive environments enhance both learning outcomes and treatment adherence.</description>

      <title>Validation of AI-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation in a Cyber-Physical Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safe and realistic interactions between automated driving systems and vulnerable road users (VRUs) in urban environments requires advanced testing methodologies. This paper presents a test environment that combines a Vehiclein-the-Loop (ViL) test bench with a motion laboratory, demonstrating the feasibility of cyber-physical (CP) testing of vehicle-pedestrian and vehicle-cyclist interactions. Building upon previous work focused on pedestrian localization, we further validate a human pose estimation (HPE) approach through a comparative analysis of real-world (RW) and virtual representations of VRUs. The study examines the perception of full-body motion using a commercial monocular camera-based 3Dskeletal detection AI. The virtual scene is generated in Unreal Engine 5, where VRUs are animated in real time and projected onto a screen to stimulate the camera. The proposed stimulation technique ensures the correct perspective, enabling realistic vehicle perception. To assess the accuracy and consistency of HPE across RW and CP domains, we analyze the reliability of detections as well as variations in movement trajectories and joint estimation stability. The validation includes dynamic test scenarios where human avatars, both walking and cycling, are monitored under controlled conditions. Our results show a strong alignment in HPE between RW and CP test conditions for stable motion patterns, while notable inaccuracies persist under dynamic movements and occlusions, particularly for complex cyclist postures. These findings contribute to refining CP testing approaches for evaluating next-generation AI-based vehicle perception and to enhancing interaction models of automated vehicles and VRUs in CP environments.</description>

      <title>A topology optimisation framework to design test specimens for one-shot identification or discovery of material models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing availability of full-field displacement data from imaging techniques in experimental mechanics is determining a gradual shift in the paradigm of material model calibration and discovery, from using several simple-geometry tests towards a few, or even one single test with complicated geometry. The feasibility of such a "one-shot" calibration or discovery heavily relies upon the richness of the measured displacement data, i.e., their ability to probe the space of the state variables and the stress space (whereby the stresses depend on the constitutive law being sought) to an extent sufficient for an accurate and robust calibration or discovery process. The richness of the displacement data is in turn directly governed by the specimen geometry. In this paper, we propose a density-based topology optimisation framework to optimally design the geometry of the target specimen for calibration of an anisotropic elastic material model. To this end, we perform automatic, high-resolution specimen design by maximising the robustness of the solution of the inverse problem, i.e., the identified material parameters, given noisy displacement measurements from digital image correlation. We discuss the choice of the cost function and the design of the topology optimisation framework, and we analyse a range of optimised topologies generated for the identification of isotropic and anisotropic elastic responses.</description>

      <title>Redefining Evaluation Standards: A Unified Framework for Evaluating the Korean Capabilities of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Korean large language models (LLMs) have driven numerous benchmarks and evaluation methods, yet inconsistent protocols cause up to 10 p.p performance gaps across institutions. Overcoming these reproducibility gaps does not mean enforcing a one-size-fits-all evaluation. Rather, effective benchmarking requires diverse experimental approaches and a framework robust enough to support them. To this end, we introduce HRET (Haerae Evaluation Toolkit), an open-source, registry-based framework that unifies Korean LLM assessment. HRET integrates major Korean benchmarks, multiple inference backends, and multi-method evaluation, with language consistency enforcement to ensure genuine Korean outputs. Its modular registry design also enables rapid incorporation of new datasets, methods, and backends, ensuring the toolkit adapts to evolving research needs. Beyond standard accuracy metrics, HRET incorporates Korean-focused output analyses-morphology-aware Type-Token Ratio (TTR) for evaluating lexical diversity and systematic keyword-omission detection for identifying missing concepts-to provide diagnostic insights into language-specific behaviors. These targeted analyses help researchers pinpoint morphological and semantic shortcomings in model outputs, guiding focused improvements in Korean LLM development.</description>

      <title>Constitutive Manifold Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropic material properties like electrical and thermal conductivities of engineering composites exhibit variability due to inherent material heterogeneity and manufacturing uncertainties. As a tensorial quantity, they are represented as symmetric positive definite tensors, which live on a curved Riemannian manifold, and accurately modelling their stochastic nature requires preserving both their symmetric positive definite properties and spatial symmetries. To achieve this, uncertainties are parametrised into scale (strength) and rotation (orientation) components, modelled as independent random variables on a manifold structure derived from the maximum entropy principle. Further, the propagation of such stochastic tensors through physics-based simulations necessitates computationally efficient surrogate models, like neural networks. However, feedforward neural network architectures are not well-suited for SPD tensors, as directly using the tensor components as inputs fails to preserve their geometric properties, often leading to suboptimal results. To address this, we introduce the Constitutive Manifold Neural Network (CMNN), which is equipped with a preprocessing layer to map the SPD tensor from the curved manifold to the local tangent space, a flat vector space, preserving statistical information in the dataset. A case study on a steady-state heat conduction problem with stochastic anisotropic conductivity demonstrates that geometry-preserving preprocessing, such as logarithmic maps for scale information, significantly improves learning performance over conventional MLPs. These findings underscore the importance of manifold-aware techniques when working with tensor-valued data in engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Calculation of Photocarrier Generation from Optical Absorption for Time-domain Simulation of Optoelectronic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.06702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photocarrier generation rate in optoelectronic materials is often calculated using the Poynting vector in the frequency domain. However, this approach is not accurate in time-domain simulations of photoconductive devices because the instantaneous Poynting vector does not distinguish between power flux densities of optical and low-frequency electromagnetic fields. The latter is generated by photocurrents and is not supposed to contribute to the photocarrier generation since the corresponding photon energy is smaller than the bandgap energy of the optoelectronic material. This work proposes an optical absorption-based model to accurately calculate the generation rate in time-domain simulations. The proposed approach considers the material dispersion near the optical frequency corresponding to the bandgap energy of the optoelectronic material and calculates the instantaneous optical absorption from the polarization current density associated with this dispersion model. Numerical examples show that the proposed method is more accurate than the Poynting vector-based approach in calculating the instantaneous optical absorption. The method is further validated against experimental results via simulations of a photoconductive device, where the Poynting vector-based approach results in divergent carrier densities when the low-frequency fields are strong.</description>

      <title>Identifying Self-Amplifying Hypergraph Structures through Mathematical Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of self-amplifying structures for hypergraphs, positioning it as a key element for understanding propagation and internal reinforcement in complex systems. To quantify this phenomenon, we define the maximal amplification factor, a metric that captures how effectively a subhypergraph contributes to its own amplification. We then develop an optimization-based methodology to compute this measure. Building on this foundation, we tackle the problem of identifying the subhypergraph maximizing the amplification factor, formulating it as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To solve it efficiently, we propose an exact iterative algorithm with proven convergence guarantees. In addition, we report the results of extensive computational experiments on realistic synthetic instances, demonstrating both the relevance and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Finally, we present a case study on chemical reaction networks, including the Formose reaction and E. coli core metabolism, where our framework successfully identifies known and novel autocatalytic subnetworks, highlighting its practical relevance to systems chemistry and biology.</description>

      <title>Drivetrain simulation using variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes variational autoencoders (VAEs) to predict a vehicle's jerk signals from torque demand in the context of limited real-world drivetrain datasets. We implement both unconditional and conditional VAEs, trained on experimental data from two variants of a fully electric SUV with differing torque and drivetrain configurations. The VAEs synthesize jerk signals that capture characteristics from multiple drivetrain scenarios by leveraging the learned latent space. A performance comparison with baseline physics-based and hybrid models confirms the effectiveness of the VAEs, without requiring detailed system parametrization. Unconditional VAEs generate realistic jerk signals without prior system knowledge, while conditional VAEs enable the generation of signals tailored to specific torque inputs. This approach reduces the dependence on costly and time-intensive real-world experiments and extensive manual modeling. The results support the integration of generative models such as VAEs into drivetrain simulation pipelines, both for data augmentation and for efficient exploration of complex operational scenarios, with the potential to streamline validation and accelerate vehicle development.</description>

      <title>Transformer Encoder and Multi-features Time2Vec for Financial Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial prediction is a complex and challenging task of time series analysis and signal processing, expected to model both short-term fluctuations and long-term temporal dependencies. Transformers have remarkable success mostly in natural language processing using attention mechanism, which also influenced the time series community. The ability to capture both short and long-range dependencies helps to understand the financial market and to recognize price patterns, leading to successful applications of Transformers in stock prediction. Although, the previous research predominantly focuses on individual features and singular predictions, that limits the model's ability to understand broader market trends. In reality, within sectors such as finance and technology, companies belonging to the same industry often exhibit correlated stock price movements.
  In this paper, we develop a novel neural network architecture by integrating Time2Vec with the Encoder of the Transformer model. Based on the study of different markets, we propose a novel correlation feature selection method. Through a comprehensive fine-tuning of multiple hyperparameters, we conduct a comparative analysis of our results against benchmark models. We conclude that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art encoding methods such as positional encoding, and we also conclude that selecting correlation features enhance the accuracy of predicting multiple stock prices.</description>
