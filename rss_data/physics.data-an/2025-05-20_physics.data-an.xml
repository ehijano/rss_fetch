      <title>On the definition and importance of interpretability in scientific machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though neural networks trained on large data sets have been successfully used to describe and predict many physical phenomena, there is a sense among scientists that, unlike traditional scientific models, where relationships come packaged in the form of simple mathematical expressions, the findings of the neural network cannot be integrated into the body of scientific knowledge. Critics of ML's inability to produce human-understandable relationships have converged on the concept of "interpretability" as its point of departure from more traditional forms of science. As the growing interest in interpretability has shown, researchers in the physical sciences seek not just predictive models, but also to uncover the fundamental principles that govern a system of interest. However, clarity around a definition of interpretability and the precise role that it plays in science is lacking in the literature. In this work, we argue that researchers in equation discovery and symbolic regression tend to conflate the concept of sparsity with interpretability. We review key papers on interpretable ML from outside the scientific community and argue that, though the definitions and methods they propose can inform questions of interpretability for SciML, they are inadequate for this new purpose. Noting these deficiencies, we propose an operational definition of interpretability for the physical sciences. Our notion of interpretability emphasizes understanding of the mechanism over mathematical sparsity. Innocuous though it may seem, this emphasis on mechanism shows that sparsity is often unnecessary. It also questions the possibility of interpretable scientific discovery when prior knowledge is lacking. We believe a precise and philosophically informed definition of interpretability in SciML will help focus research efforts toward the most significant obstacles to realizing a data-driven scientific future.</description>

      <title>Universal Convergence Metric for Time-Resolved Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a model-independent, dimensionless metric for predicting optimal measurement duration in time-resolved Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) using early-time data. Built on a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) framework, the method reconstructs scattering profiles with quantified uncertainty, even from sparse or noisy measurements. Demonstrated on the EQSANS instrument at the Spallation Neutron Source, the approach generalizes to general SANS instruments with a two-dimensional detector. A key result is the discovery of a dimensionless convergence metric revealing a universal power-law scaling in profile evolution across soft matter systems. When time is normalized by a system-specific characteristic time $t^{\star}$, the variation in inferred profiles collapses onto a single curve with an exponent between $-2$ and $-1$. This trend emerges within the first ten time steps, enabling early prediction of measurement sufficiency. The method supports real-time experimental optimization and is especially valuable for maximizing efficiency in low-flux environments such as compact accelerator-based neutron sources.</description>

      <title>Workflows and Principles for Collaboration and Communication in Battery Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary collaboration in battery science is required for rapid evaluation of better compositions and materials. However, diverging domain vocabulary and non-compatible experimental results slow down cooperation. We critically assess the current state-of-the-art and develop a structured data management and interpretation system to make data curation sustainable. The techniques we utilize comprise ontologies to give a structure to knowledge, database systems tenable to the FAIR principles, and software engineering to break down data processing into verifiable steps. To demonstrate our approach, we study the applicability of the Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique on various electrodes. Our work is a building block in making automated material science scale beyond individual laboratories to a worldwide connected search for better battery materials.</description>

      <title>Poleval: A Python package for HAXPES analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: POLEVAL provides a software toolbox for collaborative, persistent and reproducible analysis of XPS experiments. It allows to treat, analyse and visualise the results of an extended experimental campaign in a single python notebook in a consistent manner. Managing experimental data in adequate objects enables experimentalists to process and analyse measurements in very few lines of code, so as to provide decision aids through online data analysis during e.g. beamtime experiments. The persistent and self-documentary style of the notebook-based analysis allows for easy communication of intermediate results and enables progressive refinements into publishable figures or exporting the results to other programs. The toolbox facilitates various routines for data treatment (normalization, cropping, etc.) and aggregation of spectra into groups to analyse trends. It also enables quantitative analysis with three major functions: First, normalization to the photoionization cross-section and probability of emission into the analyser cone allows for quantitative comparisons between intensities from different core levels. The integrated haxquantpy package allows easy retrieval of literature values for this purpose. Second, an extensive fitting functionality is implemented to treat groups of spectra together, rather than spectrum-by-spectrum. This grouping allows reinforcing the fit algorithm with prior knowledge, such as the equivalence of peak widths or positions between spectra, which enables for more consistent, and importantly, more confident fit results for sets of potentially noisy spectra. Third, a simple formalism to estimate the thickness of adsorbate layers based on the ratio between the substrate's and adsorbate's XPS signal is implemented.</description>

      <title>Characterizing nonlinear dynamics by contrastive cartography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The qualitative study of dynamical systems using bifurcation theory is key to understanding systems from biological clocks and neurons to physical phase transitions. Data generated from such systems can feature complex transients, an unknown number of attractors, and stochasticity. Characterization of these often-complicated behaviors remains challenging. Making an analogy to bifurcation analysis, which specifies that useful dynamical features are often invariant to coordinate transforms, we leverage contrastive learning to devise a generic tool to discover dynamical classes from stochastic trajectory data. By providing a model-free trajectory analysis tool, this method automatically recovers the dynamical phase diagram of known models and provides a "map" of dynamical behaviors for a large ensemble of dynamical systems. The method thus provides a way to characterize and compare dynamical trajectories without governing equations or prior knowledge of target behavior. We additionally show that the same strategy can be used to characterize the stochastic motion of bacteria, establishing that this approach can be used as a standalone analysis tool or as a component of a broader data-driven analysis framework for dynamical data.</description>

      <title>Low-dimensional representation of brain networks for seizure risk forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying preictal states -- periods during which seizures are more likely to occur -- remains a central challenge in clinical computational neuroscience. In this study, we introduce a novel framework that embeds functional brain connectivity networks, derived from intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings, into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. This compact representation captures essential topological features of brain dynamics and facilitates the detection of subtle connectivity changes preceding seizures. Using standard machine learning techniques, we define a dimensionless biomarker, $\mathcal{B}$, that discriminates between interictal (seizure-free) and preictal (within 24 hours of seizure) network states. Our method focuses on connectivity patterns among a subset of informative iEEG electrodes, enabling robust classification of brain states across time. We validate our approach using a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme and a pseudo-prospective forecasting strategy, assessing performance with metrics such as F1-score and balanced accuracy. Results show that low-dimensional Euclidean embeddings of iEEG connectivity yield interpretable and predictive markers of preictal activity, offering promising implications for real-time seizure forecasting and individualized therapeutic interventions.</description>

      <title>Regularized Fingerprinting with Linearly Optimal Weight Matrix in Detection and Attribution of Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate change detection and attribution play a central role in establishing the causal influence of human activities on global warming. The dominant framework, optimal fingerprinting, is a linear errors-in-variables model in which each covariate is subject to measurement error with covariance proportional to that of the regression error. The reliability of such analyses depends critically on accurate inference of the regression coefficients. The optimal weight matrix for estimating these coefficients is the precision matrix of the regression error, which is typically unknown and must be estimated from climate model simulations. However, existing regularized optimal fingerprinting approaches often yield underestimated uncertainties and overly narrow confidence intervals that fail to attain nominal coverage, thereby compromising the reliability of analysis. In this paper, we first propose consistent variance estimators for the regression coefficients within the class of linear shrinkage weight matrices, addressing undercoverage in conventional methods. Building on this, we derive a linearly optimal weight matrix that directly minimizes the asymptotic variances of the estimated scaling factors. Numerical studies confirm improved empirical coverage and shorter interval lengths. When applied to annual mean temperature data, the proposed method produces narrower, more reliable intervals and provides new insights into detection and attribution across different regions.</description>
