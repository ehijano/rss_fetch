      <title>The Bernoulli structure of discrete distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any discrete distribution with support on $\{0,\ldots, d\}$ can be constructed as the distribution of sums of Bernoulli variables. We prove that the class of $d$-dimensional Bernoulli variables $\boldsymbol{X}=(X_1,\ldots, X_d)$ whose sums $\sum_{i=1}^dX_i$ have the same distribution $p$ is a convex polytope $\mathcal{P}(p)$ and we analytically find its extremal points. Our main result is to prove that the Hausdorff measure of the polytopes $\mathcal{P}(p), p\in \mathcal{D}_d,$ is a continuous function $l(p)$ over $\mathcal{D}_d$ and it is the density of a finite measure $\mu_s$ on $\mathcal{D}_d$ that is Hausdorff absolutely continuous. We also prove that the measure $\mu_s$ normalized over the simplex $\mathcal{D}$ belongs to the class of Dirichlet distributions. We observe that the symmetric binomial distribution is the mean of the Dirichlet distribution on $\mathcal{D}$ and that when $d$ increases it converges to the mode.</description>

      <title>A connection between the random pinning model and random walks in sparse random environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this short note is to establish a connection between a one-dimensional random walk in a random sparse environment and the random pinning model. We show that the grand canonical partition function of the pinning model coincides with the mean number of returns to the origin for a random walk in a random sparse environment averaged on the randomness location. We obtain thereof some information on the integrability of the number of return times in the annealed and partially annealed setups.</description>

      <title>Chance constrained directional models in stochastic data envelopment analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new family of chance constrained directional models in stochastic data envelopment analysis, generalizing the deterministic directional models and the chance constrained radial models. We prove that chance constrained directional models define the same concept of stochastic efficiency as the one given by chance constrained radial models and, as a particular case, we obtain a stochastic version of the generalized Farrell measure. Finally, we give some examples of application of chance constrained directional models with stochastic and deterministic directions, showing that inefficiency scores obtained with stochastic directions are less or equal than those obtained considering deterministic directions whose values are the means of the stochastic ones.</description>

      <title>Quenched local limit theorem for a directed random walk on the backbone of a supercritical oriented percolation cluster for $d \ge 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we extend the quenched local limit theorem obtained by the authors in [BBDS23]. More precisely, we consider a directed random walk on the backbone of the supercritical oriented percolation cluster in dimensions $d+1$ with $d\geq 1$ being the spatial dimension. In [BBDS23] an annealed local central limit theorem was proven for all $d\geq 1$ and a quenched local limit theorem under the assumption $d\geq 3$. Here we show that the latter result also holds for all $d \ge 1$.</description>

      <title>Planting and MCMC Sampling from the Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from the ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on the random $d$-regular graph with parameter $\beta&gt;0$. A key difficulty that arises in sampling from the model is the existence of a metastability window $(\beta_u,\beta_u')$ where the distribution has two competing modes, the so-called disordered and ordered phases, causing MCMC-based algorithms to be slow mixing from worst-case initialisations.
  To this end, Helmuth, Jenssen and Perkins designed a sampling algorithm that works for all $\beta$ when $q$ is large, using cluster expansion methods; more recently, their analysis technique has been adapted to show that random-cluster dynamics mixes fast when initialised more judiciously. However, a bottleneck behind cluster-expansion arguments is that they inherently only work for large $q$, whereas it is widely conjectured that sampling is possible for all $q,d\geq 3$. The only result so far that applies to general $q,d\geq 3$ is by Blanca and Gheissari who showed that the random-cluster dynamics mixes fast for $\beta&lt;\beta_u$. For $\beta&gt;\beta_u$, certain correlation phenomena emerge because of the metastability which have been hard to handle, especially for small $q$ and $d$.
  Our main contribution is to perform a delicate analysis of the Potts distribution and the random-cluster dynamics that goes beyond the threshold $\beta_u$. We use planting as the main tool in our proofs, and combine it with the analysis of random-cluster dynamics. We are thus able to show that the random-cluster dynamics initialised from all-out mixes fast for all integers $q,d\geq 3$ beyond the uniqueness threshold $\beta_u$; our analysis works all the way up to the threshold $\beta_c\in (\beta_u,\beta_u')$ where the dominant mode switches from disordered to ordered. We also obtain an algorithm in the ordered regime $\beta&gt;\beta_c$ that refines significantly the range of $q,d$.</description>

      <title>On the moments of the mass of shrinking balls under the Critical $2d$ Stochastic Heat Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Critical $2d$ Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF) is a measure valued stochastic process on $\mathbb{R}^2$ that defines a non-trivial solution to the two-dimensional stochastic heat equation with multiplicative space-time noise. Its one-time marginals are a.s. singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure, meaning that the mass they assign to shrinking balls decays to zero faster than their Lebesgue volume. In this work we explore the intermittency properties of the Critical 2d SHF by studying the asymptotics of the $h$-th moment of the mass that it assigns to shrinking balls of radius $\epsilon$ and we determine that its ratio to the Lebesgue volume is of order $(\log\tfrac{1}{\epsilon})^{{h\choose 2}}$ up to possible lower order corrections.</description>

      <title>Opinion dynamics on dense dynamic random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two-opinion voter models on dense dynamic random graphs. Our goal is to understand and describe the occurrence of consensus versus polarisation over long periods of time. The former means that all vertices have the same opinion, the latter means that the vertices split into two communities with different opinions and few disagreeing edges. We consider three models for the joint dynamics of opinions and graphs: one with a one-way feedback and two which are co-evolutionary, i.e., with a two-way feedback. In the first model only coexistence is attainable, meaning that both opinions survive, but with the presence of many disagreeing edges. In the second model only consensus prevails, while in the third model polarisation is possible. Our main results are functional laws of large numbers for the densities of the two opinions, functional laws of large numbers for the dynamic random graphs in the space of graphons, and a characterisation of the limiting densities in terms of Beta-distributions. Our results are supported by simulations. To prove our results we develop a novel method that involves coupling the co-evolutionary process to a mimicking process with one-way feedback. We expect that this method can be extended to other dense co-evolutionary models.</description>

      <title>On independence and large deviations for sublinear expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove by counterexample that a large deviation principle established by Chen and Feng [{\em Comm. Statist. Theory Methods} {\bf 45} (2016), 400--412] in the framework of sublinear expectations is incorrect. That implies that the rate function cannot, in general, be obtained by computing the Fenchel transform of the cumulant generating function, as is the case for ordinary probabilities. We derive a corrected version of that result and show that the original presentation holds under a stronger independence assumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical two-dimensional Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF) is the scaling limit of the directed polymers in random environments and the noise-mollified Stochastic Heat Equation (SHE), at the critical dimension of two and near the critical temperature. The work of Caravenna, Sun, and Zygouras (2023) proved that the discrete polymers converge to a universal (model-independent) limit, thereby identifying the limit as the SHF. In this work, we take a different approach: We formulate a set of axioms for the SHF, prove the uniqueness in law under these axioms, and also prove the existence by showing that the noise-mollified SHE converges to the SHF under this formulation. The set consists of three axioms commonly seen in stochastic flows and one axiom about the first four moments of the SHF over every time interval.</description>

      <title>Voting by mail: a Markov chain model for managing the security risks of election systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scrutiny surrounding vote-by-mail (VBM) in the United States has increased in recent years, raising concerns about the integrity and security of absentee voting. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a dynamic mathematical modeling framework for performing a risk assessment of VBM processes. We introduce a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) to model the VBM process and assess election performance and risk with a novel layered network approach that considers the interplay between VBM processes, malicious and non-malicious threats, and security mitigations. The time-inhomogeneous DTMC framework captures dynamic risks and evaluates performance over time. The DTMC model accounts for a spectrum of outcomes, from unintended voter errors to sophisticated, targeted attacks, representing a significant advancement in the risk assessment of VBM planning and protection. A case study based on real-world data from Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, is used to evaluate the DTMC model. The analysis includes the development of attack scenarios to assess the system's resilience and the evaluation of security measures. The analysis suggests that ballot drop boxes and automatic ballot notification systems are crucial for ensuring secure and reliable operations.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Dyson expansions and stochastic Duistermaat-Heckman localization on loop spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a self-adjoint operator $H\geq 0$ and (appropriate) densely defined and closed operators $P_{1},\dots, P_{n}$ in a Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$, we provide a systematic study of bounded operators given by iterated integrals
  \begin{align}\label{oh}
  \int_{\{ 0\leq s_1\leq \dots\leq s_n\leq t\}}\mathrm{e}^{-s_1H}P_{1}\mathrm{e}^{-(s_2-s_1)H}P_{2}\cdots \mathrm{e}^{-(s_n-s_{n-1})H}P_{n} \mathrm{e}^{-(t-s_n)H}\, \mathrm{d} s_{1} \ldots \mathrm{d} s_{n},\quad t&gt;0.
  \end{align} These operators arise naturally in noncommutative geometry and the geometry of loop spaces. Using Fermionic calculus, we give a natural construction of an enlarged Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}^{(n)}$ and an analytic semigroup $\mathrm{e}^{-t (H^{(n)}+P^{(n)} )}$ thereon, such that $\mathrm{e}^{-t (H^{(n)}+P^{(n)} )}$ composed from the left with (essentially) a Fermionic integration gives precisely the above iterated operator integral. This formula allows to establish important regularity results for the latter, and to derive a stochastic representation for it, in case $H$ is a covariant Laplacian and the $P_{j}$'s are first-order differential operators. Finally, with $H$ given as the square of the Dirac operator on a spin manifold, this representation is used to derive a stochastic refinement of the Duistermaat-Heckman localization formula on the loop space of a spin manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectrum of the weighted sample covariance shows a asymptotic non random behavior when the dimension grows with the number of samples. In this setting, we prove that the asymptotic spectral distribution $F$ of the weighted sample covariance has a continuous density on $\mathbb{R}^*$. We address then the practical problem of numerically finding this density. We propose a procedure to compute it, to determine the support of $F$ and define an efficient grid on it. We use this procedure to design the $\textit{WeSpeR}$ algorithm, which estimates the spectral density and retrieves the true spectral covariance spectrum. Empirical tests confirm the good properties of the $\textit{WeSpeR}$ algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We compute asymptotic non-linear shrinkage formulas for covariance and precision matrix estimators for weighted sample covariances, in the spirit of Ledoit and P\'ech\'e. We detail explicitly the formulas for exponentially-weighted sample covariances. Those new tools pave a way for applying non-linear shrinkage methods on weighted sample covariance. We show experimentally the performance of the asymptotic shrinkage formulas. Finally, we test the robustness of the theory to a heavy-tailed distributions.</description>

      <title>Parallel Backpropagation for Inverse of a Convolution with Application to Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse of an invertible convolution is an important operation that comes up in Normalizing Flows, Image Deblurring, etc. The naive algorithm for backpropagation of this operation using Gaussian elimination has running time $O(n^3)$ where $n$ is the number of pixels in the image. We give a fast parallel backpropagation algorithm with running time $O(\sqrt{n})$ for a square image and provide a GPU implementation of the same. Inverse Convolutions are usually used in Normalizing Flows in the sampling pass, making them slow. We propose to use Inverse Convolutions in the forward (image to latent vector) pass of the Normalizing flow. Since the sampling pass is the inverse of the forward pass, it will use convolutions only, resulting in efficient sampling times. We use our parallel backpropagation algorithm for optimizing the inverse convolution layer resulting in fast training times also. We implement this approach in various Normalizing Flow backbones, resulting in our Inverse-Flow models. We benchmark Inverse-Flow on standard datasets and show significantly improved sampling times with similar bits per dimension compared to previous models.</description>

      <title>Near-critical dimers and massive SLE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.15717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the dimer model on the square and hexagonal lattices with doubly periodic weights. The purpose of this paper is threefold: (a) we establish a rigourous connection with the massive SLE$_2$ constructed by Makarov and Smirnov (and recently revisited by Chelkak and Wan); (b) we show that the convergence takes place in arbitrary bounded domains subject to Temperleyan boundary conditions, and that the scaling limit is universal; and (c) we prove conformal covariance of the scaling limit. For this we introduce an inhomogeneous near-critical dimer model, corresponding to a drift for the underlying random walk which is a smoothly varying vector field or alternatively to an inhomogeneous mass profile. When the vector field derives from a log-convex potential we prove that the corresponding loop-erased random walk has a universal scaling limit. Our techniques rely on an exact discrete Girsanov identity on the triangular lattice which may be of independent interest. We complement our results by stating precise conjectures making connections to a generalised Sine-Gordon model at the free fermion point.</description>

      <title>On nonlinear Markov processes in the sense of McKean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12424v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonlinear time-inhomogeneous Markov processes in the sense of McKean's seminal work [32]. These are given as families of laws $\mathbb{P}_{s,\zeta}$, $s\geq 0$, on path space, where $\zeta$ runs through a set of admissible initial probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this paper, we concentrate on the case where every $\mathbb{P}_{s,\zeta}$ is given as the path law of a solution to a McKean-Vlasov SDE, where the latter is allowed to have merely measurable coefficients, which in particular are not necessarily weakly continuous in the measure variable. Our main result is the identification of general and checkable conditions on such general McKean-Vlasov SDEs, which imply that the path laws of their solutions form a nonlinear Markov process. Our notion of nonlinear Markov property is in McKean's spirit, but more general in order to include processes whose one-dimensional time marginal densities solve a nonlinear parabolic PDE, more precisely, a nonlinear Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation, such as Burgers' equation, the porous media equation and variants thereof with transport-type drift, and also the very recently studied $2D$ vorticity Navier-Stokes equation and the $p$-Laplace equation. In all these cases, the associated McKean-Vlasov SDEs are such that both their diffusion and drift coefficients singularly depend (i.e. Nemytskii-type) on the one-dimensional time marginals of their solutions. We stress that for our main result the nonlinear Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations do not have to be well-posed. Thus, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between solution flows of a large class of nonlinear parabolic PDEs and nonlinear Markov processes.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis and $k$-spine decomposition of inhomogeneous branching Brownian motions. Genealogies in fully pushed fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of particles performing a one-dimensional dyadic branching Brownian motion with space-dependent branching rate, negative drift $-\mu$ and killed upon reaching $0$. More precisely, the particles branch at rate $r(x)=(1+W(x))/2,$ where $W$ is a compactly supported and non-negative smooth function and the drift $\mu$ is chosen in such a way that the system is critical in some sense. This particle system can be seen as an analytically tractable model for fluctuating fronts, describing the internal mechanisms driving the invasion of a habitat by a cooperating population. Recent studies from Birzu, Hallatschek and Korolev suggest the existence of three classes of fluctuating fronts: pulled, semi pushed and fully pushed fronts. Here, we focus on the fully pushed regime. We establish a Yaglom law for this branching process and prove that the genealogy of the particles converges to a Brownian Coalescent Point Process using a method of moments. In practice, the genealogy of the BBM is seen as a random marked metric measure space and we use spinal decomposition to prove its convergence in the Gromov-weak topology. We also carry the spectral decomposition of a differential operator related to the BBM to determine the invariant measure of the spine as well as its mixing time.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principle for slow-fast system with mixed fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on a slow-fast system perturbed by mixed fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in(1/2,1)$. The integral with respect to fractional Brownian motion is the generalized Riemann-Stieltjes integral and the integral with respect to Brownian motion is the standard It\^o integral. Our approach is based on the variational framework and the weak convergence criteria for mixed fractional Brownian motion. By combining the weak convergence method and Khasminskii's averaging principle, we show a large deviation principle for the slow component.</description>

      <title>Stationary measures and the continuous-state branching process conditioned on extinction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider continuous-state branching processes (CB processes) which become extinct almost surely. First, we tackle the problem of describing the stationary measures on $(0,+\infty)$ for such CB processes. We give a representation of the stationary measure in terms of scale functions of related L\'{e}vy processes. Then we prove that the stationary measure can be obtained from the vague limit of the potential measure, and, in the critical case, can also be obtained from the vague limit of a normalized transition probability. Next, we prove some limit theorems for the CB process conditioned on extinction in a near future and on extinction at a fixed time. We obtain non-degenerate limit distributions which are of the size-biased type of the stationary measure in the critical case and of the Yaglom's distribution in the subcritical case. Finally we explore some further properties of the limit distributions.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for $\sigma$-localized \'Emery convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a bounded sequence $\{X^{n}\}_{n}$ of semimartingales on a time interval $[0,T]$, we find a sequence of convex combinations $\{Y^{n}\}_{n}$ and a limiting semimartingale $Y$ such that $\{Y^{n}\}_{n}$ converges to $Y$ in a $\sigma$-localized modification of the \'Emery topology. More precisely, $\{Y^{n}\}_{n}$ converges to $Y$ in the \'Emery topology on an increasing sequence $\{D_{n}\}_{n}$ of predictable sets covering $\Omega\times[0,T]$. We also prove some technical variants of this theorem, including a version where the complement of $\{D_{n}\}_{n}$ forms a disjoint sequence. Applications include a complete characterization of sequences admitting convex combinations converging in the \'Emery topology, and a supermartingale counterpart of Helly's selection theorem.</description>

      <title>Mean Square Temporal error estimates for the 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with transport noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the 2D Navier-Stokes equation with transport noise subject to periodic boundary conditions. Our main result is an error estimate for the time-discretisation showing a convergence rate of order (up to) 1/2. It holds with respect to mean square error convergence, whereas previously such a rate for the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations was only known with respect to convergence in probability. Our result is based on uniform-in-probability estimates for the continuous as well as the time-discrete solution exploiting the particular structure of the noise.
  Eventually, we perform numerical simulations for the corresponding problem on bounded domains with no-slip boundary conditions. They suggest the same convergence rate as proved for the periodic problem hinging sensitively on the compatibility of the data. We also compare the energy profiles with those for corresponding problems with additive or multiplicative It\^o-type noise.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of dynamic implementations of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and No U-Turn Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is substantial empirical evidence about the success of dynamic implementations of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), such as the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), in many challenging inference problems but theoretical results about their behavior are scarce. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap. More precisely, we consider a general class of MCMC algorithms we call dynamic HMC. We show that this general framework encompasses NUTS as a particular case, implying the invariance of the target distribution as a by-product. Second, we establish conditions under which NUTS is irreducible and aperiodic and as a corrolary ergodic. Under conditions similar to the ones existing for HMC, we also show that NUTS is geometrically ergodic. Finally, we improve existing convergence results for HMC showing that this method is ergodic without any boundedness condition on the stepsize and the number of leapfrog steps, in the case where the target is a perturbation of a Gaussian distribution.</description>

      <title>Convergence to decorated L\'evy processes in non-Skorohod topologies for dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for weak convergence to decorated L\'evy processes in enriched spaces of c\`adl\`ag functions for vector-valued processes arising in deterministic systems. Applications include uniformly expanding maps and unbounded observables as well as nonuniformly expanding/hyperbolic maps with bounded observables. The latter includes intermittent maps and dispersing billiards with flat cusps. In many of these examples, convergence fails in all of the Skorohod topologies. Moreover, the enriched space picks up details of excursions that are not recorded by Skorohod or Whitt topologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theorem of Frieze from 1985 asserts that the total weight of the minimum spanning tree of the complete graph $K_n$ whose edges get independent weights from the distribution $UNIFORM[0,1]$ converges to Ap\'ery's constant in probability, as $n\to\infty$. We generalize this result to sequences of graphs $G_n$ that converge to a graphon $W$. Further, we allow the weights of the edges to be drawn from different distributions (subject to moderate conditions). The limiting total weight $\kappa(W)$ of the minimum spanning tree is expressed in terms of a certain branching process defined on $W$, which was studied previously by Bollob\'as, Janson and Riordan in connection with the giant component in inhomogeneous random graphs.</description>
