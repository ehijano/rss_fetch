      <title>Low-alpha Operation of the Iota Storage Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operation with ultra-low momentum-compaction factor (alpha) is a desirable capability for many storage rings and synchrotron radiation sources. For example, low-alpha lattices are commonly used to produce picosecond bunches for the generation of coherent THz radiation and are the basis of a number of conceptual designs for EUV generation via steady-state microbunching (SSMB). Achieving ultra-low alpha requires not only a high-level of stability in the linear optics but also flexible control of higher-order compaction terms. Operation with lower momentum-compaction lattices has recently been investigated at the IOTA storage ring at Fermilab. A procedure for lowering the ring compaction using the linear optics along with compensations from the higher-order magnets was developed with the aid of a model, and an experimental technique for measuring the momentum compaction was developed. The lowest momentum compaction achieved during the available run-time was $3.4\times10^{-4}$, around 15 times lower than previously operated. These feasibility studies ensure an improved experimental understanding of the IOTA optics and potentially will enable new research programs at the facility.</description>

      <title>cDVAE: Multimodal Generative Conditional Diffusion Guided by Variational Autoencoder Latent Embedding for Virtual 6D Phase Space Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imaging the 6D phase space of a beam in a particle accelerator in a single shot is currently impossible. Single shot beam measurements only exist for certain 2D beam projections and these methods are destructive. A virtual diagnostic that can generate an accurate prediction of a beam's 6D phase space would be incredibly useful for precisely controlling the beam. In this work, a generative conditional diffusion-based approach to creating a virtual diagnostic of all 15 unique 2D projections of a beam's 6D phase space is developed. The diffusion process is guided by a combination of scalar parameters and images that are converted to low-dimensional latent vector representation by a variational autoencoder (VAE). We demonstrate that conditional diffusion guided by VAE (cDVAE) can accurately reconstruct all 15 of the unique 2D projections of a charge particle beam's 6 phase space for the HiRES compact accelerator.</description>
