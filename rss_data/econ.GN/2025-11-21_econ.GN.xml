      <title>Abortion Bans and Young Women's Labor Supply: Evidence from the Dobbs Decision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the impact of the 2022 Dobbs decision and subsequent state level abortion bans on the labor supply of young women (ages 18-24). Using monthly CPS micro data from January 2021 to December 2023, I exploit cross state variation in post Dobbs abortion policy and estimate Difference-in-Differences (DiD) and Triple-Difference (DDD) models. In a simple DiD comparing young women in ban versus protected states, labor force participation in ban states rises by 3.6 percentage points, while participation among young men in the same states falls by 2.9 percentage points, suggesting that the female response is unlikely to be driven by stronger local labor demand. The preferred DDD specification with state-by-month and gender interacted fixed effects implies a 6.6 percentage point increase in labor force participation for young women in ban states relative to young men. School enrollment does not change significantly, whereas employment increases by about 3 percentage points. These results suggest that abortion bans are associated with an immediate increase in young women's labor market attachment, potentially shifting their short run focus toward current earnings rather than human capital accumulation.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Biases and the Evolutionary Origins of Zero-Sum Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why do maladaptive perceptions and norms, such as zero-sum interpretations of interaction, persist even when they undermine cooperation and investment? We develop a framework where bounded rationality and heterogeneous cognitive biases shape the evolutionary dynamics of norm coordination. Extending evolutionary game theory with quantal response equilibria and prospect-theoretic utility, we show that subjective evaluation of payoffs systematically alters population-level equilibrium selection, generating stable but inefficient attractors. Counterintuitively, our analysis demonstrates that the benefit of rationality and the cost of risk aversion on welfare behave in nonmonotone ways: intermediate precision enhances coordination, while excessive precision or strong loss aversion leads to persistent lock-in at low-payoff and zero-sum equilibria. These dynamics produce an endogenous equity-efficiency trade-off: parameter configurations that raise aggregate welfare also increase inequality, while more equal distributions are associated with lower efficiency. The results highlight how distorted payoff perceptions can anchor societies in divergent institutional trajectories, offering a behavioral-evolutionary explanation for persistent zero-sum norms and inequality.</description>

      <title>Sovereign AI: Rethinking Autonomy in the Age of Global Interdependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a foundational general-purpose technology, raising new dilemmas of sovereignty in an interconnected world. While governments seek greater control over it, the very foundations of AI--global data pipelines, semiconductor supply chains, open-source ecosystems, and international standards--resist enclosure. This paper develops a conceptual and formal framework for understanding sovereign AI as a continuum rather than a binary condition, balancing autonomy with interdependence. Drawing on classical theories, historical analogies, and contemporary debates on networked autonomy, we present a planner's model that identifies two policy heuristics: equalizing marginal returns across the four sovereignty pillars and setting openness where global benefits equal exposure risks.
  We apply the model to India, highlighting sovereign footholds in data, compute, and norms but weaker model autonomy. The near-term challenge is integration via coupled Data x Compute investment, lifecycle governance (ModelOps), and safeguarded procurement. We then apply the model to the Middle East (Saudi Arabia and the UAE), where large public investment in Arabic-first models and sovereign cloud implies high sovereignty weights, lower effective fiscal constraints, and strong Data x Compute complementarities. An interior openness setting with guardrails emerges as optimal. Across contexts, the lesson is that sovereignty in AI needs managed interdependence, not isolation.</description>

      <title>Tracking financial crime through code and law: a review of regtech applications in anti-money laundering and terrorism financing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regulatory technology (RegTech) is transforming financial compliance by integrating advanced information technologies to strengthen anti money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML CFT) frameworks. Recent literature suggests that such technologies represent more than just an efficiency tool; they mark a paradigm shift in regulation and the evolution of financial oversight (Kurum, 2023). This paper aims to provide a narrative review of recent RegTech applications in financial crime prevention, with a focus on key compliance domains. A structured literature review was conducted to examine publications between 2020 and 2024 with a thematic synthesis of findings related to customer due diligence (CDD) and know your customer (KYC), transaction monitoring, regulatory reporting and compliance automation, information sharing and cross border cooperation, as well as cost efficiency. Findings reveal that RegTech solutions give financial institutions more responsibility for detecting and managing financial crime risks, making them more active players in compliance processes traditionally overseen by regulators. The combined use of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and big data also generates synergistic effects that improve compliance outcomes beyond what these technologies achieve individually. This demonstrates the strategic relevance of integrated RegTech approaches.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence and Accounting Research: A Framework and Agenda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), are fundamentally transforming accounting research, creating both opportunities and competitive threats for scholars. This paper proposes a framework that classifies AI-accounting research along two dimensions: research focus (accounting-centric versus AI-centric) and methodological approach (AI-based versus traditional methods). We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow. This analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it simultaneously intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable. These shifts call for reforming doctoral education to cultivate comparative advantages while building AI fluency.</description>

      <title>Quantile Selection in the Gender Pay Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to estimate selection-corrected quantiles of the gender wage gap. Our method employs instrumental variables that explain variation in the latent variable but, conditional on the latent process, do not directly affect selection. We provide semiparametric identification of the quantile parameters without imposing parametric restrictions on the selection probability, derive the asymptotic distribution of the proposed estimator based on constrained selection probability weighting, and demonstrate how the approach applies to the Roy model of labor supply. Using German administrative data, we analyze the distribution of the gender gap in full-time earnings. We find pronounced positive selection among women at the lower end, especially those with less education, which widens the gender gap in this segment, and strong positive selection among highly educated men at the top, which narrows the gender wage gap at upper quantiles.</description>

      <title>Effect of State and Local Sexual Orientation Anti-Discrimination Laws on Labor Market Differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03794v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents quasi-experimental research examining the effect of both local and state anti-discrimination laws on sexual orientation on the labor supply and wages of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) workers. To do so, we use the American Community Survey data on household composition to infer sexual orientation and combine this with a unique panel dataset on state and local anti-discrimination laws. Leveraging variation in law implementation across localities over time and between same-sex and different-sex couples, we find that anti-discrimination laws significantly narrow gaps in labor force participation and employment for men in same-sex couples relative to men in different-sex couples, and also increase their percentile rank in the wage distribution. Our analysis reveals mostly null effects for female same-sex couples; however, in metropolitan areas these laws significantly reduce their employment compared to women in different-sex couples. One explanation for the reduced labor supply is that female same-sex couples begin to have more children in response to the laws. Finally, we present evidence that state anti-discrimination laws significantly and persistently increased support for same-sex marriage. This research shows that anti-discrimination laws can be an effective policy tool for reducing labor market inequalities across sexual orientation and improving sentiment toward LGB Americans.</description>

      <title>Generative AI, Managerial Expectations, and Economic Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03897v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use generative AI to extract managerial expectations about their economic outlook from 120,000+ corporate conference call transcripts. The resulting AI Economy Score predicts GDP growth, production, and employment up to 10 quarters ahead, beyond existing measures like survey forecasts. Moreover, industry and firm-level measures provide valuable information about sector-specific and individual firm activities. A composite measure that integrates managerial expectations about firm, industry, and macroeconomic conditions further significantly improves the forecasting power and predictive horizon of national and sectoral growth. Our findings show managerial expectations offer unique insights into economic activity, with implications for both macroeconomic and microeconomic decision-making.</description>
