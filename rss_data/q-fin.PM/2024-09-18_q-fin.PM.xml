      <title>Optimal Investment with Costly Expert Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Merton problem of optimizing expected power utility of terminal wealth in the case of an unobservable Markov-modulated drift. What makes the model special is that the agent is allowed to purchase costly expert opinions of varying quality on the current state of the drift, leading to a mixed stochastic control problem with regular and impulse controls involving random consequences. Using ideas from filtering theory, we first embed the original problem with unobservable drift into a full information problem on a larger state space. The value function of the full information problem is characterized as the unique viscosity solution of the dynamic programming PDE. This characterization is achieved by a new variant of the stochastic Perron's method, which additionally allows us to show that, in between purchases of expert opinions, the problem reduces to an exit time control problem which is known to admit an optimal feedback control. Under the assumption of sufficient regularity of this feedback map, we are able to construct optimal trading and expert opinion strategies.</description>

      <title>Decomposition Pipeline for Large-Scale Portfolio Optimization with Applications to Near-Term Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrially relevant constrained optimization problems, such as portfolio optimization and portfolio rebalancing, are often intractable or difficult to solve exactly. In this work, we propose and benchmark a decomposition pipeline targeting portfolio optimization and rebalancing problems with constraints. The pipeline decomposes the optimization problem into constrained subproblems, which are then solved separately and aggregated to give a final result. Our pipeline includes three main components: preprocessing of correlation matrices based on random matrix theory, modified spectral clustering based on Newman's algorithm, and risk rebalancing. Our empirical results show that our pipeline consistently decomposes real-world portfolio optimization problems into subproblems with a size reduction of approximately 80%. Since subproblems are then solved independently, our pipeline drastically reduces the total computation time for state-of-the-art solvers. Moreover, by decomposing large problems into several smaller subproblems, the pipeline enables the use of near-term quantum devices as solvers, providing a path toward practical utility of quantum computers in portfolio optimization.</description>
