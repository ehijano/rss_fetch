      <title>QoS-Aware and Routing-Flexible Network Slicing for Service-Oriented Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the network slicing (NS) problem which attempts to map multiple customized virtual network requests (also called services) to a common shared network infrastructure and manage network resources to meet diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements. We propose a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation for the considered NS problem that can flexibly route the traffic flow of the services on multiple paths and provide end-to-end delay and reliability guarantees for all services. To overcome the computational difficulty due to the intrinsic nonlinearity in the MINLP formulation, we transform the MINLP formulation into an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation and further show that their continuous relaxations are equivalent. In sharp contrast to the continuous relaxation of the MINLP formulation which is a nonconvex nonlinear programming problem, the continuous relaxation of the MILP formulation is a polynomial-time solvable linear programming problem, which significantly facilitates the algorithmic design. Based on the newly proposed MILP formulation, we develop a customized column generation (cCG) algorithm for solving the NS problem. The proposed cCG algorithm is a decomposition-based algorithm and is particularly suitable for solving large-scale NS problems. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed formulations and the proposed cCG algorithm.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Aided Multiuser Communication: Co-design of Transmit Diversity and Active/Passive Precoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has become a cost-effective solution for constructing a smart and adaptive radio environment. Most previous works on IRS have jointly designed the active and passive precoding based on perfectly or partially known channel state information (CSI). However, in delay-sensitive or high-mobility communications, it is imperative to explore more effective methods for leveraging IRS to enhance communication reliability without the need for any CSI. In this paper, we investigate an innovative IRS-aided multiuser communication system, which integrates an IRS with its aided multi-antenna base station (BS) to simultaneously serve multiple high-mobility users through transmit diversity and multiple low-mobility users through active/passive precoding. In specific, we first reveal that when dynamically tuning the IRS's common phase-shift shared with all reflecting elements, its passive precoding gain to any low-mobility user remains unchanged. Inspired by this property, we utilize the design of common phase-shift at the IRS for achieving transmit diversity to serve high-mobility users, yet without requiring any CSI at the BS. Meanwhile, the active/passive precoding design is incorporated into the IRS-integrated BS to serve low-mobility users (assuming the CSI is known). Then, taking into account the interference among different users, we formulate and solve a joint optimization problem of the IRS's reflect precoding and the BS's transmit precoding, with the aim of minimizing the total transmit power at the BS.</description>

      <title>A New Upper Bound for Distributed Hypothesis Testing Using the Auxiliary Receiver Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper employs the add-and-subtract technique of the auxiliary receiver approach to establish a new upper bound for the distributed hypothesis testing problem. This new bound has fewer assumptions than the upper bound proposed by Rahman and Wagner, is at least as tight as the bound by Rahman and Wagner, and outperforms it in specific scenarios, particularly in the Gaussian setting.</description>

      <title>Design of wavelet filter banks for any dilation using Extended Laplacian Pyramid Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new method for designing wavelet filter banks for any dilation matrices and in any dimension. Our approach utilizes extended Laplacian pyramid matrices to achieve this flexibility. By generalizing recent tight wavelet frame construction methods based on the sum of squares representation, we introduce the sum of vanishing products (SVP) condition, which is significantly easier to satisfy. These flexible design methods rely on our main results, which establish the equivalence between the SVP and mixed unitary extension principle conditions. Additionally, we provide illustrative examples to showcase our main findings.</description>

      <title>D2D Coded Caching from Two Classes of Optimal DPDAs using Cross Resolvable Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coded caching in a wireless device-to-device (D2D) network was first studied by Ji \textit{et al.} in [4] (referred to as the JCM scheme). In a D2D network, a central server first places the data in the user cache memories and all the user's demands are served by inter-user coded multicast transmissions. Low subpacketization level D2D coded caching schemes are desirable for practical implementations. Wang \textit{et al.} in [7] proposed an array called D2D placement delivery array (DPDA) which characterizes the placement phase and the delivery phase in a D2D network. A lower bound on the transmission load of a DPDA is derived and only the JCM scheme achieves this lower bound, but requires a subpacketization level that grows exponentially with the number of users. Low subpacketization level D2D schemes can be obtained by constructing appropriate DPDAs. In this paper, we propose two new classes of DPDA constructions that give low subpacketization level D2D schemes using cross resolvable designs. The first class of constructed DPDA achieves the known lower bound on the transmission load of DPDA while requiring a subpacketization level lesser than that of the JCM scheme. We propose another lower bound on the transmission load of a DPDA and show that the second class of constructed DPDA achieves this lower bound.</description>

      <title>A New Twist on Low-Complexity Digital Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel low-complexity digital backpropagation (DBP) method, with the goal of optimizing the trade-off between backpropagation accuracy and complexity. The method combines a split step Fourier method (SSFM)-like structure with a simplifed logarithmic perturbation method to obtain a high accuracy with a small number of DBP steps. Subband processing and asymmetric steps with optimized splitting ratio are also employed to further reduce the number of steps. The first part of the manuscript is dedicated to the derivation of a simplified logaritmic-perturbation model for the propagation of a dual-polarization multiband signal in a fiber, which serves as a theoretical background for the development of the proposed coupled-band enhanced SSFM (CBESSFM). Next, the manuscript presents a digital signal processing algorithm for the implementation of DBP based on a discrete-time version of the model and an overlap-and-save processing strategy. A detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm is also presented. Finally, the performance and complexity of the proposed DBP method are investigated through numerical simulations. In a wavelength division multiplexing system over a 15 x 80km single mode fiber link, the proposed CB-ESSFM achieves a gain of about 1 dB over simple dispersion compensation with only 15 steps (corresponding to about 680 real multiplications per 2D symbol), with an improvement of 0.9 dB w.r.t. conventional SSFM and almost 0.4 dB w.r.t. our previously proposed ESSFM. Significant gains are obtained also at lower complexity. For instance, the gain reduces to a still significant value of 0.34 dB when a single DBP step is employed, requiring just 75 real multiplications per 2D symbol. A similar analysis is performed also for longer links, confirming the good performance of the proposed method w.r.t. the others.</description>

      <title>Near-field Beam Focusing under Discrete Phase Shifters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale arrays (XL-arrays) have emerged as a promising technology for enabling near-field communications in future wireless systems. However, the huge number of antennas pose demanding challenges on the hardware cost and energy consumption, especially when the antennas employ high-resolution phase shifters (PSs). To address this issue, in this paper, we consider discrete PSs at the XL-array which are practically more energy efficient, and investigate the impact of PS resolution on the near-field beam-focusing effect. To this end, we propose a new Fourier series expansion method to efficiently tackle the difficulty in characterising the beam pattern properties under phase quantization. Interestingly, we analytically show, for the first time, that 1) discrete PSs introduce additional grating lobes; 2) the main lobe still exhibits the beam-focusing effect with its beam power increasing with PS resolution; and 3) there are two types of grating lobes, featured by the beam-focusing and beam-steering effects, respectively. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the grating lobes generally degrade the communication performance. However, a low-resolution of 3-bit PSs can achieve similar beam pattern and rate performance with the continuous PS counterpart, while it attains much higher energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting for Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Performance Analysis and Generative AI Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14702v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) provides a ubiquitous coverage to user equipments (UEs) but it is also susceptible to interference. Ratesplitting (RS) effectively extracts data by decoding interference, yet its effectiveness is limited by the weakest UE. In this paper, we investigate an RS-based CF massive MIMO system, which combines strengths and mitigates weaknesses of both approaches. Considering imperfect channel state information (CSI) resulting from both pilot contamination and noise, we derive a closed-form expression for the sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the RS-based CF massive MIMO system under a spatially correlated Rician channel. Moreover, we propose low-complexity heuristic algorithms based on statistical CSI for power-splitting of common messages and power-control of private messages, and genetic algorithm is adopted as a solution for upper bound performance. Furthermore, we formulate a joint optimization problem, aiming to maximize the sum SE of the RS-based CF massive MIMO system by optimizing the power-splitting factor and power-control coefficient. Importantly, we improve a generative AI (GAI) algorithm to address this complex and nonconvexity problem by using a diffusion model to obtain solutions. Simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness and practicality in mitigating interference, especially in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Shannon Bounds for Quadratic Rate-Distortion Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Shannon lower bound has been the subject of several important contributions by Berger. This paper surveys Shannon bounds on rate-distortion problems under mean-squared error distortion with a particular emphasis on Berger's techniques. Moreover, as a new result, the Gray-Wyner network is added to the canon of settings for which such bounds are known. In the Shannon bounding technique, elegant lower bounds are expressed in terms of the source entropy power. Moreover, there is often a complementary upper bound that involves the source variance in such a way that the bounds coincide in the special case of Gaussian statistics. Such pairs of bounds are sometimes referred to as Shannon bounds. The present paper puts Berger's work on many aspects of this problem in the context of more recent developments, encompassing indirect and remote source coding such as the CEO problem, originally proposed by Berger, as well as the Gray-Wyner network as a new contribution.</description>

      <title>Unsourced Random Access: A Recent Paradigm for Massive Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth generation and beyond communication systems are expected to enable communications of a massive number of machine-type devices. The traffic generated by some of these devices will significantly deviate from those in conventional communication scenarios. For instance, for applications where a massive number of cheap sensors communicate with a base station (BS), the devices will only be sporadically active and there will be no coordination among them or with the BS. For such systems requiring massive random access solutions, a new paradigm called unsourced random access (URA) has been proposed. In URA, all the users employ the same codebook and there is no user identity during the data transmission phase. The destination is only interested in the list of messages being sent from the set of active users. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing URA solutions with an emphasis on the state-of-the-art, covering both algorithmic and information-theoretic aspects. Moreover, we provide future research directions and challenges, and describe some potential methods of addressing them.</description>

      <title>AlphaZip: Neural Network-Enhanced Lossless Text Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data compression continues to evolve, with traditional information theory methods being widely used for compressing text, images, and videos. Recently, there has been growing interest in leveraging Generative AI for predictive compression techniques. This paper introduces a lossless text compression approach using a Large Language Model (LLM). The method involves two key steps: first, prediction using a dense neural network architecture, such as a transformer block; second, compressing the predicted ranks with standard compression algorithms like Adaptive Huffman, LZ77, or Gzip. Extensive analysis and benchmarking against conventional information-theoretic baselines demonstrate that neural compression offers improved performance.</description>

      <title>End-User-Centric Collaborative MIMO: Performance Analysis and Proof of Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trend toward using increasingly large arrays of antenna elements continues. However, fitting more antennas into the limited space available on user equipment (UE) within the currently popular Frequency Range 1 spectrum presents a significant challenge. This limitation constrains the capacity scaling gains for end users, even when networks can support a higher number of antennas. To address this issue, we explore a user-centric collaborative MIMO approach, termed UE-CoMIMO, which leverages several fixed or portable devices within a personal area to form a virtually expanded antenna array. This paper develops a comprehensive mathematical framework to analyze the performance of UE-CoMIMO. Our analytical results demonstrate that UE-CoMIMO can significantly enhance the system's effective channel response within the current communication system without requiring extensive modifications. Further performance improvements can be realized by optimizing the phase shifters on the expanded antenna arrays at the collaborative devices. These findings are corroborated by ray-tracing simulations. Beyond the simulations, we implemented these collaborative devices and successfully conducted over-the-air validation in a real 5G environment, showcasing the practical potential of UE-CoMIMO. Several practical perspectives are discussed, highlighting the feasibility and benefits of this approach in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Reliable and Secure Communications Through Compact Ultra-Massive Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact Ultramassive Antenna Array (CUMA) is a pioneering paradigm that leverages the flexibility of the Fluid Antenna System (FAS) to enable a simple multiple access scheme for massive connectivity without the need for precoding, power control at the base station or interference mitigation in each user's equipment. In order to overcome the mathematical intricacy required to analyze their performance, we use an asymptotic matching approach to relax such complexity with a remarkable accuracy. First, we analyze the performance of the CUMA network in terms of the outage probability (OP) and the ergodic rate (ER), deriving simple and highly accurate closed-form approximations to the channel statistics. Then, we evaluate the potential of the CUMA scheme to provide secure multi-user communications from a physical layer security perspective. Leveraging a tight approximation to the signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR) distribution, we derive closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP). We observe that the baseline CUMA (without side information processing) exhibits limited performance when eavesdroppers are equipped with a CUMA of the same type. To improve their secure performance, we suggest that a simple imperfect interference cancellation mechanism at the legitimate receiver may substantially increase the secrecy performance. Monte Carlo simulations validate our approximations and demonstrate their accuracy under different CUMA-based scenarios.</description>

      <title>Reduced bit median quantization: A middle process for Efficient Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image compression techniques have made remarkable progress when it comes to file size reduction with a tolerable quality reduction; nonetheless, they are facing some challenges when it comes to applying more compression with the same perceptible quality or in accounting for specific use cases such as deep archive files and more efficient image transfers. Previous techniques have tried to solve the former problem by applying one specific or a combination of different algorithms. However, none of these methods were able to achieve additional file size reduction beyond a certain compression. We introduce Reduced Bit Median Quantization (RBMQ), a middle-process image compression technique designed to enhance file size reduction so that it can be stored with already existing file extension formats.in RBMQ by applying only the first step in which the quantization of valued further file size reduction can be achieved without a noticeable decrease in the image quality. Furthermore, more size reduction can be achieved by reducing the representing bits for the quantized values which can be optimal for deep archival storage or big-size image transfer in which the image quality is not suitable for the human eye since it is dark and dim but can be much efficient to interact with network and storage components later to be decoded to get the only quantized value image that almost the same quality with the original one. RBMQ introduces redundancy to the pixel values to be taken advantage of by existing compression techniques furthermore it introduces bit reduction from 8 to 5 bits for image file extensions such as jpeg which substantially reduces the file size to be used for JPEG file transfers and deep archive storage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to machine learning algorithm design based on information theory, specifically mutual information (MI). We propose a framework for learning and representing functional relationships in data using MI-based features. Our method aims to capture the underlying structure of information in datasets, enabling more efficient and generalizable learning algorithms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved performance in tasks such as function classification, regression, and cross-dataset transfer. This work contributes to the growing field of metalearning and automated machine learning, offering a new perspective on how to leverage information theory for algorithm design and dataset analysis and proposing new mutual information theoretic foundations to learning algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $n$ be an odd positive integer and $p$ be an odd prime with $p\equiv 3\ ({\rm{mod}}\ 4)$. In this paper, we study the differential properties of the function $F_{2,u}(x)=x^2\big(1+u\eta(x)\big)$ over $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, where $u\in\mathbb{F}_{p^n}^*$ and $\eta$ is the quadratic character of $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$. We determine the differential uniformity of $F_{2,u}$ for any $u\in\mathbb{F}_{p^n}^*$ and determine the differential spectrum and boomerang uniformity of the locally-APN function $F_{2,\pm 1}$.</description>

Abstract: Let B be a spacetime region of width 2R &gt; 0, and \phi a vector state localized in B. We show that the vacuum relative entropy of \phi, on the local von Neumann algebra of B, is bounded by 2\pi R-times the energy of the state \phi in B. This bound is model-independent and rigorous; it follows solely from first principles in the framework of translation covariant, local Quantum Field Theory on the Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>A Further Investigation on Complete Complementary Codes from $q$-ary Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research focuses on constructing $q$-ary functions for complete complementary codes (CCCs) with flexible parameters. Most existing work has primarily identified sufficient conditions for $q$-ary functions related to $q$-ary CCCs. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to establish both the necessary and sufficient conditions for $q$-ary functions, encompassing most existing CCCs constructions as special cases. For $q$-ary CCCs with a length of $q^m$ and a set size of $q^{n+1}$, we begin by analyzing the necessary and sufficient conditions for $q$-ary functions defined over the domain $\mathbb{Z}_q^m$. Additionally, we construct CCCs with lengths given by $L = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{m_i}$, set sizes given by $K = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{n_i+1}$, and an alphabet size of $\nu = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i$, where $p_1 &lt; p_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; p_k$. To achieve these specific parameters, we examine the necessary and sufficient conditions for $\nu$-ary functions over the domain $\mathbf{Z}_{p_1}^{m_1} \times \cdots \times \mathbf{Z}_{p_k}^{m_k}$, which is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}_{\nu}^m$ and contains $\prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{m_i}$ vectors. In this context, $\mathbf{Z}_{p_i}^{m_i} = \{0, 1, \ldots, p_i - 1\}^{m_i}$, and $m$ is the sum of $m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_k$. The $q$-ary and $\nu$-ary functions allow us to cover all possible length sequences. However, we find that the proposed $\nu$-ary functions are more suitable for generating CCCs with a length of $L = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{m_i}$, particularly when $m_i$ is coprime to $m_j$ for some $1 \leq i \neq j \leq k$. While the proposed $q$-ary functions can also produce CCCs of the same length $L$, the set size and alphabet size become as large as $L$, since in this case, the only choice for $q$ is $L$. In contrast, the proposed $\nu$-ary functions yield CCCs with a more flexible set size $K\leq L$ and an alphabet size of $\nu&lt;L$.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Classical Wireless Communication and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rydberg atomic quantum receiver (RAQR) is an emerging quantum precision sensing platform designed for receiving radio frequency (RF) signals. It relies on creation of Rydberg atoms from normal atoms by exciting one or more electrons to a very high energy level, which in turn makes the atom sensitive to RF signals. The RAQR realizes RF-to-optical conversion based on light-atom interaction relying on the so called electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and Aulter-Townes splitting (ATS), so that the desired RF signal can be read out optically. The large dipole moments of Rydberg atoms associated with rich choices of Rydberg states and various modulation schemes facilitate an ultra-high sensitivity ($\sim$ nV/cm/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$) and an ultra-broadband tunability (near direct-current to Terahertz). RAQRs also exhibit compelling scalability and lend themselves to the construction of innovative, compact receivers. Initial experimental studies have demonstrated their capabilities in classical wireless communications and sensing. To fully harness their potential in a wide variety of applications, we commence by outlining the underlying fundamentals of Rydberg atoms, followed by the principles, structures, and theories of RAQRs. Finally, we conceive Rydberg atomic quantum single-input single-output (RAQ-SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (RAQ-MIMO) schemes for facilitating the integration of RAQRs with classical wireless systems, and conclude with a set of potent research directions.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled Data Collection for IoT Networks via Rainbow Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) assisted Internet of things (IoT) systems have become an important part of future wireless communications. To achieve higher communication rate, the joint design of UAV trajectory and resource allocation is crucial. This letter considers a scenario where a multi-antenna UAV is dispatched to simultaneously collect data from multiple ground IoT nodes (GNs) within a time interval. To improve the sum data collection (SDC) volume, i.e., the total data volume transmitted by the GNs, the UAV trajectory, the UAV receive beamforming, the scheduling of the GNs, and the transmit power of the GNs are jointly optimized. Since the problem is non-convex and the optimization variables are highly coupled, it is hard to solve using traditional optimization methods. To find a near-optimal solution, a double-loop structured optimization-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm and a fully DRL-based algorithm are proposed to solve the problem effectively. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithms outperform two benchmarks with significant improvement in SDC volumes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hellinger distance between quantum states is a significant measure in quantum information theory, known for its Riemannian and monotonic properties. It is also easier to compute than the Bures distance, another measure that shares these properties. In this work, we derive the mean and variance of the Hellinger distance between pairs of density matrices, where one or both matrices are random. Along the way, we also obtain exact results for the mean affinity and mean square affinity. The first two cumulants of the Hellinger distance allow us to propose an approximation for the corresponding probability density function based on the gamma distribution. Our analytical results are corroborated through Monte Carlo simulations, showing excellent agreement.</description>

Abstract: Transfer entropy is used to establish a measure of causal relationships between two variables. Symbolic transfer entropy, as an estimation method for transfer entropy, is widely applied due to its robustness against non-stationarity. This paper investigates the embedding dimension parameter in symbolic transfer entropy and proposes optimization methods for high complexity in extreme cases with complex data. Additionally, it offers some perspectives on estimation methods for transfer entropy.</description>

      <title>Testing Dependency of Weighted Random Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14870v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the task of detecting the edge dependency between two weighted random graphs. We formulate this task as a simple hypothesis testing problem, where under the null hypothesis, the two observed graphs are statistically independent, whereas under the alternative, the edges of one graph are dependent on the edges of a uniformly and randomly vertex-permuted version of the other graph. For general edge-weight distributions, we establish thresholds at which optimal testing becomes information-theoretically possible or impossible, as a function of the total number of nodes in the observed graphs and the generative distributions of the weights. Finally, we identify a statistical-computational gap, and present evidence suggesting that this gap is inherent using the framework of low-degree polynomials.</description>

      <title>Novel Gradient Sparsification Algorithm via Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Error accumulation is an essential component of the Top-$k$ sparsification method in distributed gradient descent. It implicitly scales the learning rate and prevents the slow-down of lateral movement, but it can also deteriorate convergence. This paper proposes a novel sparsification algorithm called regularized Top-$k$ (RegTop-$k$) that controls the learning rate scaling of error accumulation. The algorithm is developed by looking at the gradient sparsification as an inference problem and determining a Bayesian optimal sparsification mask via maximum-a-posteriori estimation. It utilizes past aggregated gradients to evaluate posterior statistics, based on which it prioritizes the local gradient entries. Numerical experiments with ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10 show that at $0.1\%$ sparsification, RegTop-$k$ achieves about $8\%$ higher accuracy than standard Top-$k$.</description>

      <title>Locality vs Quantum Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proves optimal tradeoffs between the locality and parameters of quantum error-correcting codes. Quantum codes give a promising avenue towards quantum fault tolerance, but the practical constraint of locality limits their quality. The seminal Bravyi-Poulin-Terhal (BPT) bound says that a $[[n,k,d]]$ quantum stabilizer code with 2D-locality must satisfy $kd^2\le O(n)$. We answer the natural question: for better code parameters, how much "non-locality" is needed? In particular, (i) how long must the long-range interactions be, and (ii) how many long-range interactions must there be?
  We give a complete answer to both questions for all $n,k,d$: above the BPT bound, any 2D-embedding must have at least $\Omega(\#^*)$ interactions of length $\Omega(\ell^*)$, where $\#^*= \max(k,d)$ and $\ell^*=\max\big(\frac{d}{\sqrt{n}}, \big( \frac{kd^2}{n} \big)^{1/4} \big)$. Conversely, we exhibit quantum codes that show, in strong ways, that our interaction length $\ell^*$ and interaction count $\#^*$ are asymptotically optimal for all $n,k,d$.
  Our results generalize or improve all prior works on this question, including the BPT bound and the results of Baspin and Krishna. One takeaway of our work is that, for any desired distance $d$ and dimension $k$, the number of long-range interactions is asymptotically minimized by a good qLDPC code of length $\Theta(\max(k,d))$. Following Baspin and Krishna, we also apply our results to the codes implemented in the stacked architecture and obtain better bounds. In particular, we rule out any implementation of hypergraph product codes in the stacked architecture.</description>

      <title>Information Decomposition Diagrams Applied beyond Shannon Entropy: A Generalization of Hu's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09393v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In information theory, one major goal is to find useful functions that summarize the amount of information contained in the interaction of several random variables. Specifically, one can ask how the classical Shannon entropy, mutual information, and higher interaction information relate to each other. This is answered by Hu's theorem, which is widely known in the form of information diagrams: it relates shapes in a Venn diagram to information functions, thus establishing a bridge from set theory to information theory. In this work, we view random variables together with the joint operation as a monoid that acts by conditioning on information functions, and entropy as a function satisfying the chain rule of information. This abstract viewpoint allows to prove a generalization of Hu's theorem. It applies to Shannon and Tsallis entropy, (Tsallis) Kullback-Leibler Divergence, cross-entropy, Kolmogorov complexity, submodular information functions, and the generalization error in machine learning. Our result implies for Chaitin's Kolmogorov complexity that the interaction complexities of all degrees are in expectation close to Shannon interaction information. For well-behaved probability distributions on increasing sequence lengths, this shows that the per-bit expected interaction complexity and information asymptotically coincide, thus showing a strong bridge between algorithmic and classical information theory.</description>

Abstract: The novel concept of near-field velocity sensing is proposed. In contrast to far-field velocity sensing, near-field velocity sensing enables the simultaneous estimation of both radial and transverse velocities of a moving target. A maximum-likelihood-based method is proposed for jointly estimating the radial and transverse velocities from the echo signals. Assisted by near-field velocity sensing, a predictive beamforming framework is proposed for a moving communication user, which requires no channel estimation but achieves seamless data transmission. Finally, numerical examples validate the proposed approaches.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Semantic-Bit Coexisting Communication System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) is emerging as a key technology for future sixth-generation (6G) systems. Unlike traditional bit-level communication (BitCom), SemCom directly optimizes performance at the semantic level, leading to superior communication efficiency. Nevertheless, the task-oriented nature of SemCom renders it challenging to completely replace BitCom. Consequently, it is desired to consider a semantic-bit coexisting communication system, where a base station (BS) serves SemCom users (sem-users) and BitCom users (bit-users) simultaneously. Such a system faces severe and heterogeneous inter-user interference. In this context, this paper provides a new semantic-bit coexisting communication framework and proposes a spatial beamforming scheme to accommodate both types of users. Specifically, we consider maximizing the semantic rate for semantic users while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for bit-users. Due to the intractability of obtaining the exact closed-form expression of the semantic rate, a data driven method is first applied to attain an approximated expression via data fitting. With the resulting complex transcendental function, majorization minimization (MM) is adopted to convert the original formulated problem into a multiple-ratio problem, which allows fractional programming (FP) to be used to further transform the problem into an inhomogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQP) problem. Solving the problem leads to a semi-closed form solution with undetermined Lagrangian factors that can be updated by a fixed point algorithm. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed beamforming scheme significantly outperforms conventional beamforming algorithms such as zero-forcing (ZF), maximum ratio transmission (MRT), and weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE).</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of PAC Decoding with Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By concatenating a polar transform with a convolutional transform, polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC) codes can reach the dispersion approximation bound in certain rate cases. However, the sequential decoding nature of traditional PAC decoding algorithms results in high decoding latency. Due to the parallel computing capability, deep neural network (DNN) decoders have emerged as a promising solution. In this paper, we propose three types of DNN decoders for PAC codes: multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN). The performance of these DNN decoders is evaluated through extensive simulation. Numerical results show that the MLP decoder has the best error-correction performance under a similar model parameter number.</description>

      <title>Griesmer and Optimal Linear Codes from the Affine Solomon-Stiffler Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their fundamental paper published in 1965, G. Solomon and J. J. Stiffler invented infinite families of codes meeting the Griesmer bound. These codes are then called Solomon-Stiffler codes and have motivated various constructions of codes meeting or close the Griesmer bound.
  In this paper, we give a geometric construction of infinite families of affine and modified affine Solomon-Stiffler codes. Projective Solomon-Stiffler codes are special cases of our modified affine Solomon-Stiffler codes. Several infinite families of $q$-ary Griesmer, optimal, almost optimal two-weight, three-weight, four-weight and five-weight linear codes are constructed as special cases of our construction. Weight distributions of these Griesmer, optimal or almost optimal codes are determined. Many optimal linear codes documented in Grassl's list are re-constructed as (modified) affine Solomon-Stiffler codes.
  Several infinite families of optimal or Griesmer codes were constructed in two published papers in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 2017 and 2019, via Gray images of codes over finite rings. Parameters and weight distributions of these Griesmer or optimal codes and very special case codes in our construction are the same. We also indicate that more general distance-optimal binary linear codes than that constructed in a recent paper of IEEE Transactions on Information Theory can be obtained directly from codimension one subcodes in binary Solomon-Stiffler codes.</description>

      <title>Refined Statistical Bounds for Classification Error Mismatches with Constrained Bayes Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In statistical classification/multiple hypothesis testing and machine learning, a model distribution estimated from the training data is usually applied to replace the unknown true distribution in the Bayes decision rule, which introduces a mismatch between the Bayes error and the model-based classification error. In this work, we derive the classification error bound to study the relationship between the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the classification error mismatch. We first reconsider the statistical bounds based on classification error mismatch derived in previous works, employing a different method of derivation. Then, motivated by the observation that the Bayes error is typically low in machine learning tasks like speech recognition and pattern recognition, we derive a refined Kullback-Leibler-divergence-based bound on the error mismatch with the constraint that the Bayes error is lower than a threshold.</description>

      <title>Batches Stabilize the Minimum Norm Risk in High Dimensional Overparameterized Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning algorithms that divide the data into batches are prevalent in many machine-learning applications, typically offering useful trade-offs between computational efficiency and performance. In this paper, we examine the benefits of batch-partitioning through the lens of a minimum-norm overparametrized linear regression model with isotropic Gaussian features. We suggest a natural small-batch version of the minimum-norm estimator and derive bounds on its quadratic risk. We then characterize the optimal batch size and show it is inversely proportional to the noise level, as well as to the overparametrization ratio. In contrast to minimum-norm, our estimator admits a stable risk behavior that is monotonically increasing in the overparametrization ratio, eliminating both the blowup at the interpolation point and the double-descent phenomenon. We further show that shrinking the batch minimum-norm estimator by a factor equal to the Weiner coefficient further stabilizes it and results in lower quadratic risk in all settings. Interestingly, we observe that the implicit regularization offered by the batch partition is partially explained by feature overlap between the batches. Our bound is derived via a novel combination of techniques, in particular normal approximation in the Wasserstein metric of noisy projections over random subspaces.</description>

      <title>Spectrum-Aware Debiasing: A Modern Inference Framework with Applications to Principal Components Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07810v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Debiasing is a fundamental concept in high-dimensional statistics. While degrees-of-freedom adjustment is the state-of-the-art technique in high-dimensional linear regression, it is limited to i.i.d. samples and sub-Gaussian covariates. These constraints hinder its broader practical use. Here, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Debiasing--a novel method for high-dimensional regression. Our approach applies to problems with structured dependencies, heavy tails, and low-rank structures. Our method achieves debiasing through a rescaled gradient descent step, deriving the rescaling factor using spectral information of the sample covariance matrix. The spectrum-based approach enables accurate debiasing in much broader contexts. We study the common modern regime where the number of features and samples scale proportionally. We establish asymptotic normality of our proposed estimator (suitably centered and scaled) under various convergence notions when the covariates are right-rotationally invariant. Such designs have garnered recent attention due to their crucial role in compressed sensing. Furthermore, we devise a consistent estimator for its asymptotic variance.
  Our work has two notable by-products: first, we use Spectrum-Aware Debiasing to correct bias in principal components regression (PCR), providing the first debiased PCR estimator in high dimensions. Second, we introduce a principled test for checking alignment between the signal and the eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix. This test is independently valuable for statistical methods developed using approximate message passing, leave-one-out, or convex Gaussian min-max theorems. We demonstrate our method through simulated and real data experiments. Technically, we connect approximate message passing algorithms with debiasing and provide the first proof of the Cauchy property of vector approximate message passing (V-AMP).</description>

      <title>Entanglement cost of realizing quantum processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement, a peculiar connection between particles, underpins powerful technologies such as quantum computing and secure communication. However, quantifying the minimum entanglement required to prepare quantum states and implement quantum processes remains a significant challenge. We develop an efficiently computable tool that reliably estimates the amount of entanglement needed for realizing arbitrary quantum processes respecting certain physical principles. Our tool applies to the entanglement required to prepare a broad range of quantum states in the asymptotic regime, surpassing previous methods' limitations. We also confirm that entanglement, once consumed to realize the considered class of quantum operations, cannot be fully recovered, even asymptotically. This irreversible behavior is evident for full-rank entangled states and practically relevant amplitude damping channels, even under quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of partial transpose. We showcase our approach's power through examples such as estimating entanglement requirements for realizing bipartite dephasing SWAP channels and solving Hamiltonian simulations under thermal interaction, highlighting its advantages over existing techniques. Our work provides a practical toolkit for benchmarking entanglement requirements for generic states and quantum dynamics, paving the way for assessing and optimizing the performances of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization With Across-Task Transferable Max-Value Entropy Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many applications, ranging from logistics to engineering, a designer is faced with a sequence of optimization tasks for which the objectives are in the form of black-box functions that are costly to evaluate. Furthermore, higher-fidelity evaluations of the optimization objectives often entail a larger cost. Existing multi-fidelity black-box optimization strategies select candidate solutions and fidelity levels with the goal of maximizing the information about the optimal value or the optimal solution for the current task. Assuming that successive optimization tasks are related, this paper introduces a novel information-theoretic acquisition function that balances the need to acquire information about the current task with the goal of collecting information transferable to future tasks. The proposed method transfers across tasks distributions over parameters of a Gaussian process surrogate model by implementing particle-based variational Bayesian updates. Theoretical insights based on the analysis of the expected regret substantiate the benefits of acquiring transferable knowledge across tasks. Furthermore, experimental results across synthetic and real-world examples reveal that the proposed acquisition strategy that caters to future tasks can significantly improve the optimization efficiency as soon as a sufficient number of tasks is processed.</description>

      <title>Reliability Function of Classical-Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12403v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the reliability function of general classical-quantum channels, which describes the optimal exponent of the decay of decoding error when the communication rate is below the capacity. As main result, we prove a lower bound, in terms of the quantum Renyi information in Petz's form, for the reliability function. This resolves Holevo's conjecture proposed in 2000, a long-standing open problem in quantum information theory. It turns out that the obtained lower bound matches the upper bound derived by Dalai in 2013, when the communication rate is above a critical value. Thus we have determined the reliability function in this high-rate case. Our approach relies on Renes' breakthrough made in 2022, which relates classical-quantum channel coding to that of privacy amplification, as well as our new characterization of the channel Renyi information.</description>
