      <title>Position: Scaling LLM Agents Requires Asymptotic Analysis with LLM Primitives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decomposing hard problems into subproblems often makes them easier and more efficient to solve. With large language models (LLMs) crossing critical reliability thresholds for a growing slate of capabilities, there is an increasing effort to decompose systems into sets of LLM-based agents, each of whom can be delegated sub-tasks. However, this decomposition (even when automated) is often intuitive, e.g., based on how a human might assign roles to members of a human team. How close are these role decompositions to optimal? This position paper argues that asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives is needed to reason about the efficiency of such decomposed systems, and that insights from such analysis will unlock opportunities for scaling them. By treating the LLM forward pass as the atomic unit of computational cost, one can separate out the (often opaque) inner workings of a particular LLM from the inherent efficiency of how a set of LLMs are orchestrated to solve hard problems. In other words, if we want to scale the deployment of LLMs to the limit, instead of anthropomorphizing LLMs, asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives should be used to reason about and develop more powerful decompositions of large problems into LLM agents.</description>

      <title>Learning Semantics-aware Search Operators for Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fitness landscapes in test-based program synthesis are known to be extremely rugged, with even minimal modifications of programs often leading to fundamental changes in their behavior and, consequently, fitness values. Relying on fitness as the only guidance in iterative search algorithms like genetic programming is thus unnecessarily limiting, especially when combined with purely syntactic search operators that are agnostic about their impact on program behavior. In this study, we propose a semantics-aware search operator that steers the search towards candidate programs that are valuable not only actually (high fitness) but also only potentially, i.e. are likely to be turned into high-quality solutions even if their current fitness is low. The key component of the method is a graph neural network that learns to model the interactions between program instructions and processed data, and produces a saliency map over graph nodes that represents possible search decisions. When applied to a suite of symbolic regression benchmarks, the proposed method outperforms conventional tree-based genetic programming and the ablated variant of the method.</description>

      <title>The $\alpha$-Alternator: Dynamic Adaptation To Varying Noise Levels In Sequences Using The Vendi Score For Improved Robustness and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art dynamical models, such as Mamba, assume the same level of noisiness for all elements of a given sequence, which limits their performance on noisy temporal data. In this paper, we introduce the $\alpha$-Alternator, a novel generative model for time-dependent data that dynamically adapts to the complexity introduced by varying noise levels in sequences. The $\alpha$-Alternator leverages the Vendi Score (VS), a flexible similarity-based diversity metric, to adjust, at each time step $t$, the influence of the sequence element at time $t$ and the latent representation of the dynamics up to that time step on the predicted future dynamics. This influence is captured by a parameter that is learned and shared across all sequences in a given dataset. The sign of this parameter determines the direction of influence. A negative value indicates a noisy dataset, where a sequence element that increases the VS is considered noisy, and the model relies more on the latent history when processing that element. Conversely, when the parameter is positive, a sequence element that increases the VS is considered informative, and the $\alpha$-Alternator relies more on this new input than on the latent history when updating its predicted latent dynamics. The $\alpha$-Alternator is trained using a combination of observation masking and Alternator loss minimization. Masking simulates varying noise levels in sequences, enabling the model to be more robust to these fluctuations and improving its performance in trajectory prediction, imputation, and forecasting. Our experimental results demonstrate that the $\alpha$-Alternator outperforms both Alternators and state-of-the-art state-space models across neural decoding and time-series forecasting benchmarks.</description>

      <title>The Origin and Evolution of Information Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04374v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence and evolution of information handling is essential for unraveling the origins of life. Traditional genetic-first and metabolism-first models fall short in explaining how instructional information control systems naturally arise from molecular dynamics. To address this gap, we adopt an information-first approach, integrating Hofmeyr's (F, A)-systems -- an extension of Rosen's (M, R)-systems -- with temporal parametrization and multiscale causality. These models, which embody closure to efficient causation while remaining open to formal causation, provide a robust framework for primitive autopoiesis, anticipation, and adaptation. We establish a formal equivalence between extended (F, A)-systems and communicating X-machines, resolving self-referential challenges and demonstrating the hypercomputational nature of life processes. Our stepwise model traces the evolution of information handling from simple reaction networks that recognize regular languages to self-replicating chemical systems with memory and anticipatory capabilities. This transition from analog to digital architectures enhances evolutionary robustness and aligns with experimental evidence suggesting that chemical computation does not require life-specific chemistry. Furthermore, we incorporate open-ended evolutionary dynamics driven by computational undecidability and irreducibility, reinforcing the necessity of unconventional computing frameworks. This computational enactivist perspective provides a cohesive theoretical basis for a recently proposed trialectic between autopoiesis, anticipation and adaptation in order to solve the problem of relevance. By highlighting the critical role of hypercomputational processes in life's emergence and evolution, our framework offers new insights into the fundamental principles underlying biological information processing.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent with Decoupled Backpropagation and Layer-Wise Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing size of deep learning models has made distributed training across multiple devices essential. However, current methods such as distributed data-parallel training suffer from large communication and synchronization overheads when training across devices, leading to longer training times as a result of suboptimal hardware utilization. Asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) methods can improve training speed, but are sensitive to delays due to both communication and differences throughput. Moreover, the backpropagation algorithm used within ASGD workers is bottlenecked by the interlocking between its forward and backward passes. Current methods also do not take advantage of the large differences in the computation required for the forward and backward passes. Therefore, we propose an extension to ASGD called Partial Decoupled ASGD (PD-ASGD) that addresses these issues. PD-ASGD uses separate threads for the forward and backward passes, decoupling the updates and allowing for a higher ratio of forward to backward threads than the usual 1:1 ratio, leading to higher throughput. PD-ASGD also performs layer-wise (partial) model updates concurrently across multiple threads. This reduces parameter staleness and consequently improves robustness to delays. Our approach yields close to state-of-the-art results while running up to $5.95\times$ faster than synchronous data parallelism in the presence of delays, and up to $2.14\times$ times faster than comparable ASGD algorithms by achieving higher model flops utilization. We mathematically describe the gradient bias introduced by our method, establish an upper bound, and prove convergence.</description>

      <title>How the Stroop Effect Arises from Optimal Response Times in Laterally Connected Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Stroop effect refers to cognitive interference in a color-naming task: When the color and the word do not match, the response is slower and more likely to be incorrect. The Stroop task is used to assess cognitive flexibility, selective attention, and executive function. This paper implements the Stroop task with self-organizing maps (SOMs): Target color and the competing word are inputs for the semantic and lexical maps, associative connections bring color information to the lexical map, and lateral connections combine their effects over time. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 84.2%, with significantly fewer errors and faster responses in congruent compared to no-input and incongruent conditions. The model's effect is a side effect of optimizing response times, and can thus be seen as a cost associated with overall efficient performance. The model can further serve studying neurologically-inspired cognitive control and related phenomena.</description>
