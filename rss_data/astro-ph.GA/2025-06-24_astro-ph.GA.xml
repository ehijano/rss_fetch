      <title>The AURORA Survey: Tracing Galactic Outflows at $z\gtrsim2.5$ with JWST/NIRSpec NUV Absorption Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We probe galactic-scale outflows in star-forming galaxies at $z\gtrsim2.5$ drawn from the JWST/NIRSpec AURORA program. For the first time, we directly compare outflow properties from the early universe to the present day using near-UV absorption lines. We measure ISM kinematics from Fe II and Mg II absorption features in 41 and 43 galaxies, respectively, and examine how these kinematics correlate with galaxy properties. We find that galaxies with outflows tend to have higher stellar masses, and that maximum outflow velocities increase with stellar mass, SFR, $\beta$, $E(B-V)$, and $A_V$. We also find that Mg II emission is more common in galaxies with lower masses, higher sSFRs, and less dust. These trends are consistent with those in star-forming galaxies at $z&lt;2$ when using the same outflow tracers, suggesting that the feedback from star formation has played a persistent role in shaping galaxy evolution over cosmic time. We also directly compare near-UV and far-UV features in the same NIRSpec spectrum for a $z=5.19$ galaxy, finding consistent ISM kinematics and demonstrating that different tracers yield comparable measurements. We also detect Na D absorption in 10 galaxies, which have higher stellar mass, SFR, and dust attenuation compared to galaxies without Na D absorption, which is consistent with $z\sim0$ studies. The broad continuum coverage and sensitivity of NIRSpec will enable future studies with larger samples, allowing for robust tests of these trends across a wider dynamic range of galaxy properties.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of tidal spiral arms: Machine learning-assisted identification of equations and application to the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the spiral arms of the Milky Way (MW) remains a key open question in galactic dynamics. Tidal perturbations, such as the recent passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr), could play a significant role in exciting them. We aim to analytically characterize the dynamics of tidally induced spiral arms, including their phase-space signatures. We ran idealized test-particle simulations resembling impulsive satellite impacts, and used the Sparse Identification of Non-linear Dynamics (SINDy) method to infer their governing Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). We validated the method with analytical derivations and a realistic $N$-body simulation of a MW-Sgr encounter analogue. For small perturbations, a linear system of equations was recovered with SINDy, consistent with predictions from linearised collisionless dynamics. In this case, two distinct waves wrapping at pattern speeds $\Omega \pm \kappa/m$ emerge. For large impacts, we empirically discovered a non-linear system of equations, representing a novel formulation for the dynamics of tidally induced spiral arms. For both cases, these equations describe wave properties like amplitude and pattern speed, and their shape and temporal evolution in different phase-space projections. We fit the Gaia $L_Z-V_R$ waves with the linear model, providing a reasonable fit and plausible parameters for the Sgr passage. However, the predicted amplitude ratio of the two waves is inconsistent with observations, supporting a more complex origin for this feature (e.g. multiple passages, bar, spiral arms). We merge data-driven discovery with theory to create simple, accurate models of tidal spiral arms that match simulations and provide a simple tool to fit Gaia and external galaxy data. This methodology could be extended to model complex phenomena like self-gravity and dynamical friction. (ABR)</description>

      <title>Characterizing Density and Gravitational Potential Fluctuations of the Interstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Substructure in the interstellar medium (ISM) is crucial for establishing the correlation between star formation and feedback and has the capacity to significantly perturb stellar orbits, thus playing a central role in galaxy dynamics and evolution. Contemporary surveys of gas and dust emission in nearby galaxies resolve structure down to $\sim 10\,$pc scales, demanding theoretical models of ISM substructure with matching fidelity. In this work, we address this need by quantitatively characterizing the gas density in state-of-the-art MHD simulations of disk galaxies that resolve pc to kpc scales. The TIGRESS-NCR framework we employ includes sheared galactic rotation, self-consistent star formation and feedback, and nonequilibrium chemistry and cooling. We fit simple analytic models to the one-point spatial, two-point spatial, and two-point spatio-temporal statistics of the surface density fluctuation field. We find that for both solar neighborhood and inner-galaxy conditions, (i) the surface density fluctuations follow a log-normal distribution, (ii) the linear and logarithmic fluctuation power spectra are well-approximated as power laws with indices of $\approx -2.2$ and $\approx -2.8$ respectively, and (iii) lifetimes of structures at different scales are set by a combination of feedback and effective pressure terms. Additionally, we find that the vertical structure of the gas is well-modeled by a mixture of exponential and sech$^2$ profiles, allowing us to link the surface density statistics to those of the volume density and gravitational potential. We provide convenient parameterizations for incorporating realistic ISM effects into stellar-dynamical studies and for comparison with multi-wavelength observations.</description>

      <title>JWST reveals cosmic ray dominated chemistry in the local ULIRG IRAS 07251$-$0248</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the ro-vibrational absorption bands of various molecular cations (HCO$^+$, HCNH$^+$, and N$_2$H$^+$) and neutral species (HCN, HNC, and HC$_3$N) detected in the JWST/MIRI MRS spectrum (4.9-27.9 $\mu$m) of the local ultra luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS~07251$-$0248. We find that the molecular absorptions are blueshifted by 160 km s$^{-1}$ relative to the systemic velocity of the target. Using local thermal equilibrium (LTE) excitation models, we derive rotational temperatures ($T_{\rm rot}$) from 42 to 185 K for these absorption bands. This range of measured $T_{\rm rot}$ can be explained by infrared (IR) radiative pumping as a byproduct of the strength, effective critical density, and opacity of each molecular band. Thus, these results suggest that these absorptions originate in a warm expanding gas shell ($\dot{M}$$\sim$90-330 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$), which might be the base of the larger scale cold molecular outflow detected in this source. Finally, the elevated abundance of molecular cations (H$_3^+$, HCO$^+$, HCNH$^+$, and N$_2$H$^+$) can be explained by a high cosmic ray ionization rate, with log($\zeta_{\text{H}_2}$/n$_{\rm H}\, [\text{cm}^3 \text{s}^{-1}])$ in the range of -19.1 to -18.2, consistent with a cosmic ray dominated chemistry as predicted by chemical models.</description>

      <title>The JWST/AURORA Survey: Multiple Balmer and Paschen Emission Lines for Individual Star-forming Galaxies at z=1.5-4.4. I. A Diversity of Nebular Attenuation Curves and Evidence for Non-Unity Dust Covering Fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the nebular attenuation curves and dust covering fractions for 24 redshift z=1.5-4.4 star-forming galaxies using multiple Balmer and Paschen lines from the JWST/AURORA survey. Nebular reddening derived from Paschen lines exceeds that from Balmer lines for at least half the galaxies in the sample when assuming the commonly-adopted Galactic extinction curve, implying the presence of optically-thick star formation. The nebular attenuation curves exhibit a broad range of normalizations (Rv ~ 3.2-16.4). Motivated by the offsets in reddening deduced from the Balmer and Paschen lines, and the high Rv values for the individual nebular attenuation curves, both of which suggest variations in the dust-stars geometry, we propose a model with a subunity dust covering fraction (fcov). Fitting such a model to the HI recombination line ratios indicates fcov ~ 0.6-1.0. The normalizations of the nebular attenuation curves, Rv, are driven primarily by fcov and the mix of optically-thick and thin OB associations. Thus, the diversity of nebular attenuation curves can be accommodated by assuming dust grain properties similar to that of Milky Way sightlines but with a subunity covering fraction of dust. Integrated measurements of multiple Balmer and Paschen lines can be used to place novel constraints on the dust covering fraction towards OB associations. These, in turn, provide new avenues for exploring the role of dust and gas covering fraction in a number of relevant aspects of high-redshift galaxies, including the impact of stellar feedback on ISM porosity and the escape of Ly-alpha and Lyman continuum radiation.</description>

      <title>Metal-polluted PopIII galaxies and How to Find Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observing Population III (PopIII) galaxies, the hosts of first-generation stars, remains challenging even with the JWST. The current few candidates have been identified through the combination of a prominent HeII emission and the absence of metal lines, a well-known but extremely brief signature of metal-free systems. Here, we accurately model the evolution of the emission from PopIII galaxies to increase the number of candidates in JWST observations. To achieve this, we employ a locally calibrated galaxy-formation model that self-consistently follows the star formation and chemical evolution initiated by the first stars. We find that PopIII galaxies can emit metal lines in their ``self-polluted'' phase, while galaxies host only metal-free stars but the gas has been chemically-enriched by the first supernovae. In this phase, PopIII galaxies have $\rm [OIII]/H\beta \approx 1$, which opens the pool of candidates to more easily detectable sources. We predict that the high HeII emission of PopIII galaxies can last up to $\rm \approx 20 \, Myrs$ and that it is partly maintained in the ``hybrid'' phase, when PopIII and PopII stars co-exist in the host galaxy. We propose novel diagnostics involving UV metal lines to select PopIII candidates in high-z JWST surveys. In JADES, we identify 9 candidate galaxies with $&gt;25\%$ of their stellar mass in metal-free stars, showcasing the effectiveness of our method. Ultimately, the key to discovering PopIII galaxies could be to catch them during their first episodes of chemical enrichment.</description>

      <title>Standardizing a larger, higher-quality, homogeneous sample of reverberation-mapped H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using the broad-line region radius-luminosity relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-quality, homogeneous sample of 157 H$\beta$ reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (RM AGNs) spanning redshifts $0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$, which is approximately 3.8 times larger than the previously available high-quality homogeneous sample. Using the broad-line region radius$-$luminosity relation ($R-L$), which involves the broad H$\beta$ line time delay and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100\,\AA\,, we show that the sample is standardizable by using six spatially flat and nonflat cosmological models. The inferred cosmological model parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ uncertainties with those from better established baryon acoustic oscillation and Hubble parameter measurements, with the exception of two nonflat models that are ruled out by other data. The $R-L$ relation slope is found to be flatter ($\gamma=0.428 \pm 0.025$ in the flat $\Lambda$CDM model) than the slope expected from a simple photoionization model as well as the slope found previously for the smaller homogeneous sample. In addition, we find a mild dependence of H$\beta$ $R-L$ relation parameters as well as its intrinsic scatter on the Eddington ratio by comparing the $R-L$ relations for low- and high-accreting equal-sized subsamples. A future analysis of a larger homogeneous sample containing a broader range of luminosities and Eddington ratios is necessary to confirm the standardizability of H$\beta$ AGNs.</description>

      <title>X-ray emission signatures of galactic feedback in the hot circumgalactic medium: predictions from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little is currently known about the physical properties of the hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding massive galaxies. Next-generation X-ray observatories will enable detailed studies of the hot CGM in emission. To support these future efforts, we make predictions of the X-ray emission from the hot CGM using a sample of 28 $\sim$Milky Way-mass disk galaxies at $z=0$ from seven cosmological hydrodynamical simulation suites incorporating a wide range of galactic feedback prescriptions. The X-ray surface brightness (XSB) morphology of the hot CGM varies significantly across simulations. XSB-enhanced outflows and bubble-like structures are predicted in many galaxies simulated with AGN feedback and in some stellar-feedback-only galaxies, while other galaxies exhibit more isotropic XSB distributions at varying brightnesses. Galaxies simulated without cosmic ray physics exhibit radial XSB profiles with similar shapes ($\propto r^{-3}$ within $20-200$ kpc), with scatter about this slope likely due to underlying feedback physics. The hot CGM kinematics also differ substantially: velocity maps reveal signatures of bulk CGM rotation and high-velocity biconical outflows, particularly in simulations incorporating AGN feedback. Some stellar-feedback-only models also generate similar AGN-like outflows, which we postulate is due to centrally-concentrated star formation. Simulations featuring AGN feedback frequently produce extended temperature enhancements in large-scale galactic outflows, while simulations incorporating cosmic ray physics predict the coolest CGM due to pressure support being provided by cosmic rays rather than hot CGM. Individually-resolved X-ray emission lines further distinguish hot CGM phases, with lower-energy lines (e.g., O VII) largely tracing volume-filling gas, and higher-energy lines (e.g., Fe XVII) highlighting high-velocity feedback-driven outflows.</description>

      <title>Signatures of BH seeding on the $\mathrm{M_{\displaystyle \bullet}}-\sigma$ relation: Predictions from the BRAHMA simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has identified a large population of supermassive ($10^6$-$10^8~\mathrm{M}_\odot$) black holes (BHs) in the early universe ($z \sim 4$-$7$). Current measurements suggest that many of these BHs exhibit higher BH-to-stellar mass ratios than local populations, opening a new window into the earliest stages of BH-galaxy coevolution and offering the potential to place tight constraints on BH seeding and growth in the early universe. In this work, we use the BRAHMA simulations to investigate the impact of BH seeding on the $\mathrm{M_{\bullet}}-\sigma$ relation. These simulations adopt heavy $\sim10^5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ seeds and systematically varied BH seeding models, resulting in distinct predictions for seed abundances. We find that different seed models lead to different normalizations of the $\mathrm{M_{\bullet}}-\sigma$ relation at higher redshifts ($z &gt; 2$) across all $\sigma$, and at low redshift for systems with low $\sigma$ ($50~\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}} \lesssim \sigma \lesssim 80~\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$). The most lenient seed model also shows negligible evolution in the $\mathrm{M_{\bullet}}-\sigma$ relation across redshift, while more restrictive models have substantially lower normalization on the $\mathrm{M_{\bullet}}-\sigma$ relation for high $\sigma$ ($\sim 100~\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$) at high redshifts, and evolve upward toward the local relation. We demonstrate that the $\mathrm{M_{\bullet}}-\sigma$ evolution is a direct consequence of merger-dominated BH growth in low mass galaxies ($\lesssim 10^9~M_{\odot}$) and accretion dominated BH growth in high mass ($\gtrsim10^9~M_{\odot}$) galaxies. Furthermore, the scatter in the $\mathrm{M_{\bullet}}-\sigma$ relation is larger for the more restrictive models due to the inability of many BHs to grow significantly beyond their seed mass.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Imprints of vortex-lines of BEC Dark Matter on Baryonic Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our results demonstrate that vortex lines in Bose-Einstein Condensate Dark Matter (BECDM) can act as gravitational seeds that induce the condensation of baryonic matter, leading to localized gas accumulation even in the absence of imposed symmetries or rotation. Our analysis is based on the numerical solution of the system of equations for the BECDM gravitationally coupled to Euler equations for a compressible ideal gas (IG) that we use as a model of baryonic matter. Numerical simulations are constructed for various scenarios that start with a vortex solution for the BECDM and a randomly distributed ideal gas, with the aim of investigating whether the matter distribution and dynamics of the vortex influences the dynamics and distribution of the gas. We find that the gas condensation process is most efficient when the IG mass dominates over the BECDM, and when the IG has low initial velocity dispersion. We also find that strong bosonic self-interaction does not guarantee the vortex stability, instead, it can trigger dynamical instabilities that disrupt both the vortex structure and the surrounding gas. An interesting finding is that the vortex drives a persistent morphological signature on the gas, often in the form of ring-like features visible in projected density maps. These patterns survive nonlinear evolution and may serve as indirect tracers of vortex structures in BECDM halos, potentially offering a novel and testable observational probe of the model.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Multiphase Carbon in the Turbulent Circumgalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a crucial role in regulating material and energy exchange between galaxies and their environments. The best means of observing this medium is through absorption-line spectroscopy, but we have yet to develop a consistent physical model that fully explains these results. Here we investigate the impact of turbulence and non-equilibrium chemistry on the properties of the CGM, using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations that include the impact of an ionizing background. Increasing turbulence enhances small-scale density fluctuations, shifting the kinetic energy spectra from Kolmogorov to Burgers scaling. This is indicative of shock-dominated dissipation, which plays a critical role in driving carbon ionization and shaping the multiphase structure of the medium. At the same time, the presence of background radiation significantly alters the ionization balance, increasing the prevalence of C\textsc{ii} and C\textsc{iv}. Thus, turbulence and the background radiation have complementary roles: turbulence governs the spatial distribution and facilitates the formation of ionized species, whereas the background radiation modifies the overall ionization equilibrium, setting the observed distribution of multiphase carbon.</description>

We devised a new spectral-line fitting approach to de-blend rotating and non-rotating gas components, which is better tailored to the extreme feedback mechanisms at work in NGC6240. We find that ~65% of the Pa$\alpha$, H$_2$, and [FeII] line fluxes within the NIRSpec field of view arise from gas components that are kinematically decoupled from the stars. The NIR H$_2$ lines show the most deviation from the stars, with peak emission between the two rotating stellar structures. The PAH 3.3$\mu$m feature does not follow the NIR H$_2$ morphology, indicating that the latter does not trace PDRs. In the non-rotating gas components, we identify a biconical wind launched from the northern AGN, expanding along the minor axis of stellar rotation. This wind is dominated by ionised gas and, although it entrains some H$_2$, it does not show a H$_2$/PAH enhancement, suggesting either high UV irradiation or expansion along a relatively gas-free path. Furthermore, we find bright non-rotating gas emission between the two AGN and around the southern AGN, which we interpret as due to an outflow launched from the southern nucleus, coinciding with the molecular outflow previously studied in cold (sub-)millimeter tracers. The strong H$_2$/PAH enhancement measured in this region, coextensive with high velocity redshifted gas ($v\sim900$ km s$^{-1}$), suggests that the shocks responsible for the high H$_2$/PAH ratios are due to the outflow rather than to the collision of media during the merger. Our results show that the bulk of the NIR line emission in NGC6240 is decoupled from the stars, and that most of the warm H$_2$ is shock-excited and embedded in a powerful outflow, where it coexists with colder molecular gas.</description>

      <title>Dark Bondi Accretion Aided by Baryons and the Origin of JWST Little Red Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravothermal core collapse of self-interacting dark matter halos provides a compelling mechanism for seeding supermassive black holes in the early Universe. In this scenario, a small fraction of a halo, approximately $1\%$ of its mass, collapses into a dense core, which could further evolve into a black hole. We demonstrate that this process can account for the origin of JWST little red dots (LRDs) observed at redshifts $z\sim4-11$, where black holes with masses of $10^7{\rm\,M_\odot}$ can form within $500{\rm\,Myr}$ after the formation of host halos with masses of $10^{9}{\rm\,M_\odot}$. Even if the initial collapse region triggering general-relativistic instability has a mass on the order of one solar mass, the resulting seed can grow into an intermediate-mass black hole via Eddington accretion of baryonic gas. Subsequently, it can continue to grow into a supermassive black hole through dark Bondi accretion of dark matter particles. In this scenario, the majority of the black hole's mass originates from dark matter accretion rather than baryonic matter, naturally explaining the overmassive feature of LRDs.</description>

      <title>Diffuse X-Ray-emitting Gas in the Central Region of Star-Forming Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar medium of galaxies, with temperatures reaching several million degrees, provides a pivotal perspective for understanding the physical and chemical properties of star formation, galactic evolution, and their associated feedback mechanisms. We use archival data from $Chandra$ observations to extract the diffuse X-ray emission from 23 nearby star-forming galaxies and study its correlation with star formation activity in the central region of these galaxies. The surface brightness profile of each galaxy presents a sharp decrease in the central region of $\thicksim$0.3$-$2 kpc and then varies slowly outside this range. Compared to the global relation between the diffuse thermal X-ray luminosity from hot gas ($L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$) and the star formation rate (SFR), we found a super-linear relation of ${\rm log}(L_{\rm 0.5-2\,keV}^{\rm gas} /{\rm erg\,s^{-1}})=1.34\,{\rm log}({\rm SFR}/{M_{\rm \odot}}\,{\rm yr^{-1}})+40.15$ for the center of these sample galaxies. This result suggests that more intense stellar feedback is associated with stronger star formation activity in the central region of star-forming galaxies, where more energy output from supernovae (SNe) and stellar winds is converted into X-ray flux. Furthermore, the slope of the $L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$$-$SFR relation anticorrelates with spatial scale in the galactic central region. This indicates that the characteristics of central hot gas emission are gradually averaged over larger areas. The diffuse X-ray luminosity also shows a good correlation with molecular gas, stellar mass, and mid-plane pressure traced by the baryonic mass, although these relations show relatively large scatter.</description>

Abstract: This work is the continuation of a series attempting to characterize the local warm ionized medium through both static and time dependent simulations. We build upon our three dimensional, observationally-derived simulation of the local photoionized interstellar medium - based on static photoionization simulations constrained by 3D dust maps - to include metals required to predict collisionally excited optical and infrared emission lines, providing the first all-sky prediction of a series of lines including [SII] 6716$\mathring{A}$, [NII] 6584$\mathring{A}$ and [OIII] 5007$\mathring{A}$. While these predictions only include O-star photoionization under ionization equilibrium, we also carry out a suite of radiation-hydrodynamics simulations including time-dependent metal ionization and the effects of supernova feedback to highlight missing features in our predicted skies. We use the simulations to estimate the very local (1 $\rm kpc^{2}$) Galactic star formation rate, finding a rate of 370 $\rm M_{\odot}~Myr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}$ provides the best match between the observationally-derived and ab-initio simulations. This is approximately a factor of four lower than previous estimates for the star formation rate required to support an observed layer of high-altitude diffuse ionized gas, possibly suggesting a `bursty' star formation history in the region surrounding the Sun. We also investigate the effects of O-star environments on their ability to ionize large volumes of diffuse ionized gas, and find it is likely ionized by a small number of luminous O-stars located in regions where the leakage of their Lyman continuum photons can produce the vast volumes of ionized gas observed in the midplane and at high galactic altitudes.</description>

      <title>Current Galactic Chemical Evolution models fail to explain rising Na-abundances of young thick disc stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently identified an upturn in [Na/Fe] for the population of Solar-type stars in the Galactic thick disc ($-0.3 &lt; [\mathrm{Fe/H}] &lt; +0.3$ dex) at super-Solar metallicity in GALactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) data. Here, we investigate the cause of this unexplained Na enrichment between ([Fe/H] $\sim 0 - 0.6$ dex) using the OMEGA$+$ galactic chemical evolution code. We investigate the increase of [Na/Fe] with four combinations of nucleosynthetic yields from the literature, with source contributions from core-collapse supernovae, asymptotic giant branch stars, and Type Ia supernovae. We focus on two possible causes for the Na-enhancement: the "metallicity effect" resulting from core-collapse supernovae at super-Solar metallicity and the contribution of metal-rich AGB stars. We adopt two sets of Type Ia supernova yields with one model assuming only Chandrasekhar-mass explosions, and another assuming only sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions. We find that the assumed Type Ia explosion has little effect on the [Na/Fe] Galactic chemical evolution modelling, and all Galactic chemical evolution models tested fail to reproduce the observed [\mathrm{Na/Fe}] enrichment in the young thick disc population at super-Solar metallicities. Our study indicates a possible "under-pollution effect" by SNe Ia, which are the dominant producers of iron, in the Galactic disc's Solar-type star population. These findings provide a step forward toward understanding the origin of the unexplained sodium enrichment at super-Solar metallicities in the Galactic disc.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Galaxy Structures: Systematic Analysis of Bulge+Disk Decomposition Using Simulated JWST/NIRCam Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing and accurately decomposing galaxies into structural components, such as bulges and disks, is essential for understanding galaxy formation and evolution, particularly at high redshift, where galaxies are compact and faint. Leveraging the unparalleled resolution and sensitivity of JWST and imaging data from CEERs program, we simulate galaxies with bulge+disk components and assess the effectiveness of single and double S\'ersic model fittings, respectively. We first evaluate the performance of single S\'ersic fits, and find it can recover total magnitudes (i.e., within 0.5 mag), and size (i.e., within 0.2 dex), down to 27 mag. The features that emerged in the residual map can properly reflect the underlying two-component structures. We also show that S\'ersic indices can serve as proxies for the bulge-to-total flux ratio (B/T). For double S\'ersic models, we find comparable accuracy in recovering bulge and disk magnitudes (i.e., within 0.5 mag), and effective radius (i.e., within 0.2 dex), down to 26 mag. To quantitatively determine whether a double S\'ersic model better describes our two-component systems compared to a single S\'ersic profile, we evaluate the Bayesian Information Criterion for both model configurations. To extend the applicability of our results to other NIRCam programs, we evaluate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the simulated galaxies and find that model parameters are reliably reproduced when the SNR exceeds 10. Our work demonstrates the detailed morphological measurement uncertainties using single and double S\'ersic models, which provides an essential reference for future JWST/NIRCam-based morphological studies, especially for high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>No apparent forbidden/permitted narrow emission lines in the broad line quasar SDSS J1251+0613</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong both broad and narrow emission lines from central broad emission line regions (BLRs) and narrow emission line regions (NLRs) are fundamental spectroscopic characteristics of broad line Active Galactic Nuclei (BLAGNs). Lack of central BLRs leads to the identified true Type-2 AGNs without central hidden BLRs, providing clues on formation/suppression of AGN BLRs. Whether were there BLAGNs with lack of central NLRs is still an open question. Here, in the blue quasar SDSS J1251+0613, both blue continuum emissions and broad emission lines can be clearly detected in its SDSS spectrum, however there are no apparently detected narrow emission lines in the optical/NUV bands, leading to no central normal NLRs in the blue quasar SDSS J1251+0613. In order to explain the lack of NLRs, evolving NLRs is proposed that the radial outflows are carrying materials from BLRs to NLRs and the current narrow line emission materials are lying closer to the outer side of central BLRs in SDSS J1521+0613. The results in this manuscript can indicate a new unique subclass of BLAGNs, the BLAGNs without central normal NLRs, which will provide potential clues on physical origin/evolution of AGN NLRs.</description>

      <title>The role of environment on the evolution of disc galaxies density profiles New insights from simulations and comparison to Euclid data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic discs are known to have exponential radial profiles in luminosity and stellar surface density in their bright inner regions. Nonetheless, their faint outer regions often display a break, with either a down-bending or an up-bending profile. Recent Euclid Early Release Observations show that down-bending breaks are scarce in the Perseus cluster, as already suspected in Virgo. We use hydrodynamic simulations of disc galaxies interacting with a Perseus-like cluster. We show that Type II profiles (down-bending) can be rapidly eroded by the cluster tidal field on a 1 Gyr timescale, while Type III (up-bending) and Type I (no break) profiles remain largely unaffected. Type II profiles are eroded through dynamical processes, including tidal stirring of stars by the cluster potential and triggering of star formation in the outer disc. Our simulations show that observations of disc breaks across environments and cosmic epochs are consistent with a coherent evolutionary picture. At high redshift, JWST reveals early break structures in isolated environments. At low redshift, field disc galaxies retain these breaks, while dense clusters, as observed by Euclid in Perseus, show significant alterations. Our findings support a scenario in which down-bending profiles result from internal processes during early formation phases and are later modified by environmental effects in clusters. This interpretation does not require additional mechanisms such as ram-pressure stripping or star formation threshold variations to explain the observed evolution of down-bending breaks.</description>

      <title>Circular Mystery: Exploring Diffuse Emission Surrounding a Radio Galaxy with uGMRT and VLA Multiwavelength Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of J1218+1813, a circular diffuse radio source detected in the Very Large Array (VLA) FIRST survey at 1400 MHz. The source has an angular diameter of approximately one arcminute, corresponding to a physical size of ~180 kpc, and is associated with an elliptical galaxy with a redshift of z = 0.139635. To investigate its nature, we conducted a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis spanning both high and low radio frequencies, utilizing the VLA in C-configuration at L, C and X bands, along with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at bands 3 (250-500 MHz), 4 (550-850 MHz), and 5 (1000-1460 MHz). A spectral study based on these multiwavelength observations reveals that the core of J1218+1813 exhibits a steep spectral index of 0.8, indicating that the emission is dominated by optically thin synchrotron radiation. The spectral index varies between 1.1 and 1.8, from the inner to the outer structure, with the steepest values observed at the periphery of the diffuse emission. An optical analysis of the central host galaxy using spectroscopic data is also performed. The estimated black hole mass is $2.8 \pm 0.8 \times 10^{8}$ M${_\odot}$, while the host galaxy has a stellar mass of 2.9 $\times$ 10$^{11}$ M${_\odot}$ and a stellar age of 8.58 Gyr. The identification of J1218+1813 is particularly significant because it provides insight into the mechanisms responsible for the formation of circular diffuse radio structures surrounded by an elliptical galaxy. Potential formation scenarios for J1218+1813 are discussed in this paper.</description>

      <title>The completeness of the open cluster census towards the Galactic anticentre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open clusters have long been used as tracers of Galactic structure. However, without a selection function to describe the completeness of the cluster census, it is difficult to quantitatively interpret their distribution. We create a method to empirically determine the selection function of a Galactic cluster catalogue. We test it by investigating the completeness of the cluster census in the outer Milky Way, where old and young clusters exhibit different spatial distributions. We develop a method to generate realistic mock clusters as a function of their parameters, in addition to accounting for Gaia's selection function and astrometric errors. We then inject mock clusters into Gaia DR3 data, and attempt to recover them in a blind search using HDBSCAN. We find that the main parameters influencing cluster detectability are mass, extinction, and distance. Age also plays an important role, making older clusters harder to detect due to their fainter luminosity function. High proper motions also improve detectability. After correcting for these selection effects, we find that old clusters are $2.97\pm0.11$ times more common at a Galactocentric radius of 13~kpc than in the solar neighbourhood -- despite positive detection biases in their favour, such as hotter orbits or a higher scale height. The larger fraction of older clusters in the outer Galaxy cannot be explained by an observational bias, and must be a physical property of the Milky Way: young outer-disc clusters are not forming in the outer Galaxy, or at least not with sufficient masses to be identified as clusters in Gaia DR3. We predict that in this region, more old clusters than young ones remain to be discovered. The current presence of old, massive outer-disc clusters could be explained by radial heating and migration, or alternatively by a lower cluster destruction rate in the anticentre.</description>

      <title>Spiral galaxies with unusual azimuthal asymmetry in oxygen abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We considered five galaxies in the MaNGA survey that show distinct azimuthal asymmetry in the abundance, in the sense that in the inner part (more than half of the optical radius, $R_{25}$) of each galaxy there is a sector-like region where the oxygen abundances (O/H)_h are higher than the abundances (O/H)_l in other sectors. M-11761-12705 is a massive galaxy with a stellar mass of log(M_star/M_sun) = 11.6; the masses of four other galaxies are moderate: 10.1 &lt; log($M_star/M_sun) &lt; 10.4. Abundances within both high- and low-metallicity regions show flat radial gradients. The histogram for the spaxel abundances demonstrates two distinct peaks, the difference between the (O/H)_h and the (O/H)_l abundances are of 0.06 - 0.08 dex. The high-metallicity regions are located in the O/H - N/O diagram closer to the lower envelope of the band than the low-metallicity regions. The abundance properties in the massive galaxy can be explained by the low-metallicity gas infall onto the galaxy and subsequent starburst in the diluted interstellar gas. For moderate-mass galaxies, the higher oxygen abundance in the high-metallicity region and its shift towards the lower envelope in the N/O -- O/H diagram compared to the low-metallicity region can be explained in one of two ways: either the starburst in the high-metallicity region occurred several dozens of Myr ago, or the star formation in the galaxy is accompanied by galactic winds, and the region evolved with the lower efficiency of the enriched galactic winds shows higher metallicity. Two galaxies of our sample are members of galaxy pairs. However, the asymmetry parameter, A, quantifying the asymmetry of a light distribution across the galaxy, is above the canonical threshold (A = 0.35) between non-interacting/interacting galaxies in the massive galaxy only.</description>

Abstract: The secondary anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide a wealth of astrophysical and cosmological information. Pairing measurements of the CMB temperature map obtained by DR5 of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) with the large-scale structure imaging survey conducted by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, DECaLS DR9, we investigate two effects that are sensitive to the gas density $\tau$: kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) and `patchy screening' (also known as `anisotropic screening'). In particular, we measure the stacked profiles around Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) at a mean redshift of $z \approx 0.7$. We detect the kSZ signal at 7.2$\sigma$, and we find a signal at $\sim 4.1\sigma$ for the patchy screening estimator, which is in excess relative to the kSZ signal. We attribute this excess to contamination from CMB lensing. We demonstrate the effect of lensing using $N$-body simulations, and we show that the screening signal is dominated by it. Accounting for lensing, our measurement places a 95\% upper bound on the optical depth of the Extended DESI LRG sample of $\tau &lt;$ 2.5 $10^{-4}$ for a mean value of the sample of $\tau \approx$ 1.6 $10^{-4}$. Furthermore, via hydro simulations, we show that the underlying optical depth signal measured by both effects (after removing the CMB lensing contribution) is in perfect agreement when adopting either a Compensated Aperture Photometry (CAP) filter or a high-pass filter. Consistent with previous measurements, we see evidence for excess baryonic feedback around DESI LRGs in the patchy screening measurement. Provided both effects are measured with high signal-to-noise, one can measure the amplitude ratio between them, which is proportional to the root-mean-square velocity of the host halo sample, and place constraints on velocity-sensitive models such as modified gravity and phantom dark energy.</description>

      <title>Dim cores of radio-bright AGN jets: VLBI and Gaia astrometry pinpoint different parsec-scale features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometry with the very long baseline radio interferometry (VLBI) allows us to determine the position of a point close to the brightest compact detail of the source at milliarcsecond scales. For most active galactic nuclei (AGNs), this compact detail is the opaque core of the radio jet. Rare cases of sources whose brightest detail is not the core but a prominent jet feature parsecs away from the core have been reported, but such sources remained elusive. In this work, we use a novel method for a systematic search of these sources. We scrutinize the AGNs for which the offset between their coordinates determined with VLBI and Gaia is statistically significant and coincides with the vector between two dominant features in their VLBI images, using publicly available archival multi-frequency data. We find 35 sources whose VLBI coordinates are associated with a bright component of their jet separated by several to tens of mas from the radio core. Their Gaia coordinates, in turn, correspond to the jet origin and are close to the radio jet core. The previously published jet directions of most of them must be reversed. These sources exhibit atypically low brightness temperatures of the radio cores, down to 10^9 K in the host galaxy frame, and, at the same time, extreme brightness of the dominating jet components. We argue that these bright components are standing shock fronts and discuss possible physical reasons for the low core brightness, such as ineffective particle heating, atypical absorption, or differential Doppler boosting.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Anti-Correlation between Photon Index and Flux of the Crab using RXTE and NuSTAR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the recently reported anti-correlation between X-ray flux and photon index ($\Gamma$) in the Crab Nebula, using archival RXTE/PCA (3 - 50 keV), RXTE/HEXTE (20 - 100 keV), and NuSTAR (3 - 78 keV) observations. Spectra were extracted in soft (3 - 10 keV) and hard bands (10 - 50 keV, 10 - 78 keV, 20 - 100 keV) and fitted with an absorbed power-law model. Across all instruments and energy ranges, we confirm the existence of a persistent negative correlation -- harder spectra at higher flux levels. The correlation is stronger in the hard bands compared to the soft bands. This is consistent with synchrotron emission modulated by magnetic field variations in the pulsar wind nebula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider non-linear electrodynamics (NED) minimally coupled to general relativity. We derive novel electrically charged, spherically symmetric, black-hole solutions having, for some set of parameters, all their NED fields (the electric field and the square of the electromagnetic field) regular for all values of the radial coordinate. For another set of parameters, the NED fields and the Kretschmann scalar are regular as the radial coordinate runs from one spatial infinity to another spatial infinity without the metric being a wormhole. We obtain solutions that have two distinct or the same asymptotic behaviors (two spatial infinities) with equal or unequal ADM masses and solutions with always one horizon whatever the ratio of the electric charge to mass. We comment on some regularity theorems and generalize them to multi-valued NED Lagrangians. The derived regular solutions do not violate the Weak Energy Condition.</description>

      <title>Peering into the heart of darkness with VLBA : Radio Quiet AGN in the JWST North Ecliptic Pole Time-Domain Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present initial results from the 4.8 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) survey of the JWST North Ecliptic Pole Time-Domain Field (TDF). From 106 radio sources found in the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations in the TDF, we detected 12 sources (11% detection rate) at 3.3 $\mu$Jy rms sensitivity and 4 mas resolution. Most detections exhibit pc-scale emission (less than 40 pc) with high VLBA/VLA flux density ratios and brightness temperatures exceeding 10$^5$ K, confirming non-thermal AGN activity. Spectral indices ($&gt;$ -0.5) correlate with higher VLBA/VLA flux ratios, consistent with synchrotron emission from AGN coronae or jets. In the majority of our sources star formation contributes less than 50% of the total VLBA radio emission, with a few cases where the emission is almost entirely AGN-driven. Although the radio emission from radio quiet AGN is thought to be primarily driven by star formation, our VLBA observations confirm that there is also often a contribution at various levels from black hole driven AGN. Eight VLBA detections have JWST/NIRCam counterparts, predominantly early-type, bulge-dominated galaxies, which we use to get an estimate of the redshift and star formation rate (SFR). WISE colors indicate that VLBA detections are either AGN or intermediate-disk-dominated systems, while VLBA non-detections correspond to extended, star-forming galaxies. We compare SFRs derived from previous SCUBA-2 850 $\mu$m observations with new JWST-based estimates, and discuss the observed discrepancies, highlighting JWST's improved capability to disentangle AGN activity from star formation.</description>

      <title>Detailed Chemical Abundance Analysis of Metal-Poor Turn-Off Stars: One with [Fe/H] &lt; -4 and Three with [Fe/H] &lt; -4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the analysis of four new extremely metal poor turn-off stars thanks to high-resolution spectra obtained with the Subaru/HDS spectrograph. We determined the abundances and upper limits of Li, C, Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba. Metallicities range from [Fe/H] = -3.3 to -4.4 dex. For one of the stars, we measure the lithium abundance Log(Li/H) = 2.1 {\pm} 0.2. Two stars of the sample have low [{\alpha}/Fe] abundances. The most metal-poor star of the sample with [Fe/H] = -4.42 dex has a high [Sr/Fe] abundance ratio [Sr/Fe] = 0.9 dex, a high value also found in HE 1327-2326. This star is the second-most iron-poor star observed with Subaru telescope, suggesting that more ultra metal-poor stars could be discovered using high-resolution spectrographs in the Northern Hemisphere.</description>

      <title>Flash Ionization of the Early Universe by Pop III.1 Supermassive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pop III.1 theory for supermassive black hole (SMBH) formation predicts that a substantial fraction of the early universe was ionized by supermassive stars at redshifts $z\sim20-30$, an era we refer to as ``The Flash''. This is followed by recombination to a mainly neutral state within a few tens of Myr. Here we discuss the implication of this ionization for the scattering optical depth of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), $\tau$. We find a fiducial contribution of $\tau_{\rm PopIII.1}\sim0.04$. Combining this with the contribution to reionization by standard galaxy populations at $z\lesssim 10$ with $\tau_{\rm gal}\simeq0.06$, yields a total of $\tau\simeq0.10$. As noted recently by several authors, such a value can help resolve apparent ``problems'' faced by $\Lambda$CDM of negative neutrino masses and dynamical dark energy that have been implied by recent Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).</description>

      <title>Do assumptions about the central density of subhaloes affect dark matter annihilation and lensing calculations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subhalo models play a critical role in dark matter annihilation predictions and galaxy-galaxy lensing studies; however, the internal structure of subhaloes remains highly uncertain. In particular, a growing body of evidence suggests that the central density of cuspy dark matter subhaloes is conserved in minor mergers, whereas empirical models of subhalo evolution -- calibrated using limited-resolution simulations -- often assume a drop in the central density. To assess the impact of these assumptions, we systematically explore how a wide range of initial mass profiles and tidal evolution prescriptions influence annihilation and lensing calculations, including the physically motivated Energy Truncation model, which explicitly preserves the central density of subhaloes. We find that annihilation calculations are very sensitive to the assumed inner density profile, and different models can produce more than an order of magnitude difference in the annihilation rate of individual subhaloes, and a factor of $\sim5$ in the total annihilation rate expected in the Milky Way. Since the innermost parts of haloes will always be difficult to resolve in simulations, we conclude that developing a theoretical understanding of subhalo evolution is crucial to be able to make accurate predictions of the dark matter annihilation signal. On the other hand, while the shear and convergence profiles used in galaxy-galaxy lensing are sensitive to the initial profile assumed (e.g., NFW versus Einasto), they are otherwise well-approximated by a simple stripping model in which the original profile is sharply truncated at a tidal radius.</description>

      <title>Simulated host galaxy analogs of high-z quasars observed with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hosts of two low-luminosity high-z quasars, J2255+0251 and J2236+0032, were recently detected using JWST's NIRCam instrument. These represent the first high-z quasar host galaxy stellar detections and open a new window into studying high-z quasars. We examine the implications of the measured properties of J2255+0251 and J2236+0032 within the context of the hydrodynamic simulation BlueTides at z = 6.5. We find that these observed quasars fall on the BlueTides stellar to black hole mass relation and have similar luminosities to the brightest simulated quasars. We predict their star formation rates, estimating approximately $10^{2-3}$ $M_{\odot}/ \rm yr$ for both quasar hosts. J2255+0251 and J2236+0032's host galaxy radii also fall within estimates of the radii of the simulated host galaxies of similar luminosity quasars. We generate mock JWST NIRCam images of analogs to the observed quasars within BlueTides and perform a point source removal to illustrate both a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the measured and simulated radii and magnitudes. The quasar subtraction works well for similar luminosity quasars, and the recovered host images are consistent with what was observed for J2255+0251 and J2236+0032, further supporting the success of those observations. We also use our mock imaging pipeline to make predictions for the detection of J2255+0251 and J2236+0032's hosts in upcoming JWST observations. We anticipate that the simulation analogs of future high-z quasar host discoveries will allow us to make accurate predictions of their properties beyond the capabilities of JWST.</description>

      <title>A two-phase model of galaxy formation: III. The formation of globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a model of globular cluster (GC) formation within the cosmological hierarchy of structure formation. The model is rooted in the `two-phase' scenario of galaxy formation developed in Paper-I, where the fast accretion of dark matter halos at high redshift leads to the formation of self-gravitating, turbulent gas clouds that subsequently fragment into dynamically hot systems of dense sub-clouds with masses $\sim 10^6$--$10^7 {\rm M}_\odot$. Here we elaborate on the formation, evolution, and fate of these sub-clouds, and show that some of the sub-clouds can be compactified via two distinctive channels into a `supernova-free' regime to form two distinct populations of GCs. The model is simple, characterized by a small number of free parameters underpinned by physical considerations, and can be efficiently implemented into cosmological N-body simulations to generate a coherent sample of halos, galaxies, and GCs. Calibrated with observations, our model can reproduce a range of observational statistics, including those for GC masses, sizes, metallicities, spatial distributions, and the relation of GC systems with host galaxies/halos. Significant discrepancies between model results and existing observations are discussed in connection to processes implemented in the model. Predictions for GCs are made for both the local Universe and for redshift up to $z \approx 10$, and can be tested by upcoming observations.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Formation in Open Star Clusters III: Probability of Binary Black Holes Hidden in Gaia Black Hole Binary</title>

Abstract: The Gaia mission and its follow-up observations have discovered a few candidates of non-interacting single black holes (BHs) and visible stars, Gaia BH1, BH2, and BH3, collectively called ``astrometric BH binaries''. This paper investigates whether any of these candidates harbor binary BHs (BBHs), namely, whether any such candidates are previously undiscovered ``astrimetric BBH triples''. Focusing on open star clusters, which are promising formation sites of astrometric BH binaries, we estimate the formation rate of astrometric BBH triples through gravitational $N$-body simulations. We find a competitively high formation efficiency of astrometric BBH triples ($\sim 10^{-6} {\rm M}_\odot^{-1}$ or $\sim 10$\% of astrometric BH binaries) in low-metallicity environments but no astrometric BBH triples in solar-metallicity environments. Most of the astrometric BBH triples in our simulations were dynamically stable for $10$ Gyrs, indicating that $\sim10$\% of astrometric BH binary candidates may indeed harbor inner BBHs if they originate from open star clusters in low-metallicity environments. Astrometric BBH triples can be distinguished from astrometric BH binaries through radial velocity follow-up of the tertiary star. According to the statistics of our simulated samples, a small percent of astrometric BH binary candidates should exhibit detectable radial-velocity modulations generated by inner BBHs. Such candidates preferentially exhibit ``outer'' orbital periods of $\gtrsim 10^3$ days and moderately high ``outer'' orbital eccentricities ($\gtrsim 0.7$). Our current result will strongly motivate the search for astrometric BBH triples in the upcoming Gaia Data Release 4 and Gaia Final Data Release.</description>

      <title>The dual nature of GHZ9: coexisting AGN and star formation activity in a remote X-ray source at z=10.145</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopic characterization of GHZ9 at z= 10.145 $\pm$ 0.010, currently the most distant source detected by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The spectrum reveals several UV high-ionization lines, including CII, SiIV, [NIV], CIV, HeII, OIII], NIII], and CIII]. The prominent rest-frame equivalent widths (EW(CIV)$\simeq$65A, EW(OIII])$\simeq$28A, EW(CIII])$\simeq$48A) show the presence of a hard AGN radiation field, while line ratio diagnostics are consistent with either AGN or star-formation as the dominant ionizing source. GHZ9 is nitrogen-enriched (6--9.5 (N/O)$_{\odot}$), carbon-poor (0.2--0.65 (C/O)$_{\odot}$), metal-poor (Z = 0.01--0.1 Z$_{\odot}$), and compact ($&lt;$ 106 pc), similarly to GNz11, GHZ2, and recently discovered N-enhanced high redshift objects. We exploited the newly available JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam dataset to perform an independent analysis of the Chandra data confirming that GHZ9 is the most likely JWST source associated to X-ray emission at 0.5-7 keV. Assuming a spectral index $\Gamma$ = 2.3 (1.8), we estimate a black hole (BH) mass of 1.60 $\pm$ 0.31 (0.48 $\pm$ 0.09) $\times$ 10$^8$M$_{\odot}$, which is consistent either with Eddington-accretion onto heavy ($\geq$ 10$^6$ M$_{\odot}$) BH seeds formed at z=18, or super-Eddington accretion onto a light seed of $\sim$ 10$^2-10^4$ M$_{\odot}$ at z = 25. The corresponding BH-to-stellar mass ratio M$_{BH}$/M$_{star}$= 0.33$\pm$0.22 (0.10$\pm$0.07), with a stringent limit $&gt;$0.02, implies an accelerated growth of the BH mass with respect to the stellar mass. GHZ9 is the ideal target to constrain the early phases of AGN-galaxy coevolution with future multi-frequency observations.</description>

Abstract: Using a semi-analytic approach, we estimate halo spins for a large sample of HI-rich galaxies from the Arecibo Legacy Fast Alfa Survey and examine the correlation between HI mass fractions and halo spins. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between halo spin and the HI-to-stellar mass ratio in both low-mass and massive galaxy samples. This finding suggests a universal formation scenario: higher halo spin reduces angular momentum loss and gas condensation, leading to lower star formation rates and weaker feedback, which in turn helps retain gas within dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>A Redshift Survey of the Coma Cluster (A1656): Understanding the Nature of Subhalos in the Weak-lensing Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the physical properties of weak-lensing subhalos in the Coma cluster of galaxies using data from galaxy redshift surveys. The data include 12989 galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts (2184 from our MMT/Hectospec observation and 10807 from the literature). The $r$-band magnitude limit at which the differential spectroscopic completeness drops below 50% is 20.2 mag, which is spatially uniform in a region of 4.5 deg$^{2}$ where the weak-lensing map of Okabe et al. (2014) exists. We identify 1337 member galaxies in this field and use them to understand the nature of 32 subhalos detected in the weak-lensing analysis. We use Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) in the line-of-sight velocity domain to measure the mean velocity, the velocity dispersion, and the number of subhalo galaxies by mitigating the contamination from the interloping galaxies. Using subhalo properties calculated with GMM, we find no significant difference in the redshift space distribution between the cluster member galaxies and subhalos. We find that the weak-lensing mass shows strong correlations with the number of subhalo member galaxies, velocity dispersion, and dynamical mass of subhalos with power-law slopes of $0.54^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$, $0.93^{+0.35}_{-0.32}$, and $0.50^{+0.31}_{-0.18}$, respectively. The slope of the mass--velocity dispersion relation of the weak-lensing subhalos appears shallower than that of the galaxy clusters, galaxy groups, and individual galaxies. These results suggest that the combination of redshift surveys with weak-lensing maps can be a powerful tool for better understanding the nature of subhalos in clusters.</description>

      <title>ALMA reveals bright circumgalactic emission and a biconical outflow in z~6.4 quasar PSOJ183+05</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding gas flows between galaxies and their surrounding circum-galactic medium (CGM) is crucial to unveil the mechanisms regulating galaxy evolution, especially in the early Universe. However, observations of the CGM around massive galaxies at $z&gt;6$ remain limited, particularly in the cold gas phase. In this work, we present multi-configuration ALMA observations of [CII]$\lambda158\mu$m and millimetre continuum emission in the $z\sim6.4$ quasar PSOJ183+05. We find clumpy [CII] emission, tracing gas up to a $\sim6$ kpc radius, consistent with the interface region between the interstellar medium (ISM) and CGM. The [CII] kinematics shows a rotating disk and a high-velocity, biconical outflow extending up to 5 kpc. The inferred mass outflow rate is $\dot{M}_{\rm of}\sim930$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, among the highest at $z&gt;6$, and comparable to the star-formation rate. These findings suggest that quasar-driven outflows can rapidly transfer energy and momentum to the CGM, without immediately quenching star formation in the host galaxy ISM. This supports a delayed feedback scenario, in which outflows reshape CGM conditions and regulate future gas accretion over longer timescales. We find that neither the high-velocity component nor the extended CGM emission in PSOJ183+05 are recovered when using the high-resolution dataset alone, which may explain the conflicting results reported regarding [CII] sizes and the detection of outflows at $z\gtrsim6$. Combining multi-configuration ALMA data with observations from JWST and MUSE will be crucial to map the CGM across its different phases and build a comprehensive picture of the baryon cycle in the first massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field amplification during a turbulent collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question of whether a dynamo can be triggered by gravitational collapse is of great interest, especially for the early Universe. Here, we employ supercomoving coordinates to study the magnetic field amplification from decaying turbulence during gravitational collapse. We perform three-dimensional simulations and show that for large magnetic Reynolds numbers there can be exponential growth of the comoving magnetic field with conformal time before the decay of turbulence impedes further amplification. The collapse dynamics only affects the nonlinear feedback from the Lorentz force, which diminishes more rapidly for shorter collapse times, allowing nearly kinematic continued growth. We confirm that helical turbulence is more efficient in driving dynamo action than nonhelical turbulence, but this difference decreases for larger collapse times. We also show that for nearly irrotational flows, dynamo amplification is still possible, but it is always associated with a growth of vorticity -- even if it still remains very small. In nonmagnetic runs, the growth of vorticity is associated with viscosity and grows with the Mach number. In the presence of magnetic fields, vorticity emerges from the curl of the Lorentz force. During a limited time interval, an exponential growth of the comoving magnetic field with conformal time is interpreted as clear evidence of dynamo action.</description>

      <title>Morphology across cosmic time: assessing the evolution and interplay of disk and bulge-dominated galaxies in the CANDELS survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the redshift evolution of disk and bulge-dominated galaxies using a mass-complete sample of $\sim$14,000 galaxies from the CANDELS survey, selected with $H_{\rm mag} \leq 24$, $M_{\rm stellar} \geq 10^9\,{\rm M}_\odot$, and spanning $0.2 \leq z \leq 2.4$. Adopting an unbiased morphological classification, free from visual inspection or parametric assumptions, we explore the evolution of specific star formation rate (sSFR), stellar mass, structural properties, and galaxy fractions as a function of redshift and morphology. We find that while disk and bulge-dominated galaxies exhibit similar sSFR distributions at $z \sim 2.4$, bulge-dominated systems develop a redshift-dependent bimodality below $z &lt; 1.6$, unlike the unimodal behaviour of disks. This bimodality correlates with stellar mass: bulge-dominated galaxies with lower sSFR are significantly more massive and exhibit higher S\'ersic indices than their star-forming counterparts, despite having similar effective radii. Based on a Gaussian mixture decomposition, we identify two evolutionary tracks for bulge-dominated galaxies: G1, a long-lived, star-forming population with disk-like properties; and G2, a quenched, massive population whose prominence increases with decreasing redshift. The evolution of the star formation main sequence and morphology--mass fractions support a scenario in which G2 systems form through merger-driven transformations of massive disks. Our results indicate that bulge-dominated galaxies are not a homogeneous population, but instead follow divergent evolutionary paths driven by distinct physical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Protostellar disks in their natural habitat -- the formation of protostars and their accretion disks in the turbulent and magnetized interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present simulations of the supernova-driven turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) in a simulation domain of volume $(256\,{\rm pc})^3$ within which we resolve the formation of protostellar accretion disks and their stellar cores to spatial scales of $\sim 10^{-4}$ au, using the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO}. We perform simulations with no magnetic fields, ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and ambipolar diffusion, and compare the resulting first Larson cores and their associated structures, including the accretion disks, their location within the larger-scale structure and the streamers connecting these. We find that disks of sizes $10-100\,{\rm au}$ form early in the simulations without magnetic fields, while there are no disks larger than 10 au with ideal MHD. Ambipolar diffusion causes large disks to form in a subset of cases (two out of six cores), and generally reduces the strength of outflows, which are seen to play a central role. When they are able to carry away significant angular momentum, they prevent the formation of a rotationally supported disk. Magnetic fields strengths grow from $0.1 - 1$ mG in the protostellar core to more than 10 G in the first Larson core in all simulations with ideal MHD. The rotationally supported disks which form can have rotation speeds $&gt; 1$ km s$^{-1}$ even out to further than 100 au from the centre, become gravitationally unstable and form complex spiral substructures with Toomre $Q &lt; 1$. We conclude that the impact of magnetic fields and non-ideal MHD on the formation of protostellar disks is substantial in realistic formation scenarios from the turbulent ISM.</description>

      <title>Episodic mass loss in the very luminous red supergiant [W60] B90 in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study delves into [W60] B90, one of the most luminous and extreme Red Supergiants (RSGs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), aiming to search for evidence of episodic mass loss. Our discovery of a bar-like nebular structure at 1 pc, reminiscent of the bar around Betelgeuse, raised the question of whether [W60] B90 also has a bow shock. We collected and analyzed proper motion data from Gaia, as well as new multi-epoch spectroscopic and imaging data, and archival time-series photometry in the optical and mid-infrared. We found [W60] B90 to be a walkaway star, with a supersonic peculiar velocity in the direction of the bar. We detected shocked emission between the bar and the star, based on the [S II]/H$\alpha$ &gt; 0.4 criterion, providing strong evidence for a bow shock. The 30-year optical light curve revealed semi-regular variability, showing three similar dimming events with $\Delta V \sim 1$ mag, a recurrence of $\sim$12 yr, and a rise time of 400 d. We found the mid-IR light curve to vary by 0.51 mag and 0.37 mag in the WISE1 and WISE2 bands, respectively, and by 0.42 mag and 0.25 mag during the last dimming event. During this event, optical spectroscopy revealed spectral variability (M3I to M4I), a correlation between the $T_{\rm eff}$ and the brightness, increased extinction, and, after the minimum, spectral features incompatible with the models. We also found a difference of &gt;300 K between the $T_{\rm eff}$ measured from the TiO bands in the optical and the atomic lines from our $J$-band spectroscopy. We inferred that [W60] B90 is a more massive analog of Betelgeuse in the LMC and the first extragalactic single RSG with a suspected bow shock. Its high luminosity $\log(L/L_{\odot})=5.32$, mass-loss rate, and mid-IR variability compared to other RSGs in the LMC, indicate that it is in an unstable evolutionary state undergoing episodes of mass loss.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing between light curves of ellipsoidal variables with massive dark companions, contact binaries, and semidetached binaries using principal component analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photometric methods for identifying dark companion binaries - binary systems hosting quiescent black holes and neutron stars - operate by detecting ellipsoidal variations caused by tidal interactions. The limitation of this approach is that contact and semidetached binaries can produce similarly looking light curves. In this work, we address the degeneracy of ellipsoidal light curves by studying the differences between synthetically generated light curves of dark companion, semidetached, and contact binary systems. We inject the light curves with various levels of uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian noise to simulate the effects of instrumental noise and stellar spots. Using principal component analysis (PCA) and Fourier decomposition, we construct low-dimensional representations of the light curves. We find that the first two to five PCA components are sufficient to explain $99\%$ of variance in the data. The PCA representations are generally more informative than the Fourier representation for the same number of coefficients as measured by both the silhouette scores of the representations and the macro recalls of random forest classifiers trained on the representations. The random forest classifiers reach macro recalls from $0.97$ to $0.70$, indicating that the classes remain largely separable even under adverse conditions. We find that instrumental noise significantly impacts the class separation only when its standard deviation exceeds $10^{-3}$ mag, whereas the presence of spots can markedly reduce the class separation even when they contribute as little as $1\%$ of the light curve amplitude. We discuss the application of our method to real ellipsoidal samples, and we show that we can increase the purity of a sample of dark companion candidates by a factor of up to $27$ if we assume a prior purity of $1\%$, significantly improving the cost-efficiency of follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Co-precession of a curved jet and compact accretion disk in M87</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observational constraints on the configuration of the black hole (BH)-accretion disk-jet system are crucial to understanding BH spin, accretion disk physics, and jet formation. The recently reported variation in the M87 jet position angle (PA) provides a novel avenue to explore these long-standing issues. The observed $\sim$ 11-year periodicity, spanning over two cycles, is consistent with the Lense-Thirring (LT) precession of a compact, tilted accretion disk. However, how such a compact region decouples from the larger-scale accretion flow remains an open question in current numerical simulations. The jet precession challenges the traditional view of a strictly collimated jet, revealing a subtle curvature in the jet's inner regions that dynamically links the jet to the spinning BH and successfully accounts for its unexpectedly wide inner projected profile. While continued long-term observations are needed to distinguish coherent precession from stochastic fluctuations in the disk or jet orientation, these results open a new window for probing BH systems through coordinated multi-scale observations and follow-on theoretical models.</description>

      <title>The more accurately the metal-dependent star formation rate is modeled, the larger the predicted excess of binary black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the number of gravitational-wave detections grows, the merger rate of binary black holes (BBHs) can help us to constrain their formation, the properties of their progenitors, and their birth environment. Here, we aim to address the impact of the metal-dependent star formation rate (SFR) on the BBH merger rate. To this end, we have developed a fully data-driven approach to model the metal-dependent SFR and coupled it to BBH evolution. We have adopted the most up-to-date scaling relations, based on recent observational results, and we have studied how the BBH merger rate density varies over a wide grid of galaxy and binary evolution parameters. Our results show that including a realistic metal-dependent SFR evolution yields a value of the merger rate density which is too high compared to the one inferred from gravitational-wave data. Moreover, variations in the SFR in low-mass galaxies ($M_\ast \lesssim 10^8 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) do not contribute more than a factor $\sim 2$ to the overall merger rate density at redshift $z=0$. These results suggest that the discrepancy between the BBH merger rate density inferred from data and theoretical models is not caused by approximations in the treatment of the metal-dependent SFR, but rather stems from stellar evolution models and/or BBH formation channels.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays Masquerading as Hot CGM Gas: An Inverse-Compton Origin for Diffuse X-ray Emission in the Circumgalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations have argued that Milky Way (MW), Andromeda, and lower-mass galaxies exhibit extended soft X-ray diffuse halos to radii $R\gtrsim100\,$kpc in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). If interpreted as thermal emission, the shallow surface brightness profiles $S_{X}\propto R^{-1}$ are difficult to explain and contradict other observations. We show that such halos instead arise from inverse Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons with GeV cosmic ray (CR) electrons. GeV electrons have ~Gyr lifetimes and escape the galaxy, forming a shallow extended profile out to $\gtrsim100\,$kpc, where IC off the CMB should produce soft, thermal-like X-ray spectra peaked at ~keV. The observed keV halo luminosities and brightness profiles agree well with those expected for CRs observed in the local interstellar medium (LISM) escaping the galaxy, with energetics consistent with known CRs from SNe and/or AGN, around galaxies with stellar masses $M_{\ast}\lesssim2\times 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$. At higher masses observed X-ray luminosities are larger than predicted from IC and should be dominated by hot gas. In the MW+M31, the same models of escaping CRs reproduce gamma-ray observations if we assume an LISM-like proton-to-electron ratio and CR-pressure-dominated halo. In all other halos, the radio and $\gamma$-ray brightness is below detectable limits. If true, the observations provide qualitatively new constraints on CGM and CR physics: X-ray brightness directly traces the CR lepton energy density in the CGM. This agrees with LISM values within 10 kpc, which following the profile expected for escaping CRs in the CGM. The inferred CR pressure is a major part of the MW CGM pressure budget. X-ray surface brightness and luminosity allows one to further determine the CGM diffusivity at radii $\sim10-1000\,$kpc. These also agree with LISM values at small radii but increase in the CGM.</description>

Abstract: Star-forming galaxies (SFGs) are considered to be an important component of the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB) radiation observed in 0.1 -- 820 GeV, but their quantitative contribution has not yet been precisely determined. In this study, we aim to provide the currently most reliable estimate of the contribution of SFGs based on careful calibration with gamma-ray luminosities of nearby galaxies and physical quantities (star formation rate, stellar mass, and size) of galaxies observed by high-redshift galaxy surveys. Our calculations are based on the latest database of particle collision cross-sections and energy spectra of secondary particles, and take into account not only hadronic but also leptonic processes with various radiation fields in a galaxy. We find that SFGs are not the dominant component of the unresolved EGB measured by Fermi; the largest contribution is around 50% -- 60% in the 1 -- 10 GeV region, and the contribution falls rapidly in lower and higher energy ranges. This result appears to contradict a previous study, which claimed that SFGs are the dominant component of the unresolved EGB, and the origin of the discrepancy is examined. In calculations of cosmic-ray production, propagation, and interaction in a galaxy, we try models developed by two independent groups and find that they have little impact on EGB.</description>

      <title>Detecting galaxy-21-cm cross-correlation during reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic 21-cm signal promises to revolutionize studies of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Radio interferometers are aiming for a preliminary, low signal-to-noise (S/N) detection of the 21-cm power spectrum. Cross-correlating 21-cm with galaxies will be especially useful in these efforts, providing both a sanity check for initial 21-cm detection claims and potentially increasing the S/N due to uncorrelated residual systematics. Here we self-consistently simulate large-scale (1 Gpc) galaxy and 21-cm fields, computing their cross-power spectra for various choices of instruments as well as survey properties. We use 1080h observations with SKA-low AA* and HERA-350 as our benchmark 21-cm observations. We create mock Lyman alpha narrow-band, slitless and slit spectroscopic surveys, using benchmarks from instruments such as Subaru HyperSupremeCam, Roman grism, VLT MOONS, ELT MOSAIC, and JWST NIRCam. We forecast the resulting S/N of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum, varying the galaxy survey area, depth and level of 21-cm foreground contamination for each pair of instruments. We find that the highest S/N is achievable through slitless, wide-area spectroscopic surveys, with the proposed Roman HLS survey resulting in a 55$\sigma$ detection of the cross power with 21-cm as observed with SKA-low AA* for our fiducial model. Narrow-band dropout surveys are unlikely to result in a detectable cross-power, due to their poor redshift localization. Slit spectroscopy can provide a high S/N detection of the cross power for SKA-low AA* observations. Specifically, the planned MOONRISE survey with MOONS on the VLT can result in a 3$\sigma$ detection, while a survey of comparable observing time using MOSAIC on the ELT can result in a 4$\sigma$ detection. Our results can be used to guide survey strategies, facilitating the detection of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Bracketing the soliton-halo relation of ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In theories of ultralight dark matter, solitons form in the inner regions of galactic halos. The observational implications of these depend on the soliton mass. Various relations between the mass of the soliton and properties of the halo have been proposed. We analyze the implications of these relations, and test them with a suite of numerical simulations. The relation of Schive et al. 2014 is equivalent to $(E/M)_{\rm sol}=(E/M)_{\rm halo}$ where $E_{\rm sol (halo)}$ and $M_{\rm sol (halo)}$ are the energy and mass of the soliton (halo). If the halo is approximately virialized, this relation is parametrically similar to the evaporation/growth threshold of Chan et al. 2022, and it thus gives a rough lower bound on the soliton mass. A different relation has been proposed by Mocz et al. 2017, which is equivalent to $E_{\rm sol}=E_{\rm halo}$, so is an upper bound on the soliton mass provided the halo energy can be estimated reliably. Our simulations provide evidence for this picture, and are in broad consistency with the literature, in particular after accounting for ambiguities in the definition of $E_{\rm halo}$ at finite volume.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a variable yellow supergiant progenitor for the Type IIb SN 2024abfo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a progenitor candidate for the Type~IIb SN2024abfo using multi-epoch pre-explosion images from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. The progenitor exhibited a ~0.7 mag decline in F814W from 2001 to 2013, followed by significant brightening and color fluctuations in the g, r and z bands. This is the first time that substantial photometric variability has been found for the progenitor of a SN IIb. We suggest that the variability is caused by intrinsic changes in the progenitor star instead of varying obscuration by circumstellar dust. Our results show that the progenitor of SN2024abfo was likely a yellow supergiant star with an initial mass of 12--18 Msun for circumstellar reddening of E(B-V)_CSM &lt; 0.2 mag. Our study underscores the critical role of multi-epoch imaging surveys in revealing the final stages of core-collapse supernovae progenitors.</description>

      <title>Linear Thermal Instability of a Condensing Gas-Particle Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of a hot saturated gas coexisting with condensed particles in an optically thin medium. Such a situation may obtain downstream of a shock, at condensation fronts, or in vaporizing impacts. We show that the gas-particle mixture is subject to a thermal instability whereby a region of lower temperature and higher condensate density cools faster to condense faster. If the region of runaway condensation has a sound-crossing time shorter than its cooling time, then it accretes more mass, in gas and particles, from its higher pressure surroundings. Numerical integration of the linearized perturbation equations demonstrates that this radiation-condensation instability can create particle clumps and voids out of a secularly cooling gas. Provided radiation can escape to cool particle overdensities, thermal instability can help assemble chondrite parent bodies out of the vaporized debris of asteroid collisions, and form planetesimals generally.</description>

      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): Pipeline-Determined Physical Properties of OB Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim to determine the physical properties of OB stars from the multi-epoch VLT/FLAMES BLOeM spectroscopic survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud. We apply a pipeline designed to analyse large spectroscopic samples of OB stars to the co-added, initial 9 epochs of the BLOeM survey, utilising grids of synthetic model spectra computed with the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND. 69 OB stars are excluded from the analysis owing to disk emission or significant contamination by secondaries in SB2 binaries. We determine physical properties of 778 OB stars, including Teff, log g, log L/Lsun and v_e sin i. There appears to be a bimodality in v_e sin i of single O stars, while v_e sin i distributions of OB stars are strikingly different for single (median 78 km/s) and binary (median 200 km/s) systems. Inferred temperatures are broadly in agreement with literature results for stars in common, plus results from a grid-based automization tool for a subset of O and early B stars, although uncertainties are larger for surface gravities. Rotational velocities are broadly in line with an independent tool applied to the same subset. We recover the anticipated lower mass cutoff at 8 Msun from the survey design using a Bayesian inference method coupled with SMC metallicity evolutionary models, with median masses of 12.6 Msun (19.8 Msun) for B-type (O-type) stars. Spectroscopic masses exceed evolutionary masses, albeit with large uncertainties in surface gravities. We also provide an updated catalogue of O stars in the SMC since half of the 159 BLOeM O stars are newly classified as O-type stars.</description>

      <title>JWST lens model for A370: A very low dark matter fraction for a brightest cluster galaxy and lensing properties for the Dragon arc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new lens model for the $z=0.375$ galaxy cluster Abell 370 based on previously spectroscopically confirmed lensed galaxies and new lensed systems identified in JWST data, including recent data from the MAGNIF program. Based on the best models able to reproduce two radial arcs near the BCGs, we compare the stellar mass to the total mass from the lens model and find that the fraction of dark matter in the south BCG is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM while in the north BCG we find a very small amount of dark matter, more consistent with alternative models to $\Lambda$CDM. We discuss possible causes for this and conclude that additional data is needed to clarify the situation. We study the lensing properties, magnification, time delay and strength of the critical curve, along the Dragon arc, where previous studies have reported tens of alleged microlensing events from supergiant stars at $z=0.7251$. The new lens model is able to reproduce the distribution of microlensing events with great accuracy. Some of the microlensing events may be reinterpreted as long-period Cepheid in future observations. We consider this possibility and study in more detail the challenges for such detection from intervening microlenses.</description>
