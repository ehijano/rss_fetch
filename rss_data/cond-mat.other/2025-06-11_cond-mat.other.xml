      <title>Ramanujan, Landau and Casimir, divergent series: a physicist point of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a popular paradoxical exercise to show that the infinite sum of positive integer numbers is equal to -1/12, sometimes called the Ramanujan sum. Here we propose a qualitative approach, much like that of a physicist, to show how the value -1/12 can make sense and, in fact, appears in certain physical quantities where this type of summation is involved. At the light of two physical examples, taken respectively from condensed matter -- the Landau diamagnetism -- and quantum electrodynamics -- the Casimir effect -- that illustrate this strange sum, we present a systematic way to extract this Ramanujan term from the infinity.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Gauge Effect for 2-D Non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson Model in Cylinder Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge offers a powerful route to engineer novel topological phenomena. Here, we systematically investigate a two-dimensional (2-D) non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson model incorporating SU(2) non-Abelian gauge, demonstrating the emergence of Hopf-link bulk braiding topology in the complex energy spectrum solely with x-direction nearest-neighbor couplings. Because of the limitations of exceptional point (EP) topology in fully capturing the rich non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) under non-Abelian influence, we introduce a novel polarization parameter derived from the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). This parameter quantitatively discerns left-, right-, and notably, bipolar skin modes, with its accuracy corroborated by directly encoding real-space eigenstate. Our findings reveal that non-Abelian gauge provides unprecedented influence over NHSE, compared with Abelian gauge and without gauge cases. Furthermore, we uncover unique characteristics of zero-imaginary-energy eigenstates at these topological boundaries, including pronounced degeneracy and bipolar localization which is unaffected by size effects, investigated via dynamical evolution and Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR). This work establishes a new paradigm for synthesizing and manipulating non-Hermitian topological phases driven by non-Abelian structures, opening avenues for topological engineering and holding promise for experimental realization in synthetic dimensional platforms.</description>

      <title>Adaptive quantum dynamics with the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation. This adaptive tVMC approach addresses numerical instabilities that arise when the variational ansatz is overparameterized or contains redundant degrees of freedom. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans\"atze.</description>

      <title>HSG-12M: A Large-Scale Spatial Multigraph Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing graph benchmarks assume non-spatial, simple edges, collapsing physically distinct paths into a single link. We introduce HSG-12M, the first large-scale dataset of $\textbf{spatial multigraphs}-$graphs embedded in a metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two nodes are retained as separate edges. HSG-12M contains 11.6 million static and 5.1 million dynamic $\textit{Hamiltonian spectral graphs}$ across 1401 characteristic-polynomial classes, derived from 177 TB of spectral potential data. Each graph encodes the full geometry of a 1-D crystal's energy spectrum on the complex plane, producing diverse, physics-grounded topologies that transcend conventional node-coordinate datasets. To enable future extensions, we release $\texttt{Poly2Graph}$: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that maps arbitrary 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Benchmarks with popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning from multi-edge geometry at scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices, forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for geometry-aware graph learning and new opportunities of data-driven scientific discovery in condensed matter physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Fighting Exponentially Small Gaps by Counterdiabatic Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the efficiency of approximate counterdiabatic driving (CD) in accelerating adiabatic passage through a first-order quantum phase transition. Specifically, we analyze a minimal spin-glass bottleneck model that is analytically tractable and exhibits both an exponentially small gap at the transition point and a change in the ground state that involves a macroscopic rearrangement of spins. Using the variational Floquet-Krylov expansion to construct CD terms, we find that while the formation of excitations is significantly suppressed, achieving fully adiabatic evolution remains challenging, necessitating high-order nonlocal terms in the expansion. Our results demonstrate that local CD strategies have limited effectiveness when crossing the extremely small gaps characteristic of NP-hard Ising problems. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative method, termed quantum brachistochrone counterdiabatic driving (QBCD), which significantly increases the fidelity to the target state over the expansion method by directly addressing the gap-closing point and the associated edge states.</description>

      <title>Interplay of entanglement structures and stabilizer entropy in spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between nonstabilizerness and entanglement is crucial for uncovering the fundamental origins of quantum complexity. Recent studies have proposed entanglement spectral quantities, such as antiflatness of the entanglement spectrum and entanglement capacity, as effective complexity measures, establishing direct connections to stabilizer R\'enyi entropies. In this work, we systematically investigate quantum complexity across a diverse range of spin models, analyzing how entanglement structure and nonstabilizerness serve as distinctive signatures of quantum phases. By studying entanglement spectra and stabilizer entropy measures, we demonstrate that these quantities consistently differentiate between distinct phases of matter. Specifically, we provide a detailed analysis of spin chains including the XXZ model, the transverse-field XY model, its extension with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, as well as the Cluster Ising and Cluster XY models. Our findings reveal that entanglement spectral properties and magic-based measures serve as intertwined, robust indicators of quantum phase transitions, highlighting their significance in characterizing quantum complexity in many-body systems.</description>
