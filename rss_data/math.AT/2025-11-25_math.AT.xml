      <title>Infinitely Many Tangent Functors on Diffeological Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study tangent spaces in the setting of diffeological spaces. Several distinct tangent functors have been introduced, each of which extends the classical tangent functor from smooth manifolds. In this paper, we construct infinitely many non-isomorphic tangent functors on diffeological spaces. We compare our constructions with existing models, including the internal and external tangent spaces. Our results show that the choice of tangent functor is far from unique outside smooth manifolds.</description>

      <title>The universal continuous six functor formalism on light condensed anima</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the universal property of the six functor formalism $\Shv(-;\Sp)$ on locally compact Hausdorff spaces given by Zhu, we show that the six functor formalism $\Shv(-;\Sp)$ on light condensed anima in the sense of Heyer-Mann is initial among all six functor formalisms $D$ satisfying some mild conditions, and then we present some applications.</description>

      <title>Invariant and Coinvariant Morse Homologies for Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we construct invariant and coinvariant Morse chain complexes with integer coefficients for any compact effective orbifold. We conjecture that the homology of the coinvariant chain complex computes the homology of the underlying topological space over $\Z$, improving a construction of \cite{cho2014orbifold}, which is isomorphic to the homology of the underlying topological space over $\Q$. In contrast, the homology of the invariant Morse chain complex is sensitive to the orbifold structure itself.</description>

      <title>Joint Projective Invariants on First Jet Spaces of Point Configurations via Moving Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the action of the projective group $PGL(3,\mathbb{R})$ on the $n$-fold first-order jet space of point configurations on the plane. Using the method of moving frames, we construct an explicit complete generating set for the field of absolute first-order joint projective differential invariants $\mathcal{I}_{n,0}$ for any $n \ge 3$. This approach provides a unified construction for all $n$, immediately ensuring functional independence of the fundamental invariants and yielding formulas suitable for both symbolic and numerical implementation.
  Next, we study the field of relative first-order invariants $\mathcal{I}_n$ with Jacobian multiplier. It is shown that the invariantization of the Jacobian under the projective action yields a primitive element of the field extension $\mathcal{I}_n / \mathcal{I}_{n,0}$.
  Finally, we introduce a multiplicative cochain complex $C^\bullet$ associated with the action of $PGL(3,\mathbb{R})$ on the jet space, and show that the invariantization operator induced by the moving frame generates an explicit contracting homotopy. This provides a constructive proof of the vanishing of higher cohomology and an interpretation of the "defect" of invariantization as an exact cocycle in $C^\bullet$.</description>

      <title>On the generalized brace product: relation to $H$-splitting of loop space fibrations \&amp; the $J$-homomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a fibration $F \hookrightarrow E \rightarrow B$ with a homotopy section $s: B \rightarrow E$, James introduced a binary product $\left\{, \right\}_s: \pi_i B \times \pi_j F \rightarrow \pi_{i+j-1} F$, called the brace product, which was later generalized by Yoon. We show that the vanishing of this generalized brace product is the precise obstruction to the $H$-splitting of the loop space fibration, i.e., $\Omega E \simeq \Omega B \times \Omega F$ as $H$-spaces. Using rational homotopy theory, we show that for rational spaces, the vanishing of the generalized brace product coincides with the vanishing of the classical James brace product, enabling us to perform the relevant computations. In addition, the notion of $J$-homomorphism is generalized and connected to the generalized brace product. Among the applications, we characterize the homotopy types of certain fibrations, including sphere bundles over spheres.</description>

      <title>A chain-level model for Chas-Sullivan products in Morse homology with differential graded coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the framework of Morse theory with differential graded coefficients to study certain operations on the total space of a fibration. More particularly, we focus in this paper on a chain-level description of the Chas-Sullivan product on the homology of the free loop space of an oriented, closed and connected manifold. The idea of ''intersecting on the base'' and ''concatenating on the fiber'' are well-adapted to this framework. We also give a Morse theoretical description of other products that follow the same principle. For this purpose, we develop functorial properties with respect to the coefficient in terms of morphisms of A $\infty$ -modules and morphisms of fibrations. We also build a differential graded version of the K{\"u}nneth formula and of the Pontryagin-Thom construction.</description>

Abstract: We present a combinatorial isomorphism between Stasheff associahedra and an inductive cone construction of those complexes given by Loday. We give an alternate description of certain polytopes, known as multiplihedra, which arise in the study of $A_\infty$ maps. We also prove a combinatorial isomorphism between Stasheff associahedra, collapsed multiplihedra and graph cubeahedra for path graphs.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Multiparameter Persistence Modules</title>

Abstract: Dey and Xin (J.Appl.Comput.Top., 2022, arXiv:1904.03766) describe an algorithm to decompose finitely presented multiparameter persistence modules using a matrix reduction algorithm. Their algorithm only works for modules whose generators and relations are distinctly graded. We extend their approach to work on \emph{all} finitely presented modules and introduce several improvements that lead to significant speed-ups in practice. Our algorithm is fixed parameter tractable with respect to the maximal number of relations with the same degree and with further optimisation we obtain an $O(n^3)$ algorithm for interval-decomposable modules. In particular, we can decide interval-decomposability in this time. As a by-product to the proofs of correctness we develop a theory of parameter restriction for persistence modules. Our algorithm is implemented as a software library \textsc{aida} which is the first to enable the decomposition of large inputs. We show its capabilities via extensive experimental evaluation.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Insights into Protein Architecture: Persistent Homology and Machine Learning Applied to the Flagellar Motor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning approach that leverages persistent homology to classify bacterial flagellar motors into two functional states: rotated and stalled. By embedding protein structural data into a topological framework, we extract multiscale features from filtered simplicial complexes constructed over atomic coordinates. These topological invariants, specifically persistence diagrams and barcodes, capture critical geometric and connectivity patterns that correlate with motor function. The extracted features are vectorized and integrated into a machine learning pipeline that includes dimensionality reduction and supervised classification. Applied to a curated dataset of experimentally characterized flagellar motors from diverse bacterial species, our model demonstrates high classification accuracy and robustness to structural variation. This approach highlights the power of topological data analysis in revealing functionally relevant patterns beyond the reach of traditional geometric descriptors, offering a novel computational tool for protein function prediction.</description>

      <title>A Steenrod Square for Link Floer Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Manolescu-Sarkar constructed a stable homotopy type for link Floer homology, which uses grid homology and accounts for all domains that do not pass through a specific square. We explicitly give the framings of the lower-dimensional moduli spaces of the Manolescu-Sarkar construction as well as the more general moduli spaces corresponding to the full grid. Though in the latter case the stable homotopy type is not known, the explicit framings are enough to construct a framed 1-flow category, a construction by Lobb-Orson-Sch\"utz which contains enough information to find the second Steenrod square. Finally, we find an algorithm for computing the second Steenrod square for all versions of grid homology coming from the full grid.</description>

      <title>Algebraic topology of $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any $C^*$-algebra can be regarded as a generalization of locally compact Hausdorff topological space. Here we consider a generalization of fundamental group and (co)homology theory. In result one has invariants of $C^*$-algebras such that: for any commutative $C^*$-algebra $A = C_0\left(\mathcal X \right)$ the invariants of $A$ coincide with the $\mathcal X$ ones, the theory is not trivial even for algebras having a one spectrum, e.g. containing one point only. Instead of $\mathcal X$ we consider the space $\mathcal Y$ which should not be Hausdorff. However a noncommutative $C^*$-algebra $A$ defines $\mathcal Y$ and vice-versa.</description>
