      <title>Unveiling the Diversity of Type IIn Supernovae via Systematic Light Curve Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type IIn supernovae (SNeIIn) are a highly heterogeneous subclass of core-collapse supernovae, spectroscopically characterized by signatures of interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). Here we systematically model the light curves of 142 archival SNeIIn using MOSFiT (the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients). We find that the observed and inferred properties of SNIIn are diverse, but there are some trends. The typical SN CSM is dense ($\sim$10$^{-12}$gcm$^{-3}$) with highly diverse CSM geometry, with a median CSM mass of $\sim$1M$_\odot$. The ejecta are typically massive ($\gtrsim10$M$_\odot$), suggesting massive progenitor systems. We find positive correlations between the CSM mass and the rise and fall times of SNeIIn. Furthermore there are positive correlations between the rise time and fall times and the $r$-band luminosity. We estimate the mass-loss rates of our sample (where spectroscopy is available) and find a high median mass-loss rate of $\sim$10$^{-2}$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$, with a range between 10$^{-4}$--1M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. These mass-loss rates are most similar to the mass loss from great eruptions of luminous blue variables, consistent with the direct progenitor detections in the literature. We also discuss the role that binary interactions may play, concluding that at least some of our SNeIIn may be from massive binary systems. Finally, we estimate a detection rate of 1.6$\times$10$^5$yr$^{-1}$ in the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>From coasting to energy-conserving: new self-similar solutions to the interaction phase of strong explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical explosions that contain dense and ram-pressure-dominated ejecta evolve through an interaction phase, during which a forward shock (FS), contact discontinuity (CD), and reverse shock (RS) form and expand with time. We describe new self-similar solutions that apply to this phase and are most accurate in the limit that the ejecta density is large compared to the ambient density. These solutions predict that the FS, CD, and RS expand at different rates in time and not as single temporal power-laws, are valid for explosions driven by steady winds and homologously expanding ejecta, and exist when the ambient density profile is a power-law with power-law index shallower than $\sim 3$ (specifically when the FS does not accelerate). We find excellent agreement between the predictions of these solutions and hydrodynamical simulations, both for the temporal behavior of the discontinuities and for the variation of the fluid quantities. The self-similar solutions are applicable to a wide range of astrophysical phenomena and -- although the details are described in future work -- can be generalized to incorporate relativistic speeds with arbitrary Lorentz factors. We suggest that these solutions accurately interpolate between the initial ``coasting'' phase of the explosion and the later, energy-conserving phase (or, if the ejecta is homologous and the density profile is sufficiently steep, the self-similar phase described in Chevalier 1982),</description>

      <title>Extreme-mass ratio inspirals in strong segregation regime -- to inspiral or to get ejected?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme-mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) are among the main targets for upcoming low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). In the classical scenario, EMRIs are formed when BHs scatter off each other and are driven onto highly eccentric orbits that gradually inspiral due to GW emission. If the cluster is in a state of strong mass segregation, the BHs are expected to reside in a steep cusp around the central massive black hole (MBH), which would facilitate more efficient EMRI formation. However, strong mass segregation may also lead to an increased rate of ejections due to close encounters between the BHs. Here, we test the relevance of such ejections for EMRI formation by numerically solving a two-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation. Our formalism includes the effects of two-body relaxation, GW dissipation, and ejections. We find that the EMRI formation rate can be suppressed due to ejections by more than an order of magnitude for strongly segregated BH cusps with density index $\gamma\gtrsim 2.25$ around central MBHs of mass $M_{\bullet} \lesssim 10^6 M_\odot $. The EMRI formation rate levels off up to a maximum value of $\simeq 200~{\rm Gyr}^{-1}$ due to ejections, which is roughly an order of magnitude lower than the usual scenarios ignoring ejections for steep BH cusps around low mass MBHs. Our analysis brings forth the significance of strong scatterings for EMRI formation in galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic $\gamma$-ray modulations in the blazars PKS 2155-83 and PKS 2255-282</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While there has been an increase in interest in the possibility of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in blazars, the search has hitherto been restricted to sources with well-sampled light curves. Objects with light curves that include gaps have been, to our knowledge, overlooked. Here, we study two such curves, which have the interesting feature of pertaining to relatively high redshift blazars -- FSRQs, PKS 2155-83 and PKS 2255-282 -- observed by Fermi-LAT. Their redshifts border the 'cosmic noon' era of galaxy formation and merging, and their light curves exhibit a distinctive pattern of repetitive high and low (gap dominant) states for $15.6$ years. To accommodate for the gaps in the curves, data is integrated over extended time intervals of 1 month and 2 months. The resulting curves were also examined using methods suitable for sparsely sampled data. This investigation of PKS 2155-83 and PKS 2255-282 suggests QPOs with periods of $4.69\pm0.79$ yr ($3\sigma$) and $6.82\pm2.25$ yr ($2.8\sigma$), respectively. The flux PDFs of the blazars, along with the correlation between their flux and spectral index, were also analyzed. Given the epochs the objects are observed, the plausibility of a binary black hole scenario as an origin of the apparent periodicity was examined. We estimated the prospective parameters of such a system using a simple geometric model. The total masses were estimated, and found to be consistent, in principle, with independent (dynamical) measurements of the central black hole masses in the two host galaxies.</description>

      <title>Kilonova emission from GW230529 and mass gap neutron star-black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of the gravitational-wave event GW230529, presumably a neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger, by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration is an exciting discovery for multimessenger astronomy. The black hole (BH) has a high probability of falling within the ''mass gap'' between the peaks of the neutron star (NS) and the BH mass distributions. Because of the low primary mass, the binary is more likely to produce an electromagnetic counterpart than previously detected NSBH mergers. We investigate the possible kilonova (KN) emission from GW230529, and find that if it was an NSBH, there is a $\sim$ 2-41% probability (depending on the assumed equation of state) that GW230925 produced a KN with magnitude peaking at $\sim 1-2$ day post merger at $g \lesssim 23.5$, $i&lt;23$. Hence, it could have been detected by ground-based telescopes. If it was a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, we find $\sim$ 0-12% probability that it produced a KN. Motivated by these numbers, we simulated a broader population of mgNSBH mergers that may be detected in O4, and we obtained a 9-21% chance of producing a KN, which would be detectable with $g\lesssim 25$ and $ i \lesssim 24$, typically fainter than what is expected from GW230529. Based on these findings, DECam-like instruments may be able to detect up to 80% of future mgNSBH KNe, thus up to $\sim1$ multimessenger mgNSBH per year may be discoverable at the current level of sensitivity (O4).</description>

      <title>A Novel Optimal Transport-Based Approach for Interpolating Spectral Time Series: Paving the Way for Photometric Classification of Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for creating spectral time series, which can be used for generating synthetic light curves for photometric classification but also for applications like K-corrections and bolometric corrections. This approach is particularly valuable in the era of large astronomical surveys, where it can significantly enhance the analysis and understanding of an increasing number of SNe, even in the absence of extensive spectroscopic data. methods: By employing interpolations based on optimal transport theory, starting from a spectroscopic sequence, we derive weighted average spectra with high cadence. The weights incorporate an uncertainty factor, for penalizing interpolations between spectra with significant epoch differences and with poor match between the synthetic and observed photometry. results: Our analysis reveals that even with phase difference of up to 40 days between pairs of spectra, optical transport can generate interpolated spectral time series that closely resemble the original ones. Synthetic photometry extracted from these spectral time series aligns well with observed photometry. The best results are achieved in the V band, with relative residuals less than 10% for 87% and 84% of the data for type Ia and II, respectively. For the B, g, R and r bands the relative residuals are between 65% and 87% within the previously mentioned 10% threshold for both classes. The worse results correspond to the i and I bands where, in the case, of SN~Ia the values drop to 53% and 42%, respectively. conclusions: We introduce a new method to construct spectral time series for individual SN starting from a sparse spectroscopic sequence, demonstrating its capability to produce reliable light curves that can be used for photometric classification.</description>

      <title>Escape of fast radio bursts from magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright extragalactic transients likely produced by magnetars. We study the propagation of FRBs in magnetar winds, assuming that the wind is strongly magnetized and composed of electron-positron pairs. We focus on the regime where the strength parameter of the radio wave, $a_0$, is larger than unity, and the wave frequency, $\omega_0$, is larger than the Larmor frequency in the background magnetic field, $\omega_{\rm L}$. We show that strong radio waves with $a_0&gt;1$ are able to propagate when $\omega_0 &gt; a_0\omega_{\rm L}$, as the plasma current is a linear function of the wave electric field. The dispersion relation is independent of the wave strength parameter when $\omega_0 &gt; a_0\omega_{\rm L}$. Instead, radio waves could be damped when $\omega_0 &lt; a_0\omega_{\rm L}$, as a significant fraction of the wave energy is used to compress the plasma and amplify the background magnetic field. Our results suggest that FRBs should be produced at large distances from the magnetar (i.e., $R&gt;10^{12}{\rm\; cm}$, where the condition $\omega_0 &gt; a_0\omega_{\rm L}$ is satisfied). Alternatively, the structure of the magnetar wind should be strongly modified during a flare to allow the escape of FRBs produced at radii $R&lt;10^{12}{\rm\; cm}$.</description>

      <title>A growing braking index and spin-down swings for the pulsar PSR B0540-69</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The way pulsars spin down is not understood in detail, but a number of possible physical mechanisms produce a spin-down rate that scales as a power of the rotation rate ($\dot\nu\propto-\nu^n$), with the power-law index $n$ called the braking index. PSR B0540-69 is a pulsar that in 2011, after 16 years of spinning down with a constant braking index of 2.1, experienced a giant spin-down change and a reduction of its braking index to nearly zero. Here, we show that following this episode the braking index monotonically increased during a period of at least four years and stabilised at ~1.1. We also present an alternative interpretation of a more modest rotational irregularity that occurred in 2023, which was modelled as an anomalous negative step of the rotation rate. Our analysis shows that the 2023 observations can be equally well described as a transient swing of the spin-down rate (lasting ~65 days), and the Bayesian evidence indicates that this model is strongly preferred.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a millisecond pulsar associated with Terzan 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations show that globular clusters might be among the best places to find millisecond pulsars. However, the globular cluster Terzan 6 seems to be an exception without any pulsar discovered, although its high stellar encounter rate suggests that it harbors dozens of them. We report the discovery of the first radio pulsar, PSR J1751-3116A, likely associated with Terzan 6 in a search of C-band (4-8 GHz) data from the Green Bank Telescope with a spin period of 5.33 ms and dispersion measure, DM$\simeq$383 ${\rm pc~cm^{-3}}$. The mean flux density of this pulsar is approximately 3 ${\rm \mu Jy}$. The DM agrees well with predictions from the Galactic free electron density model, assuming a distance of 6.7 kpc for Terzan 6. PSR J1751-3116A is likely an isolated millisecond pulsar, potentially formed through dynamical interactions, considering the core-collapsed classification and the exceptionally high stellar encounter rate of Terzan 6. This is the highest radio frequency observation that has led to the discovery of a pulsar in a globular cluster to date. While L-band (1-2 GHz) observations of this cluster are unlikely to yield significant returns due to propagation effects, we predict that further pulsar discoveries in Terzan 6 will be made by existing radio telescopes at higher frequencies.</description>

Abstract: In this article a new method is proposed for estimating the mass composition of cosmic rays in individual events with energies above $1.25 \times 10^{19}$ eV. It is based on a joint analysis of experimental data and simulation results obtained using the QGSJet-II.04 model for muons with threshold energy $E_{\mu} = 1.0 \times \cos\theta$ GeV in air showers with zenith angles up to 60 degrees. The data from ground-based and underground scintillation detectors of the Yakutsk EAS array were used. Separate groups of nuclei and other primary particles were found.</description>

      <title>Investigating the CREDIT history of supernova remnants as cosmic-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) have long been suspected to be the primary sources of Galactic cosmic rays. Over the past decades, great strides have been made in the modelling of particle acceleration, magnetic field amplification, and escape from SNRs. Yet, while many SNRs have been observed in non-thermal emission in radio, X-rays, and gamma-rays, there is no evidence for any individual object contributing to the locally observed flux. Here, we propose a particular spectral signature from individual remnants that is due to the energy-dependent escape from SNRs. For young and nearby sources, we predict fluxes enhanced by tens of percent in narrow rigidity intervals; given the percent-level flux uncertainties of contemporary cosmic-ray data, such features should be readily detectable. We model the spatial and temporal distribution of sources and the resulting distribution of fluxes with a Monte Carlo approach. The decision tree that we have trained on simulated data is able to discriminate with very high significance between the null hypothesis of a smooth distribution of sources and the scenario with a stochastic distribution of individual sources. We suggest that this cosmic-ray energy-dependent injection time (CREDIT) scenario be considered in experimental searches to identify individual SNRs as cosmic-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Vetting quark-star models with gravitational waves in the hierarchical Bayesian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new avenue for investigating the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter in compact stars, which is an outstanding problem in astronomy and nuclear physics. In the future, next-generation (XG) GW detectors will be constructed, deemed to provide a large number of high-precision observations. We investigate the potential of constraining the EOS of quark stars (QSs) with high-precision measurements of mass $m$ and tidal deformability $\Lambda$ from the XG GW observatories. We adopt the widely-used bag model for QSs, consisting of four microscopic parameters: the effective bag constant $B_{\rm eff}$, the perturbative quantum chromodynamics correction parameter $a_4$, the strange quark mass $m_s$, and the pairing energy gap $\Delta$. With the help of hierarchical Bayesian inference, for the first time we are able to infer the EOS of QSs combining multiple GW observations. Using the top 25 loudest GW events in our simulation, we find that, the constraints on $B_{\rm eff}$ and $\Delta$ are tightened by several times, while $a_4$ and $m_s$ are still poorly constrained. We also study a simplified 2-dimensional (2-d) EOS model which was recently proposed in literature. The 2-d model is found to exhibit significant parameter-estimation biases as more GW events are analyzed, while the predicted $m$-$\Lambda$ relation remains consistent with the full model.</description>

Abstract: The Be/X-ray binary pulsar RX J0440.9+4431 went through a giant outburst in December 2022 with a peak flux of $\sim$2.3 Crab in 15--50 keV. We studied the broad-band timing and spectral properties of RX J0440.9+4431 using four $AstroSat$ observations, where the source transited between subcritical and supercritical accretion regimes. Pulsations were detected significantly above 100 keV. The pulse profiles were found to be highly luminosity- and energy-dependent. A significant evolution in the pulse profile shape near the peak of the outburst indicates a possible change in the accretion mode and beaming patterns of RX J0440.9+4431. The rms pulsed fraction was luminosity- and energy-dependent, with a concave-like feature around 20--30 keV. The depth of this feature varied with luminosity, indicating changes in the accretion column height and proportion of reflected photons. The broad-band continuum spectra were best fitted with a two-component Comptonization model with a blackbody component or a two-blackbody component model with a thermal Comptonization component. A quasi-periodic oscillation at 60 mHz was detected at a luminosity of $2.6 \times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which evolved into 42 mHz at $1.5 \times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The QPO rms were found to be energy dependent with an overall increasing trend with energy. For the first time, we found the QPO frequency varying with photon energy in an X-ray pulsar, which poses a challenge in explaining the QPO with current models such as the Keplarian and beat frequency model. Hence, more physically motivated models are required to understand the physical mechanism behind the mHz QPOs.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Key Features of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic high-energy events with unknown origins, which are observationally divided into two categories, i.e., repeaters and non-repeaters. However, there are potentially a number of non-repeaters that may be misclassified, as repeating bursts are missed due to the limited sensitivity and observation periods, thus misleading the investigation of their physical properties. In this work, we propose a repeater identification method based on the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm and apply the classification to the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) catalog. We find that the spectral morphology parameters, specifically spectral running ($r$), represent the key features for identifying repeaters from the non-repeaters. Also, the results suggest that repeaters are more biased towards narrowband emission, whereas non-repeaters are inclined toward broadband emission. We provide a list of 163 repeater candidates, with $5$ of which are confirmed with an updated repeater catalog from CHIME/FRB. Our findings help to the understanding of the various properties underlying repeaters and non-repeaters, as well as guidelines for future FRB detection and categorization.</description>

      <title>Powerful flares and magneto-elastic oscillations of magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetars are neutron stars with superstrong magnetic fields which can exceed 1e15 G. Some magnetars (the so-called soft gamma-repeaters) demonstrate occasionally very powerful processes of energy release, which result in exceptionally strong flares of electromagnetic radiation. It is believed that these flares are associated with the presence of superstrong magnetic fields. Despite many hypotheses, the mechanism of these flares remains a mystery. In afterglows of the flares, one has often observed quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of magnetar emission. They are interpreted as stellar vibrations, excited by the flares, which are useful for exploring the nature of magnetar activity. The incompleteness of theories employed to interpret magnetar QPOs is discussed.</description>

      <title>Features and prospects for Kilonova remnant detection with current and future surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the observable spectral and temporal properties of kilonova remnants analytically, and showcase quantitative differences with respect to supernova remnants. We provide detection prospects of kilonova remnants in the context of ongoing radio surveys. We find that there is a good chance to expect 10s of such objects in future surveys with a flux threshold of $\sim 0.1$ mJy. Kilonova remnants from a postulated population of long lived supramassive neutron star remnants of neutron star mergers are even more likely to be detected as they are extremely bright and peak earlier. For ongoing survey with threshold of $\sim$ mJy, we expect to find 10-100s of such objects if they are a significant fraction of total kilonova population. Considering that there are no promising such kilonovae candidates in current surveys, we constrain the fraction of such extreme kilonova to be no more than 30 percent of the overall kilonovae rate, depending on the details of ejecta mass and external density distribution.</description>

      <title>An Extended Closure Relation by LightGBM for Neutrino Radiation Transport in Core-collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a machine learning model using LightGBM, one of the most popular gradient boosting decision tree methods these days, to predict the Eddington tensor, or the second-order angular moment, for neutrino radiation transport in core-collapse supernova simulations. We use not only zero-th and first moments as in ordinary closure relations but also information on the background matter configuration extensively. For training the model we utilize some post-bounce snapshots from one of our previous Boltzmann radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. The Eddington tensor as well as the zero-th and first angular moments are calculated from the neutrino distribution function obtained in the simulation. LightGBM is light indeed and its high efficiency in training enables us to feed a large number of features and figure out which features are more important than others. We report in this paper the results of the training and validation as well as the generalization of our model: it can reproduce the Eddington factor better in general than the M1-closure relation, one of the most commonly employed algebraic closure relations at present; the generalization performance is also much improved from our previous model based on the deep neural network.</description>

      <title>Metamorphosis of Positronium Moving Across a Magnetic Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positronium spectrum and lifetimes are known with a high precision. The situation is different for positronium moving across a magnetic field. The total momentum does not commute with the Hamiltonian and is replaced by conserved pseudomomentum. The internal dynamics is not separated from the motion of the system as a whole. The Coulomb potential well is distorted and a wide outer potential well is created. We analytically determine the energy spectrum for a broad range of the magnetic field and pseudomomentum values. We locate the region of these parameters for which the ground state resides in the outer well. The results may play a role in the supression of pulsars radio emission (polar cap problem).</description>

      <title>SpectrAx: Spectral Search of Axion-Like Particles Using Multi-Band Observations of Galaxy Clusters from SKA, SO, CMB-S4 and eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of axions or Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) has been predicted by various Beyond Standard Model (BSM) theories, and the proposed photon-ALP interaction is one of the ways to probe them. Such an interaction will lead to photon-ALP resonant conversion in galaxy clusters, resulting in a polarized spectral distortion in the CMB along the cluster line of sight. The estimation of this signal from galaxy clusters requires an estimation of the electron density and magnetic field in galaxy clusters. We have developed a new Bayesian framework \texttt{SpectrAx} that can use observations from different electromagnetic bands such as radio, CMB, optical, and X-ray to infer the astrophysical properties of a galaxy cluster, such as cluster its redshift, electron density and magnetic field, along with the BSM physics such as ALPs. By using the simulated data for upcoming CMB surveys such as Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4 in combination with Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) we demonstrate the capability in accurately inferring the ALPs coupling strength along with the radial profile of electron density and magnetic field from galaxy clusters. The application of this framework to the data from future surveys by combining SKA+SO+eROSITA and SKA+CMB-S4+eROSITA will make it possible for the first time to explore both astrophysics and BSM physics from low-redshift galaxy clusters using a multi-band approach.</description>

      <title>An improved IMR model for BBHs on elliptical orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waveforms capturing binary's evolution through the early-inspiral phase play a critical role in extracting orbital features that nearly disappear during the late-inspiral and subsequent merger phase due to radiation reaction forces; for instance, the effect of orbital eccentricity. Phenomenological approaches that model compact binary mergers rely heavily on combining inputs from both analytical and numerical approaches to reduce the computational cost of generating templates for data analysis purposes. In a recent work, Chattaraj et al., Phys. Rev. D 106, 124008 (2022) arXiv:2204.02377(gr-qc), we demonstrated construction of a dominant (quadrupole) mode inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) model for binary black holes (BBHs) on elliptical orbits. The model was constructed in time-domain and is fully analytical. The current work is an attempt to improve this model by making a few important changes in our approach. The most significant of those involves identifying initial values of orbital parameters with which the inspiral part of the model is evolved. While the ingredients remain the same as in arXiv:2204.02377(gr-qc), resulting waveforms at each stage seem to have improved as a consequence of new considerations proposed here. The updated model is validated also against an independent waveform family resulting overlaps better than $\sim 96.5\%$ within the calibrated range of binary parameters. Further, we use the prescription of the dominant mode model presented here to provide an alternate (but equivalent) model for the (dominant) quadrupole mode and extend the same to a model including the effect of selected non-quadrupole modes. Finally, while this model assumes non-spinning components, we show that this could also be used for mildly spinning systems with component spins (anti-) aligned w.r.t the orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Stable Case BB/BC Mass Transfer to Form GW190425-like Massive Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On April 25th, 2019, the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration discovered a Gravitational-wave (GW) signal from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, i.e., GW190425. Due to the inferred large total mass, the origin of GW190425 remains unclear. We perform detailed stellar structure and binary evolution calculations that take into account mass-loss, internal differential rotation, and tidal interactions between a He-rich star and a NS companion. We explore the parameter space of the initial binary properties, including initial NS and He-rich masses and initial orbital period. We find that the immediate post-common-envelope progenitor system, consisting of a primary $\sim2.0\,M_\odot$ ($\sim1.7\,M_\odot$) NS and a secondary He-rich star with an initial mass of $\sim3.0-5.5\,M_\odot$ ($\sim5.5-6.0\,M_\odot$) in a close binary with an initial period of $\sim0.08-0.5\,{\rm{days}}$ ($\sim 0.08-0.4\,{\rm{days}}$), that experiences stable Case BB/BC mass transfer (MT) during binary evolution, can reproduce the formation of GW190425-like BNS events. Our studies reveal that the secondary He-rich star of the GW190425's progenitor before its core collapse can be efficiently spun up through tidal interaction, finally remaining as a NS with rotational energy even reaching $\sim10^{52}\,{\rm{erg}}$, which is always much higher than the neutrino-driven energy of the supernova (SN) explosion. If the newborn secondary NS is a magnetar, we expect that GW190425 can be the remnant of a magnetar-driven SN, e.g., a magnetar-driven ultra-stripped SN, a superluminous SN, or a broad-line Type Ic SN. Our results show that GW190425 could be formed through the isolated binary evolution, which involves a stable Case BB/BC MT just after the common envelope phase. On top of that, we show the He-rich star can be tidally spun up, potentially forming a spinning magnetized NS (magnetar) during the second SN explosion.</description>

Abstract: Gamma/hadron discrimination in ground-based gamma-ray observatories at the GeV energy range is challenging as traditional muon-based methods become less effective at lower energies. This work explores a novel gamma/hadron discrimination method for Extensive Air Shower arrays that analyzes the shower signal footprint patterns using advanced Vision Transformer (ViT) models. The robustness of this method against noise, including atmospheric muons and low-energy proton showers, demonstrates its potential for application in future gamma-ray observatories.</description>

      <title>Evidence for gravitational self-lensing of the central supermassive black hole binary in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1566</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally accepted that all massive galaxies host supermassive black holes (BHs) in their center and that mergers of two galaxies lead to the formation of BH binaries. The most interesting among them comprise the mergers in their final state, that is to say with parsec (3.2 light years) or sub-parsec orbital separations. It is possible to detect these systems with binary self-lensing. Here we report the potential detection of a central supermassive BH binary in the active galaxy (AGN) NGC1566 based on a microlensing outburst. The light curve of the outburst - based on observations with the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae - lasted from the beginning of 2017 until the beginning of 2020. The steep symmetric light curve as well as its shape look very different with respect to normal random variations in AGN. However, the observations could be easily reproduced with a best-fit standard microlensing light curve. Based on the light curve, we derived a characteristic timescale of 155 days. During the outburst, the continuum as well as the broad line intensities varied; however, the narrow emission lines did not. This is an indication that the lensing object orbits the AGN nucleus between the broad line region (BLR) and the narrow line region (NLR), that is, at a distance on the order of 250 light days. The light curve can be reproduced by a lens with a BH mass of 5*10^{5} M_solar. This implies a mass ratio to the central AGN on the order of 1 to 10.</description>

      <title>Imaging fermionic dark matter cores at the center of galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current images of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) candidates at the center of our Galaxy and M87 have opened an unprecedented era for studying strong gravity and the nature of relativistic sources. Very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) data show images consistent with a central SMBH within General Relativity (GR). However, it is essential to consider whether other well-motivated dark compact objects within GR could produce similar images. Recent studies have shown that dark matter (DM) halos modeled as self-gravitating systems of neutral fermions can harbor very dense fermionic cores at their centers, which can mimic the spacetime features of a black hole (BH). Such dense, horizonless DM cores can satisfy the observational constraints: they can be supermassive and compact and lack a hard surface. We investigate whether such cores can produce similar observational signatures to those of BHs when illuminated by an accretion disk. We compute images and spectra of the fermion cores with a general-relativistic ray tracing technique, assuming the radiation originates from standard $\alpha$ disks, which are self-consistently solved within the current DM framework. Our simulated images possess a central brightness depression surrounded by a ring-like feature, resembling what is expected in the BH scenario. For Milky Way-like halos, the central brightness depressions have diameters down to $\sim 35\, \mu$as as measured from a distance of approximately $8\,$kpc. Finally, we show that the DM cores do not possess photon rings, a key difference from the BH paradigm, which could help discriminate between the models.</description>

Abstract: A dark sector with a very large number of massive degrees of freedom is generically constrained by radiative corrections to Newton's constant. However, there are caveats to this statement, especially if the degrees of freedom are light or mass-less. Here, we examine in detail and update a number of constraints on the possible number of dark degrees of freedom, including from black hole evaporation, from perturbations to systems including an evaporating black hole, from direct gravitational production at colliders, from high-energy cosmic rays, and from supernovae energy losses.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with a Ricci coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes in scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity with an additional coupling between the scalar field and the Ricci scalar using non-linear simulations that employ excision. In this class of theories, black holes possess hair if they lie in a specific mass range, in which case they exhibit a finite-area singularity, unlike general relativity. Our results show that the Ricci coupling can mitigate the loss of hyperbolicity in spherical evolution with black hole initial data. Using excision can enlarge the parameter space for which the system remains well-posed, as one can excise the elliptic region that forms inside the horizon. Furthermore, we explore a possible relation between the loss of hyperbolicity and the formation of the finite-area singularity inside the horizon. We find that the location of the singularity extracted from the static analysis matches the location of the sonic line well. Finally, when possible, we extract the monopolar quasi-normal modes and the time scale of the linear tachyonic instability associated with scalarization. We also check our results by utilizing a continued fraction analysis and supposing linear perturbations of the static solutions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction in dark matter spikes: corrections to Chandrasekhar's formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the intermediate mass-ratio inspiral of a stellar-mass compact object with an intermediate-mass black hole that is surrounded by a dark matter density spike. The interaction of the inspiraling black hole with the dark matter particles in the spike leads to dynamical friction. This can alter the dynamics of the black hole binary, leaving an imprint on the gravitational wave signal. Previous calculations did not include in the evaluation of the dynamical friction coefficient the contribution from particles that move faster than the black hole. This term is neglected in the standard Chandrasekhar's treatment where only slower moving particles contribute to the decelerating drag. Here, we demonstrate that dynamical friction produced by the fast moving particles has a significant effect on the evolution of a massive binary within a dark matter spike. For a density profile $\rho\propto r^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma\lesssim 1$, the dephasing of the gravitational waveform can be several orders of magnitude larger than estimated using the standard treatment. As $\gamma$ approaches $0.5$ the error becomes arbitrarily large. Finally, we show that dynamical friction tends to make the orbit more eccentric for any $\gamma &lt; 1.8$. However, energy loss by gravitational wave radiation is expected to dominate the inspiral, leading to orbital circularization in most cases.</description>

      <title>The discovery of three pulsars in the globular cluster M15 with the FAST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the discovery of three pulsars in the Globular Cluster (GC) M15 (NGC 7078) by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). PSR J2129+1210J (M15J) is a millisecond pulsar with a spin period of 11.84 ms and a dispersion measure of 66.68 pc cm-3. Both PSR J2129+1210K and L (M15K and L) are long-period pulsars with spin periods of 1928 ms and 3961 ms, respectively. M15L is the GC pulsar with the longest spin period known. The timing solutions of M15A to M15H are updated. As predicted by Ridolfi et al.(2018), the flux density of M15C keeps decreasing and the latest detection in our dataset was on December 20th, 2022. We have also detected M15I's signal for the first time since its discovery. Current timing suggests that it is an isolated pulsar.</description>

      <title>The proper way to spatially decompose the gravitational-wave origin in stellar collapse simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) hold great potential for an unobscured view of protoneutron stars (PNSs) formed as a result of stellar collapses. While waiting for discovery, deepening the understanding of GW emission in theory is beneficial for both optimizing searching strategies and deciphering the eventual data. One significant aspect is the spatially dependent contribution to the overall GW signal extracted from sophisticated hydrodynamic simulations. I present the proper way to perform the spatial decomposition of GW strain with the quadrupole formula in the slow-motion and weak-field approximation. Then I demonstrate the approach using the results of a 2D axisymmetric pseudo-Newtonian hydrodynamic simulation of core-collapse supernova. I show a detailed comparison between the proper and improper methods and discuss the possible consequences based on the improper method. Moreover, with the correct approach, the GW spatial profiles agree well with those calculated from a consistent perturbative method.</description>

      <title>X-ray view of dissipative warm corona in active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the X-ray spectra of AGNs, a noticeable excess of soft X-rays is typically detected beyond the extrapolation of the power-law trend observed between 2-10 keV. In the scenario of warm Comptonization, observations propose a warm corona temperature ranging from 0.1-1 keV and an optical depth of approximately 10-20. Furthermore, according to radiative constraints derived from spectral analyses employing Comptonization models, it is suggested that the majority of the accretion power is released within the warm corona, while the disk beneath it is largely non-dissipative, emitting mainly the reprocessed radiation from the corona. We test the dissipative warm corona model using the radiative transfer code-TITAN/NOAR on a sample of 82 XMM-Newton observations of AGNs. Through spectral modeling of the X-ray data, we aim to estimate the total amount of internal heating inside the warm corona situated on top of the accretion disk. By modeling the 0.3-10 keV EPIC-pn spectra, we estimate the internal heating and optical depth of the warm corona and check their correlations with global parameters blackhole parameters. From model normalization, we compute the radial extent of warm corona on top of cold accretion disk. Our model infers the presence of dissipative warm corona, with optical depths distributed in the range 6-30 and total internal heating in the range 1-29 x 1e-23 erg/s-cm3. The extent of warm corona is spread across a large range from 7-408 gravitational radii, and we find that warm corona is more extended for larger accretion rates. Soft excess emission is ubiquitous in AGNs across wide mass range and accretion rate. We confirm that warm corona responsible for producing the soft-excess is highly dissipative in nature with larger optical depths being associated with lower internal heating and vice versa. The cold standard accretion disk regulates the extent of warm corona.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dissipation in short gamma-ray burst jets. I. Resistive relativistic MHD evolution in a model environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short gamma-ray bursts originate when relativistic jets emerge from the remnants of binary neutron star mergers. Both the jet and the remnant are believed to be strongly magnetized, and the presence of magnetic fields is known to influence the jet propagation across the surrounding post-merger environment. In the magnetic interplay between the jet and the environment itself, effects due to a finite plasma conductivity may be important, especially in the first phases of the jet propagation. We aim to investigate such effects, from jet launching to its final breakout from the post-merger environment. 2D axisymmetric and full 3D resistive relativistic MHD simulations, are performed with the PLUTO numerical code. Different models for physical resistivity, which must be small but still above the numerical one (producing unwanted smearing of structures in any ideal MHD code) are considered and compared. All simulations are performed by using an axisymmetric analytical model for the jet propagation environment; we leave the case of jet propagation in a realistic environment (i.e. imported from actual binary neutron star merger simulation) to a later study. Significant differences in the jet structure and induced turbulence are clearly seen in 2D axisymmetric simulations. Regions with a resistive electric field parallel to the magnetic field form and non-thermal particle acceleration may be enhanced there. The level of dissipated Ohmic power is also dependent on the various recipes for resistivity. Most of the differences arise before breakout from the magnetized environment, whereas once the jet enters the external atmosphere these differences are preserved during further propagation despite the lower grid refinement. Finally, we show and discuss the 3D evolution of the jet within the same environment, in order to highlight the emergence of non-axisymmetric features.</description>

      <title>Extragalactic Magnetar Giant Flare GRB 231115A: Insights from Fermi/GBM Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the detection and analysis of GRB 231115A, a candidate extragalactic magnetar giant flare (MGF) observed by Fermi/GBM and localized by INTEGRAL to the starburst galaxy M82. This burst exhibits distinctive temporal and spectral characteristics that align with known MGFs, including a short duration and a high peak energy. Gamma-ray analyses reveal significant insights into this burst, supporting conclusions already established in the literature: our time-resolved spectral studies provide further evidence that GRB 231115A is indeed a MGF. Significance calculations also suggest a robust association with M82, further supported by a high Bayes factor that minimizes the probability of chance alignment with a neutron star merger. Despite extensive follow-up efforts, no contemporaneous gravitational wave or radio emissions were detected. The lack of radio emission sets stringent upper limits on possible radio luminosity. Constraints from our analysis show no fast radio bursts (FRBs) associated with two MGFs. X-ray observations conducted post-burst by Swift/XRT and XMM/Newton provided additional data, though no persistent counterparts were identified. Our study underscores the importance of coordinated multi-wavelength follow-up and highlights the potential of MGFs to enhance our understanding of short GRBs and magnetar activities in the cosmos. Current MGF identification and follow-up implementation are insufficient for detecting expected counterparts; however, improvements in these areas may allow for the recovery of follow-up signals with existing instruments. Future advancements in observational technologies and methodologies will be crucial in furthering these studies.</description>

      <title>Performance-Portable Binary Neutron Star Mergers with AthenaK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an extension to the AthenaK code for general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) in dynamical spacetimes using a 3+1 conservative Eulerian formulation. Like the fixed-spacetime GRMHD solver, we use standard finite-volume methods to evolve the fluid and a constrained transport scheme to preserve the divergence-free constraint for the magnetic field. We also utilize a first-order flux correction (FOFC) scheme to reduce the need for an artificial atmosphere and optionally enforce a maximum principle to improve robustness. We demonstrate the accuracy of AthenaK using a set of standard tests in flat and curved spacetimes. Using a SANE accretion disk around a Kerr black hole, we compare the new solver to the existing solver for stationary spacetimes using the so-called "HARM-like" formulation. We find that both formulations converge to similar results. We also include the first published binary neutron star (BNS) mergers performed on graphical processing units (GPUs). Thanks to the FOFC scheme, our BNS mergers maintain a relative error of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-11})$ or better in baryon mass conservation up to collapse. Finally, we perform scaling tests of AthenaK on OLCF Frontier, where we show excellent weak scaling of $\geq 80\%$ efficiency up to 32768 GPUs and $74\%$ up to 65536 GPUs for a GRMHD problem in dynamical spacetimes with six levels of mesh refinement. AthenaK achieves an order-of-magnitude speedup using GPUs compared to CPUs, demonstrating that it is suitable for performing numerical relativity problems on modern exascale resources.</description>

      <title>Signatures of ultralight bosons in the orbital eccentricity of binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the existence of clouds of ultralight particles surrounding black holes during their cosmological history as members of a binary system can leave a measurable imprint on the distribution of masses and orbital eccentricities observable with future gravitational-wave detectors. Notably, we find that for nonprecessing binaries with chirp masses ${\cal M} \lesssim 10\,M_\odot$, formed exclusively in isolation, larger-than-expected values of the eccentricity, i.e. $e\gtrsim 10^{-2}$ at gravitational-wave frequencies $f_{\rm GW} \simeq 10^{-2}\,$Hz, would provide tantalizing evidence for a new particle of mass between $[0.5,2.5] \times 10^{-12}\,$eV in nature. The predicted evolution of the eccentricity can also drastically affect the in-band phase evolution and peak frequency. These results constitute unique signatures of boson clouds of ultralight particles in the dynamics of binary black holes, which will be readily accessible with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, as well as future mid-band and Deci-hertz detectors.</description>

      <title>A plethora of long-range neutrino interactions probed by DUNE and T2HK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Upcoming neutrino experiments will soon search for new neutrino interactions more thoroughly than ever before, boosting the prospects of extending the Standard Model. In anticipation of this, we forecast the capability of two of the leading long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, DUNE and T2HK, to look for new flavor-dependent neutrino interactions with electrons, protons, and neutrons that could affect the transitions between different flavors. We interpret their sensitivity in the context of long-range neutrino interactions, mediated by a new neutral boson lighter than $10^{-10}$ eV, and sourced by the vast amount of nearby and distant matter in the Earth, Moon, Sun, Milky Way, and beyond. For the first time, we explore the sensitivity of DUNE and T2HK to a wide variety of $U(1)^\prime$ symmetries, built from combinations of lepton and baryon numbers, each of which induces new interactions that affect oscillations differently. We find ample sensitivity: in all cases, DUNE and T2HK may constrain the existence of the new interaction even if it is supremely feeble, may discover it, and, in some cases, may identify the symmetry responsible for it.</description>

      <title>What is the nature of GW230529? An exploration of the gravitational lensing hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On the 29th of May 2023, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration observed a compact binary coalescence event consistent with a neutron star-black hole merger, though the heavier object of mass 2.5-4.5 $M_\odot$ would fall into the purported lower mass gap. An alternative explanation for apparent observations of events in this mass range has been suggested as strongly gravitationally lensed binary neutron stars. In this scenario, magnification would lead to the source appearing closer and heavier than it really is. Here, we investigate the chances and possible consequences for the GW230529 event to be gravitationally lensed. We find this would require high magnifications and we obtain low rates for observing such an event, with a relative fraction of lensed versus unlensed observed events of $2 \times 10^{-3}$ at most. When comparing the lensed and unlensed hypotheses accounting for the latest rates and population model, we find a 1/58 chance of lensing, disfavoring this option. Moreover, when the magnification is assumed to be strong enough to bring the mass of the heavier binary component below the standard limits on neutron star masses, we find high probability for the lighter object to have a sub-solar mass, making the binary even more exotic than a mass-gap neutron star-black hole system. Even when the secondary is not sub-solar, its tidal deformability would likely be measurable, which is not the case for GW230529. Finally, we do not find evidence for extra lensing signatures such as the arrival of additional lensed images, type-II image dephasing, or microlensing. Therefore, we conclude it is unlikely for GW230529 to be a strongly gravitationally lensed binary neutron star signal.</description>
