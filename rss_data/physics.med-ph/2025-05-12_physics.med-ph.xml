      <title>Towards order of magnitude X-ray dose reduction in breast cancer imaging using phase contrast and deep denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed human cancer in the United States at present. Early detection is crucial for its successful treatment. X-ray mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis are currently the main methods for breast cancer screening. However, both have known limitations in terms of their sensitivity and specificity to breast cancers, while also frequently causing patient discomfort due to the requirement for breast compression. Breast computed tomography is a promising alternative, however, to obtain high-quality images, the X-ray dose needs to be sufficiently high. As the breast is highly radiosensitive, dose reduction is particularly important. Phase-contrast computed tomography (PCT) has been shown to produce higher-quality images at lower doses and has no need for breast compression. It is demonstrated in the present study that, when imaging full fresh mastectomy samples with PCT, deep learning-based image denoising can further reduce the radiation dose by a factor of 16 or more, without any loss of image quality. The image quality has been assessed both in terms of objective metrics, such as spatial resolution and contrast-to-noise ratio, as well as in an observer study by experienced medical imaging specialists and radiologists. This work was carried out in preparation for live patient PCT breast cancer imaging, initially at specialized synchrotron facilities.</description>

      <title>A Proton Treatment Planning Method for Combining FLASH and Spatially Fractionated Radiation Therapy to Enhance Normal Tissue Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: FLASH radiation therapy (FLASH-RT) uses ultra-high dose rates to induce the FLASH effect, enhancing normal tissue sparing. In proton Bragg peak FLASH-RT, this effect is confined to high-dose regions near the target at deep tissue levels. In contrast, Spatially Fractionated Radiation Therapy (SFRT) creates alternating high- and low-dose regions with high peak-to-valley dose ratios (PVDR), sparing tissues at shallow-to-intermediate depths. Purpose: This study investigates a novel proton modality (SFRT-FLASH) that synergizes FLASH-RT and SFRT to enhance normal tissue protection across all depths. Methods: Two SFRT techniques are integrated with FLASH-RT: proton GRID therapy (pGRID) with conventional beam sizes and proton minibeam radiation therapy (pMBRT) with submillimeter beams. These are implemented as pGRID-FLASH (SB-FLASH) and minibeam-FLASH (MB-FLASH), respectively. The pGRID technique uses a scissor-beam (SB) method to achieve uniform target coverage. To meet FLASH dose (5 Gy) and dose-rate (40 Gy/s) thresholds, a single-field uniform-dose-per-fraction strategy is used. Dose and dose-rate constraints are jointly optimized, including a CTV1cm structure (a 1 cm ring around the CTV) for each field. Results: Across four clinical cases, MB-FLASH and SB-FLASH plans were benchmarked against conventional (CONV), FLASH-RT (FLASH), pMBRT (MB), and pGRID (SB) plans. SFRT-FLASH achieved high FLASH effect coverage (~60-80% in CTV1cm) while preserving PVDR (~2.5-7) at shallow-to-intermediate depths. Conclusions: We present a proton treatment planning approach that combines the FLASH effect at depth with high PVDR near the surface, enhancing normal tissue protection and advancing proton therapy.</description>

      <title>UltraGauss: Ultrafast Gaussian Reconstruction of 3D Ultrasound Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely used due to its safety, affordability, and real-time capabilities, but its 2D interpretation is highly operator-dependent, leading to variability and increased cognitive demand. 2D-to-3D reconstruction mitigates these challenges by providing standardized volumetric views, yet existing methods are often computationally expensive, memory-intensive, or incompatible with ultrasound physics. We introduce UltraGauss: the first ultrasound-specific Gaussian Splatting framework, extending view synthesis techniques to ultrasound wave propagation. Unlike conventional perspective-based splatting, UltraGauss models probe-plane intersections in 3D, aligning with acoustic image formation. We derive an efficient rasterization boundary formulation for GPU parallelization and introduce a numerically stable covariance parametrization, improving computational efficiency and reconstruction accuracy. On real clinical ultrasound data, UltraGauss achieves state-of-the-art reconstructions in 5 minutes, and reaching 0.99 SSIM within 20 minutes on a single GPU. A survey of expert clinicians confirms UltraGauss' reconstructions are the most realistic among competing methods. Our CUDA implementation will be released upon publication.</description>

      <title>Conceptualization of ionization dose to water to quantify radiotherapy doses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \emph{Objective.} This study conceptualizes the ionization dose to water as the dose absorbed to water and expended exclusively on ionization, which may be more relevant to biological responses than absorbed dose, and formulates its dosimetric procedures for high-energy photon, electron, proton, and ion beams. It also aims to propose ionization chambers with reduced ionization-dose uncertainty for proton and ion beams. \emph{Approach.} Based on the international code of practice, the dosimetric procedure without W-value correction was formulated for all these beam types, and that also without stopping-power-ratio correction was formulated for proton and ion beams. For the latter, water-equivalent gas (WEG) was considered for gas-sealed ionization chambers. For dose representation, the ionization dose is calibrated to the reference absorbed dose in the standard dosimeter calibration with $^{60}$Co \gamma\ rays. The proposed dosimetry procedures were simulated for virtual test beams. \emph{Main results.} The calibrated ionization dose measured with a common ionization chamber was compatible with the absorbed dose for all beams, and with a slightly reduced uncertainty from \SI{1.4}{\%} to \SI{1.3}{\%} for proton beams and from \SI{2.4}{\%} to \SI{1.9}{\%} for ion beams. With a WEG ionization chamber, the uncertainty was further reduced to \SI{0.7}{\%} for proton beams and \SI{1.0}{\%} for ion beams. \emph{Significance.} The new dose concept, calibrated ionization dose, can be easily used in radiotherapy practice with conventional dose prescriptions. The minimized beam-quality correction for ionization doses will be advantageous for non-reference conditions and complex clinical beams of various types, including those not covered by the standard dosimetry procedures.</description>

      <title>Dosimetric Evaluation of CT-to-RED Calibration Curves on Dosimetric Accuracy in Brain Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16805v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate radiotherapy dose calculation depends on converting CT Hounsfield Units (HU) to relative electron density (RED) using calibration curves. This study compared three different CT-to-RED calibration curves-two derived from physical phantoms (CIRS 062M and Catphan 604) and one default curve from the Monaco treatment planning system (TPS) by recalculating ten brain tumor VMAT plans. The analysis showed that using the default TPS curve led to dose overestimation (by 3 5 for target volumes and 2 4 for some critical organs) compared to the CIRS phantom-derived curve, which was the most accurate. The Catphan curve had intermediate results. The findings highlight that the choice of calibration curve significantly affects dose accuracy in brain radiotherapy, and site-specific, phantom-based calibration should be prioritized to improve treatment precision and safety.</description>

      <title>An imageless magnetic resonance framework for fast and cost-effective decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the gold standard in countless diagnostic procedures, yet hardware complexity, long scans, and cost preclude rapid screening and point-of-care use. We introduce Imageless Magnetic Resonance Diagnosis (IMRD), a framework that bypasses k-space sampling and image reconstruction by analyzing raw one-dimensional MR signals. We identify potentially impactful embodiments where IMRD requires only optimized pulse sequences for time-domain contrast, minimal low-field hardware, and pattern recognition algorithms to answer clinical closed queries and quantify lesion burden. As a proof of concept, we simulate multiple sclerosis lesions in silico within brain phantoms and deploy two extremely fast protocols (approximately 3 s), with and without spatial information. A 1D convolutional neural network achieves AUC close to 0.95 for lesion detection and R2 close to 0.99 for volume estimation. We also perform robustness tests under reduced signal-to-noise ratio, partial signal omission, and relaxation-time variability. By reframing MR signals as direct diagnostic metrics, IMRD paves the way for fast, low-cost MR screening and monitoring in resource-limited environments.</description>

      <title>Fourier-based Inversion of Partial X-ray Transforms in n Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two theorems describing analytic left-inverses of partial X-ray transforms. The first theorem concerns X-ray data collected with an arbitrary distribution of parallel projections; it contains a convolution-backprojection formula and a backprojection-convolution formula for recovering the transformed volume, provided the data is sufficient. The second theorem concerns X-ray data collected with a cone-beam; it contains a backprojection-convolution formula for recovering the transformed volume, provided the data is amenable to this method. The cone-beam method is usable for X-ray source point loci that are multidimensional and that adequately surround the reconstruction support; it supports data collected with a flat 2D detector of finite size.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms and safety of air plasma inactivated SARS-CoV-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) displays antimicrobial, antitumor, and antiviral properties, while the underlying mechanism is seldom clearly elucidated. In this work, we employed CAP with air-feeding gas to directly inactivate SARS-CoV-2. The results indicate that the typical SARS-CoV-2 morphological spikes disappeared after plasma treatment and the proteosomes of SRAS-CoV-2 were modified. In addition, we also evaluated the safety of the air plasma device in simulating daily life environments through rat experiments. We evaluated rats' daily physiological behavior, body weight, food consumption, organ histopathology, blood biochemical indicators, and so on. These results demonstrate air plasma device is a safe and effective mean prevents virus transmissions and infections.</description>

      <title>Image space formalism of convolutional neural networks for k-space interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Noise resilience in image reconstructions by scan-specific robust artificial neural networks for k-space interpolation (RAKI) is linked to nonlinear activations in k-space. To gain a deeper understanding of this relationship, an image space formalism of RAKI is introduced for analyzing noise propagation analytically, identifying and characterizing image reconstruction features and to describe the role of nonlinear activations in a human readable manner. Methods: The image space formalism for RAKI inference is employed by expressing nonlinear activations in k-space as element-wise multiplications with activation masks, which transform into convolutions in image space. Jacobians of the de-aliased, coil-combined image relative to the aliased coil images can be expressed algebraically, and thus, the noise amplification is quantified analytically (g-factor maps). We analyze the role of nonlinearity for noise resilience by controlling the degree of nonlinearity in the reconstruction model via the negative slope parameter in leaky ReLU. Results: The analytical g-factor maps correspond with those obtained from Monte Carlo simulations and from an auto differentiation approach for in vivo brain images. Apparent blurring and contrast loss artifacts are identified as implications of enhanced noise resilience. These residual artifacts can be traded against noise resilience by adjusting the degree of nonlinearity in the model (Tikhonov-like regularization) in case of limited training data. The inspection of image space activations reveals an autocorrelation pattern leading to a potential center artifact. Conclusion: The image space formalism of RAKI provides the means for analytical quantitative noisepropagation analysis and human-readable visualization of the effects of the nonlinear activation functions in k-space.</description>
