      <title>Climatological benchmarking of AI-generated tropical cyclones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive climatological benchmarking of tropical cyclones (TCs) generated by AI-based global weather prediction models. Using all TC events from the North Atlantic and Western Pacific basins between 2020 and 2025, we assess the ability of two AI models (Pangu-Weather and Aurora) to reproduce observed TC track density, climatology of storm characteristics, and physical consistency with TC theory. By comparing AI-simulated TCs with ERA5 reanalysis, we benchmark the distributions of intensity, size, forward speed, and evaluate the model's ability to credibly simulate extratropical transition. Results show that both Pangu and Aurora perform well in reproducing storm track density, forward speed distribution, and outer size distribution. Aurora shows an improved performance in simulating storm intensity compared to Pangu, with less bias in the distribution of minimum central pressure and maximum wind speed. However, both models overestimate the distribution of storm inner size (radius of maximum winds), especially for extreme events. AI models capture the relative frequency and temporal evolution of extratropical transition patterns with reasonable accuracy. The AI-simulated TCs are also less likely to conform to gradient wind balance compared to ERA5, indicating that the AI TCs may not be physically realistic in many cases. This benchmarking identifies systematic biases that can guide future corrections and support extended applications of AI models for TC hazard and risk assessment. Our work establishes a foundation for future studies using AI weather models in the context of TC climatological and hazard research.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Review of Phase-Averaged and Phase-Resolving Wave Models for Coastal Modeling Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting ocean wave behavior is challenging due to the difficulty in choosing suitable numerical models among many with varying capabilities. This review examines the development and performance of numerical wave models in coastal engineering and oceanography, focusing on the difference between phase-averaged spectral models and phase-resolving models. We evaluate the formulation, governing equations, and methods of widely used third-generation phase-averaged spectral models (SWAN, WAVEWATCH III, MIKE 21 SW, TOMAWAC, and WAM) alongside advanced phase-resolving models (FUNWAVE, SWASH, COULWAVE, and NHWAVE) that employ Boussinesq-type equations and non-hydrostatic formulations. The review begins with early parameterized models and progresses to contemporary third-generation models, which solve the wave action conservation equation with few spectral constraints. A comparison of the models' efficiency, accuracy in nearshore conditions, ability to resolve nonlinear wave-wave interaction, simulate wave breaking, diffraction, and wave-current interactions is provided. Applications in operational forecasting, extreme event simulation, coastal structure design, and assessing climate change impacts are discussed. The validation of these models and the statistical metrics and intercomparison studies used are addressed. A discussion of the limitations in computational scalability, physics parameterization, and model coupling is provided, along with emerging trends in high-resolution modeling and hybrid models. This review guides researchers in evaluating which models to use in coastal and oceanographic research.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution of satellite-derived SST data via Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the super-resolution problem of satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) using deep generative models. Although standard gap-filling techniques are effective in producing spatially complete datasets, they inherently smooth out fine-scale features that may be critical for a better understanding of the ocean dynamics. We investigate the use of deep learning models as Autoencoders (AEs) and generative models as Conditional-Generative Adversarial Networks (C-GANs), to reconstruct small-scale structures lost during interpolation. Our supervised -- model free -- training is based on SST observations of the Mediterranean Sea, with a focus on learning the conditional distribution of high-resolution fields given their low-resolution counterparts. We apply a tiling and merging strategy to deal with limited observational coverage and to ensure spatial continuity. Quantitative evaluations based on mean squared error metrics, spectral analysis, and gradient statistics show that while the AE reduces reconstruction error, it fails to recover high-frequency variability. In contrast, the C-GAN effectively restores the statistical properties of the true SST field at the cost of increasing the pointwise discrepancy with the ground truth observation. Our results highlight the potential of deep generative models to enhance the physical and statistical realism of gap-filled satellite data in oceanographic applications.</description>

      <title>Technical Report: Towards Unified Diffusion Models for Multi-Model Climate Emulation at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large ensembles of climate projections are essential for characterizing uncertainty in future climate and extreme weather events, yet computational constraints of numerical climate models limit ensemble sizes to a small number of realizations per model. We present a unified conditional diffusion model that dramatically reduces this computational barrier by learning shared distributional patterns across multiple Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 models and emission scenarios. Rather than training separate emulators for each model-scenario combination, our approach captures the common statistical structures underlying nine CMIP6 models, generating daily temperature maps with a global coverage for historical and future periods. This unified framework enables: (i) efficient probabilistic sampling for comprehensive uncertainty quantification across models and scenarios; (ii) rapid generation of large ensembles that would be computationally intractable with traditional climate models; (iii) variance-reduced treatment effect analysis via fixed-seed generation that disentangles forced climate responses from internal variability. Evaluations on held-out models demonstrate reliable generalization to unseen future climates, enabling rapid exploration of different emission pathways.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Probabilistic Data-Driven Weather Modeling with a Stretched-Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic data-driven weather model capable of providing an ensemble of high spatial resolution realizations of 87 variables at arbitrary forecast length and ensemble size. The model uses a stretched grid, dedicating 2.5 km resolution to a region of interest, and 31 km resolution elsewhere. Based on a stochastic encoder-decoder architecture, the model is trained using a loss function based on the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) evaluated point-wise in real and spectral space. The spectral loss components is shown to be necessary to create fields that are spatially coherent. The model is compared to high-resolution operational numerical weather prediction forecasts from the MetCoOp Ensemble Prediction System (MEPS), showing competitive forecasts when evaluated against observations from surface weather stations. The model produced fields that are more spatially coherent than mean squared error based models and CRPS based models without the spectral component in the loss.</description>

      <title>Epistemic and Aleatoric Uncertainty Quantification in Weather and Climate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing and quantifying uncertainty in physical parameterisations is a central challenge in weather and climate modelling, and approaches are often developed separately for different timescales. Here, we introduce a unified framework for analysing uncertainty in parameterisations across weather and climate regimes. Using the Lorenz 1996 system as a testbed for simplified chaotic dynamics, we quantify uncertainties in a subgrid-scale parameterisation using a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN). This allows us to disentangle aleatoric uncertainty, arising from internal variability in the training data, and epistemic uncertainties, arising from poorly constrained parameters during training. At runtime, we sample uncertainties in line with stochastic approaches in weather models and perturbed-parameter methods in climate models. On weather timescales, aleatoric uncertainty dominates, underscoring the value of stochastic parameterisations. On longer, climate timescales and under changing forcings, accounting for both types of uncertainty is necessary for well-calibrated ensembles, with epistemic uncertainty widening the range of explored climate states, and aleatoric uncertainty promoting transitions between them. Constraining parameter uncertainty with short simulations reduces epistemic uncertainty and improves long-term model behaviour under perturbed forcings. This framework links concepts from machine learning with traditional uncertainty quantification in Earth system modelling, offering a pathway toward seamless treatment of uncertainty in weather and climate prediction.</description>

      <title>A retrospective on the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2025 Atlantic hurricane season saw above average activity overall, with extended quiet periods separated by three distinct clusters of activity. The broad-scale conditions were often unfavourable for cyclogenesis and common drivers of activity such as La Nina were not present. However, short-term variability, including periods of weak shear and episodic equatorial wave driving, led to the clusters of activity. When storms were able to overcome the unfavourable conditions, above-average SSTs provided the energy for intensification, leading to the formation of five hurricanes, of which three (Erin, Humberto, and Melissa) reached category five.</description>

      <title>Effect of near-inertial pumping on subduction at an ocean front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactions between near-inertial waves (NIWs) and submesoscale currents in the surface ocean are challenging to deconvolve due to their overlapping temporal and spatial scales. The frequency of NIW is modulated by the relative vorticity, $\zeta$, of submesoscale currents, which varies between positive and negative $\zeta$ of $O(f)$ on spatial scales of 1 -- 10~$km$, particularly across fronts where the horizontal buoyancy gradient, $\nabla_H b$, is intensified. The effective NIW frequency $f_{\small{eff}} = f + \zeta/2$ can therefore also vary by $O(f)$ on these scales, causing the waves to be out of phase. This generates periodic convergence and divergence in the surface layer, particularly at fronts. The resulting vertical motion, known as inertial pumping, is traditionally considered to be reversible. However, the strong vertical shear of the horizontal velocity at fronts, $v_z \sim |\nabla_H b|/f$, implies that not all of the water that is pumped downward will return. We examine the effect of this asymmetry on the vertical transport of tracers with an ambient vertical gradient, analogous to biogeochemical tracers, such as oxygen and dissolved organic carbon. Using numerical simulations of an unstable front forced by NIW, we demonstrate that inertial pumping can lead to net vertical transport of tracers. Spectral analysis of the vertical tracer flux -- given by the covariance between tracer anomaly and vertical velocity -- reveals that the interaction of strong NIW with submesoscale currents enhances the vertical exchange at the front on both the sub-inertial and inertial time scales.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Atmospheric Radiation: From Thunderstorm Ground Enhancements to Terrestrial Gamma-Ray Flashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a unified conceptual and observational framework that reinterprets these radiation bursts as manifestations of the same runaway processes happening at different atmospheric depths (Dual-stage model, DSM). We review recent results from satellite (ASIM), aircraft (ALOFT), balloon (HELEN), and ground-based (SEVAN and KANAZAWA) experiments to demonstrate the advantages of this integrated approach. This study addresses key contradictions in the field, introduces new classification criteria based on physics rather than detector location, and enhances our understanding of particle acceleration in thunderstorms.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the soil and atmospheric stress on carbon sequestration in a Mediterranean pine forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequestration of atmospheric CO$_2$ in a Mediterranean semi-arid Aleppo Pine Forest (Pinus halepensis) close to the border of the semi-arid timberline was characterized and quantified under field conditions. Measurements of organic and inorganic CO$_2$ sequestration with gas exchange and stock counting approaches were made in both rainfed control (approximately 12$\%$ average annual soil moisture) and summer irrigated plots (approximately 24$\%$ annual average soil moisture), providing the opportunity to separate the effects of atmospheric water demand from soil water stress on the atmospheric CO$_2$ sequestration responses. Measurements yield an organic carbon sequestration (OCS) rate of approximately 550 g CO$_2$ m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$, two-thirds in soil and one-third in biomass. In addition, measurements yield an inorganic carbon sequestration (ICS) rate of approximately 216 g CO$_2$ m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$; via calcite (CaCO$_3$) precipitation in the soil due to root exhalation of CO$_2$ (60$\%$) and microbial activity (40$\%$). The drip irrigated plot showed approximately 3 times higher organic CO$_2$ sequestration than the control plot. The organic sequestration is divided equally between the soil and the biomass. For the irrigated plot, the inorganic CO$_2$ was approximately 1.8 times higher than that of the control plot. However, for inorganic CO$_2$ sequestration, the soil moisture would need to be maintained lower than that of the study plot to preclude dissolving precipitated calcite. For many drylands, irrigation could be achieved by using fossil water reserves. These measured values demonstrate the relatively high potential carbon sequestration in Mediterranean drylands forests under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Regional Storm Surge Surrogate Model Training Strategy Under Evolving Landscape and Climate Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coastal communities can be exposed to risk from catastrophic storm-induced coastal hazards, causing major global losses each year. Recent advances in computational power have enabled the integration of machine learning (ML) into coastal hazard modeling, particularly for storm surge prediction. Given the potential variation in future climate and landscape conditions, efficient predictive models that can incorporate multiple future scenarios are needed. Existing studies built a framework for training ML models using storm surge simulation data under different potential future climate and landscape scenarios. However, storm surge simulation data under designed future scenarios require computationally expensive numerical simulations of synthetic storm suites over extensive geospatial grids. As the number of designed scenarios increases, the computational cost associated with both numerical simulation and ML training increases rapidly. This study introduces a cost-effective reduction strategy that incorporates new scenario data while minimizing computational burden. The approach reduces training data across three dimensions: (1) grid points, (2) input features, and (3) storm suite size. Reducing the storm suite size is especially effective in cutting simulation costs. Model performance was evaluated using different ML algorithms, showing consistent effectiveness. When trained on 5,000 of 80,000 grid points, 10 of 12 features, and 40 of 90 storms, the model achieved an R=0.93, comparable to that of models trained on the full dataset, with substantially lower computational expense.</description>

      <title>Crowdsourcing the Frontier: Advancing Hybrid Physics-ML Climate Simulation via a $50,000 Kaggle Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subgrid machine-learning (ML) parameterizations have the potential to introduce a new generation of climate models that incorporate the effects of higher-resolution physics without incurring the prohibitive computational cost associated with more explicit physics-based simulations. However, important issues, ranging from online instability to inconsistent online performance, have limited their operational use for long-term climate projections. To more rapidly drive progress in solving these issues, domain scientists and machine learning researchers opened up the offline aspect of this problem to the broader machine learning and data science community with the release of ClimSim, a NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks publication, and an associated Kaggle competition. This paper reports on the downstream results of the Kaggle competition by coupling emulators inspired by the winning teams' architectures to an interactive climate model (including full cloud microphysics, a regime historically prone to online instability) and systematically evaluating their online performance. Our results demonstrate that online stability in the low-resolution, real-geography setting is reproducible across multiple diverse architectures, which we consider a key milestone. All tested architectures exhibit strikingly similar offline and online biases, though their responses to architecture-agnostic design choices (e.g., expanding the list of input variables) can differ significantly. Multiple Kaggle-inspired architectures achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on certain metrics such as zonal mean bias patterns and global RMSE, indicating that crowdsourcing the essence of the offline problem is one path to improving online performance in hybrid physics-AI climate simulation.</description>

      <title>Oya: Deep Learning for Accurate Global Precipitation Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate precipitation estimation is critical for hydrological applications, especially in the Global South where ground-based observation networks are sparse and forecasting skill is limited. Existing satellite-based precipitation products often rely on the longwave infrared channel alone or are calibrated with data that can introduce significant errors, particularly at sub-daily timescales. This study introduces Oya, a novel real-time precipitation retrieval algorithm utilizing the full spectrum of visible and infrared (VIS-IR) observations from geostationary (GEO) satellites. Oya employs a two-stage deep learning approach, combining two U-Net models: one for precipitation detection and another for quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), to address the inherent data imbalance between rain and no-rain events. The models are trained using high-resolution GPM Combined Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) v07 data as ground truth and pre-trained on IMERG-Final retrievals to enhance robustness and mitigate overfitting due to the limited temporal sampling of CORRA. By leveraging multiple GEO satellites, Oya achieves quasi-global coverage and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing competitive regional and global precipitation baselines, offering a promising pathway to improved precipitation monitoring and forecasting.</description>
