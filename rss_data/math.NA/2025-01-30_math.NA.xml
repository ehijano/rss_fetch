      <title>Moment-based adaptive time integration for thermal radiation transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a framework for moment-based adaptive time integration of deterministic multifrequency thermal radiation transpot (TRT). We generalize our recent semi-implicit-explicit (IMEX) integration framework for gray TRT to multifrequency TRT, and also introduce a semi-implicit variation that facilitates higher-order integration of TRT, where each stage is implicit in all components except opacities. To appeal to the broad literature on adaptivity with Runge--Kutta methods, we derive new embedded methods for four asymptotic preserving IMEX Runge--Kutta schemes we have found to be robust in our previous work on TRT and radiation hydrodynamics. We then use a moment-based high-order-low-order representation of the transport equations. Due to the high dimensionality, memory is always a concern in simulating TRT. We form error estimates and adaptivity in time purely based on temperature and radiation energy, for a trivial overhead in computational cost and memory usage compared with the base second order integrators. We then test the adaptivity in time on the tophat and Larsen problem, demonstrating the ability of the adaptive algorithm to naturally vary the timestep across 4--5 orders of magnitude, ranging from the dynamical timescales of the streaming regime to the thick diffusion limit.</description>

      <title>Fractional coupled Halanay inequality and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a generalized fractional Halanay-type coupled inequality, which serves as a robust tool for characterizing the asymptotic stability of diverse time fractional functional differential equations, particularly those exhibiting Mittag-Leffler type stability. Our main tool is a sub-additive property of Mittag-Leffler function and its optimal asymptotic decay rate estimation. Our results further optimize and improve some existing results in the literature. We illustrate two significant applications of this fractional Halanay-type inequality. Firstly, by combining our results in this work with the positive representation method positive representation of delay differential systems, we establish an asymptotic stability criterion for a category of linear fractional coupled systems with bounded delays. This criterion extends beyond the traditional boundaries of positive system theory, offering a new perspective on stability analysis in this domain. Secondly, through energy estimation, we establish the contractility and dissipativity of a class of time fractional neutral functional differential equations. Our analysis reveals the typical long-term polynomial decay behavior inherent in time fractional evolutionary equations, thereby providing a solid theoretical foundation for subsequent numerical investigations.</description>

      <title>Unfitted finite element interpolated neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach that integrates unfitted finite element methods and neural networks to approximate partial differential equations on complex geometries. Easy-to-generate background meshes (e.g., a simple Cartesian mesh) that cut the domain boundary (i.e., they do not conform to it) are used to build suitable trial and test finite element spaces. The method seeks a neural network that, when interpolated onto the trial space, minimises a discrete dual norm (defined over the test space) of the weak residual functional associated to the equation. As with unfitted finite elements, essential boundary conditions are weakly imposed by Nitsche's method. The method is robust to variations in Nitsche coefficient values, and to small cut cells. We experimentally demonstrate the method's effectiveness in solving both forward and inverse problems across various 2D and 3D complex geometries, including those defined by implicit level-set functions and explicit stereolithography meshes. For forward problems with smooth analytical solutions, the trained neural networks achieve several orders of magnitude smaller $H^1$ errors compared to their interpolation counterparts. These interpolations also maintain expected $h$- and $p$-convergence rates. Moreover, using preconditioners (achieved by stabilisations) remarkably accelerates neural network training and further enhances robustness to the choice of Nitsche coefficient values. The experiments also show the method's high accuracy and reliability in solving inverse problems, even with incomplete observations.</description>

      <title>Approximate Taylor methods for ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method for the numerical solution of ODEs is presented. This approach is based on an approximate formulation of the Taylor methods that has a much easier implementation than the original Taylor methods, since only the functions in the ODEs, and not their derivatives, are needed, just as in classical Runge-Kutta schemes. Compared to Runge-Kutta methods, the number of function evaluations to achieve a given order is higher, however with the present procedure it is much easier to produce arbitrary high-order schemes, which may be important in some applications. In many cases the new approach leads to an asymptotically lower computational cost when compared to the Taylor expansion based on exact derivatives. The numerical results that are obtained with our proposal are satisfactory and show that this approximate approach can attain results as good as the exact Taylor procedure with less implementation and computational effort.</description>

      <title>High Order Extrapolation Techniques for WENO Finite-Difference Schemes Applied to NACA Airfoil Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-difference WENO schemes are capable of approximating accurately and efficiently weak solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws. In this context high order numerical boundary conditions have been proven to increase significantly the resolution of the numerical solutions. In this paper a finite-difference WENO scheme is combined with a high order boundary extrapolation technique at ghost cells to solve problems involving NACA airfoil profiles. The results obtained are comparable with those obtained through other techniques involving unstructured meshes.</description>

      <title>H2-MG: A multigrid method for hierarchical rank structured matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new fast iterative solver for large systems involving kernel matrices. Advantageous aspects of H2 matrix approximations and the multigrid method are hybridized to create the H2-MG algorithm. This combination provides the time and memory efficiency of H2 operator representation along with the rapid convergence of a multilevel method. We describe how H2MG works, show its linear complexity, and demonstrate its effectiveness on two standard kernels. The current zoo of H2 solvers, which includes a wide variety of iterative and direct solvers, so far lacks a method that exploits multiple levels of resolution, commonly referred to in the iterative methods literature as ``multigrid'' from its origins in a hierarchy of grids used to discretize differential equations. This makes H2-MG a valuable addition to the collection of H2 solvers. The algorithm has potential for advancing various fields that require the solution of large, dense, symmetric positive definite matrices.</description>

      <title>An efficient algorithm for the minimal least squares solution of linear system with indefinite symmetric matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a new algorithm for solving symmetric indefinite systems of linear equations is presented. It factorizes the matrix into the form LDLt using Jacobi rotations in order to increase the pivot's absolute value. Furthermore, Rook's pivoting strategy is also adapted and implemented. In determinate compatible systems, the computational cost of the algorithm was similar to the cost of the Bunch-Kaufman method, but the error was approximately 50 % smaller for intermediate and large matrices, regardless of the condition number of the coefficient matrix. Furthermore, unlike Bunch-Kaufman, the new algorithm calculates with little additional cost the fundamental basis of the null space, and obtains the minimal least squares and minimum norm solutions. In minimal least squares with minimum norm problems, the new algorithm was compared with the LAPACK Complete Orthogonal Decomposition algorithm, among others. The obtained error with both algorithms was similar but the computational cost was at least 20 % smaller with the new algorithm, even though the Complete Orthogonal Decomposition is implemented in a blocked form.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the navigation of magnetic microrobots through cerebral bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local administration of thrombolytics in ischemic stroke could accelerate clot lysis and the ensuing reperfusion while minimizing the side effects of systemic administration. Medical microrobots could be injected into the bloodstream and magnetically navigated to the clot for administering the drugs directly to the target. The magnetic manipulation required to navigate medical microrobots will depend on various parameters such as the microrobots size, the blood velocity, and the imposed magnetic field gradients. Numerical simulation was used to study the motion of magnetically controlled microrobots flowing through representative cerebral bifurcations, for predicting the magnetic gradients required to navigate the microrobots from the injection point until the target location. Upon thorough validation of the model against several independent analytical and experimental results, the model was used to generate maps and a predictive equation providing quantitative information on the required magnetic gradients, for different scenarios. The developed maps and predictive equation are crucial to inform the design, operation and optimization of magnetic navigation systems for healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Enriched Immersed Finite Element and Isogeometric Analysis -- Algorithms and Data Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Immersed finite element methods provide a convenient analysis framework for problems involving geometrically complex domains, such as those found in topology optimization and microstructures for engineered materials. However, their implementation remains a major challenge due to, among other things, the need to apply nontrivial stabilization schemes and generate custom quadrature rules. This article introduces the robust and computationally efficient algorithms and data structures comprising an immersed finite element preprocessing framework. The input to the preprocessor consists of a background mesh and one or more geometries defined on its domain. The output is structured into groups of elements with custom quadrature rules formatted such that common finite element assembly routines may be used without or with only minimal modifications. The key to the preprocessing framework is the construction of material topology information, concurrently with the generation of a quadrature rule, which is then used to perform enrichment and generate stabilization rules. While the algorithmic framework applies to a wide range of immersed finite element methods using different types of meshes, integration, and stabilization schemes, the preprocessor is presented within the context of the extended isogeometric analysis. This method utilizes a structured B-spline mesh, a generalized Heaviside enrichment strategy considering the material layout within individual basis functions$'$ supports, and face-oriented ghost stabilization. Using a set of examples, the effectiveness of the enrichment and stabilization strategies is demonstrated alongside the preprocessor$'$s robustness in geometric edge cases. Additionally, the performance and parallel scalability of the implementation are evaluated.</description>

      <title>Quantitative convergence of a discretization of dynamic optimal transport using the dual formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a discretization of the dynamic optimal transport problem for which we can obtain the convergence rate for the value of the transport cost to its continuous value when the temporal and spatial stepsize vanish. This convergence result does not require any regularity assumption on the measures, though experiments suggest that the rate is not sharp. Via an analysis of the duality gap we also obtain the convergence rates for the gradient of the optimal potentials and the velocity field under mild regularity assumptions. To obtain such rates, we discretize the dual formulation of the dynamic optimal transport problem and use the mature literature related to the error due to discretizing the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.</description>

      <title>Projected Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms in non-convex and super-linear setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17077v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is of significant interest in many applications to sample from a high-dimensional target distribution $\pi$ with the density $\pi(\text{d} x) \propto e^{-U(x)} (\text{d} x) $, based on the temporal discretization of the Langevin stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In this paper, we propose an explicit projected Langevin Monte Carlo (PLMC) algorithm with non-convex potential $U$ and super-linear gradient of $U$ and investigate the non-asymptotic analysis of its sampling error in total variation distance. Equipped with time-independent regularity estimates for the associated Kolmogorov equation, we derive the non-asymptotic bounds on the total variation distance between the target distribution of the Langevin SDEs and the law induced by the PLMC scheme with order $\mathcal{O}(d^{\max\{3\gamma/2 , 2\gamma-1 \}} h |\ln h|)$, where $d$ is the dimension of the target distribution and $\gamma \geq 1$ characterizes the growth of the gradient of $U$. In addition, if the gradient of $U$ is globally Lipschitz continuous, an improved convergence order of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2} h)$ for the classical Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) scheme is derived with a refinement of the proof based on Malliavin calculus techniques. To achieve a given precision $\epsilon$, the smallest number of iterations of the PLMC algorithm is proved to be of order ${\mathcal{O}}\big(\tfrac{d^{\max\{3\gamma/2 , 2\gamma-1 \}}}{\epsilon} \ \cdot \ln (\tfrac{d}{\epsilon}) \cdot \ln (\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}) \big)$. In particular, the classical Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) scheme with the non-convex potential $U$ and the globally Lipschitz gradient of $U$ can be guaranteed by order ${\mathcal{O}}\big(\tfrac{d^{3/2}}{\epsilon} \cdot \ln (\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}) \big)$. Numerical experiments are provided to confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Finite Element Interpolated Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of neural networks to approximate partial differential equations (PDEs) has gained significant attention in recent years. However, the approximation of PDEs with localised phenomena, e.g., sharp gradients and singularities, remains a challenge, due to ill-defined cost functions in terms of pointwise residual sampling or poor numerical integration. In this work, we introduce $h$-adaptive finite element interpolated neural networks. The method relies on the interpolation of a neural network onto a finite element space that is gradually adapted to the solution during the training process to equidistribute a posteriori error indicator. The use of adaptive interpolation is essential in preserving the non-linear approximation capabilities of the neural networks to effectively tackle problems with localised features. The training relies on a gradient-based optimisation of a loss function based on the (dual) norm of the finite element residual of the interpolated neural network. Automatic mesh adaptation (i.e., refinement and coarsening) is performed based on a posteriori error indicators till a certain level of accuracy is reached. The proposed methodology can be applied to indefinite and nonsymmetric problems. We carry out a detailed numerical analysis of the scheme and prove several a priori error estimates, depending on the expressiveness of the neural network compared to the interpolation mesh. Our numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the method in capturing sharp gradients and singularities for forward and inverse PDE problems, both in 2D and 3D scenarios. We also show that the proposed preconditioning strategy (i.e., using a dual residual norm of the residual as a cost function) enhances training robustness and accelerates convergence.</description>

      <title>Anderson-Picard based nonlinear preconditioning of the Newton iteration for non-isothermal flow simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose, analyze, and test a nonlinear preconditioning technique to improve the Newton iteration for non-isothermal flow simulations. We prove that by first applying an Anderson accelerated Picard step, Newton becomes unconditionally stable (under a uniqueness condition on the data) and its quadratic convergence is retained but has less restrictive sufficient conditions on the Rayleigh number and initial condition's accuracy. Since the Anderson-Picard step decouples the equations in the system, this nonlinear preconditioning adds relatively little extra cost to the Newton iteration (which does not decouple the equations). Our numerical tests illustrate this quadratic convergence and stability on multiple benchmark problems. Furthermore, the tests show convergence for significantly higher Rayleigh number than both Picard and Newton, which illustrates the larger convergence basin of Anderson-Picard based nonlinear preconditioned Newton that the theory predicts.</description>

      <title>Approximation of High-Dimensional Gibbs Distributions with Functional Hierarchical Tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The numerical representation of high-dimensional Gibbs distributions is challenging due to the curse of dimensionality manifesting through the intractable normalization constant calculations. This work addresses this challenge by performing a particle-based high-dimensional parametric density estimation subroutine, and the input to the subroutine is Gibbs samples generated by leveraging advanced sampling techniques. Specifically, to generate Gibbs samples, we employ ensemble-based annealed importance sampling, a population-based approach for sampling multimodal distributions. These samples are then processed using functional hierarchical tensor sketching, a tensor-network-based density estimation method for high-dimensional distributions, to obtain the numerical representation of the Gibbs distribution. We successfully apply the proposed approach to complex Ginzburg-Landau models with hundreds of variables. In particular, we show that the approach proposed is successful at addressing the metastability issue under difficult numerical cases.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Low-Order Discontinuous Galerkin Methods with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Compressible Navier--Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18897</link>

Abstract: Computational advances have fundamentally transformed the landscape of numerical simulations, enabling unprecedented levels of complexity and precision in modeling physical phenomena. While these high-fidelity simulations offer invaluable insights for scientific discovery and problem solving, they impose substantial computational requirements. Consequently, low-fidelity models augmented with subgrid-scale parameterizations are employed to achieve computational feasibility. We introduce an end-to-end differentiable framework for solving the compressible Navier--Stokes equations. This integrated approach combines a differentiable discontinuous Galerkin (DG) solver with a neural network source term. Through the implementation of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) for network parameter optimization, our methodology ensures continuous interaction with the governing equations throughout the training process. We refer to this approach as NODE-DG. This hybrid approach combines the accuracy of numerical methods with the efficiency of machine learning, offering the following key advantages: (1) enhanced accuracy of low-order DG approximations by capturing subgrid-scale dynamics; (2) robustness to nonuniform and missing temporal data; (3) elimination of operator-splitting errors; and (4) a continuous-in-time operator enabling predictions with variable time step sizes, which accelerates projected high-order DG simulations. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework through two examples: two-dimensional Kelvin--Helmholtz instability and three-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex examples.</description>

      <title>Mesh-Informed Reduced Order Models for Aneurysm Rupture Risk Prediction</title>

Abstract: The complexity of the cardiovascular system needs to be accurately reproduced in order to promptly acknowledge health conditions; to this aim, advanced multifidelity and multiphysics numerical models are crucial. On one side, Full Order Models (FOMs) deliver accurate hemodynamic assessments, but their high computational demands hinder their real-time clinical application. In contrast, ROMs provide more efficient yet accurate solutions, essential for personalized healthcare and timely clinical decision-making. In this work, we explore the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in cardiovascular medicine by integrating FOMs with ROMs for predicting the risk of aortic aneurysm growth and rupture. Wall Shear Stress (WSS) and the Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), sampled at different growth stages of the thoracic aortic aneurysm, are predicted by means of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs exploit the natural graph structure of the mesh obtained by the Finite Volume (FV) discretization, taking into account the spatial local information, regardless of the dimension of the input graph. Our experimental validation framework yields promising results, confirming our method as a valid alternative that overcomes the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Gradient-free training of recurrent neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks are a successful neural architecture for many time-dependent problems, including time series analysis, forecasting, and modeling of dynamical systems. Training such networks with backpropagation through time is a notoriously difficult problem because their loss gradients tend to explode or vanish. In this contribution, we introduce a computational approach to construct all weights and biases of a recurrent neural network without using gradient-based methods. The approach is based on a combination of random feature networks and Koopman operator theory for dynamical systems. The hidden parameters of a single recurrent block are sampled at random, while the outer weights are constructed using extended dynamic mode decomposition. This approach alleviates all problems with backpropagation commonly related to recurrent networks. The connection to Koopman operator theory also allows us to start using results in this area to analyze recurrent neural networks. In computational experiments on time series, forecasting for chaotic dynamical systems, and control problems, as well as on weather data, we observe that the training time and forecasting accuracy of the recurrent neural networks we construct are improved when compared to commonly used gradient-based methods.</description>

      <title>Stroke classification using Virtual Hybrid Edge Detection from in silico electrical impedance tomography data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive imaging method for recovering the internal conductivity of a physical body from electric boundary measurements. EIT combined with machine learning has shown promise for the classification of strokes. However, most previous works have used raw EIT voltage data as network inputs. We build upon a recent development which suggested the use of special noise-robust Virtual Hybrid Edge Detection (VHED) functions as network inputs, although that work used only highly simplified and mathematically ideal models. In this work we strengthen the case for the use of EIT, and VHED functions especially, for stroke classification. We design models with high detail and mathematical realism to test the use of VHED functions as inputs. Virtual patients are created using a physically detailed 2D head model which includes features known to create challenges in real-world imaging scenarios. Conductivity values are drawn from statistically realistic distributions, and phantoms are afflicted with either hemorrhagic or ischemic strokes of various shapes and sizes. Simulated noisy EIT electrode data, generated using the realistic Complete Electrode Model (CEM) as opposed to the mathematically ideal continuum model, is processed to obtain VHED functions. We compare the use of VHED functions as inputs against the alternative paradigm of using raw EIT voltages. Our results show that (i) stroke classification can be performed with high accuracy using 2D EIT data from physically detailed and mathematically realistic models, and (ii) in the presence of noise, VHED functions outperform raw data as network inputs.</description>

      <title>Convergence of two-timescale gradient descent ascent dynamics: finite-dimensional and mean-field perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-timescale gradient descent-ascent (GDA) is a canonical gradient algorithm designed to find Nash equilibria in min-max games. We analyze the two-timescale GDA by investigating the effects of learning rate ratios on convergence behavior in both finite-dimensional and mean-field settings. In particular, for finite-dimensional quadratic min-max games, we obtain long-time convergence in near quasi-static regimes through the hypocoercivity method. For mean-field GDA dynamics, we investigate convergence under a finite-scale ratio using a mixed synchronous-reflection coupling technique.</description>
