      <title>Entropy-production fluctuation theorem for a generalized Langevin particle in crossed electric and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fluctuations of entropy production for a charged Brownian particle confined in a harmonic trap and driven out of equilibrium by crossed electric and magnetic fields. The magnetic field is constant and perpendicular to the plane of motion, while the electric field is time dependent and provides the driving. The non-Markovian dynamics is modeled by a generalized Langevin equation with memory and Gaussian noise. Using the exact solution of this linear dynamics, we obtain the time-dependent Gaussian phase-space probability density and from it compute the trajectory-dependent total entropy production. For two solvable driving protocols, we prove analytically that the entropy production obeys a detailed fluctuation theorem.</description>

      <title>Complete Decomposition of Anomalous Diffusion in Variable Speed Generalized L\'evy Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variable Speed Generalized L\'{e}vy Walks (VGLWs) are a class of spatio-temporally coupled stochastic processes that unify a broad range of previously studied models within a single parametrized framework. Their dynamics consist of discrete random steps, or flights, during which the walker's speed varies deterministically with both the elapsed time and the total duration of the flight. We investigate the anomalous diffusive behavior of VGLWs and analyze it through decomposition into the three fundamental constitutive effects that capture violations of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT): the Joseph effect, reflecting long-range increment correlations, the Noah effect, arising from heavy-tailed step-size distributions with infinite variance, and the Moses effect, associated with statistical aging and non-stationarity. Our results show that anomalous diffusion in VGLWs is typically generated by a nontrivial combination of all three effects, rather than being attributable to a single mechanism. Strikingly, we find that within the VGLW framework the Noah exponent $L$, which quantifies the strength of the Noah effect, is unbounded from above, revealing a richer and more extreme landscape of anomalous diffusion than in previously studied L\'{e}vy-walk-type models.</description>

      <title>Correlation between the first-reaction time and the acquired boundary local time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the statistical correlation between the first-reaction time of a diffusing particle and its boundary local time accumulated until the reaction event. Since the reaction event occurs after multiple encounters of the particle with a partially reactive boundary, the boundary local time as a proxy for the number of such encounters is not independent of, but intrinsically linked to, the first-reaction time. We propose a universal theoretical framework to derive their joint probability density and, in particular, the correlation coefficient. To illustrate the dependence of these correlations on the boundary reactivity and shape, we obtain explicit analytical solutions for several basic domains. The analytical results are complemented by Monte Carlo simulations, which we employ to examine the role of interior obstacles on correlations in disordered media. Applications of these statistical results in chemical physics are discussed</description>

      <title>Efficient Monte-Carlo sampling of metastable systems using non-local collective variable updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte-Carlo simulations are widely used to simulate complex molecular systems, but standard approaches suffer from metastability. Lately, the use of non-local proposal updates in a collective-variable (CV) space has been proposed in several works. Here, we generalize these approaches and explicitly spell out an algorithm for non-linear CVs and underdamped Langevin dynamics. We prove reversibility of the resulting scheme and demonstrate its performance on several numerical examples, observing a substantial performance increase compared to methods based on overdamped Langevin dynamics as considered previously. Advances in generative machine-learning-based proposal samplers now enable efficient sampling in CV spaces of intermediate dimensionality (tens to hundreds of variables), and our results extend their applicability toward more realistic molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Random planting with harvest: A statistical-mechanical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a statistical-mechanical description of a recently introduced random planting model in which plants are represented by growing hard disks. Seedlings of negligible size are introduced at random positions in a field, grow at a prescribed rate, and are harvested upon reaching a fixed maturity diameter. Planting attempts that would lead to an overlap at any time during growth are rejected. Starting from an empty field, this simple dynamical rule drives the system to a nonequilibrium steady state in which the mean planting and harvesting rates coincide. We show that the steady state can be mapped onto a nonadditive polydisperse hard-disk fluid and exploit this mapping to develop analytical predictions based on a low-density virial expansion and on scaled particle theory. The resulting description yields an effective adsorption isotherm for the steady-state plant density as a function of the planting rate and compares favorably with numerical simulations over a wide range of parameters. At large planting rates, the density approaches the optimal value achieved by desynchronized regular planting, and the data are consistent with an algebraic approach to this limit with an exponent close to 1/3. Beyond density and yield, we show that the spatial organization of the field at high planting rates exhibits clear signatures of the same underlying geometric constraints that characterize optimal desynchronized planting. This connection is revealed through both the conventional radial distribution function and a radius-resolved pair correlation g(z,r) which highlights strong size correlations associated with parent-child seeding events and whose structure can be interpreted as a dynamically broadened precursor of the corresponding ideal mixe--size lattice. Finally, we extend the theory to sigmoidal growth laws and compute the associated virial coefficient.</description>

      <title>Solvable Quantum Circuits from Spacetime Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years dual-unitary circuits and their multi-unitary generalizations have emerged as exactly solvable yet chaotic models of quantum many-body dynamics. However, a systematic picture for the solvability of multi-unitary dynamics remains missing. We present a framework encompassing a large class of such non-integrable models with exactly solvable dynamics, which we term \emph{completely reducible} circuits. In these circuits, the entanglement membrane determining operator growth and entanglement dynamics can be characterized analytically. Completely reducible circuits extend the notion of space-time symmetry to more general lattice geometries, breaking dual-unitarity globally but not locally, and allow for a rich phenomenology going beyond dual-unitarity. As example, we introduce circuits that support four and five directions of information flow. We derive a general expression for the entanglement line tension in terms of the pattern of information flow in spacetime. The solvability is shown to be related to the absence of knots of this information flow, connecting entanglement dynamics to the Kauffman bracket as knot invariant. Building on these results, we propose that in general non-integrable dynamics the curvature of the entanglement line tension can be interpreted as a density of information transport. Our results provide a new and unified framework for exactly solvable models of many-body quantum chaos, encompassing and extending known constructions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the statistical properties of orthogonal, or real, Clifford circuits doped with magic and imaginary resources. By developing the Weingarten calculus for the real Clifford group, we derive the exact overlap distribution of real stabilizer states, identifying a new universality class: the orthogonal Clifford Porter-Thomas distribution. We prove that local real architectures recover this global statistic in logarithmic depth. Furthermore, we uncover a sharp hierarchy in resource requirements: while retrieving Haar statistics necessitates a polylogarithmic amount of magic states, recovering the full unitary Clifford statistics requires only a single phase gate.</description>

      <title>Universal and Maximal Entanglement Swapping in General Fermionic Gaussian States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring universal entanglement structure in many-body systems is both fundamental and challenging, particularly when the system undergoes non-unitary operations. In this work, we uncover a universal mechanism for realizing maximal entanglement swapping in fermionic Gaussian states subjected to projective Bell measurements. We consider two initially decoupled, half-filled copies of a free-fermion system in arbitrary dimensions and perform post-selective Bell measurements on half of the corresponding sites across the two copies. Remarkably, the post-measurement state factorizes into a product of Bell pairs, establishing maximal interlayer entanglement entirely independent of the initial Gaussian state. We derive this post-measurement state exactly for general particle-number-conserving fermionic Gaussian states, establishing both the validity and universality of the mechanism, with numerical simulations serving as consistency checks. This phenomenon arises from a robust interplay between fermionic statistics and Gaussianity, revealing a distinct fermionic route to measurement-induced maximal entanglement.</description>

      <title>Higher-form entanglement asymmetry. Part I. The limits of symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a relative entropy that faithfully diagnoses symmetry breaking in quantum states, possibly within a spatial subregion. In this work, we extend such framework to higher-form symmetries and compute entanglement asymmetry in theories with spontaneously-broken continuous zero- and higher-form symmetries. One of our central results is an entropic Coleman--Mermin--Wagner theorem, for $0$- and $p$-form symmetries, valid also on subregions, which forbids spontaneous breaking of continuous $p$-form symmetries in spacetime dimensions $d\leq p+2$. Our theorem not only qualifies symmetry breaking, it also quantifies it: spontaneous breaking triggers a nonvanishing entanglement asymmetry that grows monotonically towards the infrared, and counts the number of Goldstone fields. Along the way, we derive standalone results concerning the entanglement entropy of Goldstone bosons and gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Unleash $Q$! Cohomology, Localization, and Interpolation in Parisi-Sourlas Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parisi--Sourlas supersymmetric models are known to undergo dimensional reduction; that is, their physics is captured by models in two fewer dimensions. In this work, we revisit dimensional reduction, providing new arguments and reformulating existing proofs in terms of the cohomology of a supercharge $Q$. We obtain three main results. First, we show that the recently developed picture of dimensional reduction via decoupling of operators admits a natural explanation in terms of $Q$-exactness. Second, we provide a new proof of dimensional reduction using the supersymmetric localization argument. Third, we revisit Cardy's ``interpolation'' proof -- which is reminiscent of localization but does not rely on saddle-point methods -- and show that it can be understood as a consequence of deforming the action by a $Q$-exact term. Finally, we show that while existing nonperturbative proofs of dimensional reduction apply only to scalar Lagrangians, our formulation of Cardy's argument extends to any theory with Parisi--Sourlas supersymmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal defects -- extended objects in conformal field theories -- carry localised excitations inherited from symmetry currents, known as the displacements and tilts. They capture the linear response of the defect to deformations of its shape or of its profile along internal symmetry directions. There is no universal formula for deformations beyond the linear order and this is subject to ambiguities of coordinate choices on coset spaces and scheme dependence in the quantum theory. We analyse the exact match between the two and identify the scheme independent quantities capturing nonlinearly realised symmetries. This leads to universal integral identities for correlation functions in the presence of tilts and displacements. We present several applications of them. We also study possible anomalies, recovering known ones, finding new expressions for them, and uncovering new ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems provide universal constraints on nonequilibrium energy and entropy fluctuations, making them a natural framework to assess how and to what extent quantum resources become thermodynamically relevant. We develop a unified framework for incorporating a generic quantum resource, including athermality, quantum coherence, and entanglement, into fluctuation theorems. We work within the end point measurement scheme, which avoids an initial energy measurement and allows quantum resources in the initial state to affect nonequilibrium energy statistics. We derive a family of quantum fluctuation theorems, including generalized Jarzynski equalities and Crooks type fluctuation relations, in which corrections decompose into resource resolved contributions. For single systems, we introduce the concept of weight of athermality, and combine it with the weight of coherence to isolate distinct thermodynamic effects of these quantum resources. For bipartite systems, we furthermore obtain two families of entanglement-resolved fluctuation theorems using an appended correlation operator and the best separable approximation, respectively. Finally, we introduce the concepts of coherence and entanglement fluctuation distances, as Kullback Leibler divergences, which quantify the thermodynamic relevance of quantum resources in a process-dependent and operational manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the atomic-scale mechanisms governing metal-mediated nucleation and growth of gallium nitride (GaN) and related alloys is critical for tailoring their structural and functional properties in advanced electronic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices. Using real-time environmental transmission electron microscopy (E-TEM) in conjunction with Gibbs free energy calculations, we elucidate the distinct processes of GaN nucleation and growth from Ga droplet arrays with and without GaN pre-nuclei. For the lowest temperatures, although GaN nucleation at Ga droplet arrays is not observed, GaN growth occurs preferentially at pre-existing GaN nuclei, presumably due to the reduced Gibbs free energy for NH3 decomposition at Ga/GaN interfaces. For intermediate to high temperatures, E-TEM reveals nucleation and growth of GaN from Ga droplets with and without GaN nuclei, with enhanced crystallinity for the GaN nuclei, due to epitaxial templating. These results highlight the critical role of the Ga/GaN interface in facilitating NH3 decomposition and GaN growth, offering fundamental insights into metal-mediated nucleation and growth of GaN and related materials.</description>

      <title>Emergence of higher-order interactions in systems of coupled Kuramoto oscillators with time delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms that govern collective synchronization is a paramount task in nonlinear dynamics. While higher-order (many-body) interactions have recently emerged as a powerful framework for capturing collective behaviors, real-world examples regarding dynamics remain scarce. Here, we show that higher-order interactions naturally emerge from time-delayed pairwise coupling in Kuramoto oscillators. By expanding the delay term up to second order in the coupling strength, we derive an effective Kuramoto model featuring both two-body and three-body interactions, but without delay, hence, easier to be analyzed. Numerical simulations show that this reduced model can reproduce the bistability and synchronization transitions of the original time-delayed system. Furthermore, applying the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, we obtain a stability diagram for incoherent and synchronized states that closely matches the results of the original model. Our findings reveal that time delays can be effectively recast in the form of higher-order interactions, offering a new perspective on how delayed interactions shape the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Timelike Entanglement Entropy and Renormalization Group Flow Irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study holographic c-theorems based on timelike entanglement entropy and show that a timelike c-function captures irreversible renormalization group (RG) flow. We demonstrate that timelike c-functions are applicable to both relativistic and non-relativistic quantum matter in nematic phases with broken rotational symmetry, and that they remain monotonic even under anisotropic RG flows, thereby passing some of the most stringent consistency tests. Across all classes of theories examined, we find that the null energy condition, thermodynamic stability, and a constraint on an effective spatial dimensionality are jointly sufficient to guarantee monotonicity of the timelike c-function along the RG flow. Moreover, we identify a geometric upper bound on the rate of change of the timelike c-function, which constrains how rapidly effective degrees of freedom can be coarse-grained along the RG flow whenever a timelike c-theorem applies. The applicability of holographic c-theorems is thus extended to highly nontrivial RG flows and points toward a new information-theoretic diagnostic of holographic RG dynamics.</description>

      <title>Replica Keldysh field theory of quantum-jump processes: General formalism and application to imbalanced and inefficient fermion counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions have largely been explored for projective or continuous measurements of Hermitian observables, assuming perfect detection without information loss. Yet such transitions also arise in more general settings, including quantum-jump processes with non-Hermitian jump operators, and under inefficient detection. A theoretical framework for treating these broader scenarios has been missing. Here we develop a comprehensive replica Keldysh field theory for general quantum-jump processes in both bosonic and fermionic systems. Our formalism provides a unified description of pure-state quantum trajectories under efficient detection and mixed-state dynamics emerging from inefficient monitoring, with deterministic Lindbladian evolution appearing as a limiting case. It thus establishes a direct connection between phase transitions in nonequilibrium steady states of driven open quantum matter and in measurement-induced dynamics. As an application, we study imbalanced and inefficient fermion counting in a one-dimensional lattice system: monitored gain and loss of fermions occurring at different rates, with a fraction of gain and loss jumps undetected. For imbalanced but efficient counting, we recover the qualitative picture of the balanced case: entanglement obeys an area law for any nonzero jump rate, with an extended quantum-critical regime emerging between two parametrically separated length scales. Inefficient detection introduces a finite correlation length beyond which entanglement, as quantified by the fermionic logarithmic negativity, obeys an area law, while the subsystem entropy shows volume-law scaling. Numerical simulations support our analytical findings. Our results offer a general and versatile theoretical foundation for studying measurement-induced phenomena across a wide class of monitored and open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Critical coupling in $\phi_2^4$ theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $\phi^4$ theory with $\phi(x)\in\mathbb{R}$ in two Euclidean dimensions. We determine for a variety of self-couplings $\hat{\lambda}$ the (negative) critical bare mass $\hat{\mu}_{0\mathrm{c}}^2(\hat{\lambda})$ where the lattice-regularized system changes from the symmetric to the broken phase. Based on these data, the transition to infinite volume and a universal scheme with the renormalized parameter $\hat{\mu}_\mathrm{c}^2(\hat{\lambda})$ is made. Finally, $f_\mathrm{c}=\lim_{\hat{\lambda}\to0}\hat{\lambda}/\hat{\mu}_\mathrm{c}^2(\hat{\lambda})$ is determined, with a judicious choice of the parameterizations considered. Our final result reads $f_\mathrm{c}=11.1097(20)_\mathrm{stat}(09)_\mathrm{sys}=11.1097(22)_\mathrm{tot}$.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Stochastic Interpolants for Amorphous Particle Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern generative models hold great promise for accelerating diverse tasks involving the simulation of physical systems, but they must be adapted to the specific constraints of each domain. Significant progress has been made for biomolecules and crystalline materials. Here, we address amorphous materials (glasses), which are disordered particle systems lacking atomic periodicity. Sampling equilibrium configurations of glass-forming materials is a notoriously slow and difficult task. This obstacle could be overcome by developing a generative framework capable of producing equilibrium configurations with well-defined likelihoods. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging an equivariant Riemannian stochastic interpolation framework which combines Riemannian stochastic interpolant and equivariant flow matching. Our method rigorously incorporates periodic boundary conditions and the symmetries of multi-component particle systems, adapting an equivariant graph neural network to operate directly on the torus. Our numerical experiments on model amorphous systems demonstrate that enforcing geometric and symmetry constraints significantly improves generative performance.</description>

      <title>Scalable tests of quantum contextuality from stabilizer-testing nonlocal games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soon after the dawn of quantum error correction, DiVincenzo and Peres observed that stabilizer codewords could give rise to simple proofs of quantumness via contextuality. This discovery can be recast in the language of nonlocal games: every $n$-qubit stabilizer state defines a specific "stabilizer-testing" $n$-player nonlocal game, which quantum players can win with probability one. If quantum players can moreover outperform all possible classical players, then the state is contextual. However, the classical values of stabilizer-testing games are largely unknown for scalable examples beyond the $n$-qubit GHZ state. We introduce several new methods for upper-bounding the classical values of these games. We first prove a general coding-theory bound for all stabilizer-testing games: if the classical value $p_{\mathrm{cl}}^* &lt; 1$, then $p_{\mathrm{cl}}^* \leq 7/8$, i.e., there is no classical strategy that can perform as well as the optimal quantum strategy even in an asymptotic sense. We then show how to tighten this bound for the most common scalable examples, namely GHZ, toric-code and cyclic cluster states. In particular, we establish an asymptotically tight upper bound for cyclic cluster states using transfer-matrix methods. This leads to the striking conclusion that measuring an exponentially small fidelity to the cyclic cluster state will suffice to witness its contextuality.</description>

      <title>Self-Affine Scaling of Earth's Islands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth's relief is approximately self-affine, meaning a zoom-in on a small region looks statistically similar to a large region upon a suitable rescaling. Fractional Brownian surfaces give an idealized self-affine model of Earth's relief with one parameter, the Hurst exponent $H$, characterizing the roughness of the surface. To quantitatively assess agreement with Earth elevation data, we compile a large dataset of topographic profiles of islands (N=131,063 with the range of areas covering 8+ orders of magnitude) and obtain four estimates for the Hurst exponent of Earth's surface by fitting four statistical laws from the theory of self-affine surfaces concerning islands: (i) distribution of areas, (ii) volume-area relationship, (iii) perimeter-area relationship, and (iv) maximum height-area relationship. The estimated Hurst exponents differ greatly, indicating different fractal scaling behavior for different geometric features, but are sorted in order of increasing expected influence of erosion at the shorelines.</description>

      <title>Numerically exact open quantum system work statistics with process tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying the thermodynamic work costs of quantum operations is essential for the continued development and optimisation of emerging quantum technologies. This present a significant challenge in regimes of rapid control within complex, non-equilibrium environments - conditions under which many contemporary quantum devices operate and conventional approximations break down. Here, we introduce a process tensor framework that enables the computation of the full numerically exact quantum work statistics of driven open quantum systems. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to a Landauer erasure protocol operating beyond the weak-coupling, Markovian, and slow-driving limits. The resulting work probability distributions reveal distinct quantum signatures that are missed by low-order moments yet significantly impact the erasure fidelity of the protocol. Our framework delivers non-perturbative accuracy and detail in characterising energy-exchange fluctuations in driven open quantum systems, establishing a powerful and versatile tool for exploring thermodynamics and control in the operating regimes of both near-term and future quantum devices.</description>

      <title>The Motile Josephson Array: Bridging Active Turbulence and Superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent minimalist modeling has demonstrated that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support an emergent, inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this letter, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for the emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as a macroscopic superconducting phase governed by the Adler equation. The validity of this mapping is confirmed analytically by a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity, corresponding to the saddle-node bifurcation of phase-locking systems. These results define the new minimal chiral flocking model as a motile, disordered Josephson array, bridging active turbulence and quantum superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Many-body contextuality and self-testing quantum matter via nonlocal games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextuality is arguably the fundamental property that makes quantum mechanics different from classical physics. It is responsible for quantum computational speedups in both magic-state-injection-based and measurement-based models of computation, and can be directly probed in a many-body setting by multiplayer nonlocal quantum games. Here, we discuss a family of games that can be won with certainty when performing single-site Pauli measurements on a state that is a codeword of a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) error-correcting quantum code. We show that these games require deterministic computation of a code-dependent Boolean function, and that the classical probability of success is upper bounded by a generalized notion of nonlinearity/nonquadraticity. This success probability quantifies the state's contextuality, and is computed via the function's (generalized) Walsh-Hadamard spectrum. To calculate this, we introduce an efficient, many-body-physics-inspired method that involves identifying the symmetries of an auxiliary hypergraph state. We compute the classical probability of success for several paradigmatic CSS codes and relate it to both classical statistical mechanics models and to strange correlators of symmetry-protected topological states. We also consider CSS submeasurement games, which can only be won with certainty by sharing the appropriate codeword up to local isometries. These games therefore enable self-testing, which we illustrate explicitly for the 2D toric code. We also discuss how submeasurement games enable an extensive notion of contextuality in many-body states.</description>

Abstract: Materials that have zero-energy flat band states on the surface may show surface superconductivity. Here we report a theoretical observation that a Hamiltonian describing a thin slab of topological nodal line semimetal, has zero energy eigenstate spanning the entire surface of the Brillouin zone under certain conditions, namely (i) the hopping amplitude of fermions in the direction of thickness is more than that in other directions (ii) the onsite energy should be less than some limiting value determined by the hopping probability. Our claim is substantiated by analytic and numerical approach. We also report new phase transitions in a region of parameter space and indicate that the Hamiltonian can also be realised by stacked layers described by a suitable Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Number of local minima in discrete-time fractional Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of local minima in time series data and random landscapes is essential across numerous scientific disciplines, offering critical insights into system dynamics. Recently, Kundu, Majumdar, and Schehr derived the exact distribution of the number of local minima for a broad class of Markovian symmetric walks [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{110}, 024137 (2024)]; however, many real-world systems are non-Markovian, typically due to interactions with possibly hidden degrees of freedom. This work investigates the statistical properties of local minima in discrete-time samples of fractional Brownian motion (fBm), a non-Markovian Gaussian process with stationary increments, widely used to model complex, anomalous diffusion phenomena. We derive a complete asymptotic characterization of the fluctuations of the number of local minima $m_N$ in an $N$-step discrete-time fBm. We show that the fluctuations of $m_N$ exhibit a sharp transition at the Hurst exponent $H=3/4$: for $H\le 3/4$ they satisfy a central limit theorem with Gaussian limiting law, whereas for $H&gt;3/4$ they converge to a non-Gaussian Rosenblatt process. The convergence at the process level gives us full statistical description at all times. We exemplify it on the covariance of the rescaled minima process, which displays two qualitatively distinct regimes matching Brownian and Rosenblatt covariances on either side of this threshold. Our analysis relies on a Hermite/Wick decomposition of the local-minimum indicator, which isolates a quadratic functional of an effective long-memory mode as the unique driver of the anomalous statistics. These results identify the count of local minima as a simple and robust diagnostic of long-range dependence in non-Markovian Gaussian processes, a conclusion supported by numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We consider a minimal model for quantum thermalization of coupled chaotic subsystems. The route towards ergodicity is explored as a function of the coupling strength. The results are contrasted with the predictions of standard Random Matrix Theory (RMT) and the Eigenstates Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). We highlight a coupling regime of disparity between the spectral statistics that indicates chaos, and ergodicity measures that indicate lack of ETH thermalization. The analysis involves a revision of the energy shell concept, in a way that is consistent but independent of the semiclassical perspective.</description>

      <title>From Three-Particle Dynamics to the Structural Origin of the Arrow of Time in Classical and Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified formulation of the origin of the arrow of time in classical and quantum mechanics. We begin with a mechanical analysis of a one-dimensional three-particle system, which provides a concrete example in which macroscopic irreversibility emerges despite microscopically reversible dynamics. By abstracting this mechanism, we identify coarse-graining as the essential ingredient responsible for macroscopic time asymmetry. We then formulate a general structural criterion for the thermodynamic arrow of time. We show that when microscopic time evolution forms a group while the induced macroscopic evolution forms only a semigroup, macroscopic time-reversal symmetry is necessarily broken. We prove that this semigroup structure arises if and only if the coarse-graining map from microscopic to macroscopic states is non-injective. This result holds independently of whether the underlying system is classical or quantum. In the quantum case, using density matrices, antiunitary time reversal, and CPTP coarse-graining maps, we show that macroscopic irreversibility follows inevitably from information loss, without requiring any asymmetry in the microscopic laws. Our results demonstrate that the thermodynamic arrow of time has a universal structural origin: the loss of microscopic information inherent in coarse-graining.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04270v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuously measured quantum systems are characterized by an output current, in the form of a stochastic and correlated time series which conveys crucial information about the underlying quantum system. The many tools used to describe current fluctuations are scattered across different communities: quantum opticians often use stochastic master equations, while a prevalent approach in condensed matter physics is provided by full counting statistics. These, however, are simply different sides of the same coin. Our goal with this tutorial is to provide a unified toolbox for describing current fluctuations. This not only provides novel insights, by bringing together different fields in physics, but also yields various analytical and numerical tools for computing quantities of interest. We illustrate our results with various pedagogical examples, and connect them with topical fields of research, such as waiting-time statistics, quantum metrology, thermodynamic uncertainty relations, quantum point contacts and Maxwell's demons.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Role of Anisotropies in Shaping Structure Formation in Cosmological N-Body Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Initial conditions in cosmological $N$-body simulations are typically generated by displacing particles from a regular cubic lattice using a correlated field derived from the linear power spectrum, often via the Zel'dovich approximation. While this procedure reproduces the target two-point statistics (e.g., the power spectrum or correlation function), it introduces subtle anisotropies due to the underlying lattice structure. These anisotropies, invisible to angle-averaged diagnostics, become evident through directional measures such as the Angular Distribution of Pairwise Distances. Analyzing two Cold Dark Matter simulations with { varying resolutions and box sizes}, we show that these anisotropies are not erased but are amplified by gravitational evolution. They seed filamentary structures that persist into the linear regime, remaining visible even at redshift $z = 0$. Our findings demonstrate that such features are numerical artifacts -- emerging from the anisotropic coupling between the displacement field and the lattice -- not genuine predictions of an isotropic cosmological model. These results underscore the importance of critically reassessing how initial conditions are constructed, particularly when probing the large-scale, quasi-linear regime of structure formation.</description>

Abstract: The quantum Fisher information, the quantum analogue of the classical Fisher information, is a central quantity in quantum metrology and quantum sensing due to its connection to parameter estimation and fidelity susceptibility. Using numerically exact methods applied to a paradigmatic open quantum system, the spin-boson model, we calculate both static and dynamical quantum Fisher information matrix elements with respect to spin-bath couplings and magnetic field strengths. As the spin-bath interaction increases, we first show that the coupling-coupling matrix elements relative to the ground state of the Hamiltonian are linked to the entanglement growth and signal the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition through their non-monotonic behavior. We also point out that the static quantum Fisher information exhibits a non-perturbative behavior in the zero-coupling limit, which we justify with an analytic argument. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time-dependent matrix elements can reveal non-Markovian effects as well as the transition from the coherent to incoherent regime at the Toulouse point, remaining robust under pure dephasing noise. Non-monotonic signatures of the quantum Fisher information matrix reflect changes in quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence, quantify non-Markovian behavior, and enable criticality-enhanced quantum sensing, thereby shedding light on key features of open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Variational Method in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a variational framework for addressing two-dimensional non-integrable quantum field theories through the exact structure of their integrable counterparts. Concentrating on the $\varphi^4$ Landau-Ginzburg model, we use the analytical Vacuum Expectation Values and Form Factors of local operators in the sinh-Gordon theory as the foundation of a variational ansatz. In this way, we obtain controlled estimates of central physical quantities of the $\varphi^4$ theory - such as the finite-volume ground-state energy and the physical mass as a function of the coupling constant. The strengths of the variational methods are leveraged in combination with the Hamiltonian truncation techniques and the LeClair-Mussardo formula, which also allow to probe the accuracy of the variational approximation varying the system size. Within the weak-coupling regime, a detailed numerical analysis reveals the behaviour of the finite-volume spectrum, the ground-state energy, and the elastic part of the scattering matrix, showing how the rigorous machinery of integrable models can serve as a guiding light into the complex landscape of non-integrable quantum field dynamics.</description>

      <title>Friendship-paradox paradox: Do most people's friends really have more friends than they do?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13957v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical friendship paradox asserts that, on average, an individual's neighbors have a higher degree than the individual. This statement concerns network-level means and does not describe how often a typical node is locally dominated by its neighbors. Motivated by this distinction, we develop a framework that separates mean-based friendship paradox inequalities from two majority-type quantities: a global fraction measuring how many nodes have a degree smaller than the mean degree of their neighbors, and a local fraction based on hub centrality that measures how many nodes are dominated in a median-based sense. We show that neither fraction is constrained by the classical friendship paradox and that they can behave independently of each other. A simple example and two empirical networks illustrate how quadrant patterns in the joint distribution of a node's degree and its neighbors' degree determine the signs and magnitudes of the two fractions, and how left- or right-skewed degree distributions of neighboring nodes can yield opposite conclusions for mean-based and median-based comparisons. The resulting framework offers a clearer distinction between population averages and local majority relations and provides a foundation for future analyses of local advantage, disadvantage, and perception asymmetry in complex networks.</description>

      <title>Extended regime of nematic order in an interacting monomer-dimer model of Heilmann and Lieb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit a two-dimensional model of liquid crystals introduced by Heilmann and Lieb (1979), which consists of a system of dimers on the square lattice at chemical potential $\lambda$, interacting via a hard-core repulsion and an attractive interaction of strength $-a&lt;0$ between adjacent, colinear dimers. The model is conjectured to exhibit nematic order at low temperatures, in the sense of orientational symmetry breaking coupled with the absence of translational order, provided that $\lambda+a&gt;0$. In this paper, we prove the conjecture under the additional condition that $3a&gt;\lambda$, which corresponds physically to the regime where vacancies, as opposed to misaligned dimers, are the dominant mechanism for decorrelation, significantly extending the parameter regime under which the conjecture is known to hold. Our proof adapts the strategy of Hadas and Peled (2025) for proving the existence of a columnar phase in the hard-square model, combining a mesoscopic characterization of orientational order with the disagreement percolation method of van den Berg (1993) to prove the absence of translational order. To deal with the non-nearest neighbor interactions in the model, we also introduce an extension of the chessboard estimate applicable to finite products of periodic Gibbs measures.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniform patterns nucleated at low temperatures: Insight from vortex matter imaged in unprecedentedly large fields-of-view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniform patterns present enhanced physical properties that make them the new generation of cutting-edge technological devices. Synthesizing devices with tens of thousands of components arranged in a hyperuniform fashion has thus become a breakthrough to achieve in order to implement these technologies. Here we provide evidence that extended two-dimensional hyperuniform patterns spanning tens of thousands of components can be nucleated using as a template the low-temperature vortex structure obtained in pristine Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 samples after following a field-cooling protocol.</description>
