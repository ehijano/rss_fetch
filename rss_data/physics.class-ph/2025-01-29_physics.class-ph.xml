      <title>Modeling Atomic Polarizability: From Charge Distortion to Non-Uniform Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the classical model of atomic polarizability, atomic charges are displaced by an applied electric field, assuming the electron cloud remains spherically symmetric but with its center shifted from the nucleus, thereby inducing an electric dipole. In this work, we propose that the applied electric field distorts the initially spherical electron cloud into a spheroidal shape, with the nucleus positioned at one of its focal points. We assume that the electron cloud's charge density remains uniform and is not altered by the applied field. We derive a modified expression for the polarizability that accounts for the distortion factor, represented by the eccentricity of the spheroid, and analyze an additional model incorporating non-uniform charge distribution. Furthermore, we present an expression for polarizability that combines the effects of both distortion and non-uniform charge density. These models aim to refine the classical approximation and offer deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying atomic polarizability.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the problem of existence of surface Rayleigh waves with impedance boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of surface waves in an isotropic elastic half-space endowed with impedance boundary conditions as first proposed by Godoy et al. [Wave Motion 49 (2012), 585-594]. These conditions are controlled by two impedance parameters, where the standard stress-free boundary condition is retrieved for zero impedance. While the existence of a unique surface wave (called Rayleigh wave) is well-established for the standard stress-free boundary condition, the introduction of more general boundary conditions may lead to the absence of surface waves or even cause the PDE boundary value problem to become ill-posed. For the case of Godoy's impedance boundary conditions, the problem of existence and uniqueness of a surface wave of Rayleigh type was investigated by means of the complex function method based on Cauchy-type integrals. However, this method is quite cumbersome and hard to apply. In this work, we present an alternative method based on elementary tools from calculus to deal with the problem. We consider a particular case where both impedance parameters are non-zero and demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of the surface wave for all material and boundary parameter values. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effect of the impedance parameter on the speed of the surface wave.</description>
