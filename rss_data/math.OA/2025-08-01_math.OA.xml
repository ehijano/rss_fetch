      <title>Quantum Hamming Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the set of words of a given length for a given alphabet, the Hamming metric between two such words is the number of positions where the two words differ. A quantum version of the corresponding Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric on states was introduced in 2021 by De Palma, Marvian, Trevisan and Lloyd. For the quantum version the alphabet is replaced by a full matrix algebra, and the set of words is replaced by the tensor product of a corresponding number of copies of that full matrix algebra. While De Palma et al. work primarily at the level of states, they do obtain the corresponding seminorm (the quantum Hamming metric) on the algebra of observables that plays the role of assigning Lipschitz constants to functions. A suitable such seminorm on a unital C*-algebra is the current common method for defining a quantum metric on a C*-algebra.
  In this paper we will reverse the process, by first expressing the Hamming metric in terms of the C*-algebra of functions on the set of words, and then dropping the requirement that the algebra be commutative so as to obtain the quantum Hamming metric. From that we obtain the corresponding Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric on states. Along the way we show that many of the steps can be put in more general forms of some interest, notably for infinite-dimensional C*-algebras.</description>

      <title>Generalized Multiple Operator Integrals and Perturbation Theory for Operators with Continuous Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operators with continuous spectra naturally arise in spectral theory, quantum mechanics, automorphic forms, and noncommutative geometry. However, analyzing such operators, particularly in the non-selfadjoint setting, remains challenging due to spectral instability and the lack of an orthonormal basis. This work advances the theory of Multiple Operator Integrals (MOIs) by developing a unified framework for generalized MOIs (GMOIs) associated with general (non-normal, non-selfadjoint) operators possessing continuous spectra. Building on prior work in Generalized Double Operator Integrals (GDOIs) and finite dimensional GMOIs, we extend the theory to include: the formulation of GMOIs in the continuous spectrum setting, their algebraic structure, continuity properties, norm and Lipschitz estimates, and a perturbation formula that generalizes classical results. As a key application, we derive a Krein-type spectral shift formula for GDOIs in the continuous spectrum setting and further extend it to arbitrary-order approximations. These contributions provide a foundation for broader developments in spectral theory, operator algebras, noncommutative geometry, and noncommutative analysis.</description>

      <title>Local presentability and monadicity of forgetful functors for operator algebraic categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work of Lindenhovius and Zamdzhiev, it was established that the category of complete operator spaces, with completely contractive linear maps as morphisms, is locally countably presentable. In this work, we extend their conclusion to the non-complete setting and prove that the categories of operator systems, (Archimedean) order unit spaces, and unital operator algebras are all locally countably presentable as well. This is established through an analysis of forgetful functors and the identification of Eilenberg-Moore categories. We provide a complete understanding of adjunction and monadicity for forgetful functors between these categories, together with the categories of $C^*$-algebras, Banach spaces, and normed spaces. In addition, for various subcategories of function-theoretic objects, we investigate completeness and local presentability through Kadison's duality theorem.</description>

      <title>On the continuity of derivations over locally regular Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of continuity of derivations over Banach algebras. More specifically, we consider a class of Banach algebras that contain a dense `$C^*$-like' subalgebra. We discuss applications to $L^p$-crossed products and symmetrized $L^p$-crossed products. As an example, our results imply that every derivation over the $L^p$-crossed product $F^p(G,X,\alpha)$ is continuous, provided that $G$ is infinite, finitely generated, has polynomial growth, and acts freely on the compact space $X$.</description>

      <title>Operator identities of multiplicity 3 for associative algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider algebraic identities for linear operators on associative algebras in which each term has degree 2 (the number of variables) and multiplicity 3 (the number of occurrences of the operator). We apply the methods of earlier work by the author and Elgendy which classified operator identities of degree 2, multiplicities 1 and 2. We begin with the general operator identity of multiplicity 3 which has 10 terms and indeterminate coefficients. We use the operadic concept of partial composition to generate all consequences of this identity in degree 3, multiplicity 4. The coefficient matrix of these consequences has size $105 \times 20$ and indeterminate entries. We compute the partial Smith form of this matrix and use Gr\"obner bases for determinantal ideals to discover which values of the indeterminates produce a matrix of submaximal rank. The only possible submaximal values of the rank are 16 and 19: there are 6 new identities of rank 16, and 8 new identities of rank 19.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces on Homogeneous Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relationships between a subvariety of the open unit ball in the complex $d$-dimensional space $\mathbb{C}^{d}$, the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) obtained by restricting the Drury-Arveson space to the variety, and its multiplier algebra. Davidson, Ramsey, and Shalit showed that given two subvarieties, one is the image of the other under an automorphism of the ball if and only if the RKHSs corresponding to the varieties are isometrically isomorphic as RKHSs, and this holds if and only if their multiplier algebras are isometrically isomorphic as multiplier algebras. We observe that whenever two such RKHSs are close to being isometrically isomorphic, their multiplier algebras are close to being isometrically isomorphic as well. In this case, the underlying varieties are close to being automorphically equivalent. For homogeneous varieties satisfying some additional conditions, we show that if one variety is close to being the image of the other under a unitary, then the RKHSs are close to being isometrically isomorphic as RKHSs. This continues work by Ofek, Pandey and Shalit, who showed that for two finite subsets in the open unit ball $B_{d}$, one set is close to being the image of the other under an automorphism of $B_{d}$, if and only if the RKHSs defined on these sets, are close to being isometrically isomorphic, and that happens if and only if their multiplier algebras are close to being completely isometrically isomorphic.</description>

      <title>On Rieffel's conjecture characterizing a deformed algebra as Heisenberg smooth operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{A}$ be a unital C$^*$-algebra and $E_n$ be the Hilbert $\mathscr{A}$-module defined as the completion of the $\mathscr{A}$-valued Schwartz function space $\mathcal{S}^\mathscr{A}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ with respect to the norm $\|f\|_2 := \left\| \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(x)^*f(x) \, dx \right\|_\mathscr{A}^{1 / 2}$. Also, let $\text{Ad }\mathcal{U}$ be the canonical action of the $(2n + 1)$-dimensional Heisenberg group by conjugation on the algebra of adjointable operators on $E_n$ and let $J$ be a skew-symmetric linear transformation on $\mathbb{R}^n$. We characterize the smooth vectors under $\text{Ad }\mathcal{U}$ which commute with a certain algebra of right multiplication operators $R_h$, with $h \in \mathcal{S}^\mathscr{A}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, where the product is ``twisted'' with respect to $J$ according to a deformation quantization procedure introduced by M.A. Rieffel. More precisely, we establish that they coincide with an algebra of left multiplication operators and show that this solves, in particular, a conjecture posed by Rieffel.</description>

      <title>Flatness of $\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections and commutativity of Frobenius algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tensor functor called $\alpha$-induction produces a new unitary fusion category from a Frobenius algebra, or a $Q$-system, in a braided unitary fusion category. A bi-unitary connection, which is a finite family of complex number subject to some axioms, realizes an object in any unitary fusion category. It also gives a characterization of a finite-dimensional nondegenerate commuting square in subfactor theory of Jones and realizes a certain $4$-tensor appearing in recent studies of $2$-dimensional topological order. We study $\alpha$-induction for bi-unitary connections, and show that flatness of the resulting $\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections implies commutativity of the original Frobenius algebra. This gives a converse of our previous result and answers a question raised by R. Longo. We furthermore give finer correspondence between the flat parts of the $\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections and the commutative Frobenius subalgebras studied by B\"ockenhauer-Evans.</description>
