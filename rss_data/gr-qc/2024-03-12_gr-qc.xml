      <title>Stability of hypermassive neutron stars with realistic rotation and entropy profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers produce massive, hot, rapidly differentially rotating neutron star remnants; electromagnetic and gravitational wave signals associated with the subsequent evolution depend on the stability of these remnants. Stability of relativistic stars has previously been studied for uniform rotation and for a class of differential rotation with monotonic angular velocity profiles. Stability of those equilibria to axisymmetric perturbations was found to respect a turning point criterion: along a constant angular momentum sequence, the onset of unstable stars is found at maximum density less than but close to the density of maximum mass. In this paper, we test this turning point criterion for non-monotonic angular velocity profiles and non-isentropic entropy profiles, both chosen to more realistically model post-merger equilibria. Stability is assessed by evolving perturbed equilibria in 2D using the Spectral Einstein Code. We present tests of the code's new capability for axisymmetric metric evolution. We confirm the turning point theorem and determine the region of our rotation law parameter space that provides highest maximum mass for a given angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Primordial dust universe in the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply quantum cosmology to investigate the early moments of a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological model, using Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) as the gravitational theory. The matter content of the model is a dust perfect fluid. We start studying the classical model. Then, we write the total Hamiltonian of the model, quantize it and find the appropriate Wheeler-DeWitt equation. In order to avoid factor ordering ambiguities, in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, we introduce a canonical transformation. We solve that equation using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation and compute the tunneling probabilities for the birth of that universe ($TP_{WKB}$). Since the WKB wavefunction depends on the dust energy and the free coupling constants coming from the HL theory, we compute the behavior of $TP_{WKB}$ as a function of all these quantities.</description>

      <title>Time Delay of Light in the Gravitational lensing of Supermassive Black Holes in Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark matter halo has non-negligible effects on the gravitational lensing of supermassive black hole in the galaxy center. Our work gives a study on the time-delay of light in gravitational lensings of black holes enclosed by dark matter halos. To provide a precise description on the distribution of dark matter in galaxies, we choose several famous phenomenological dark matter halo models in astrophysics, including the NFW, Beta, Burkert and Moore models, to carry out the present study. Through numerically calculating the time-delay of light in gravitational lensing, a comparative analysis of the dark matter effects within different halo models has been performed. Assuming typical length scales associated with the galactic gravitational lensing, numerical results indicate that the NFW, Beta, Moore dark matter halos can significantly enhance the time delay of light. Conversely, the dark matter in Burkert model exhibits a negative contribution on the time delay, resulting in smaller time delay compared with those for pure black hole cases.

      <title>Power spectra and circular polarization of primordial gravitational waves with parity and Lorentz violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The violations of parity and Lorentz symmetries in gravity can change the propagating properties of gravitational waves (GWs) in the cosmological background, which can arise from a large number of parity- and Lorentz-violating theories. In this paper, through a systematic parametrization for characterizing possible derivations from the standard GW propagation in general relativity, we study both the parity- and Lorentz-violating effects on the power spectra and the polarization of the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) during the slow-roll inflation. To this end, we calculate explicitly the power spectrum and the corresponding circular polarization of the PGWs analytically by using the uniform asymptotic approximation. It is shown that the new contributions to power spectra contain two parts, one from the parity-violating terms and the other from the Lorentz-violating terms. While the Lorentz-violating terms can only affect the overall amplitudes of PGWs, the parity-violating terms induce nonzero circular polarization of PGWs, i.e., the left-hand and right-hand polarization modes of GWs have different amplitudes.</description>

      <title>The Nature of Dark Energy and Constraints on Its Hypothetical Constituents from Force Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review considers the theoretical approaches to the understanding of dark energy which comprises approximately 68\% of the energy of our Universe and explains an acceleration in its expansion. Following a discussion of the main approach based on Einstein's equations with the cosmological term, the explanations of dark energy using the concept of some kind of scalar field are elucidated. These include the concept of a quintessence and modifications of the general theory of relativity by means of the scalar-tensor gravity exploiting the chameleon, symmetron, and environment-dependent dilaton fields and corresponding particles. After mentioning several laboratory experiments allowing to constrain the hypothetical scalar fields modeling the dark energy, special attention is devoted to the possibility of constraining the parameters of chameleon, symmetron, and environment-dependent dilaton fields from measuring the Casimir force. It is concluded that the parameters of each of these fields can be significantly strengthened in near future by using the next generation setups in preparation suitable for measuring the Casimir force at larger separations.</description>

      <title>Spinfoams, $\gamma$-duality and parity violation in primordial gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$ appears as a coupling constant in the spinfoam dynamics of loop quantum gravity and can be understood as a measure of gravitational parity violation via a duality rotation. We investigate an effective field theory for gravity and a scalar field, with dynamics given by a $\gamma$-dual action obtained via a duality rotation of a parity-non-violating one. The resulting relation between the coupling constants of parity-even and parity-odd higher-curvature terms is determined by $\gamma$, opening the possibility of its measurement in the semiclassical regime. For a choice of $\gamma$-dual effective action, we study cosmic inflation and show that the observation of a primordial tensor polarization, together with the tensor tilt and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, provides a measurement of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and, therefore, of the scale of discreteness of the quantum geometry of space.</description>

      <title>New slow-roll approximations for inflation in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new slow-roll approximations for inflationary models with the Gauss-Bonnet term. We find more accurate expressions of the standard slow-roll parameters as functions of the scalar field. To check the accuracy of approximations considered we construct inflationary models with quadratic and quartic monomial potentials and the Gauss-Bonnet term. Numerical analysis of these models indicates that the proposed inflationary scenarios do not contradict to the observation data. New slow-roll approximations show that the constructed inflationary models are in agreement with the observation data, whereas one does not get allowed observational parameters at the same values of parameters of the constructed models in the standard slow-roll approximation.</description>

      <title>Geometric and topological corrections to Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute departures in the black hole thermodynamics induced by either geometric or topological corrections to general relativity. Specifically, we analyze the spherically symmetric spacetime solutions of two modified gravity scenarios with Lagrangians $\mathcal{L}\sim R^{1+\epsilon}$ and $\mathcal{L}\sim R+\epsilon\, \mathcal{G}^2$, where $\mathcal{G}$ is the Euler density in four dimensions, while $ 0&lt;\epsilon\ll 1$ measures the perturbation around the Hilbert-Einstein action. Accordingly, we find the expressions of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy by the Penrose formula, and the black hole temperature and horizon of the obtained solutions. We then investigate the heat capacities in terms of the free parameters of the theories under study. In doing so, we show that healing the problem of negative heat capacities can be possible under particular choices of the free constants, albeit with limitations on the masses allowed for the black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>Exploring Unique Quasinormal Modes of a Massive Scalar Field in Brane-World Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute precise values of quasinormal modes of a massive scalar field in the background of the Schwarzschild-like brane-localised black holes. It is shown that the quasinormal spectrum of the massive field differs qualitatively from that previously known for other black hole models, due to the presence of two kinds of modes: those whose damping rate vanishes as the mass of the field $\mu$ increases up to some critical value, and those whose real oscillation frequency vanishes at a certain value of $\mu$. While the first type of modes, which are arbitrarily long-lived, are recognized in various four-dimensional backgrounds as quasi-resonances, the second type is a novel feature for asymptotically flat black holes. When $Re (\omega)$ reaches zero, the fundamental mode disappears from the spectrum and the first overtone becomes the fundamental mode. We also demonstrate that quasi-resonances may not exist for brane-localised black holes immersed in $D\geq 6$ - dimensional bulk.</description>

      <title>QED Effects on Kerr-Newman Black Hole Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating first-order QED effects, we explore the shadows of Kerr-Newman black holes with a magnetic charge through the numerical backward ray-tracing method. Our investigation accounts for both the direct influence of the electromagnetic field on light rays and the distortion of the background spacetime metric due to QED corrections. We notice that the area of the shadow increases with the QED effect, mainly due to the fact that the photons move more slowly in the effective medium and become easier to be trapped by the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the phase-space of homogeneous and anisotropic spacetimes within symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$-gravity. Specifically, we consider the Kantowski-Sachs and locally rotational Bianchi III geometries to describe the physical space. By analyzing the phase-space, we reconstruct the cosmological history dictated by $f(Q)$-gravity and comment about the theory's viability. Our findings suggest that the free parameters of the connection must be constrained to eliminate nonlinear terms in the field equations. Consequently, new stationary points emerge, rendering the theory cosmologically viable. We identify the existence of anisotropic accelerated universes, which may correspond to the pre-inflationary epoch.</description>

      <title>Soft Theorems for Boostless Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider effective field theories (EFTs) of scalar fields with broken Lorentz boosts, which arise by taking the decoupling and flat-space limits of the EFT of inflation, and derive constraints that must be satisfied by the corresponding scattering amplitudes if there is an underlying non-linearly realised symmetry. We primarily concentrate on extended shift symmetries which depend on the space-time coordinates, and find that combinations of scattering amplitudes obey enhanced Adler zeros. That is, such combinations vanish as one external momentum is taken soft, with the rate at which they vanish dictated by the corresponding symmetry. In our soft theorem derivation, we pay particular care to the energy and momentum-conserving delta functions that arise due to space-time translations, and show that when acted upon by derivatives with respect to spatial momenta, they yield a tower of soft theorems which are ultimately required for closure of the underlying symmetry algebra. All of our soft theorems correspond to constraints that must be satisfied by on-shell amplitudes and, even for symmetries that depend on the time coordinate, our soft theorems only require derivatives to be taken with respect to spatial momenta. We perform a soft bootstrap procedure to find solutions to our soft theorems, and compare these solutions to what we find from an off-shell analysis using the coset construction.</description>

      <title>Particle shells from relativistic bubble walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic bubble walls from cosmological phase transitions (PT) necessarily accumulate expanding shells of particles. We systematically characterize shell properties, and identify and calculate the processes that prevent them from free streaming: phase-space saturation effects, out-of-equilibrium $2\to2$ and $3\to2$ shell-shell and shell-bath interactions, and shell interactions with bubble walls. We find that shells do not free stream in scenarios widely studied in the literature, where standard predictions will need to be reevaluated, including those of bubble wall velocities, gravitational waves (GW) and particle production. Our results support the use of bulk-flow GW predictions in all regions where shells free stream, irrespectively of whether or not the latent heat is mostly converted in the scalar field gradient.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Phase Shifts in Eccentric Black Hole Mergers as a Probe of Dynamical Formation Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantify for the first time the gravitational wave (GW) phase shift appearing in the waveform of eccentric binary black hole (BBH) mergers formed dynamically in three-body systems. For this, we have developed a novel numerical method where we construct a reference binary, by evolving the post-Newtonian (PN) evolution equations backwards from a point near merger without the inclusion of the third object, that can be compared to the real binary that evolves under the influence from the third BH. From this we quantify how the interplay between dynamical tides, PN-effects, and the time-dependent Doppler shift of the eccentric GW source results in unique observable GW phase shifts that can be mapped to the gravitational dynamics taking place at formation. We further find a new analytical expression for the GW phase shift, which surprisingly has a universal functional form that only depends on the time-evolving BBH eccentricity. The normalization scales with the BH masses and initial separation, which can be linked to the underlying astrophysical environment. GW phase shifts from a chaotic 3-body BH scattering taking place in a cluster, and from a BBH inspiraling in a disk migration trap near a super-massive BH, are also shown for illustration. When current and future GW detectors start to observe eccentric GW sources with high enough signal-to-noise-ratio, we propose this to be among the only ways of directly probing the dynamical origin of individual BBH mergers using GWs alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study real-time finite-temperature correlators for free scalars of any mass in a $dS_{d+1}$ static patch in any dimension. We show that whenever the inverse temperature is a rational multiple of the inverse de Sitter temperature, certain Matsubara poles of the symmetric Wightman function disappear. At the de Sitter temperature, we explicitly show how the Lorentzian thermal correlators can all be obtained by analytic continuations from the round $S^{d+1}$. We establish the precise relation between the Harish-Chandra character for $SO(1,d+1)$ and the integrated spectral function, providing a novel dynamical perspective on the former and enabling generalizations. Furthermore, we study scalars with exceptional non-positive masses. We provide a physical picture for the distinctive structures of their characters. For the massless case, we perform a consistent static patch quantization, and find the unique $S^{d+1}$ correlator that analytically continues to the correlators in the quantum theory.</description>

      <title>On the mutual exclusiveness of time and position in quantum physics and the corresponding uncertainty relation for free falling particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle is one of the characteristic properties of quantum theory, where it signals the incompatibility of two types of measurements. In this paper, we argue that measurements of time-of-arrival $T_x$ at position $x$ and position $X_t$ at time $t$ are mutually exclusive for a quantum system, each providing complementary information about the state of that system. For a quantum particle of mass $m$ falling in a uniform gravitational field $g$, we show that the corresponding uncertainty relation can be expressed as $\Delta T_x \Delta X_t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2mg}$. This uncertainty relationship can be taken as evidence of the presence of a form of epistemic incompatibility in the sense that preparing the initial state of the system so as to decrease the measured position uncertainty will lead to an increase in the measured time-of-arrival uncertainty. These findings can be empirically tested in the context of ongoing or forthcoming experiments on measurements of time-of-arrival for free-falling quantum particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that equality within the Minkowski inequality for asymptotically flat static spaces is achieved only by slices in Schwarzschild space for mean-convex, non-negative scalar curvature boundaries. In order to establish this, we prove uniqueness of quasi-spherical static metrics: any quasi-spherical metric with vanishing shear vector that admits a bounded static vacuum potential is a rotationally symmetric piece of Schwarzschild space. We also observe that the static Minkowski inequality extends to all dimensions when the boundary is connected and to weakly asymptotically flat static spaces. As a result, the uniqueness theorems for photon surfaces and static metric extensions from our prequel extend to this larger class and to all dimensions.</description>

      <title>Dark Branes for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a setup for the origin of dark matter based on spacetime with a warped extra dimension and three branes: the Planck brane, the TeV brane, at a (few) TeV scale $\rho_T$, and a dark brane, at a (sub)-GeV scale $\rho_1\lesssim 100$ GeV $\ll\rho_T$. The Standard Model is localized in the TeV brane, thus solving the Higgs hierarchy problem, while the dark matter $\chi$, a Dirac fermion with mass $m_\chi&lt;\rho_1$, is localized in the dark brane. The radion, with mass $m_r&lt;m_\chi$, interacts strongly ($\sim m_\chi/\rho_1\sim\mathcal O(1)$) with dark matter and very weakly ($\sim m_{f}\rho_1/\rho_T^2\ll 1$) with the Standard Model matter $f$. The generic conflict between the bounds on its detection signatures and its proper relic abundance is avoided as dark matter annihilation is $p$-wave suppressed. The former is determined by its very weak interactions with the SM and the latter by its much stronger annihilation into radions. Therefore, there is a vast range in the Dark Matter's parameter space where the correct relic abundance is achieved consistently with the existing bounds. Moreover, for the dark brane with $\rho_1\lesssim 10$ GeV, a confinement/deconfinement first order phase transition, where the radion condensates, produces a stochastic gravitational waves background at the nanoHz frequencies, which can be identified with the signal detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments. In the PTA window, for $0.15 \textrm{ GeV}\lesssim m_\chi\lesssim 0.5$ GeV the relic abundance is reproduced and all constraints are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cosmological Parameters with Viscous Modified Chaplygin Gas and Generalized Cosmic Chaplygin Gas Models in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity: Utilizing Late-time Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates accelerated cosmic expansion using the Viscous Modified Chaplygin Gas (VMMG) and Generalized Cosmic Chaplygin Gas (GCCM) within Horava-Lifshitz gravity. Our primary objective is to constrain essential cosmological parameters, such as the Hubble Parameter ($H_{0}$) and Sound Horizon ($r_{d}$). We incorporate recent datasets comprising 17 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation observations, 33 Cosmic Chronometer measurements, 40 Type Ia Supernovae data points, 24 quasar Hubble diagram data points, and 162 Gamma Ray Bursts data points. Additionally, we integrate the most recent determination of the Hubble constant (R22). Treating $r_{d}$ as a free parameter helps alleviate bias, enhance precision, and improve dataset compatibility. By simulating random correlations in the covariance matrix, errors are reduced. The obtained values of ($H_{0}$) and ($r_{d}$) are consistent with those from Planck and SDSS. Cosmography tests offer insights into the dynamics of both models, aiding our understanding of cosmological evolution. Statefinder diagnostics deepen our understanding of cosmic expansion dynamics and aid in distinguishing between different cosmological models. The $o_{m}$ Diagnostic test reveals that at late times, VMMG falls in the phantom region and GCCM falls in the phantom quintessence region. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) provide support for all models under consideration, indicating that each model offers a plausible explanation. Notably, the $\Lambda$CDM model emerges with the lowest AIC score, suggesting its relatively superior fit compared to others. Additionally, validation through the reduced $\chi_{\text{red}}^{2}$ statistic confirms satisfactory fits across all models, further reinforcing their credibility in explaining the observed data.</description>

      <title>Compact Objects in close orbits as Gravitational Wave Sources: Formation Scenarios and Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational Waves (GWs) provide a unique way to explore our Universe. The ongoing ground-based detectors, e.g., LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, and the upcoming next-generation detectors, e.g., Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, as well as the future space-borne GW antennas, e.g., LISA, TianQin, and TaiJi, cover a wide range of GW frequencies {from $\sim 10^{-4}\;\rm Hz$ to $\sim 10^3\;\rm Hz$} and almost all types of compact objects in close orbits serve as the potential target sources for these GW detectors. The synergistic multi-band GW and EM observations would allow us to study fundamental physics from stars to cosmology. {The formation of stellar GW sources has been extensively explored in recent years, and progress on physical processes in binary interaction has been made as well. Furthermore, some studies have shown that the progress in binary evolution may significantly affect the properties of the stellar GW sources.}</description>

      <title>In-Depth Modeling of Tilt-To-Length Coupling in LISA's Interferometers and TDI Michelson Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present first-order models for tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling in LISA, both for the individual interferometers as well as in the time-delay interferometry (TDI) Michelson observables. These models include the noise contributions from angular and lateral jitter coupling of the six test masses, six movable optical subassemblies (MOSAs), and three spacecraft. We briefly discuss which terms are considered to be dominant and reduce the TTL model for the second-generation TDI Michelson X observable to these primary noise contributions to estimate the resulting noise level. We show that the expected TTL noise will initially violate the entire mission displacement noise budget, resulting in the known necessity to fit and subtract TTL noise in data post-processing. By comparing the noise levels for different assumptions prior to subtraction, we show why noise mitigation by realignment prior to subtraction is favorable. We then discuss that the TTL coupling in the individual interferometers will have noise contributions that will not be present in the TDI observables. Models for TTL coupling noise in TDI and in the individual interferometers are therefore different, and commonly made assumptions are valid as such only for TDI but not for the individual interferometers. Finally, we analyze what implications can be drawn from the presented models for the subsequent fit-and-subtraction in post-processing. We show that noise contributions from the test mass and inter-satellite interferometers are indistinguishable, such that only the combined coefficients can be fit and used for subtraction. However, a distinction is considered not necessary. Additionally, we show a correlation between coefficients for transmitter and receiver jitter couplings in each individual TDI Michelson observable. This full correlation can be resolved by using all three Michelson observables for fitting the TTL coefficients.</description>

      <title>Differential geometry and general relativity with algebraifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is often noted that many of the basic concepts of differential geometry, such as the definition of connection, are purely algebraic in nature. Here, we review and extend existing work on fully algebraic formulations of differential geometry which eliminate the need for an underlying manifold. While the literature contains various independent approaches to this, we focus on one particular approach that we argue to be the most natural one based on the definition of \emph{algebraifold}, by which we mean a commutative algebra $\mathcal{A}$ for which the module of derivations of $\mathcal{A}$ is finitely generated projective. Over $\mathbb{R}$ as the base ring, this class of algebras includes the algebra $C^\infty(M)$ of smooth functions on a manifold $M$, and similarly for analytic functions. An importantly different example is the Colombeau algebra of generalized functions on $M$, which makes distributional differential geometry an instance of our formalism. Another instance is a fibred version of smooth differential geometry, since any smooth submersion $M \to N$ makes $C^\infty(M)$ into an algebraifold with $C^\infty(N)$ as the base ring.Over any field $k$ of characteristic zero, examples include the algebra of regular functions on a smooth affine variety as well as any function field.
  Our development of differential geometry in terms of algebraifolds comprises tensors, connections, curvature, geodesics and we briefly consider general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we establish Hardy and Heisenberg uncertainty-type inequalities for the exterior of a Schwarzschild black hole. The weights that appear in both inequalities are tailored to fit the geometry, and can both be compared to the related Riemannian distance from the event horizon to yield inequalities for that distance. Moreover, in both cases the classic Euclidean inequalities with a point singularity can be recovered in the limit where one stands ``far enough'' from the black hole, as expected from the asymptotic flatness of the metric.</description>

      <title>From S-matrix theory to strings: Scattering data and the commitment to non-arbitrariness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early history of string theory is marked by a shift from strong interaction physics to quantum gravity. The first string models and associated theoretical framework were formulated in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the context of the S-matrix program for the strong interactions. In the mid-1970s, the models were reinterpreted as a potential theory unifying the four fundamental forces. This paper provides a historical analysis of how string theory was developed out of S-matrix physics, aiming to clarify how modern string theory, as a theory detached from experimental data, grew out of an S-matrix program that was strongly dependent upon observable quantities. Surprisingly, the theoretical practice of physicists already turned away from experiment before string theory was recast as a potential unified quantum gravity theory. With the formulation of dual resonance models (the "hadronic string theory"), physicists were able to determine almost all of the models' parameters on the basis of theoretical reasoning. It was this commitment to "non-arbitrariness", i.e., a lack of free parameters in the theory, that initially drove string theorists away from experimental input, and not the practical inaccessibility of experimental data in the context of quantum gravity physics. This is an important observation when assessing the role of experimental data in string theory.</description>

Abstract: We express the $q$-th Gauss--Bonnet--Chern mass of an immersed submanifold of Euclidean space as a linear combination of two terms: the total $(2q)$-th mean curvature and the integral, over the entire manifold, of the inner product between the $(2q+1)$-th mean curvature vector and the position vector of the immersion. As a consequence, we obtain, for each $q$, a geometric inequality that holds whenever the positive mass theorem (for the $q$-th Gauss--Bonnet--Chern mass) holds.</description>

Abstract: Tidal disruptions of stars on the equatorial plane orbiting Kerr black holes have been widely studied. However thus far, there have been fewer studies of stars in inclined precessing orbits around a Kerr black hole. In this paper, by using tensor virial equations, we show the presence of possible resonances in these systems for typical physical parameters of black hole-neutron star binaries in close orbits or of a white dwarf/an ordinary star orbiting a supermassive black hole. This suggests the presence of a new instability before the tidal disruption limit is encountered in such systems.</description>

      <title>Fully non-Gaussian Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs) represent a particular class of primordial signals which are sourced at second-order in perturbation theory whenever a scalar fluctuation of the metric is present. They form a guaranteed Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) that, depending on the amplification of primordial scalar fluctuations, can be detected by GW detectors. The amplitude and the frequency shape of the scalar-induced SGWB can be influenced by the statistical properties of the scalar density perturbations. In this work we study the intuitive physics behind SIGWs and we analyze the imprints of local non-Gaussianity of the primordial curvature perturbation on the GW spectrum. We consider all the relevant non-Gaussian contributions up to fifth-order in the scalar seeds without any hierarchy, and we derive the related GW energy density $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$. We perform a Fisher matrix analysis to understand to which accuracy non-Gaussianity can be constrained with the LISA detector, which will be sensitive in the milli-Hertz frequency band. We find that LISA, neglecting the impact of astrophysical foregrounds, will be able to measure the amplitude, the width and the peak of the spectrum with an accuracy up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, while non-Gaussianity can be measured up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$. Finally, we discuss the implications of our non-Gaussianity expansion on the fraction of Primordial Black Holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Krasnov's formulation of General Relativity (GR), we develop a lightcone ansatz for self-dual gravity (along with linearized anti-self-dual perturbations) in the Poincare patch of de Sitter space. This amounts to a generalization of Plebanski's "second heavenly equation" to non-zero cosmological constant. The only interaction vertices are cubic ones, found previously by Metsaev in a bottom-up lightcone approach. We point out a special feature of these vertices, which leads to "almost conservation" of energy at each successive order in perturbation theory, despite the time-dependent de Sitter background. Since we embed the lightcone variables into a full spacetime metric, the solutions have a clear geometric interpretation. In particular, this allows us to read off boundary data on both the past and future horizons of a causal (static) patch. In this way, we add self-dual GR to the program of defining &amp; computing scattering amplitudes in a causal patch of de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Weyl geometric effects on the propagation of light in gravitational fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the effects of Weyl geometry on the propagation of electromagnetic waves and on the gravitational spin Hall effect of light. It is usually assumed that in vacuum the electromagnetic waves propagate along null geodesics, a result which follows from the geometrical optics approximation. However, this model is valid only in the limit of infinitely high frequencies. At large but finite frequencies, the ray dynamics is affected by the wave polarization. Therefore, the propagation of the electromagnetic waves can deviate from null geodesics, and this phenomenon is known as the gravitational spin Hall effect of light. On the other hand, Maxwell's equations have the remarkable property of conformal invariance. This property is a cornerstone of Weyl geometry and the corresponding gravitational theories. As a first step in our study, we obtain the polarization-dependent ray equations in Weyl geometry, describing the gravitational spin Hall effect of light in the presence of nonmetricity. As a specific example of the spin Hall effect of light in Weyl geometry, we consider the case of the simplest conformally invariant action, constructed from the square of the Weyl scalar, and the strength of the Weyl vector only. The action is linearized in the Weyl scalar by introducing an auxiliary scalar field. In static spherical symmetry, this theory admits an exact black hole solution, which generalizes the standard Schwarzschild solution through the presence of two new terms in the metric, having a linear and a quadratic dependence on the radial coordinate. We numerically study the polarization-dependent propagation of light rays in this exact Weyl geometric metric, and the effects of the presence of the Weyl vector on the magnitude of the spin Hall effect are estimated.</description>

      <title>Influences of tilted thin accretion disks on the observational appearance of hairy black holes in Horndeski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on the observational appearance of black holes, both in general relativity and modified gravity, has been in full swing since the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration announced photos of M87$^{*}$ and Sagittarius A$^{*}$. Nevertheless, limited attention has been given to the impact of tilted accretion disks on black hole images. This paper investigates the $230$ GHz images of non-rotating hairy black holes illuminated by tilted, thin accretion disks in Horndeski gravity with the aid of a ray tracing method. The results indicate that reducing the scalar hair parameter effectively diminishes image luminosity and extends both the critical curve and the inner shadow. This trend facilitates the differentiation between hairy black holes and Schwarzschild black holes, especially in certain parameter spaces where the current Event Horizon Telescope array is capable of capturing such variations. Furthermore, we observe that the inclination of the tilted accretion disk can mimic the observation angle, consequently affecting image brightness and the morphology of the inner shadow. In specific parameter spaces, alterations in the tilt or position of the accretion disk can lead to a drift in the light spot within the images of hairy black holes. This finding may establish a potential correlation between the precession of the tilted accretion disk and image features. Additionally, through an examination of images depicting hairy black holes surrounded by two thin accretion disks, we report the obscuring effect of the accretion environment on the inner shadow of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Galilean and Carrollian limits of gravitational theories and application to higher derivative gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the seemingly different methods used to derive non-Lorentzian (Galilean and Carrollian) gravitational theories from Lorentzian ones are equivalent. Specifically, the pre-nonrelativistic and the pre-ultralocal parametrizations can be constructed from the gauging of the Galilei and Carroll algebras, respectively. Also, the pre-ultralocal approach of taking the Carrollian limit is equivalent to performing the ADM decomposition and then setting the signature of the Lorentzian manifold to zero. We use this uniqueness to write a generic expansion for the curvature tensors and construct Galilean and Carrollian limits of all metric theories of gravity of finite order ranging from the $f(R)$ gravity to a completely generic higher derivative theory, the $f(g_{\mu\nu},R_{\mu\nu\sigma \rho},\nabla_{\mu})$ gravity. We present an algorithm for calculation of the $n$-th order of the Galilean and Carrollian expansions that transforms this problem into a constrained optimization problem. We also derive the condition under which a gravitational theory becomes a modification of general relativity in both limits simultaneously.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the optical properties of the black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar (EMS) theory. We evaluate the shadow cast by the black hole and obtain analytical solutions for both the radius of the photon sphere and the shadow radius. We observe that the black hole parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$ both influence the shadow of black hole. It is shown that the photon sphere and the shadow radius increase as a consequence of the presence of parameter $\gamma$. Interestingly, we show that shadow radius decreases first and then remains unchanged due to the impact of parameter $\beta$. Finally, we consider the weak gravitational lensing and the total magnification of lensed images around black hole. We find that the black hole charge and parameter $\beta$ both give rise to a significant effect, reducing the deflection angle. Similarly, the same behaviour for the total magnification is observed due to the effect of black hole charge and parameter $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Constraining parametric deviations from the Kerr spacetime using black hole ringdowns of GW150914 and GW190521</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ringdown phase of a binary black hole merger is modelled by the quasi-normal modes of a perturbed Kerr black hole. According to the black hole no-hair theorem, the emitted ringdown spectra are constrained by the mass and spin of the remnant black hole and thus offer an excellent test of the Kerr-nature of black holes. As a parameterization of beyond-Kerr effects, we employ the Johannsen-Psaltis metric ansatz. We analyze the ringdown of two binary black hole merger events- GW150914 and GW190521 to constrain the deviation from Kerr. We find that both events are consistent with the Kerr metric and due to the larger signal-to-noise ratio and the presence of the additional subdominant mode in the ringdown phase, we find a factor of ~2 improvement in constraints on the deviation parameter in the case of GW190521 as compared to GW150914. Moreover, we find that the deviation parameter is anti-correlated to the spin of the remnant black hole. We also explore the effect of priors for other physical parameters on the Kerr deviation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing of massive particles by a black-bounce-Schwarzschild black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate in detail the weak-field gravitational lensing of a relativistic neutral massive particle induced by a regular black-bounce-Schwarzschild black hole proposed by Simpson and Visser. Starting with the calculation of the gravitational deflection of the massive particle up to the third post-Minkowskian order, the Virbhadra-Ellis lens equation is solved perturbatively beyond the weak-deflection limit to achieve the expressions for the lensing observables of the primary and secondary images of a point-like particle source. The main observables contain not only the positions, the flux magnifications, and the gravitational time delays of the individual images, but also the positional relations, the magnification relations (including the total magnification), the magnification centroid, and the differential time delay. We then discuss the velocity-induced effects originated from the deviation of the particle's initial velocity from the speed of light on the black-bounce-Schwarzschild lensing observables of the images of a point-like light source, and the effects induced by the bounce parameter of the spacetime on the measurable image properties of Schwarzschild lensing of the massive particle. As an application of the results, we model the supermassive black hole in the Galactic Center (i.e., Sgr A$^{\ast}$) as the lens, and focus on evaluating the possibilities to detect the new velocity-induced and bounce-induced effects on the practical lensing observables and analyzing the dependence of these effects on the parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector falling radially into a four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole, coupled linearly to a massless scalar field that has been prepared in the Hartle-Hawking or Unruh state, has recently been shown to exhibit a local extremum in its transition probability near the black hole horizon [K.K. Ng et al., New J. Phys. 24 (2022) 103018]. We show that a similar phenomenon is present in the transition rate of a UDW detector falling radially into a spinless Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole, with the scalar field prepared in the Hartle-Hawking state. We give extensive numerical results as a function of the detector's energy gap, the black hole's mass, and the detector's drop-off radius. Our results suggest that the effect is robust, motivating a search for a similar effect in other black hole spacetimes, and calling for an explanation of the physical origin of the effect.</description>

      <title>Workshop on the limiting compactness objects: Black holes and Buchdahl stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The workshop was organized at IUCAA on Oct 30 - Nov 3, 2023 as a compact discussion and discourse meeting with a threadbare exposition and discussion of the various aspects and the questions arising. It was occasioned by the visit of Professor Hakan Andreasson of the Gothenburg Technical University, Sweden. He has been exploring with his collaborators the Einstein - Vlasov system for over a decade and a half as a possible matter source for compact objects. This system characterizes itself by free particles in motion and interacting only through gravity. For a limiting compactness, this may be the most appropriate state. The main thrust of the workshop was to understand this new object, Buchdahl Star (BS), of limiting compactness without a horizon. It is almost as compact as a black hole (BH) and yet has no horizon and hence is open for interaction with the outside world. Ever since the proposal of the membrane paradigm envisaging a timelike fiducial surface near BH horizon, BS offers an excellent possibility of the existence of such a real astrophysical object. It could very well compete with BH as a mimicker for various physical and astrophysical phenomena. Thus, it opens up a new vista of study and investigation of all the questions that one asks for BH, for this new creature, BS. The workshop was intended to identify certain interesting questions as well as the people interested in studying them. On this count, the workshop has been a huge success as several interesting questions have been identified, a few groups have been formed to take up different problems, and the work has already started. Nothing more could one have asked from such an exercise. A brief summary of some of the talks is included, followed by a brief discussion of the projects identified as a result of the discussions during the workshop.</description>

      <title>Conformal structure of singularities in some varying fundamental constants bimetric cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the conformal structure of singularities arising from varying fundamental constants using the method of Penrose diagrams. We employ a specific type of bimetric model featuring two different metrics. One metric describes the causal structure for matter, while the other characterizes the causal structure for gravitational interactions, which is related to variations in fundamental constants such as the gravitational constant and the speed of light. For this reason, we focused on the gravitational metric to calculate the conformal transformation and compose Penrose diagrams for the singularities arising from the varying fundamental constants. We have shown that, in one case, the parameter such as the scale factor, the density and the pressure resemble those of the finite scale factor singularity (FSF). Despite singularity appears in constant conformal time in our case and in the case of FSF the Misner-Sharp horizon looks different. Our another case is similar to sudden future singularity (SFS), but there are differences in the conformal structures. We have also shown that in our cases the behavior of Misner-Sharp horizon strongly depends on initial conditions. The last analytical solution which we introduced is identical to conformal structure of the standard exotic singularity for the matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, ultracompact objects have been found to be susceptible to a new nonlinear instability, known as the light-ring instability, triggered by stable light rings. This discovery raises concerns about the viability of these objects as alternatives to black holes. In this work, we investigate the presence of the light-ring instability in scalarized Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, which have been previously shown to admit stable light rings. We employ fully nonlinear numerical evolutions of both scalarized black holes with and without stable light rings, perturbing them initially with spherically symmetric scalar perturbations. Our simulations demonstrate the long-term stability of these scalarized black holes, suggesting that the presence of a stable light ring may not necessarily induce the light-ring instability.</description>

      <title>MHV amplitudes and BCFW recursion for Yang-Mills theory in the de Sitter static patch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.07572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the scattering problem in the static patch of de Sitter space, i.e. the problem of field evolution between the past and future horizons of a de Sitter observer. We formulate the problem in terms of off-shell fields in Poincare coordinates. This is especially convenient for conformal theories, where the static patch can be viewed as a flat causal diamond, with one tip at the origin and the other at timelike infinity. As an important example, we consider Yang-Mills theory at tree level. We find that static-patch scattering for Yang-Mills is subject to BCFW-like recursion relations. These can reduce any static-patch amplitude to one with N^{-1}MHV helicity structure, dressed by ordinary Minkowski amplitudes. We derive all the N^{-1}MHV static-patch amplitudes from self-dual Yang-Mills field solutions. Using the recursion relations, we then derive from these an infinite set of MHV amplitudes, with arbitrary number of external legs.</description>

Abstract: We study entanglement negativity for evaporating black hole based on the holographic model with defect brane. We introduce a defect extremal surface formula for entanglement negativity. Based on partial reduction, we show the equivalence between defect extremal surface formula and island formula for entanglement negativity in AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$. Extending the study to the model of eternal black hole plus CFT bath, we find that black hole-black hole negativity decreases until vanishing, left black hole-left radiation negativity is always a constant, radiation-radiation negativity increases and then saturates at a time later than Page time. In all the time dependent cases, defect extremal surface formula agrees with island formula.</description>

      <title>Using Pulsar Parameter Drifts to Detect Sub-Nanohertz Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves with frequencies below 1~nHz are notoriously difficult to detect. With periods exceeding current experimental lifetimes, they induce slow drifts in observables rather than periodic correlations. Observables with well-known intrinsic contributions provide a means to probe this regime. In this work, we demonstrate the viability of using observed pulsar timing parameters to discover such "ultralow" frequency gravitational waves, presenting two complementary observables for which the systematic shift induced by ultralow-frequency gravitational waves can be extracted. Using existing data for these parameters, we search the ultralow frequency regime for continuous-wave signals, finding a sensitivity near the expected prediction from inspirals of supermassive black holes. We do not see an excess in the data, setting a limit on the strain of $ 1.3 \times 10 ^{ - 12} $ at $ 450~{\rm pHz} $ with a sensitivity dropping approximately quadratically with frequency until $ 10~{\rm pHz}$. Our search method opens a new frequency range for gravitational wave detection and has profound implications for astrophysics, cosmology, and particle physics.</description>

      <title>Action, entropy and pair creation rate of charged black holes in de Sitter space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute and clarify the interpretation of the on-shell Euclidean action for Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes in de Sitter space. We show the on-shell action is minus the sum of the black hole and cosmological horizon entropy for arbitrary mass and charge in any number of dimensions. This unifying expression helps to clear up a confusion about the Euclidean actions of extremal and ultracold black holes in de Sitter, as they can be understood as special cases of the general expression. We then use this result to estimate the probability for the pair creation of black holes with arbitrary mass and charge in an empty de Sitter background, by employing the formalism of constrained instantons. Finally, we suggest that the decay of charged de Sitter black holes is governed by the gradient flow of the entropy function and that, as a consequence, the regime of light, superradiant, rapid charge emission should describe the potential decay of extreme charged Nariai black holes to singular geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we determine the consequences of the quantum entanglement of a system of two identical particles when the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) is considered. GUP is usually associated with the existence of a minimal length. We focus on the main formulations of the GUP and then we determine the minimal uncertainties in position induced by those modified GUP's. Our results point out that the minimal uncertainty is reduced by half of its usual value independently of the GUP employed. This implies that the minimal length is also reduced by half. On the other hand, it is generally expected that the minimal length must not depend on physical system. We overcome this apparent paradox by realizing that the entangled system is composed by two particles so that an effective parameter related to the minimal length must be employed.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIa. Eigenmodes, correlation matrices, and detectability of orientable Euclidean manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If the Universe has non-trivial spatial topology, observables depend on both the parameters of the spatial manifold and the position and orientation of the observer. In infinite Euclidean space, most cosmological observables arise from the amplitudes of Fourier modes of primordial scalar curvature perturbations. Topological boundary conditions replace the full set of Fourier modes with specific linear combinations of selected Fourier modes as the eigenmodes of the scalar Laplacian. We present formulas for eigenmodes in orientable Euclidean manifolds with the topologies $E_{1}$ - $E_{6}$, $E_{11}$, $E_{12}$, $E_{16}$, and $E_{18}$ that encompass the full range of manifold parameters and observer positions, generalizing previous treatments. Under the assumption that the amplitudes of primordial scalar curvature eigenmodes are independent random variables, for each topology we obtain the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes (of scalar fields linearly related to the scalar curvature) and the correlation matrices of spherical-harmonic coefficients of such fields sampled on a sphere, such as the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We evaluate the detectability of these correlations given the cosmic variance of the observed CMB sky. We find that topologies where the distance to our nearest clone is less than about 1.2 times the diameter of the last scattering surface of the CMB give a correlation signal that is larger than cosmic variance noise in the CMB. This implies that if cosmic topology is the explanation of large-angle anomalies in the CMB, then the distance to our nearest clone is not much larger than the diameter of the last scattering surface. We argue that the topological information is likely to be better preserved in three-dimensional data, such as will eventually be available from large-scale structure surveys.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background in LISA from Unresolved White Dwarf Binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect a wide variety of gravitational wave sources in the mHz band. Some of these signals will elude individual detection, instead contributing as confusion noise to one of several stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWBs) -- notably including the `Galactic foreground', a loud signal resulting from the superposition of millions of unresolved double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) in the Milky Way. It is possible that similar, weaker SGWBs will be detectable from other DWD populations in the local universe, including the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We use the Bayesian LISA Inference Package ($\tt{BLIP}$) to investigate the possibility of an anisotropic SGWB generated by unresolved DWDs in the LMC. To do so, we compute the LMC SGWB from a realistic DWD population generated via binary population synthesis, simulate four years of time-domain data with $\tt{BLIP}$ comprised of stochastic contributions from the LMC SGWB and the LISA detector noise, and analyze this data with $\tt{BLIP}$'s spherical harmonic anisotropic SGWB search. We also consider the case of spectral separation from the Galactic foreground. We present the results of these analyses and show, for the first time, that the unresolved DWDs in the LMC will comprise a significant SGWB for LISA.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on interactions between dark energy and dark matter with momentum and energy transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We place observational constraints on a dark energy (DE) model in which a quintessence scalar field $\phi$ is coupled to dark matter (DM) through momentum and energy exchanges.The momentum transfer is weighed by an interaction between the field derivative and DM four velocity with a coupling constant $\beta$, whereas the energy exchange is characterized by an exponential scalar-field coupling to the DM density with a coupling constant $Q$. A positive coupling $\beta$ leads to the suppression for the growth of DM density perturbations at low redshifts, whose property offers a possibility for resolving the $\sigma_8$ tension problem. A negative coupling $Q$ gives rise to a $\phi$-matter-dominated epoch, whose presence can reduce the sound horizon around the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) decoupling epoch. Using the data of Planck 2018, 12-th Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Phantheon supernovae samples, and 1-year dark energy survey, we find that the two couplings are constrained to be $\beta=0.332^{+1.246}_{-0.237}$ and $Q =-0.0312^{+0.0312}_{-0.0085}$ at 68\,\% confidence level (CL). Thus, there is an interesting observational signature of the momentum exchange ($\beta \neq 0$) between DE and DM, with a peak of the probability distribution of the energy transfer coupling at $Q&lt;0$.</description>

Abstract: Dipole charge conservation forces isolated charges to be immobile fractons. These couple naturally to spatial two-index symmetric tensor gauge fields that resemble a spatial metric. We propose a spacetime Lorentz covariant version of dipole symmetry and study the theory of the associated gauge fields. In the presence of a suitable background field, these contain a massive anti-symmetric and a massless symmetric two-index tensors. The latter transforms only under longitudinal diffeomorphisms, making the massless sector similar to linearized gravity, but with additional modes of lower spin. We show that the theory can be consistently coupled to a curved background metric and study its possible interaction terms with itself and with matter. In addition, we construct a map between solutions of linearized gravity in Kerr-Schild form and solutions of fracton gravity coupled to matter.</description>

      <title>Warped Conformal Symmetries of the Accelerating Kerr Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on the holographic descriptions of Kerr black holes indicate that the conformal or the warped conformal symmetries are responsible for the Kerr black hole physics at both background and perturbation levels. In the present paper, we extend the validity of these studies to the case of accelerating Kerr black hole. By invoking a set of non-trivial diffeomorphisms near the horizon bifurcation surface of the accelerating Kerr black hole, the Dirac brackets among charges of the diffeomorphisms form the symmetry algebra of a warped CFT which consists of one Virasoro and one Kac-Moody algebra with central extensions. This provides the evidence for warped CFTs being possible holographic dual to accelerating Kerr black holes. The thermal entropy formula of the warped CFT fixed by modular parameters and vacuum charges reproduces the entropy of the rotating black hole with acceleration.</description>

      <title>Consistency Condition for Slow-roll and Rapid-turn Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We summarize our work on a consistency condition for inflation in two-field cosmological models, in the regime of rapid turn and third-order slow roll. To ensure a sustained inflationary period of this type, one needs to satisfy a certain relation between the scalar potential and the scalar field-space metric. We explain the derivation of this condition. Furthermore, we argue that, generically, the rapid-turn phase tends to be short-lived.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmological Poisson equation in a model-independent way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how one can test the cosmological Poisson equation by requiring only the validity of three main assumptions: the energy-momentum conservation equations of matter, the equivalence principle, and the cosmological principle. We first point out that one can only measure the combination ${\mathcal M}\equiv \Omega_m^{(0)}\mu$, where $\mu$ quantifies the deviation of the Poisson equation from the standard one and $\Omega_m^{(0)}$ is the fraction of matter density at present. Then we employ a recent model-independent forecast for the growth rate $f(z)$ and the expansion rate $E(z)$ to obtain constraints on ${\mathcal M}$ for a survey that approximates a combination of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and Euclid. We conclude that a constant ${\mathcal M}$ can be measured with a relative error $\sigma_{\mathcal{M}}=4.5\%$, while if ${\mathcal M}$ is arbitrarily varying in redshift, it can be measured only to within $13.4\%$ (1 $\sigma$ c.l.) at redshift $z=0.9$, and 15-22\% up to $z=1.5$. We also project our constraints on some parametrizations of ${\mathcal M}$ proposed in literature, while still maintaining model-independence for the background expansion, the power spectrum shape, and the non-linear corrections. Generally speaking, as expected, we find much weaker model-independent constraints than found so far for such models. This means that the cosmological Poisson equation remains quite open to various alternative gravity and dark energy models.</description>

      <title>Bulk reconstruction using timelike entanglement in (A)dS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the entanglement entropies for spacelike subregions, and the associated modular Hamiltonians play a crucial role in the bulk reconstruction program within Anti de-Sitter (AdS) holography. Explicit examples of HKLL map exist mostly for the cases where the emergent bulk region is the so-called entanglement wedge of the given boundary subregion. However, motivated from the complex pseudo-entropy in Euclidean conformal field theories (CFT), one can talk about a `timelike entanglement' in Lorentzian CFTs dual to AdS spacetimes. One can then utilize this boundary timelike entanglement to define a boundary `timelike modular Hamiltonian'. We use constraints involving these Hamiltonians in a manner similar to how it was used for spacelike cases, and write down bulk operators in regions which are not probed by an RT surface corresponding to a single CFT. In the context of two dimensional CFT, we re-derive the HKLL formulas for free bulk scalar fields in three examples: in AdS Poincar\'{e} patch, inside and outside of the AdS black hole, and for de Sitter flat slicings. In this method, one no longer requires the knowledge of bulk dynamics for sub-horizon holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we demonstrate how black hole quasi-normal modes can emerge from a Dirichlet brickwall model normal modes. We consider a probe scalar field in a BTZ geometry with a Dirichlet brickwall and demonstrate that as the wall approaches the event horizon, the corresponding poles in the retarded correlator become dense and yield an effective branch-cut. The associated discontinuity of the correlator carries the information of the black hole quasi-normal modes. We further demonstrate that a non-vanishing angular momentum non-perturbatively enhances the pole-condensing. We hypothesize that it is also related to quantum chaotic features of the corresponding spectral form factor, which has been observed earlier. Finally, we discuss the underlying algebraic justification of this approximate thermalization in terms of the trace of the algebra.</description>

      <title>Observables from classical black hole scattering in Scalar-Tensor theory of gravity from worldline quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we compute the two observables, impulse and waveform, in a black hole scattering event for the Scalar-Tensor theory of gravity with a generic scalar potential using the techniques of Worldline Quantum Field Theory. We mainly investigate the corrections to the above mentioned observables due to the extra scalar degree of freedom. For the computation of impulse, we consider the most general scenario by making the scalar field massive and then show that each computed diagram has a smooth massless limit. We compute the waveform for scalar and graviton up to 2PM, taking the scalar as massless. Furthermore, we discuss if the scalar has mass and how the radiation integrals get more involved than the massless case. We also arrive at some analytical results using stationary phase approximation. Interestingly, we also show that the $\lambda_4 \varphi^4$ interaction vertex does not contribute to the radiation by showing that the integral has no non-zero finite value.</description>

      <title>A Spinorial proof of the positivity of Quasi-Local mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13909v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide spinor-based proof of the positivity of the Wang-Yau \cite{yau} quasi-local mass. More precisely we prove under an appropriate spin assumption that the gravitational mass bounded by a spacelike topological $2-$sphere is non-negative in a generic spacetime verifying dominant energy condition and vanishes only if the surface is embedded in the Minkowski space. This proof is purely quasi-local in nature and in particular does not rely on Bartanik's gluing and asymptotic extension construction \cite{bartnik1993quasi} and subsequent application of the Schoen-Yau \cite{schoen1979proof,schoen1981proof} positive mass theorem.</description>

      <title>Particle spectra of general Ricci-type Palatini or metric-affine theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of weak-field metric-affine (i.e. Palatini) gravity near Minkowski spacetime, we compute the particle spectra in the simultaneous presence of all independent contractions quadratic in Ricci-type tensors. Apart from the full metric-affine geometry, we study kinematic limits with vanishing torsion (i.e. a symmetric connection) and vanishing non-metricity (i.e. a metric connection, which is physically indistinguishable from Poincar\'e gauge theory at the level of the particle spectrum). We present a detailed report on how spin-parity projection operators can be used to derive systematically and unambiguously the character of the propagating states. The unitarity constraints derived from the requirements of tachyon- and ghost-freedom are obtained. We show that, even in the presence of all Ricci-type operators, only a narrow selection of viable theories emerges by a tuning.</description>

      <title>Neural Simulation-Based Inference of the Neutron Star Equation of State directly from Telescope Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a unique opportunity to study strongly interacting matter under extreme density conditions. The intricacies of matter inside neutron stars and their equation of state are not directly visible, but determine bulk properties, such as mass and radius, which affect the star's thermal X-ray emissions. However, the telescope spectra of these emissions are also affected by the stellar distance, hydrogen column, and effective surface temperature, which are not always well-constrained. Uncertainties on these nuisance parameters must be accounted for when making a robust estimation of the equation of state. In this study, we develop a novel methodology that, for the first time, can infer the full posterior distribution of both the equation of state and nuisance parameters directly from telescope observations. This method relies on the use of neural likelihood estimation, in which normalizing flows use samples of simulated telescope data to learn the likelihood of the neutron star spectra as a function of these parameters, coupled with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to efficiently sample from the corresponding posterior distribution. Our approach surpasses the accuracy of previous methods, improves the interpretability of the results by providing access to the full posterior distribution, and naturally scales to a growing number of neutron star observations expected in the coming years.</description>

      <title>An analytical approximation of the evolution of the primordial curvature perturbation in the ultraslow-roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation can enter an ultraslow-roll (USR) stage, if there is a plateau on the inflaton potential. During this stage, the primordial curvature perturbation ${\mathcal R}_k$ and its power spectrum ${\mathcal P}_{\mathcal R}$ can be remarkably enhanced on small scales. In this work, an analytical approximation is provided to systematically study the evolution of ${\mathcal R}_k$ in the USR inflation. We first discuss the asymptotic solutions of the moduli and arguments of ${\mathcal R}_k$ and its time derivative ${\mathcal R}_{k,N}$ on the sub- and super-horizon scales separately and find that all these solutions have simple exponential forms. Then, ${\mathcal R}_k$ on five typical scales are investigated in order. Our analytical approximation predicts that ${\mathcal R}_k$ first revolves around the origin in the complex plane, but if it crosses the horizon around the start of the USR stage, there appears a subsequent linear evolution towards or away from the origin. This behavior naturally explains the shape of ${\mathcal P}_{\mathcal R}$ from the sharp dip to the peak and matches the numerical results perfectly. Moreover, the minimum of ${\mathcal P}_{\mathcal R}$ is exactly proved to be nonvanishing. Our analytical approximation will help the model building in primordial black hole and gravitational wave physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The EHT has captured a series of images of black holes. These images could provide valuable information about the gravitational environment near the event horizon. However, accurate detection and parameter estimation for candidate black holes are necessary. This paper explores the potential for identifying black holes in the ultraviolet band using space telescopes. We establish a data pipeline for generating simulated observations and present an ensemble neural network model for black hole detection and parameter estimation. The model achieves mean average precision [0.5] values of 0.9176 even when reaching the imaging FWHM ($\theta_c$) and maintains the detection ability until $0.54\theta_c$. The parameter estimation is also accurate. These results indicate that our methodology enables super-resolution recognition. Moreover, the model successfully detects the shadow of M87* from background noise and other celestial bodies and estimates its inclination and positional angle. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of detecting black holes in the ultraviolet band and provides a new method for black hole detection and further parameter estimation.</description>
