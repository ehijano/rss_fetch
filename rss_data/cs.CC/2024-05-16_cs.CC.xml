      <title>Hilbert Functions and Low-Degree Randomness Extractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $S\subseteq \mathbb{F}^n$, consider the linear space of restrictions of degree-$d$ polynomials to $S$. The Hilbert function of $S$, denoted $\mathrm{h}_S(d,\mathbb{F})$, is the dimension of this space. We obtain a tight lower bound on the smallest value of the Hilbert function of subsets $S$ of arbitrary finite grids in $\mathbb{F}^n$ with a fixed size $|S|$. We achieve this by proving that this value coincides with a combinatorial quantity, namely the smallest number of low Hamming weight points in a down-closed set of size $|S|$.
  Understanding the smallest values of Hilbert functions is closely related to the study of degree-$d$ closure of sets, a notion introduced by Nie and Wang (Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A, 2015). We use bounds on the Hilbert function to obtain a tight bound on the size of degree-$d$ closures of subsets of $\mathbb{F}_q^n$, which answers a question posed by Doron, Ta-Shma, and Tell (Computational Complexity, 2022).
  We use the bounds on the Hilbert function and degree-$d$ closure of sets to prove that a random low-degree polynomial is an extractor for samplable randomness sources. Most notably, we prove the existence of low-degree extractors and dispersers for sources generated by constant-degree polynomials and polynomial-size circuits. Until recently, even the existence of arbitrary deterministic extractors for such sources was not known.</description>

      <title>Low-Degree Polynomials Are Good Extractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that random low-degree polynomials (over $\mathbb{F}_2$) are unbiased, in an extremely general sense. That is, we show that random low-degree polynomials are good randomness extractors for a wide class of distributions. Prior to our work, such results were only known for the small families of (1) uniform sources, (2) affine sources, and (3) local sources. We significantly generalize these results, and prove the following.
  1. Low-degree polynomials extract from small families. We show that a random low-degree polynomial is a good low-error extractor for any small family of sources. In particular, we improve the positive result of Alrabiah, Chattopadhyay, Goodman, Li, and Ribeiro (ICALP 2022) for local sources, and give new results for polynomial sources and variety sources via a single unified approach.
  2. Low-degree polynomials extract from sumset sources. We show that a random low-degree polynomial is a good extractor for sumset sources, which are the most general large family of sources (capturing independent sources, interleaved sources, small-space sources, and more). This extractor achieves polynomially small error, and its min-entropy requirement is tight up to a square.
  Our results on sumset extractors imply new complexity separations for linear ROBPs, and the tools that go into its proof have further applications, as well. The two main tools we use are a new structural result on sumset-punctured Reed-Muller codes, paired with a novel type of reduction between randomness extractors. Using the first new tool, we strengthen and generalize the extractor impossibility results of Chattopadhyay, Goodman, and Gurumukhani (ITCS 2024). Using the second, we show the existence of sumset extractors for min-entropy $k=O(\log(n/\varepsilon))$, resolving an open problem of Chattopadhyay and Liao (STOC 2022).</description>

      <title>Rounding Large Independent Sets on Expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach for approximating large independent sets when the input graph is a one-sided spectral expander - that is, the uniform random walk matrix of the graph has the second eigenvalue bounded away from 1. Consequently, we obtain a polynomial time algorithm to find linear-sized independent sets in one-sided expanders that are almost $3$-colorable or are promised to contain an independent set of size $(1/2-\epsilon)n$. Our second result above can be refined to require only a weaker vertex expansion property with an efficient certificate. Somewhat surprisingly, we observe that the analogous task of finding a linear-sized independent set in almost $4$-colorable one-sided expanders (even when the second eigenvalue is $o_n(1)$) is NP-hard, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture.
  All prior algorithms that beat the worst-case guarantees for this problem rely on bottom eigenspace enumeration techniques (following the classical spectral methods of Alon and Kahale) and require two-sided expansion, meaning a bounded number of negative eigenvalues of magnitude $\Omega(1)$. Such techniques naturally extend to almost $k$-colorable graphs for any constant $k$, in contrast to analogous guarantees on one-sided expanders, which are Unique Games-hard to achieve for $k \geq 4$.
  Our rounding builds on the method of simulating multiple samples from a pseudodistribution introduced by Barak et. al. for rounding Unique Games instances. The key to our analysis is a new clustering property of large independent sets in expanding graphs - every large independent set has a larger-than-expected intersection with some member of a small list - and its formalization in the low-degree sum-of-squares proof system.</description>
