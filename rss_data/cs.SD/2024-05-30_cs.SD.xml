      <title>SoundCTM: Uniting Score-based and Consistency Models for Text-to-Sound Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound content is an indispensable element for multimedia works such as video games, music, and films. Recent high-quality diffusion-based sound generation models can serve as valuable tools for the creators. However, despite producing high-quality sounds, these models often suffer from slow inference speeds. This drawback burdens creators, who typically refine their sounds through trial and error to align them with their artistic intentions. To address this issue, we introduce Sound Consistency Trajectory Models (SoundCTM). Our model enables flexible transitioning between high-quality 1-step sound generation and superior sound quality through multi-step generation. This allows creators to initially control sounds with 1-step samples before refining them through multi-step generation. While CTM fundamentally achieves flexible 1-step and multi-step generation, its impressive performance heavily depends on an additional pretrained feature extractor and an adversarial loss, which are expensive to train and not always available in other domains. Thus, we reframe CTM's training framework and introduce a novel feature distance by utilizing the teacher's network for a distillation loss. Additionally, while distilling classifier-free guided trajectories, we train conditional and unconditional student models simultaneously and interpolate between these models during inference. We also propose training-free controllable frameworks for SoundCTM, leveraging its flexible sampling capability. SoundCTM achieves both promising 1-step and multi-step real-time sound generation without using any extra off-the-shelf networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate SoundCTM's capability of controllable sound generation in a training-free manner.</description>

      <title>Reverse the auditory processing pathway: Coarse-to-fine audio reconstruction from fMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from the hierarchical processing of the human auditory system, which transforms sound from low-level acoustic features to high-level semantic understanding, we introduce a novel coarse-to-fine audio reconstruction method. Leveraging non-invasive functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data, our approach mimics the inverse pathway of auditory processing. Initially, we utilize CLAP to decode fMRI data coarsely into a low-dimensional semantic space, followed by a fine-grained decoding into the high-dimensional AudioMAE latent space guided by semantic features. These fine-grained neural features serve as conditions for audio reconstruction through a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Validation on three public fMRI datasets-Brain2Sound, Brain2Music, and Brain2Speech-underscores the superiority of our coarse-to-fine decoding method over stand-alone fine-grained approaches, showcasing state-of-the-art performance in metrics like FD, FAD, and KL. Moreover, by employing semantic prompts during decoding, we enhance the quality of reconstructed audio when semantic features are suboptimal. The demonstrated versatility of our model across diverse stimuli highlights its potential as a universal brain-to-audio framework. This research contributes to the comprehension of the human auditory system, pushing boundaries in neural decoding and audio reconstruction methodologies.</description>

      <title>Improving Speech Decoding from ECoG with Self-Supervised Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work on intracranial brain-machine interfaces has demonstrated that spoken speech can be decoded with high accuracy, essentially by treating the problem as an instance of supervised learning and training deep neural networks to map from neural activity to text. However, such networks pay for their expressiveness with very large numbers of labeled data, a requirement that is particularly burdensome for invasive neural recordings acquired from human patients. On the other hand, these patients typically produce speech outside of the experimental blocks used for training decoders. Making use of such data, and data from other patients, to improve decoding would ease the burden of data collection -- especially onerous for dys- and anarthric patients. Here we demonstrate that this is possible, by reengineering wav2vec -- a simple, self-supervised, fully convolutional model that learns latent representations of audio using a noise-contrastive loss -- for electrocorticographic (ECoG) data. We train this model on unlabelled ECoG recordings, and subsequently use it to transform ECoG from labeled speech sessions into wav2vec's representation space, before finally training a supervised encoder-decoder to map these representations to text. We experiment with various numbers of labeled blocks; for almost all choices, the new representations yield superior decoding performance to the original ECoG data, and in no cases do they yield worse. Performance can also be improved in some cases by pretraining wav2vec on another patient's data. In the best cases, wav2vec's representations decrease word error rates over the original data by upwards of 50%.</description>

      <title>BLSP-KD: Bootstrapping Language-Speech Pre-training via Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent end-to-end approaches have shown promise in extending large language models (LLMs) to speech inputs, but face limitations in directly assessing and optimizing alignment quality and fail to achieve fine-grained alignment due to speech-text length mismatch. We introduce BLSP-KD, a novel approach for Bootstrapping Language-Speech Pretraining via Knowledge Distillation, which addresses these limitations through two key techniques. First, it optimizes speech-text alignment by minimizing the divergence between the LLM's next-token prediction distributions for speech and text inputs using knowledge distillation. Second, it employs a continuous-integrate-andfire strategy to segment speech into tokens that correspond one-to-one with text tokens, enabling fine-grained alignment. We also introduce Partial LoRA (PLoRA), a new adaptation method supporting LLM finetuning for speech inputs under knowledge distillation. Quantitative evaluation shows that BLSP-KD outperforms previous end-to-end baselines and cascaded systems with comparable scale of parameters, facilitating general instruction-following capabilities for LLMs with speech inputs. This approach provides new possibilities for extending LLMs to spoken language interactions.</description>

      <title>Vocos: Closing the gap between time-domain and Fourier-based neural vocoders for high-quality audio synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in neural vocoding are predominantly driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) operating in the time-domain. While effective, this approach neglects the inductive bias offered by time-frequency representations, resulting in reduntant and computionally-intensive upsampling operations. Fourier-based time-frequency representation is an appealing alternative, aligning more accurately with human auditory perception, and benefitting from well-established fast algorithms for its computation. Nevertheless, direct reconstruction of complex-valued spectrograms has been historically problematic, primarily due to phase recovery issues. This study seeks to close this gap by presenting Vocos, a new model that directly generates Fourier spectral coefficients. Vocos not only matches the state-of-the-art in audio quality, as demonstrated in our evaluations, but it also substantially improves computational efficiency, achieving an order of magnitude increase in speed compared to prevailing time-domain neural vocoding approaches. The source code and model weights have been open-sourced at https://github.com/gemelo-ai/vocos.</description>

      <title>TF-SepNet: An Efficient 1D Kernel Design in CNNs for Low-Complexity Acoustic Scene Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08200v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies focus on developing efficient systems for acoustic scene classification (ASC) using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which typically consist of consecutive kernels. This paper highlights the benefits of using separate kernels as a more powerful and efficient design approach in ASC tasks. Inspired by the time-frequency nature of audio signals, we propose TF-SepNet, a CNN architecture that separates the feature processing along the time and frequency dimensions. Features resulted from the separate paths are then merged by channels and directly forwarded to the classifier. Instead of the conventional two dimensional (2D) kernel, TF-SepNet incorporates one dimensional (1D) kernels to reduce the computational costs. Experiments have been conducted using the TAU Urban Acoustic Scene 2022 Mobile development dataset. The results show that TF-SepNet outperforms similar state-of-the-arts that use consecutive kernels. A further investigation reveals that the separate kernels lead to a larger effective receptive field (ERF), which enables TF-SepNet to capture more time-frequency features.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Unsupervised and Text-Based Audio Editing Using DDPM Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10009v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Editing signals using large pre-trained models, in a zero-shot manner, has recently seen rapid advancements in the image domain. However, this wave has yet to reach the audio domain. In this paper, we explore two zero-shot editing techniques for audio signals, which use DDPM inversion with pre-trained diffusion models. The first, which we coin ZEro-shot Text-based Audio (ZETA) editing, is adopted from the image domain. The second, named ZEro-shot UnSupervized (ZEUS) editing, is a novel approach for discovering semantically meaningful editing directions without supervision. When applied to music signals, this method exposes a range of musically interesting modifications, from controlling the participation of specific instruments to improvisations on the melody. Samples and code can be found in https://hilamanor.github.io/AudioEditing/ .</description>

      <title>TRAMBA: A Hybrid Transformer and Mamba Architecture for Practical Audio and Bone Conduction Speech Super Resolution and Enhancement on Mobile and Wearable Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose TRAMBA, a hybrid transformer and Mamba architecture for acoustic and bone conduction speech enhancement, suitable for mobile and wearable platforms. Bone conduction speech enhancement has been impractical to adopt in mobile and wearable platforms for several reasons: (i) data collection is labor-intensive, resulting in scarcity; (ii) there exists a performance gap between state of-art models with memory footprints of hundreds of MBs and methods better suited for resource-constrained systems. To adapt TRAMBA to vibration-based sensing modalities, we pre-train TRAMBA with audio speech datasets that are widely available. Then, users fine-tune with a small amount of bone conduction data. TRAMBA outperforms state-of-art GANs by up to 7.3% in PESQ and 1.8% in STOI, with an order of magnitude smaller memory footprint and an inference speed up of up to 465 times. We integrate TRAMBA into real systems and show that TRAMBA (i) improves battery life of wearables by up to 160% by requiring less data sampling and transmission; (ii) generates higher quality voice in noisy environments than over-the-air speech; (iii) requires a memory footprint of less than 20.0 MB.</description>

      <title>Instruct-MusicGen: Unlocking Text-to-Music Editing for Music Language Models via Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music editing, which employ text queries to modify music (e.g.\ by changing its style or adjusting instrumental components), present unique challenges and opportunities for AI-assisted music creation. Previous approaches in this domain have been constrained by the necessity to train specific editing models from scratch, which is both resource-intensive and inefficient; other research uses large language models to predict edited music, resulting in imprecise audio reconstruction. To Combine the strengths and address these limitations, we introduce Instruct-MusicGen, a novel approach that finetunes a pretrained MusicGen model to efficiently follow editing instructions such as adding, removing, or separating stems. Our approach involves a modification of the original MusicGen architecture by incorporating a text fusion module and an audio fusion module, which allow the model to process instruction texts and audio inputs concurrently and yield the desired edited music. Remarkably, Instruct-MusicGen only introduces 8% new parameters to the original MusicGen model and only trains for 5K steps, yet it achieves superior performance across all tasks compared to existing baselines, and demonstrates performance comparable to the models trained for specific tasks. This advancement not only enhances the efficiency of text-to-music editing but also broadens the applicability of music language models in dynamic music production environments.</description>

      <title>CoVoMix: Advancing Zero-Shot Speech Generation for Human-like Multi-talker Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) modeling have led to significant strides in generating high-fidelity and diverse speech. However, dialogue generation, along with achieving human-like naturalness in speech, continues to be a challenge. In this paper, we introduce CoVoMix: Conversational Voice Mixture Generation, a novel model for zero-shot, human-like, multi-speaker, multi-round dialogue speech generation. CoVoMix first converts dialogue text into multiple streams of discrete tokens, with each token stream representing semantic information for individual talkers. These token streams are then fed into a flow-matching based acoustic model to generate mixed mel-spectrograms. Finally, the speech waveforms are produced using a HiFi-GAN model. Furthermore, we devise a comprehensive set of metrics for measuring the effectiveness of dialogue modeling and generation. Our experimental results show that CoVoMix can generate dialogues that are not only human-like in their naturalness and coherence but also involve multiple talkers engaging in multiple rounds of conversation. This is exemplified by instances generated in a single channel where one speaker's utterance is seamlessly mixed with another's interjections or laughter, indicating the latter's role as an attentive listener. Audio samples are available at https://aka.ms/covomix.</description>

      <title>Spiketrum: An FPGA-based Implementation of a Neuromorphic Cochlea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel FPGA-based neuromorphic cochlea, leveraging the general-purpose spike-coding algorithm, Spiketrum. The focus of this study is on the development and characterization of this cochlea model, which excels in transforming audio vibrations into biologically realistic auditory spike trains. These spike trains are designed to withstand neural fluctuations and spike losses while accurately encapsulating the spatial and precise temporal characteristics of audio, along with the intensity of incoming vibrations. Noteworthy features include the ability to generate real-time spike trains with minimal information loss and the capacity to reconstruct original signals. This fine-tuning capability allows users to optimize spike rates, achieving an optimal balance between output quality and power consumption. Furthermore, the integration of a feedback system into Spiketrum enables selective amplification of specific features while attenuating others, facilitating adaptive power consumption based on application requirements. The hardware implementation supports both spike-based and non-spike-based processors, making it versatile for various computing systems. The cochlea's ability to encode diverse sensory information, extending beyond sound waveforms, positions it as a promising sensory input for current and future spike-based intelligent computing systems, offering compact and real-time spike train generation.</description>
