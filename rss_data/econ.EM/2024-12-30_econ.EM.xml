      <title>Asymptotic Properties of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator for Markov-switching Observation-driven Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Markov-switching observation-driven model is a stochastic process $((S_t,Y_t))_{t \in \mathbb{Z}}$ where (i) $(S_t)_{t \in \mathbb{Z}}$ is an unobserved Markov process taking values in a finite set and (ii) $(Y_t)_{t \in \mathbb{Z}}$ is an observed process such that the conditional distribution of $Y_t$ given all past $Y$'s and the current and all past $S$'s depends only on all past $Y$'s and $S_t$. In this paper, we prove the consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator for such model. As a special case hereof, we give conditions under which the maximum likelihood estimator for the widely applied Markov-switching generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model introduced by Haas et al. (2004b) is consistent and asymptotic normal.</description>

      <title>Using Ordinal Voting to Compare the Utilitarian Welfare of a Status Quo and A Proposed Policy: A Simple Nonparametric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship of policy choice by majority voting and by maximization of utilitarian welfare has long been discussed. I consider choice between a status quo and a proposed policy when persons have interpersonally comparable cardinal utilities taking values in a bounded interval, voting is compulsory, and each person votes for a policy that maximizes utility. I show that knowledge of the attained status quo welfare and the voting outcome yields an informative bound on welfare with the proposed policy. The bound contains the value of status quo welfare, so the better utilitarian policy is not known. The minimax-regret decision and certain Bayes decisions choose the proposed policy if its vote share exceeds the known value of status quo welfare. This procedure differs from majority rule, which chooses the proposed policy if its vote share exceeds 1/2.</description>

      <title>Sentiment trading with large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in sentiment analysis of U.S. financial news and their potential in predicting stock market returns. We analyze a dataset comprising 965,375 news articles that span from January 1, 2010, to June 30, 2023; we focus on the performance of various LLMs, including BERT, OPT, FINBERT, and the traditional Loughran-McDonald dictionary model, which has been a dominant methodology in the finance literature. The study documents a significant association between LLM scores and subsequent daily stock returns. Specifically, OPT, which is a GPT-3 based LLM, shows the highest accuracy in sentiment prediction with an accuracy of 74.4%, slightly ahead of BERT (72.5%) and FINBERT (72.2%). In contrast, the Loughran-McDonald dictionary model demonstrates considerably lower effectiveness with only 50.1% accuracy. Regression analyses highlight a robust positive impact of OPT model scores on next-day stock returns, with coefficients of 0.274 and 0.254 in different model specifications. BERT and FINBERT also exhibit predictive relevance, though to a lesser extent. Notably, we do not observe a significant relationship between the Loughran-McDonald dictionary model scores and stock returns, challenging the efficacy of this traditional method in the current financial context. In portfolio performance, the long-short OPT strategy excels with a Sharpe ratio of 3.05, compared to 2.11 for BERT and 2.07 for FINBERT long-short strategies. Strategies based on the Loughran-McDonald dictionary yield the lowest Sharpe ratio of 1.23. Our findings emphasize the superior performance of advanced LLMs, especially OPT, in financial market prediction and portfolio management, marking a significant shift in the landscape of financial analysis tools with implications to financial regulation and policy analysis.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Identification of First-Price Auction with Unobserved Competition: A Density Discontinuity Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.05476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider nonparametric identification of independent private value first-price auction models, in which the analyst only observes winning bids. Our benchmark model assumes an exogenous number of bidders $N$. We show that, if the bidders observe $N$, the resulting discontinuities in the winning bid density can be used to identify the distribution of $N$. The private value distribution can be nonparametrically identified in a second step. This extends, under testable identification conditions, to the case where $N$ is a number of potential buyers, who bid with some unknown probability. Identification also holds in presence of additive unobserved heterogeneity drawn from some parametric distributions. A parametric Bayesian estimation procedure is proposed. An application to Shanghai Government IT procurements finds that the imposed three bidders participation rule is not effective. This generates loss in the range of as large as $10\%$ of the appraisal budget for small IT contracts.</description>

      <title>Treatment Effects with Multidimensional Unobserved Heterogeneity: Identification of the Marginal Treatment Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11444v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes sufficient conditions for the identification of the marginal treatment effects with multivalued treatments. Our model is based on a multinomial choice model with utility maximization. Our MTE generalizes the MTE defined in Heckman and Vytlacil (2005) in binary treatment models. As in the binary case, we can interpret the MTE as the treatment effect for persons who are indifferent between two treatments at a particular level. Our MTE enables one to obtain the treatment effects of those with specific preference orders over the choice set. Further, our results can identify other parameters such as the marginal distribution of potential outcomes.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric Inference for Regression-Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Treatment effects in regression discontinuity designs (RDDs) are often estimated using local regression methods. \cite{Hahn:01} demonstrated that the identification of the average treatment effect at the cutoff in RDDs relies on the unconfoundedness assumption and that, without this assumption, only the local average treatment effect at the cutoff can be identified. In this paper, we propose a semiparametric framework tailored for identifying the average treatment effect in RDDs, eliminating the need for the unconfoundedness assumption. Our approach globally conceptualizes the identification as a partially linear modeling problem, with the coefficient of a specified polynomial function of propensity score in the linear component capturing the average treatment effect. This identification result underpins our semiparametric inference for RDDs, employing the $P$-spline method to approximate the nonparametric function and establishing a procedure for conducting inference within this framework. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that our global approach achieves a faster convergence rate compared to the local method. Monte Carlo simulations further confirm that the proposed method consistently outperforms alternatives across various scenarios. Furthermore, applications to real-world datasets illustrate that our global approach can provide more reliable inference for practical problems.</description>
