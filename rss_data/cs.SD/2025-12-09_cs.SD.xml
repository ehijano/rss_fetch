      <title>DreamFoley: Scalable VLMs for High-Fidelity Video-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have achieved remarkable improvements in visual content fidelity. However, the absence of synchronized audio severely undermines immersive experience and restricts practical applications of these technologies. To address this challenge, several pioneering works have explored diffusion transformer architectures for generating plausible video-synchronized audio, including Kling-foley, HunyuanVideo-foley and Thinksound. Distinct from existing works, we introduce an autoregressive audio generation architecture (DreamFoley) that harnesses the capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) to jointly model sequential interactions among video, audio, and text modalities. Our approach features a dual-visual encoder module that effectively captures both audio-aligned and text-aligned visual features. Additionally, we employ a Residual Vector Quantization audio tokenizer with a delay-pattern generation scheme to balance the trade-off between training efficiency and audio quality. Moreover, we introduce the classifier-free guidance strategy into VLMs to bootstrap generated audio quality. Furthermore, we establish an efficient data production pipeline to scale audio-video-text triple collection. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our model, achieving promising performance across popular benchmarks. We hope that the findings in this study provide a strong foundation for future video-to-audio generation research. We also release the previously missing audio-visual textual descriptions from the public benchmark, aiming to facilitate subsequent researchers in conducting more convenient and effective evaluations and comparisons.</description>

      <title>Physics-Guided Deepfake Detection for Voice Authentication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voice authentication systems deployed at the network edge face dual threats: a) sophisticated deepfake synthesis attacks and b) control-plane poisoning in distributed federated learning protocols. We present a framework coupling physics-guided deepfake detection with uncertainty-aware in edge learning. The framework fuses interpretable physics features modeling vocal tract dynamics with representations coming from a self-supervised learning module. The representations are then processed via a Multi-Modal Ensemble Architecture, followed by a Bayesian ensemble providing uncertainty estimates. Incorporating physics-based characteristics evaluations and uncertainty estimates of audio samples allows our proposed framework to remain robust to both advanced deepfake attacks and sophisticated control-plane poisoning, addressing the complete threat model for networked voice authentication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents our work for the ICASSP 2026 Environmental Sound Deepfake Detection (ESDD) Challenge. The challenge is based on the large-scale EnvSDD dataset that consists of various synthetic environmental sounds. We focus on addressing the complexities of unseen generators and low-resource black-box scenarios by proposing an audio-text cross-attention model. Experiments with individual and combined text-audio models demonstrate competitive EER improvements over the challenge baseline (BEATs+AASIST model).</description>

      <title>Who Will Top the Charts? Multimodal Music Popularity Prediction via Adaptive Fusion of Modality Experts and Temporal Engagement Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting a song's commercial success prior to its release remains an open and critical research challenge for the music industry. Early prediction of music popularity informs strategic decisions, creative planning, and marketing. Existing methods suffer from four limitations:(i) temporal dynamics in audio and lyrics are averaged away; (ii) lyrics are represented as a bag of words, disregarding compositional structure and affective semantics; (iii) artist- and song-level historical performance is ignored; and (iv) multimodal fusion approaches rely on simple feature concatenation, resulting in poorly aligned shared representations. To address these limitations, we introduce GAMENet, an end-to-end multimodal deep learning architecture for music popularity prediction. GAMENet integrates modality-specific experts for audio, lyrics, and social metadata through an adaptive gating mechanism. We use audio features from Music4AllOnion processed via OnionEnsembleAENet, a network of autoencoders designed for robust feature extraction; lyric embeddings derived through a large language model pipeline; and newly introduced Career Trajectory Dynamics (CTD) features that capture multi-year artist career momentum and song-level trajectory statistics. Using the Music4All dataset (113k tracks), previously explored in MIR tasks but not popularity prediction, GAMENet achieves a 12% improvement in R^2 over direct multimodal feature concatenation. Spotify audio descriptors alone yield an R^2 of 0.13. Integrating aggregate CTD features increases this to 0.69, with an additional 7% gain from temporal CTD features. We further validate robustness using the SpotGenTrack Popularity Dataset (100k tracks), achieving a 16% improvement over the previous baseline. Extensive ablations confirm the model's effectiveness and the distinct contribution of each modality.</description>

      <title>Protecting Bystander Privacy via Selective Hearing in LALMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large audio language models (LALMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world settings where they inevitably capture speech from unintended nearby bystanders, raising privacy risks that existing benchmarks and defences largely overlook. We introduce SH-Bench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate selective hearing: a model's ability to attend to an intended main speaker while refusing to process or reveal information about incidental bystander speech. SH-Bench contains 3,968 multi-speaker audio mixtures spanning both real-world and synthetic scenarios, paired with 77k multiple-choice questions that probe models under general and selective operating modes. We propose Selective Efficacy (SE), a unified metric capturing both multi-speaker comprehension and bystander-privacy protection. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LALMs reveals substantial privacy leakage, with strong audio understanding failing to translate into selective protection of bystander privacy. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Bystander Privacy Fine-Tuning (BPFT), a training pipeline that teaches models to refuse bystander-related queries without degrading main-speaker comprehension. BPFT yields substantial gains which improve SE by up to 15.9% over Gemini 2.5 Pro, demonstrating that selective hearing is learnable but far from achieved in current LALMs. SH-Bench and BPFT provide the first systematic framework for measuring and improving bystander privacy in audio foundation models.</description>

      <title>XM-ALIGN: Unified Cross-Modal Embedding Alignment for Face-Voice Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces our solution, XM-ALIGN (Unified Cross-Modal Embedding Alignment Framework), proposed for the FAME challenge at ICASSP 2026. Our framework combines explicit and implicit alignment mechanisms, significantly improving cross-modal verification performance in both "heard" and "unheard" languages. By extracting feature embeddings from both face and voice encoders and jointly optimizing them using a shared classifier, we employ mean squared error (MSE) as the embedding alignment loss to ensure tight alignment between modalities. Additionally, data augmentation strategies are applied during model training to enhance generalization. Experimental results show that our approach demonstrates superior performance on the MAV-Celeb dataset. The code will be released at https://github.com/PunkMale/XM-ALIGN.</description>

      <title>What Needs to be Known in Order to Perform a Meaningful Scientific Comparison Between Animal Communications and Human Spoken Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human spoken language has long been the subject of scientific investigation, particularly with regard to the mechanisms underpinning speech production. Likewise, the study of animal communications has a substantial literature, with many studies focusing on vocalisation. More recently, there has been growing interest in comparing animal communications and human speech. However, it is proposed here that such a comparison necessitates the appraisal of a minimum set of critical phenomena: i) the number of degrees-of-freedom of the vocal apparatus, ii) the ability to control those degrees-of-freedom independently, iii) the properties of the acoustic environment in which communication takes place, iv) the perceptual salience of the generated sounds, v) the degree to which sounds are contrastive, vi) the presence/absence of compositionality, and vii) the information rate(s) of the resulting communications.</description>

      <title>Singing Timbre Popularity Assessment Based on Multimodal Large Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated singing assessment is crucial for education and entertainment. However, existing systems face two fundamental limitations: reliance on reference tracks, which stifles creative expression, and the simplification of complex performances into non-diagnostic scores based solely on pitch and rhythm. We advocate for a shift from discriminative to descriptive evaluation, creating a complete ecosystem for reference-free, multi-dimensional assessment. First, we introduce Sing-MD, a large-scale dataset annotated by experts across four dimensions: breath control, timbre quality, emotional expression, and vocal technique. Our analysis reveals significant annotation inconsistencies among experts, challenging the validity of traditional accuracy-based metrics. Second, addressing the memory limitations of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in analyzing full-length songs, we propose VocalVerse. This efficient hybrid architecture leverages a lightweight acoustic encoder to model global performance features and long-term dependencies. Third, to address automated metric shortcomings, we establish the H-TPR (Human-in-the-loop Tiered Perceptual Ranking) benchmark, which evaluates a model's ability to generate perceptually valid rankings rather than predicting noisy ground-truth scores.</description>

      <title>Multi-Accent Mandarin Dry-Vocal Singing Dataset: Benchmark for Singing Accent Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singing accent research is underexplored compared to speech accent studies, primarily due to the scarcity of suitable datasets. Existing singing datasets often suffer from detail loss, frequently resulting from the vocal-instrumental separation process. Additionally, they often lack regional accent annotations. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Accent Mandarin Dry-Vocal Singing Dataset (MADVSD). MADVSD comprises over 670 hours of dry vocal recordings from 4,206 native Mandarin speakers across nine distinct Chinese regions. In addition to each participant recording audio of three popular songs in their native accent, they also recorded phonetic exercises covering all Mandarin vowels and a full octave range. We validated MADVSD through benchmark experiments in singing accent recognition, demonstrating its utility for evaluating state-of-the-art speech models in singing contexts. Furthermore, we explored dialectal influences on singing accent and analyzed the role of vowels in accentual variations, leveraging MADVSD's unique phonetic exercises.</description>

      <title>JEPA as a Neural Tokenizer: Learning Robust Speech Representations with Density Adaptive Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a two-stage self-supervised framework that combines the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with a Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM) for learning robust speech representations. Stage~1 uses JEPA with DAAM to learn semantic audio features via masked prediction in latent space, fully decoupled from waveform reconstruction. Stage~2 leverages these representations for efficient tokenization using Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) and a mixed-radix packing scheme, followed by high-fidelity waveform reconstruction with a HiFi-GAN decoder. By integrating Gaussian mixture-based density-adaptive gating into the JEPA encoder, the model performs adaptive temporal feature selection and discovers hierarchical speech structure at a low frame rate of 2.5~Hz. The resulting tokens (47.5 tokens/sec) provide a reversible, highly compressed, and language-model-friendly representation that is competitive with, and often more efficient than, existing neural audio codecs.</description>

      <title>MultiAPI Spoof: A Multi-API Dataset and Local-Attention Network for Speech Anti-spoofing Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing speech anti-spoofing benchmarks rely on a narrow set of public models, creating a substantial gap from real-world scenarios in which commercial systems employ diverse, often proprietary APIs. To address this issue, we introduce MultiAPI Spoof, a multi-API audio anti-spoofing dataset comprising about 230 hours of synthetic speech generated by 30 distinct APIs, including commercial services, open-source models, and online platforms. Based on this dataset, we define the API tracing task, enabling fine-grained attribution of spoofed audio to its generation source. We further propose Nes2Net-LA, a local-attention enhanced variant of Nes2Net that improves local context modeling and fine-grained spoofing feature extraction. Experiments show that Nes2Net-LA achieves state-of-the-art performance and offers superior robustness, particularly under diverse and unseen spoofing conditions.

      <title>Incorporating Structure and Chord Constraints in Symbolic Transformer-based Melodic Harmonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer architectures offer significant advantages regarding the generation of symbolic music; their capabilities for incorporating user preferences toward what they generate is being studied under many aspects. This paper studies the inclusion of predefined chord constraints in melodic harmonization, i.e., where a desired chord at a specific location is provided along with the melody as inputs and the autoregressive transformer model needs to incorporate the chord in the harmonization that it generates. The peculiarities of involving such constraints is discussed and an algorithm is proposed for tackling this task. This algorithm is called B* and it combines aspects of beam search and A* along with backtracking to force pretrained transformers to satisfy the chord constraints, at the correct onset position within the correct bar. The algorithm is brute-force and has exponential complexity in the worst case; however, this paper is a first attempt to highlight the difficulties of the problem and proposes an algorithm that offers many possibilities for improvements since it accommodates the involvement of heuristics.</description>

      <title>KidSpeak: A General Multi-purpose LLM for Kids' Speech Recognition and Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of conversational and diffusion-based AI, there is a growing adoption of AI in educational services, ranging from grading and assessment tools to personalized learning systems that provide targeted support for students. However, this adaptability has yet to fully extend to the domain of children's speech, where existing models often fail due to their reliance on datasets designed for clear, articulate adult speech. Children, particularly those in early developmental stages or with speech and language pathologies, present unique challenges that current AI models and datasets are ill-equipped to handle. To address this, we introduce KidSpeak, a multi-task speech-enhanced Foundation Model capable of both generative and discriminative tasks specifically tailored to children's speech patterns. Our framework employs a two-stage training process that incorporates phonetic knowledge into the speech encoder, achieving an average accuracy of 87% across four separate tasks. Furthermore, recognizing the limitations of scalable human annotation and existing speech alignment tools, we propose the Flexible and Automatic Speech Aligner (FASA) and leverage the method to construct high quality datasets for training and evaluation. This novel alignment tool significantly improves the quality of aligned children's speech from noisy data, enhancing data quality by 13.6x compared to human annotations, as demonstrated on the CHILDES dataset. To the best of our knowledge, KidSpeak and FASA represent the first comprehensive solution designed for speech and language therapy in children, offering both a multi-purpose speech LLM and a robust alignment tool.</description>

      <title>Degrading Voice: A Comprehensive Overview of Robust Voice Conversion Through Input Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identity, accent, style, and emotions are essential components of human speech. Voice conversion (VC) techniques process the speech signals of two input speakers and other modalities of auxiliary information such as prompts and emotion tags. It changes para-linguistic features from one to another, while maintaining linguistic contents. Recently, VC models have made rapid advancements in both generation quality and personalization capabilities. These developments have attracted considerable attention for diverse applications, including privacy preservation, voice-print reproduction for the deceased, and dysarthric speech recovery. However, these models only learn non-robust features due to the clean training data. Subsequently, it results in unsatisfactory performances when dealing with degraded input speech in real-world scenarios, including additional noise, reverberation, adversarial attacks, or even minor perturbation. Hence, it demands robust deployments, especially in real-world settings. Although latest researches attempt to find potential attacks and countermeasures for VC systems, there remains a significant gap in the comprehensive understanding of how robust the VC model is under input manipulation. here also raises many questions: For instance, to what extent do different forms of input degradation attacks alter the expected output of VC models? Is there potential for optimizing these attack and defense strategies? To answer these questions, we classify existing attack and defense methods from the perspective of input manipulation and evaluate the impact of degraded input speech across four dimensions, including intelligibility, naturalness, timbre similarity, and subjective perception. Finally, we outline open issues and future directions.</description>

      <title>Hankel-FNO: Fast Underwater Acoustic Charting Via Physics-Encoded Fourier Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and accurate underwater acoustic charting is crucial for downstream tasks such as environment-aware sensor placement optimization and autonomous vehicle path planning. Conventional methods rely on computationally expensive while accurate numerical solvers, which are not scalable for large-scale or real-time applications. Although deep learning-based surrogate models can accelerate these computations, they often suffer from limitations such as fixed-resolution constraints or dependence on explicit partial differential equation formulations. These issues hinder their applicability and generalization across diverse environments. We propose Hankel-FNO, a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)-based model for efficient and accurate acoustic charting. By incorporating sound propagation knowledge and bathymetry, our method has high accuracy while maintaining high computational speed. Results demonstrate that Hankel-FNO outperforms traditional solvers in speed and surpasses data-driven alternatives in accuracy, especially in long-range predictions. Experiments show the model's adaptability to diverse environments and sound source settings with minimal fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Coherent Audio-Visual Editing via Conditional Audio Generation Following Video Edits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel pipeline for joint audio-visual editing that enhances the coherence between edited video and its accompanying audio. Our approach first applies state-of-the-art video editing techniques to produce the target video, then performs audio editing to align with the visual changes. To achieve this, we present a new video-to-audio generation model that conditions on the source audio, target video, and a text prompt. We extend the model architecture to incorporate conditional audio input and propose a data augmentation strategy that improves training efficiency. Furthermore, our model dynamically adjusts the influence of the source audio based on the complexity of the edits, preserving the original audio structure where possible. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in maintaining audio-visual alignment and content integrity.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Single-Channel Audio Separation with Diffusion Source Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-channel audio separation aims to separate individual sources from a single-channel mixture. Most existing methods rely on supervised learning with synthetically generated paired data. However, obtaining high-quality paired data in real-world scenarios is often difficult. This data scarcity can degrade model performance under unseen conditions and limit generalization ability. To this end, in this work, we approach this problem from an unsupervised perspective, framing it as a probabilistic inverse problem. Our method requires only diffusion priors trained on individual sources. Separation is then achieved by iteratively guiding an initial state toward the solution through reconstruction guidance. Importantly, we introduce an advanced inverse problem solver specifically designed for separation, which mitigates gradient conflicts caused by interference between the diffusion prior and reconstruction guidance during inverse denoising. This design ensures high-quality and balanced separation performance across individual sources. Additionally, we find that initializing the denoising process with an augmented mixture instead of pure Gaussian noise provides an informative starting point that significantly improves the final performance. To further enhance audio prior modeling, we design a novel time-frequency attention-based network architecture that demonstrates strong audio modeling capability. Collectively, these improvements lead to significant performance gains, as validated across speech-sound event, sound event, and speech separation tasks.</description>

      <title>DeepAgent: A Dual Stream Multi Agent Fusion for Robust Multimodal Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic media, particularly deepfakes, is an emerging challenge for digital content verification. Although recent studies use both audio and visual information, most integrate these cues within a single model, which remains vulnerable to modality mismatches, noise, and manipulation. To address this gap, we propose DeepAgent, an advanced multi-agent collaboration framework that simultaneously incorporates both visual and audio modalities for the effective detection of deepfakes. DeepAgent consists of two complementary agents. Agent-1 examines each video with a streamlined AlexNet-based CNN to identify the symbols of deepfake manipulation, while Agent-2 detects audio-visual inconsistencies by combining acoustic features, audio transcriptions from Whisper, and frame-reading sequences of images through EasyOCR. Their decisions are fused through a Random Forest meta-classifier that improves final performance by taking advantage of the different decision boundaries learned by each agent. This study evaluates the proposed framework using three benchmark datasets to demonstrate both component-level and fused performance. Agent-1 achieves a test accuracy of 94.35% on the combined Celeb-DF and FakeAVCeleb datasets. On the FakeAVCeleb dataset, Agent-2 and the final meta-classifier attain accuracies of 93.69% and 81.56%, respectively. In addition, cross-dataset validation on DeepFakeTIMIT confirms the robustness of the meta-classifier, which achieves a final accuracy of 97.49%, and indicates a strong capability across diverse datasets. These findings confirm that hierarchy-based fusion enhances robustness by mitigating the weaknesses of individual modalities and demonstrate the effectiveness of a multi-agent approach in addressing diverse types of manipulations in deepfakes.</description>

      <title>A multimodal Bayesian Network for symptom-level depression and anxiety prediction from voice and speech data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During psychiatric assessment, clinicians observe not only what patients report, but important nonverbal signs such as tone, speech rate, fluency, responsiveness, and body language. Weighing and integrating these different information sources is a challenging task and a good candidate for support by intelligence-driven tools - however this is yet to be realized in the clinic. Here, we argue that several important barriers to adoption can be addressed using Bayesian network modelling. To demonstrate this, we evaluate a model for depression and anxiety symptom prediction from voice and speech features in large-scale datasets (30,135 unique speakers). Alongside performance for conditions and symptoms (for depression, anxiety ROC-AUC=0.842,0.831 ECE=0.018,0.015; core individual symptom ROC-AUC&gt;0.74), we assess demographic fairness and investigate integration across and redundancy between different input modality types. Clinical usefulness metrics and acceptability to mental health service users are explored. When provided with sufficiently rich and large-scale multimodal data streams and specified to represent common mental conditions at the symptom rather than disorder level, such models are a principled approach for building robust assessment support tools: providing clinically-relevant outputs in a transparent and explainable format that is directly amenable to expert clinical supervision.</description>

      <title>Is Self-Supervised Learning Enough to Fill in the Gap? A Study on Speech Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech inpainting consists in reconstructing corrupted or missing speech segments using surrounding context, a process that closely resembles the pretext tasks in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for speech encoders. This study investigates using SSL-trained speech encoders for inpainting without any additional training beyond the initial pretext task, and simply adding a decoder to generate a waveform. We compare this approach to supervised fine-tuning of speech encoders for a downstream task -- here, inpainting. Practically, we integrate HuBERT as the SSL encoder and HiFi-GAN as the decoder in two configurations: (1) fine-tuning the decoder to align with the frozen pre-trained encoder's output and (2) fine-tuning the encoder for an inpainting task based on a frozen decoder's input. Evaluations are conducted under single- and multi-speaker conditions using in-domain datasets and out-of-domain datasets (including unseen speakers, diverse speaking styles, and noise). Both informed and blind inpainting scenarios are considered, where the position of the corrupted segment is either known or unknown. The proposed SSL-based methods are benchmarked against several baselines, including a text-informed method combining automatic speech recognition with zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis. Performance is assessed using objective metrics and perceptual evaluations. The results demonstrate that both approaches outperform baselines, successfully reconstructing speech segments up to 200 ms, and sometimes up to 400 ms. Notably, fine-tuning the SSL encoder achieves more accurate speech reconstruction in single-speaker settings, while a pre-trained encoder proves more effective for multi-speaker scenarios. This demonstrates that an SSL pretext task can transfer to speech inpainting, enabling successful speech reconstruction with a pre-trained encoder.</description>

      <title>Target Speaker Extraction through Comparing Noisy Positive and Negative Audio Enrollments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Target speaker extraction focuses on isolating a specific speaker's voice from an audio mixture containing multiple speakers. To provide information about the target speaker's identity, prior works have utilized clean audio samples as conditioning inputs. However, such clean audio examples are not always readily available. For instance, obtaining a clean recording of a stranger's voice at a cocktail party without leaving the noisy environment is generally infeasible. Limited prior research has explored extracting the target speaker's characteristics from noisy enrollments, which may contain overlapping speech from interfering speakers. In this work, we explore a novel enrollment strategy that encodes target speaker information from the noisy enrollment by comparing segments where the target speaker is talking (Positive Enrollments) with segments where the target speaker is silent (Negative Enrollments). Experiments show the effectiveness of our model architecture, which achieves over 2.1 dB higher SI-SNRi compared to prior works in extracting the monaural speech from the mixture of two speakers. Additionally, the proposed two-stage training strategy accelerates convergence, reducing the number of optimization steps required to reach 3 dB SNR by 60%. Overall, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the monaural target speaker extraction conditioned on noisy enrollments. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/xu-shitong/TSE-through-Positive-Negative-Enroll .</description>

      <title>SteerMusic: Enhanced Musical Consistency for Zero-shot Text-guided and Personalized Music Editing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Music editing is an important step in music production, which has broad applications, including game development and film production. Most existing zero-shot text-guided editing methods rely on pretrained diffusion models by involving forward-backward diffusion processes. However, these methods often struggle to preserve the musical content. Additionally, text instructions alone usually fail to accurately describe the desired music. In this paper, we propose two music editing methods that improve the consistency between the original and edited music by leveraging score distillation. The first method, SteerMusic, is a coarse-grained zero-shot editing approach using delta denoising score. The second method, SteerMusic+, enables fine-grained personalized music editing by manipulating a concept token that represents a user-defined musical style. SteerMusic+ allows for the editing of music into user-defined musical styles that cannot be achieved by the text instructions alone. Experimental results show that our methods outperform existing approaches in preserving both music content consistency and editing fidelity. User studies further validate that our methods achieve superior music editing quality.</description>

      <title>Scaling to Multimodal and Multichannel Heart Sound Classification with Synthetic and Augmented Biosignals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11606v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths each year. Early detection is critical, creating a demand for accurate and inexpensive pre-screening methods. Deep learning has recently been applied to classify abnormal heart sounds indicative of CVDs using synchronised phonocardiogram (PCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as well as multichannel PCG (mPCG). However, state-of-the-art architectures remain underutilised due to the limited availability of synchronised and multichannel datasets. Augmented datasets and pre-trained models provide a pathway to overcome these limitations, enabling transformer-based architectures to be trained effectively. This work combines traditional signal processing with denoising diffusion models, WaveGrad and DiffWave, to create an augmented dataset to fine-tune a Wav2Vec 2.0-based classifier on multimodal and multichannel heart sound datasets. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the Computing in Cardiology (CinC) 2016 dataset of single channel PCG, accuracy, unweighted average recall (UAR), sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) reach 92.48%, 93.05%, 93.63%, 92.48%, 94.93% and 0.8283, respectively. Using the synchronised PCG and ECG signals of the training-a dataset from CinC, 93.14%, 92.21%, 94.35%, 90.10%, 95.12% and 0.8380 are achieved for accuracy, UAR, sensitivity, specificity and MCC, respectively. Using a wearable vest dataset consisting of mPCG data, the model achieves 77.13% accuracy, 74.25% UAR, 86.47% sensitivity, 62.04% specificity, and 0.5082 MCC. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models for CVD detection when supported by augmented datasets, highlighting their potential to advance multimodal and multichannel heart sound classification.</description>

      <title>Audio Palette: A Diffusion Transformer with Multi-Signal Conditioning for Controllable Foley Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12175v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have enabled high-quality text-to-audio synthesis, but fine-grained acoustic control remains a significant challenge in open-source research. We present Audio Palette, a diffusion transformer (DiT) based model that extends the Stable Audio Open architecture to address this "control gap" in controllable audio generation. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on semantic conditioning, Audio Palette introduces four time-varying control signals, loudness, pitch, spectral centroid, and timbre, for precise and interpretable manipulation of acoustic features. The model is efficiently adapted for the nuanced domain of Foley synthesis using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a curated subset of AudioSet, requiring only 0.85% of the original parameters to be trained. Experiments demonstrate that Audio Palette achieves fine-grained, interpretable control of sound attributes. Crucially, it accomplishes this novel controllability while maintaining high audio quality and strong semantic alignment to text prompts, with performance on standard metrics such as Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) and LAION-CLAP scores remaining comparable to the original baseline model. We provide a scalable, modular pipeline for audio research, emphasizing sequence-based conditioning, memory efficiency, and a three-scale classifier-free guidance mechanism for nuanced inference-time control. This work establishes a robust foundation for controllable sound design and performative audio synthesis in open-source settings, enabling a more artist-centric workflow in the broader context of music and sound information retrieval.</description>

      <title>DiTAR: Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling for Speech Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03930v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several recent studies have attempted to autoregressively generate continuous speech representations without discrete speech tokens by combining diffusion and autoregressive models, yet they often face challenges with excessive computational loads or suboptimal outcomes. In this work, we propose Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling (DiTAR), a patch-based autoregressive framework combining a language model with a diffusion transformer. This approach significantly enhances the efficacy of autoregressive models for continuous tokens and reduces computational demands. DiTAR utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy for patch generation, where the language model processes aggregated patch embeddings and the diffusion transformer subsequently generates the next patch based on the output of the language model. For inference, we propose defining temperature as the time point of introducing noise during the reverse diffusion ODE to balance diversity and determinism. We also show in the extensive scaling analysis that DiTAR has superb scalability. In zero-shot speech generation, DiTAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in robustness, speaker similarity, and naturalness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MAVERIX (Multimodal audiovisual Evaluation and Recognition IndeX), a unified benchmark to probe the video understanding in multimodal LLMs, encompassing video, audio, text inputs with human performance baselines. Although recent advancements in models with vision and audio understanding capabilities have shown substantial progress, the field lacks a standardized evaluation framework to thoroughly assess their cross-modality comprehension performance. MAVERIX curates 2,556 questions from 700 videos, in the form of both multiple-choice and open-ended formats, explicitly designed to evaluate multimodal models through questions that necessitate tight integration of video and audio information, spanning a broad spectrum of agentic scenarios. MAVERIX uniquely provides models with audiovisual questions, closely mimicking the multimodal perceptual experiences available to humans during inference and decision-making processes. To our knowledge, MAVERIX is the first benchmark aimed explicitly at assessing comprehensive audiovisual integration in such granularity. Experiments with state-of-the-art models, including Qwen 2.5 Omni and Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, show performance around 64% accuracy, while human experts reach near-ceiling performance of 92.8%, exposing a substantial gap to human-level comprehension. With standardized evaluation protocols, a rigorously annotated pipeline, and a public toolkit, MAVERIX establishes a challenging testbed for advancing audiovisual multimodal intelligence.</description>

Abstract: The Metaverse, a shared and spatially organized digital continuum, is transforming various industries, with music emerging as a leading use case. Live concerts, collaborative composition, and interactive experiences are driving the Musical Metaverse (MM), but the requirements of the underlying network and service infrastructures hinder its growth. These challenges underscore the need for a novel modeling and simulation paradigm tailored to the unique characteristics of MM sessions, along with specialized service provisioning strategies capable of capturing their interactive, heterogeneous, and multicast-oriented nature. To this end, we make a first attempt to formally model and analyze the problem of service provisioning for MM sessions in 5G/6G networks. We first formalize service and network graph models for the MM, using "live audience interaction in a virtual concert" as a reference scenario. We then present MuMeNet, a novel discrete-event network simulator specifically tailored to the requirements and the traffic dynamics of the MM. We showcase the effectiveness of MuMeNet by running a linear programming based orchestration policy on the reference scenario and providing performance analysis under realistic MM workloads.</description>
