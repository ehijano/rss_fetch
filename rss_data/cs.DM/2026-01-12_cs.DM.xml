      <title>Local generation of languages: the monotonic binary sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous article, we have introduced the problem of local generation of languages, where the communication underlying the generation procedure is captured by a simplicial complex. We study in details this problem for the language of binary monotonic sequences. We prove general results and identify several classes of minimal simplicial complexes generating this language.</description>

      <title>A Rank 23 Algorithm for Multiplying 3 x 3 Matrices with an Arithmetic Complexity of 59</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1969 Strassen showed surprisingly that it is possible to multiply two 2 x 2 matrices using seven multiplications and 18 additions, instead of the naive eight multiplications and four additions. The number of additions was later reduced to 15. Karstadt and Schwartz further reduced the number of additions to 12 using a change-of-basis method. Both the number of multiplications and the number of additions have been shown to be optimal for the 2 x 2 case.
  For multiplying 3 x 3 matrices, the lowest number of multiplications found so far is 23. Using 23 multiplications, Schwart et al. showed how to reduce the number of additions to 61 using a change-of-basis method. M{\aa}rtensson and Stankovski Wagner showed how to achieve 62 additions, without changing basis. Using the optimization method by M{\aa}rtensson and Stankovski Wagner, Stapleton found an algorithm requiring only 60 additions. In this work we continue to combine the methods of M{\aa}rtensson, Stankovski Wagner and Stapleton, finding an algorithm requiring only 59 additions, still without a basis change. Technical details on the method and tools used for finding this scheme, and a discussion on the impact of this discovery, will come in an upcoming publication.</description>

      <title>On Edge-Disjoint Maximal Outerplanar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide two constructions for $t$ edge-disjoint maximal outerplanar graphs on every number of $n \geq 4t$ vertices. The bound on the minimum number of vertices is tight. These constructions yield the existence of optimal outerthickness-$t$ graphs for every $t \in \mathbb{N}$. While one of the constructions works for all values of $t$ and extends graphs from Guy and Nowakowski (1990), the other one holds only for powers of $2$, but yields graphs with maximum degree logarithmic in the number of vertices. Thus, the latter may be helpful in tackling the open question of determining the outerthickness of all complete graphs.</description>

      <title>Weisfeiler-Leman on graphs of small twin-width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twin-width is a graph parameter introduced in the context of first-order model checking, and has since become a central parameter in algorithmic graph theory. While many algorithmic problems become easier on arbitrary classes of bounded twin-width, graph isomorphism on graphs of twin-width 4 and above is as hard as the general isomorphism problem. For each positive number $k$, the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm is an iterative color refinement algorithm that encodes structural similarities and serves as a fundamental tool for distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs. We show that the graph isomorphism problem for graphs of twin-width 1 can be solved by the purely combinatorial 3-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, while there is no fixed $k$ such that the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm solves the graph isomorphism problem for graphs of twin-width 4.
  Moreover, we prove the conjecture of Bergougnoux, Gajarsk\'y, Guspiel, Hlinen\'y, Pokr\'yvka, and Sokolowski that stable graphs of twin-width 2 have bounded rank-width. This in particular implies that isomorphism of these graphs can be decided by a fixed dimension of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Counting Linear Regions in ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16716v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An established measure of the expressive power of a given ReLU neural network is the number of linear regions into which it partitions the input space. There exist many different, non-equivalent definitions of what a linear region actually is. We systematically assess which papers use which definitions and discuss how they relate to each other. We then analyze the computational complexity of counting the number of such regions for the various definitions. Generally, this turns out to be an intractable problem. We prove NP- and #P-hardness results already for networks with one hidden layer and strong hardness of approximation results for two or more hidden layers. Finally, on the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that counting linear regions can at least be achieved in polynomial space for some common definitions.</description>

      <title>A Truly Subcubic Combinatorial Algorithm for Induced 4-Cycle Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first truly subcubic, combinatorial algorithm for detecting an induced $4$-cycle in a graph. The running time is $O(n^{2.84})$ on $n$-node graphs, thus separating the task of detecting induced $4$-cycles from detecting triangles, which requires $n^{3-o(1)}$ time combinatorially under the popular BMM hypothesis.
  Significant work has gone into characterizing the exact time complexity of induced $H$-detection, relative to the complexity of detecting cliques of various sizes. Prior work identified the question of whether induced $4$-cycle detection is triangle-hard as the only remaining case towards completing the lowest level of the classification, dubbing it a "curious" case [Dalirrooyfard, Vassilevska W., FOCS 2022]. Our result can be seen as a negative resolution of this question.
  Our algorithm deviates from previous techniques in the large body of subgraph detection algorithms and employs the trendy topic of graph decomposition that has hitherto been restricted to more global problems (as in the use of expander decompositions for flow problems) or to shaving subpolynomial factors (as in the application of graph regularity lemmas). While our algorithm is slower than the (non-combinatorial) state-of-the-art $\tilde{O}(n^{\omega})$-time algorithm based on polynomial identity testing [Vassilevska W., Wang, Williams, Yu, SODA 2014], combinatorial advancements often come with other benefits. In particular, we give the first nontrivial deterministic algorithm for detecting induced $4$-cycles.</description>
