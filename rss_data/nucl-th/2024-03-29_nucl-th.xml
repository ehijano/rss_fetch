      <title>Inner fission barriers of uranium isotopes in the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner fission barriers of the even-even uranium isotopes from the proton to the neutron drip line are studied with the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum. A periodic evolution for the ground state shapes is shown with the neutron number, i.e., spherical shapes at shell closures $N=$126, 184, 258, and prolate dominated shapes between them. In analogy to the shape evolution, the inner fission barriers also exhibit a periodic behavior: peaks at the shell closures and valleys in the mid-shells. The triaxial effect to the inner fission barrier is evaluated using the triaxial relativistic mean field calculations plus a simple BCS method for pairing. With the triaxial correction included, good consistency in the inner barrier heights is found with the available empirical data. Besides, the evolution from the proton to the neutron drip line is in accord with the results by the multi-dimensionally constrained relativistic mean field theory. A flat valley in the fission barrier height is predicted around the neutron-rich nucleus $^{318}$U which may play a role of fission recycling in the astrophysical $r$-process nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Inverse Potentials for $\alpha-\alpha$ Scattering using Gaussian Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alpha-alpha scattering phase shifts (SPS) have been determined using phase function method (PFM) with local nuclear interaction between two alpha clusters modeled as double Gaussian potential and Coulomb repulsion in the form of $erf()$ function. The obtained SPS for various $\ell$-channels have been compared with experimental ones with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as a measure. The model parameters have been optimised by suitable optimisation technique by looking for minimum value of MAPE. The results for $\ell$=0$^+$, 2$^+$ and 4$^+$ partial waves have been obtained, to match with experimental SPS, with MAPE values of $7.6$, $2.7$ and $6.5$ respectively for data up to $120$ MeV, while for higher states 6$^+$, 8$^+$ and 10$^+$ has MAPE of $1.7, 7.4$ and $10.4$ respectively for data from $53-120$ MeV. On extrapolation for data in range E$_{\ell ab.}$ = $23-120$ MeV, using the optimised parameters, the SPS are found to be in close agreement with experimental ones for first three channels.</description>

      <title>Cross-checking the geometric effects in heavy-ion collisions at 1 GeV/nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing the isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model, the 1 GeV/nucleon deformed uranium-uranium ultra-central collisions are simulated. Based on sensitive observables, mean square collective flow and pion meson multiplicity, the impacts of high-momentum tails caused by short-range correlations and the symmetry energy in high-density regions on geometric effects are discussed under different reaction orientations. Finally, the neural network model for identifying reaction orientations is also developed.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in multinucleon transfer reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear reactions present an interesting case for studies of the time-evolution of entanglement between complex quantum systems. In this work, the time-dependent nuclear density functional theory is employed to explore entanglement in multinucleon transfer reactions. As an illustrative example, for the reaction $^{40}$Ca $+$ $^{208}$Pb at $E_{\rm lab} = 249$ MeV, in the interval of impact parameters $4.65-7.40$ fm, and the relativistic density functional PC-PK1, we compute the von Neumann entropies, entanglement between fragments, nucleon-number fluctuations, and Shannon entropy for the nucleon-number observable. A simple linear correlation is established between the entanglement and nucleon-number fluctuation of the final fragments. The entanglement between the fragments can be related to the corresponding excitation energies and angular momenta. The relationship between the von Neumann entropy and the Shannon entropy for the nucleon-number observable is analyzed, as well as the time-evolution of the entanglement (nucleon-number fluctuation). The entanglement is also calculated for a range of incident energies and it is shown how, depending on the impact parameter, the entanglement increases with the collision energy.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of the dense matter equation of state built upon extended Skyrme interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-relativistic model of nuclear matter with Brussels extended Skyrme interactions is employed in order to build, within a Bayesian approach, models for the dense matter equation of state (EOS). In addition to a minimal set of constraints on nuclear empirical parameters; the density behavior of energy per particle in pure neutron matter (PNM); a lower limit on the maximum neutron star (NS) mass, we require that the Fermi velocity of neutrons ($v_{\mathrm{F;\,n}}$) in PNM and symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) with densities up to $0.8~\mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ does not exceed the speed of light. The latter condition is imposed in order to cure a deficiency present in many Skyrme interactions [Duan and Urban, Phys. Rev. C 108, 025813 (2023)]. We illustrate the importance of this constraint for the posterior distributions. Some of our models are subjected to constraints on the density dependence of neutron (nucleon) Landau effective mass in PNM (SNM), too. The impact of various sets of constraints on the behaviors of nuclear matter and NSs is discussed in detail. When compared with models built upon standard Skyrme interactions, it turns out that those based on the extended interactions are stiffer if Fermi velocity is disregarded, but softer if it is taken into account.</description>

      <title>An extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model for quark and nuclear matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to one capable of exploring quark and nuclear matter consistently. With an extra term standing for quark-nucleon interactions, nucleons could automatically emerge as color-singlet three-quark entities by following a process similar to mesons. Besides the quark part in mean field approximation, both mesons and nucleons could contribute to the thermodynamic potential thus possibly give rise to quarkyonic matter beyond mean field. In the study, two kinds of "confining" couplings are adopted for the new interaction term and two different quark masses are considered for comparison. It turns out that only confined nuclear matter or deconfined quark matter is possible for all the cases at zero temperature, thus quarkyonic matter is not favored at all. Even more strictly, only the case with stronger confinement effect and a smaller quark mass admits a physical first-order phase transition from nuclear matter to quark matter around twice saturation density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pion $\beta$ decay, $\pi^+ \to\pi^0 e^+ \nu_e$, offers a pristine way to measure the CKM matrix element $V_{ud}$ in a purely mesonic system, with excellent control over the hadronic matrix elements. We review the physics goals and current status of the PIONEER experiment, which aims at major improvements in the branching fractions for the $\pi^+\to e^+ \nu_e$ decay in Phase I and for pion $\beta$ decay in Phases II and III of its experimental program, potentially leading to a measurement of $V_{ud}$ competitive with determinations from $\beta$ decays involving nucleons.</description>

      <title>Exact evaluation of large-charge correlation functions in non-relativistic conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-charge master field which generates all n-point correlation functions with an insertion of large charge Q in non-relativistic conformal field theory is obtained. This field is used to compute Schr\"odinger-invariant n-point correlation functions of large-charge operators via a direct evaluation of the path integral. Conformal dimensions are found to agree with calculations based on the state-operator correspondence. The master field solution exhibits an emergent harmonic trap whose frequency is a function of the Euclidean time. The large-charge effective action with operator insertions describes a droplet of superfluid matter whose spatial size scales with the time separation of sources. The solution is used to compute Schr\"odinger symmetry breaking corrections in the large-charge effective field theory (EFT) due to a finite scattering length in the fundamental theory of fermions near unitarity. The scaling of these effects in the large-charge power counting scheme is established, and the size of the effects is quantified using input from quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the near-unitary gas, as well as from the large-N expansion at large charge.</description>

      <title>Reference Energies for Double Excitations: Improvement and Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of photochemistry, the significance of double excitations (also known as doubly-excited states), where two electrons are concurrently elevated to higher energy levels, lies in their involvement in key electronic transitions essential in light-induced chemical reactions as well as their challenging nature from the computational theoretical chemistry point of view. Based on state-of-the-art electronic structure methods (such as high-order coupled-cluster, selected configuration interaction, and multiconfigurational methods), we improve and expand our prior set of accurate reference excitation energies for electronic states exhibiting a substantial amount of double excitations [http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b01205; Loos et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2019, 15, 1939]. This extended collection encompasses 47 electronic transitions across 26 molecular systems that we separate into two distinct subsets: (i) 28 "genuine" doubly-excited states where the transitions almost exclusively involve doubly-excited configurations and (ii) 19 "partial" doubly-excited states which exhibit a more balanced character between singly- and doubly-excited configurations. For each subset, we assess the performance of high-order coupled-cluster (CC3, CCSDT, CC4, and CCSDTQ) and multiconfigurational methods (CASPT2, CASPT3, PC-NEVPT2, and SC-NEVPT2). Using as a probe the percentage of single excitations involved in a given transition ($\%T_1$) computed at the CC3 level, we also propose a simple correction that reduces the errors of CC3 by a factor of 3, for both sets of excitations. We hope that this more complete and diverse compilation of double excitations will help future developments of electronic excited-state methodologies.</description>

      <title>Angular dependence in transverse momentum dependent diffractive parton distributions at small-$x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the angular dependence of the recently proposed transverse momentum dependent quark and gluon diffractive parton distributions at small-$x$. We introduce the difractive versions of the Sivers function and the elliptic gluon Wigner distribution and evaluate them in simple models with gluon saturation and study their geometric scaling properties. We also show that the diffractive version of the linearly polarized gluon distribution identically vanishes to leading order. These distributions enrich the physics opportunities for measuring semi-inclsuive diffractive DIS processes at the future electron-ion colliders.</description>

      <title>Spin alignment of vector mesons by second-order hydrodynamic gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting with the polarization dependent Wigner function of vector mesons, we derive an expression for the 00-component ($\rho_{00}$) of spin density matrix in terms of the second order gradients of the vector meson distribution functions. We further apply a thermal model to analyze the transverse momentum and the azimuthal angle dependence of $\rho_{00}$ for $\phi$ and $K^{*0}$ mesons resulting from distribution gradients in Au-Au collisions with $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=130$ GeV at mid-rapidity. Our results for the transverse momentum dependence indicate that the deviations of $\rho_{00}$ from $1/3$ as the signal for spin alignment are greatly enhanced at large transverse momenta and have a strong centrality dependence while analysis of the azimuthal angle ($\phi_q$) dependence suggest that such deviations have a $\cos(2\phi_q)$ structure with opposite sign for $\phi$ and $K^{*0}$. Our finding may be considered as a baseline for probing spin-alignment mechanisms beyond hydrodynamic gradients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The total and differential cross sections of the elastic proton-neutron and antiproton-neutron scattering are studied in a holographic QCD model, focusing on the Regge regime. Taking into account the Pomeron and Reggeon exchange, which are described by the Reggeized spin-2 glueball and vector meson propagator respectively, those cross sections are obtained. It is presented that the currently available experimental data of the total cross sections can be well described within the model. Once a single adjustable parameter is determined with the total cross section data, the differential cross sections can be calculated without any additional parameters. Although the available differential cross section data are limited, it is found that our predictions are consistent with those.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extreme temperatures and densities of many astrophysical environments tends to destabilize nuclear isomers by inducing transitions to higher energy states. Those states may then cascade to ground. However, not all environments destabilize all isomers. Nuclear isomers which retain their metastable character in pertinent astrophysical environments are known as astrophysically metastable nuclear isomers, or "astromers". Astromers can influence nucleosynthesis, altering abundances or even creating new pathways that would otherwise be inaccessible. Astromers may also release energy faster or slower relative to their associated ground state, acting as heating accelerants or batteries, respectively. In stable isotopes, they may even simply remain populated after a cataclysmic event and emit observable x- or $\gamma$-rays. The variety of behaviors of these nuclear species and the effects they can have merit careful consideration in nearly every possible astrophysical environment. Here we provide a brief overview of astromers past and present, and we outline future work that will help to illuminate their role in the cosmos.</description>

      <title>The spin-flip-induced quadrupole resonance in odd-$A$ exotic atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the possible existence of quadrupole resonances in exotic atoms containing odd-$A$ nuclei. We find that the spin-flip of the de-exciting exotic particle can induce a resonance, altering the orbital angular momentum of the nucleus by one quanta. This process results in an excited nucleus with a suppression in x-ray photon emissions during the exotic atom cascade. We provide specific cases of antiprotonic atoms of stable elements where this resonance effect is expected to occur. The study of this phenomena may provide insight into the strong interaction of deeply bound antiprotonic states in the proximity of the unpaired nucleon, and serve as a tool for probing short-lived excited nuclear states.</description>
