      <title>A linear upper bound on the zero-sum Ramsey number of forests in $\mathbb{Z}_p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $m$ be a positive integer and let $G$ be a graph. The zero-sum Ramsey number $R(G,\mathbb{Z}_m)$ is the least integer $N$ (if it exists) such that for every edge-coloring $\chi \, : \, E(K_N) \, \rightarrow \, \mathbb{Z}_m$ one can find a copy of $G$ in $K_N$ such that $\sum_{e \, \in \, E(G)}{\chi(e)} \, = \, 0$.
  In this paper, we show that, for every prime $p$, $$R(F,\mathbb{Z}_p)\leq n+9p-12$$ for every forest $F$ in $n\geq 3p^2-12p+11$ vertices with $p\mid e(F)$.</description>

      <title>Impartial Avoidance Games on Convex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a two-player game in which players take turns avoiding the selection of certain points within a convex geometry. The objective is to prevent the convex closure of all chosen points from encompassing a predefined set. The first player forced into a move that results in the inclusion of this set loses the game. We redevelop a theoretical framework for these avoidance games and determine their nim numbers, including cases involving vertex geometries of trees, edge geometries of trees, and scenarios where the predefined set consists of extreme points.</description>

      <title>Crystal skeleton polynomials with major index, charge and depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of polynomials, crystal skeleton polynomials, to better understand enumeration of standard Young tableaux, quasi-Yamanouchi tableaux and interactions with Gessel's expansion of a Schur function, quasi-crystals and crystal skeletons as Maas-Gari\'{e}py introduced in 2023. After developing calculus of those polynomials, we organize thoughts on major index, charge, depth, inversions with RSK correspondence and a bivariate factorial. Also, we revisit the theorem on internal zeros of fake degree polynomials by Billey--Konvalinka--Swanson (2020). These results altogether improve Gessel's expansion.</description>

      <title>3-Coloring $P_t$-Free Graphs With Only One Prescribed Induced Odd Cycle Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is $P_t$-free if it contains no induced subgraph isomorphic to a $t$-vertex path. A graph is not bipartite if and only if it contains an induced subgraph isomorphic to a $k$-vertex cycle, where $k$ is odd. We focus on the 3-coloring problem for $P_t$-free graphs that have only one prescribed induced odd cycle length. For any integer $t$ and any odd integer $k$, let $\mathcal{G}_{t,k}$ be the class of graphs that are $P_{t}$-free and all their induced odd cycles must be $C_k$. In this paper, we present a polynomial-time algorithm that solves the 3-coloring problem for any graph in $\mathcal{G}_{10,7}$.</description>

      <title>Hardness of Planarity for Weak Temporal Sequences of 2-Connected Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A weak deletion sequence is a sequence $(G_1,\ldots,G_n)$ of graphs so that for each $i\in[n-1]$ either $G_i$ is isomorphic to a subgraph of $G_{i+1}$, or vice versa: $G_{i+1}$ is isomorphic to a subgraph of $G_i$. We prove that determining the simultaneous planar embeddability of weak deletion sequences of $2$-connected graphs is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>A Factorization of the Log-Concavity Operator for Pascal Determinantal Arrays and Their Infinite Row-Wise Log-Concavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Pascal determinantal arrays $\PD_k$, whose entries $\PD_k(i,j)$ are the $k\times k$ minors of the lower-triangular Pascal matrix $P=( \binom{a}{b} )_{a,b\ge 0}$.
  We prove an exact factorization of the row-wise log-concavity operator:
  \[
  \LC(\PD_k)=\PD_{k-1}\Had\PD_{k+1},
  \]
  where $\LC(a)_j=a_j^2-a_{j-1}a_{j+1}$ and $\Had$ denotes the Hadamard (entrywise) product.
  This identity is established by an elementary manipulation of the Desnanot--Jacobi (Dodgson) identity in two adjacent positions.
  We further prove a general inequality asserting that the log-concavity operator is submultiplicative under Hadamard products of log-concave arrays:
  $\LC(A\Had X)\ge\LC(A)\Had\LC(X)$.
  Combining the factorization with this inequality yields a uniform algebraic proof that every row of every array $\PD_k$ ($k\ge 1$) is infinitely log-concave, extending the celebrated theorem of McNamara and Sagan from Pascal's triangle ($\PD_1$) to the entire determinantal hierarchy.
  Applications include the log-convexity of $\{\PD_k(i,j)\}_{k\ge 0}$ in the determinantal order $k$ and a family of determinantal Hadamard inequalities.</description>

      <title>Frame Numbers and Jacobson Radicals for Partial Geometries and Related Coherent Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the modular representation theory of rank $3$ association schemes arising from partial geometries with parameters $(s,t,\alpha)$. First, we obtain an explicit closed formula for the Frame number of the point scheme in terms of the number of points $v$ and the parameter $s+t+1-\alpha$, and use it to characterize the primes $p$ for which the adjacency algebra over $\mathbb{F}_p$ is not semisimple. We then give a complete case-by-case description of the Jacobson radical of this algebra in four arithmetic situations and determine the generic $p$-ranks of the adjacency matrices.
  As a step toward understanding the modular representation theory of coherent configurations of type $[3,2;3]$ associated with strongly regular designs, we analyze the relationship between the modular structure of the point scheme and that of the design algebra. For the generalized quadrangle $\mathrm{GQ}(2,2)$ we obtain partial results on the structure of the $2$-modular adjacency algebra $\mathbb{F}_2 \mathfrak{X}$, and we explain the representation-theoretic difficulties that prevent a complete determination of its Wedderburn decomposition and Gabriel quiver, which remains open and is formulated as Problem~6.8.</description>

      <title>Proof of a combinatorial conjecture posed in "The Blimpy Shape of Heady-s and Taily-s Bit Strings"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate three properties conjectured to hold for a certain function by Levin (2025) in a study of the blimpy graphical shape of the number of bit strings with a given score under an interesting scoring system. The properties include discrete convexity, a simple formula for the greatest argument at which the function is negative, and a positive expectation under a certain probability function. A new set of inequalities which imply the latter is presented and proved under some monotonicity assumptions.</description>

      <title>Berge Hamilton cycles in a random sparsification of dense hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard random graph process, edges are added to an initially empty graph one by one uniformly at random. A classic result by Ajtai, Koml\'os, and Szemer\'edi, and independently by Bollob\'as, states that in the standard random graph process, with high probability, the graph becomes Hamiltonian exactly when its minimum degree becomes $2$; this is known as a \emph{hitting time} result. Johansson extended this result by showing the following: For a graph $G$ with $\delta(G) \geq (1/2+\varepsilon)n$, in the random graph process constrained to the host graph $G$, the hitting times for minimum degree $2$ and Hamiltonicity still coincide with high probability.
  In this paper, we extend Johansson's result to Berge Hamilton cycles in hypergraphs. We prove that if an $r$-uniform hypergraph $H$ satisfies either $\delta_1(H) \geq (\frac{1}{2^{r-1}} + \varepsilon)\binom{n-1}{r-1}$ or $\delta_2(H) \geq \varepsilon n^{r-2}$, then in the random process generated by the edges of $H$, the time at which the hypergraph reaches minimum degree $2$ coincides with the time at which it contains a Berge Hamilton cycle with high probability. This generalizes the work of Bal, Berkowitz, Devlin, and Schacht, who established the result for the case where $H$ is a complete $r$-uniform hypergraph.</description>

      <title>Circular Chromatic Numbers, Balanceability, Relation Algebras, and Network Satisfaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize graphs with circular chromatic number less than 3 in terms of certain balancing labellings studied in the context of signed graphs. In fact, we construct a signed graph which is universal for all such labellings of graphs with circular chromatic number less than $3$, and is closely related to the generic circular triangle-free graph studied by Bodirsky and Guzm\'an-Pro. Moreover, our universal structure gives rise to a representation of the relation algebra $56_{65}$. We then use this representation to show that the network satisfaction problem described by this relation algebra belongs to NP. This concludes the full classification of the existence of a universal square representation, as well as the complexity of the corresponding network satisfaction problem, for relation algebras with at most four atoms.</description>

      <title>Bell Numbers and Stirling Numbers of the Mycielskian of Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish explicit formulas for Bell numbers and graphical Stirling numbers of complete multipartite graphs, complete bipartite graphs with removed perfect matchings, and Mycielskian trees. For complete multipartite graphs $K(n_1,\ldots,n_\ell)$, we provide a simplified proof that $B(G) = \prod_{i=1}^\ell \bell{n_i}$. We derive $B(K_{n,n} - M) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} \bell{k}^2$ for removed perfect matching $M$, and for Mycielskian star graphs, $B(M(St_n); 3) = 2^n + 1$ and $B(M(St_n); 2n) = 2n^2 - 3n + 3$. Results extend to Mycielskians of arbitrary trees. Our computational verifications establish links between graphical Bell numbers and fundamental sequences in combinatorics and pattern avoidance, including identification of several OEIS entries: A000051, A096376, A116735, A384980, A384981, A384988, A385432, and A385437.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial proofs of totals of some statistics on Catalan words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Catalan word is one on the alphabet of positive integers starting with $1$ in which each subsequent letter is at most one more than its predecessor. Let $\mathcal{C}_n$ denote the set of Catalan words of length $n$. In this paper, we give combinatorial proofs of explicit formulas for the sums of several parameter values taken over all the members of $\mathcal{C}_n$. In particular, we find such proofs for the parameters tracking the number of symmetric or $\ell$-valleys, which was previously requested by Baril et al. Further, we find a combinatorial explanation of a related Catalan number identity whose proof was also requested. To carry out our arguments, we consider corresponding statistics on Dyck paths and find the cardinality of certain sets of marked Dyck paths wherein one or more of the steps is distinguished from all others.</description>

      <title>A new improvement to the Overfull Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph with order $n$, maximum degree $\D(G)$, minimum degree $\delta(G)$ and chromatic index $\chi'(G)$, respectively. A graph $G$ is called {\em $\D$-critical} if $\chi'(G)=\D(G)+1$ and $\chi'(H)\textless \chi'(G)$ for every proper subgraph $H$ of $G$, and $G$ is overfull if $\left|E(G)\right|&gt;\Delta(G)\lfloor n/2\rfloor$. In 1986, Chetwynd and Hilton proposed the Overfull Conjecture: Every $\D$-critical graph $G$ with $\D(G)\textgreater\frac{n}{3}$ is overfull. The Overfull Conjecture has many implications, such as that it implies a polynomial-time algorithm for determining the chromatic index of graphs $G$ with $\D(G)\textgreater\frac{n}{3}$, and implies several longstanding conjectures in the area of graph edge coloring. Recently, Cao, Chen, Jing and Shan (SIAM J. Discrete Math. 2022) verified the Overfull Conjecture for $\D(G)-7\delta(G)/4\ge (3n-17)/4$. In this paper, we improve it for $\D(G)-5\delta(G)/3\ge (2n-7)/3$.</description>

      <title>Left regular bands with symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The representation theory of left regular band semigroup algebras is well-studied and known to have close connections with combinatorial topology, as established in the work of Margolis--Saliola--Steinberg ('15, '21). In this paper, we investigate the representation theory of the invariant subalgebras of left regular band semigroup algebras carrying the action of a finite group through the lens of group-equivariant combinatorial topology.
  We characterize when the invariant subalgebra is semisimple or commutative and examine the equivariant structure of the Peirce components of the semigroup algebra. For CW left regular bands, we interpret these Peirce components in terms of the equivariant topology of intervals in the support semilattice, yielding the Cartan invariants of the invariant subalgebras of left regular bands associated to CAT(0)-cube complexes. We also give a topological formula for the Peirce components for left regular bands with hereditary algebras. Finally, in specializing to left regular bands associated to geometric lattices, we explore generalizations of the Desarm\'{e}ni\'{e}n--Wachs derangement representation and their connections to Markov chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies short brooms in edge-chromatic critical graphs. We prove that for any short broom in a $\Delta$-critical graph, at most one color is missing at more than one vertex. Moreover, this color (if exists) is missing at exactly two vertices. Applying this result, we verify the Vertex-splitting Conjecture for graphs with $\Delta \geq 2(n-1)/3$ and the Overfull Conjecture for $\Delta$-critical graphs satisfying $\Delta \geq (2n+5\delta-12)/3$.</description>

      <title>A lower bound theorem for $d$-polytopes with at most $3d-1$ vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a lower bound theorem for the number of $k$-faces ($1\le k\le d-2$) in a $d$-dimensional polytope $P$ (or $d$-polytope) with up to $3d-1$ vertices. Previous lower bound theorems for $d$-polytopes with few vertices concern those with at most $2d$ vertices, $2d+1$ vertices, and $2d+2$ vertices.
  If $P$ has exactly $d+2$ facets and $2d+\ell$ vertices ($\ell\ge 1$), the lower bound is tight for certain combinations of $d$ and $\ell$. When $P$ has at least $d+3$ facets and $2d+\ell$ vertices ($\ell\ge 1$), the lower bound remains tight up to $\ell=d-1$, and equality for some $1\le k\le d-2$ is attained only when $P$ has precisely $d+3$ facets.
  We exhibit at least one minimiser for each number of vertices between $2d+1$ and $3d-1$, including two distinct minimisers with $2d+2$ vertices and three with $3d-2$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of Finite Distance Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the work of Gabriel Conant, we investigate the enumeration problems of finite distance monoids by applying the decomposition of Archimedean classes and studying their internal arithmetic progressions. Specifically, we first determine the exact value of $DM(n,2)$, which denotes the number of distance monoids on $n$ non-zero elements with Archimedean complexity $2$. This computation allows us to resolve a conjecture of Conant, establishing that the total number $DM(n)$ of distance monoids grows at least exponentially in $n$. Furthermore, we study the asymptotic behavior of $DM(n,n-k)$ for fixed $k$, proving that $DM(n,n-k) = O(n^k)$ and providing an exact formula for $DM(n,n-2)$.</description>

      <title>Intersection problems for linear codes and polynomials over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07547v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proves a stability result for a variation of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem in the context of polynomials over finite fields. Let $\mathcal F$ be a family of polynomials of degree at most $k \geq 3$ in $\mathbb F_q[X]$. Call $\mathcal F$ intersecting if for any two polynomials $f, g$ in $\mathcal F$, there exists a point $x \in \mathbb F_q$ for which $f(x) = g(x)$. An intersecting family is called a star if it consists of all polynomials $f$ with ${\rm deg } f \leq k$ such that $f(x) = y$ for some fixed points $x, y \in \mathbb F_q$. In this paper we prove that if $\mathcal F$ is an intersecting family with $|\mathcal F| \geq \frac 1{\sqrt 2} q^k + \mathcal O(q^{k-1})$, then $\mathcal F$ is contained in a star. In fact, we prove that this is still true if we also evaluate the polynomials "at infinity", which is equivalent to studying the problem for homogeneous bivariate polynomials.
  The proof technique extends to a general framework for intersection problems of linear codes $C$. One has to investigate the geometry of the projective system $\mathcal S$ associated to $C$. If the hyperplanes that don't intersect $\mathcal S$ are well spread out with respect to the points not on $\mathcal S$, then one obtains stability results, showing that any intersecting family of reasonably large size is contained in a star.</description>

      <title>The index of $t\mathcal{{C}}_{3}^{-}$-free signed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical spectral Tur\'{a}n problem is to determine the maximum spectral radius of an $F$-free graph of order $n$. This paper extends this framework to signed graphs. Let $\mathcal{C}_r^-$ be the set of all unbalanced signed graphs with underlying graphs $C_r$. Wang, Hou and Li [Linear Algebra Appl, 681 (2024) 47-65] previously determined the spectral Tur\'{a}n number of $\mathcal{C}_{3}^{-}$. In the present work, we characterize the extremal graphs that achieve the maximum index among all unbalanced signed graphs of order $n$ that are $t\mathcal{C}{3}^{-}$-free for $t\geq 2$. Furthermore, for $t\geq 3$, we identify the graphs with the second maximum index among all $t\mathcal{C}{3}^{-}$-free unbalanced signed graphs of fixed order $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a connected graph $G$, the equidistant dimension of $G$ represents the cardinality of the smallest set of vertices $S$ of $G$ such that for any two vertices $x,y\notin S$ there is at least one vertex in $S$ equidistant to both $x,y$ in terms of distances. In this article, we compute the equidistant dimension of some Cartesian product graphs including two-dimensional Hamming graphs, some hypercubes, prisms of cycle, and squared grid graphs.</description>

      <title>Exact supported co-degree bounds for Hamilton cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07751v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any $k\ge 3$ and $\ell \in [k-1]$ such that $(k,\ell) \ne (3,1)$, we show that any sufficiently large $k$-graph $G$ must contain a Hamilton $\ell$-cycle provided that it has no isolated vertices and every set of $k-1$ vertices contained in an edge is contained in at least $\left(1 - \frac{1}{\lfloor{\frac{k}{k-\ell}\rfloor}(k-\ell)}\right)n - (k - 3)$ edges. We also show that this bound is tight for infinitely many values of $k$ and $\ell$ and is off by at most $1$ for all others, and is hence essentially optimal. This improves an asymptotic version of this result due to Mycroft and Z\'arate-Guer\'en, and the case $\ell = k-1$ completely resolves a conjecture of Illingworth, Lang, M\"uyesser, Parczyk and Sgueglia.
  These results support the utility of $\textit{minimum}$ $\textit{supported}$ $\textit{co-degree}$ conditions in a $k$-graph, a recently introduced variant of the standard notion of minimum co-degree applicable to $k$-graphs with non-trivial strong independent sets. Our proof techniques involve a novel blow-up tiling framework introduced by Lang, avoiding traditional approaches using the regularity and blow-up lemmas.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of maps with the Dumitriu-Edelman model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an expansion in $1/N$ and $\beta$ of the cumulants of power sums of the particles of the $\beta$-ensemble. This new expansion is obtained using the tridiagonal model of Dumitriu and Edelman. The coefficients of the expansion are expressed in terms of suitably labelled maps introduced by Bouttier, Fusy, and Guitter. Our expansion is of a different nature than the one obtained by LaCroix in is study of the $b$-conjecture of Goulden and Jackson, and involves only orientable maps. We are able to relate bijectively the first two orders of our expansion to the one of LaCroix using a novel many-to-one mapping that relates suitably labelled planar maps with two minima and maps on the projective plane.</description>

      <title>Nahm sum identities for Cartan matrices of type $D_k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Around 2007, Warnaar proved four identities related to Nahm sums associated with twice the inverse of the Cartan matrix of type $D_k$. Three of these had been conjectured by Flohr, Grabow, and Koehn, while special cases of two of the identities were first conjectured in 1993 by Kedem, Klassen, McCoy, and Melzer. Warnaar's proof relies on a multi-sum identity from Andrews' proof of the Andrews-Gordon identities. We give a new proof of all four identities using the theory of Bailey pairs. Furthermore, we establish a parametric generalization of two of the identities and provide two distinct proofs of this generalization.</description>

      <title>On the hardness of recognizing graphs of small mim-width and its variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mim-width of a graph is a powerful structural parameter that, when bounded by a constant, allows several hard problems to be polynomial-time solvable - with a recent meta-theorem encompassing a large class of problems [SODA2023]. Since its introduction, several variants such as sim-width and omim-width were developed, along with a linear version of these parameters. It was recently shown that mim-width and all these variants all paraNP-hard, a consequence of the NP-hardness of distinguishing between graphs of linear mim-width at most 1211 and graphs of sim-width at least 1216 [ICALP2025]. The complexity of recognizing graphs of small width, particularly those close to $1$, remained open, despite their especially attractive algorithmic applications.
  In this work, we show that the width recognition problems remain NP-hard even on small widths. Specifically, after introducing the novel parameter Omim-width sandwiched between omim-width and mim-width, we show that: (1) deciding whether a graph has sim-width = 1, omim-width = 1, or Omin-width = 1 is NP-hard, and the same is true for their linear variants; (2) the problems of deciding whether mim-width $\leq$ 2 or linear mim-width $\leq$ 2 are both NP-hard. Interestingly, our reductions are relatively simple and are from the Unrooted Quartet Consistency problem, which is of great interest in computational biology but is not commonly used (if ever) in the theory of algorithms.</description>

      <title>Rogers-Ramanujan type identities at $\Lambda_0$ from perfect crystals of exceptional quantum affine algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive Rogers--Ramanujan type partition identities at the fundamental weight $\Lambda_0$ for the exceptional affine types $G_2^{(1)}$, $D_4^{(3)}$, $F_4^{(1)}$, $E_6^{(2)}$, $E_6^{(1)}$, $E_7^{(1)}$ and $E_8^{(1)}$. Our starting point is the Dousse--Konan reformulation of the $(\mathrm{KMN})^2$ crystal character formula, applied to the level-one perfect crystal $B=B(\theta)\sqcup B(0)$ of Benkart--Frenkel--Kang--Lee with ground element $\phi\in B(0)$. This realizes the normalized character $e^{-\Lambda_0}\mathrm{ch} L(\Lambda_0)$ as generating functions of grounded $B$-colored partitions governed locally by the crystal energy. After principal specialization, we obtain a colored partition model subject to explicit difference, congruence, and initial conditions. On the product side, under the same specialization, the Weyl--Kac character formula yields an explicit Euler-type product, equivalently the generating function for partitions with parts in a concrete allowed set. Comparing the two specializations gives coefficientwise equalities of generating functions. A key computational feature is that the difference matrix can be produced from the crystal data without explicitly computing the energy function. For each type we tabulate the congruence data, forbidden initial parts, and the full difference matrix, and we provide reproducible coefficient checks.</description>

      <title>Generalized Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebras on decorated rooted forests by weighted cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of rooted trees is an operated Hopf algebra whose coproduct satisfies the classical Hochschild 1-cocycle condition. In this paper, we extend the setting from rooted trees to the space $H_{\rm RT}(X,\Omega)$ of $(X,\Omega)$-rooted trees, in which internal vertices are decorated by a set $\Omega$ and leafs are decorated by $X \cup \Omega$. We introduce a new coalgebra structure on $H_{\rm RT}(X,\Omega)$ whose coproduct satisfies a weighted Hochschild 1-cocycle condition involving multiple operators, thereby generalizing the classical condition. A combinatorial interpretation of this coproduct is also provided. We then endow $H_{\rm RT}(X,\Omega)$ with a Hopf algebra structure. Finally, we define weighted $\Omega$-cocycle Hopf algebras, characterized by a Hochschild 1-cocycle condition with weights, and show that $H_{\rm RT}(X,\Omega)$ is the free object in the category of $\Omega$-cocycle Hopf algebras.</description>

Abstract: We study the totally nonnegative part of the Peterson variety in arbitrary Lie type and establish its connection to the strongly dominant weight polytope. In particular, we prove that the totally nonnegative part of the Peterson variety is a regular CW-complex, which is homeomorphic to a cube as a cell-decomposed space. This confirms a conjecture of Rietsch for all Lie types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a combinatorial version of the Intersection Hodge Conjecture for projective toric varieties. The conjecture asserts that the subspace of rational Hodge classes in the intersection cohomology $IH^*(X_\Sigma)$ is generated by the classes of algebraic cycles. We define the space of combinatorial Hodge classes, $Hdg^k_{\mathrm{comb}}(\Sigma) \subset IH^{2k}_{\mathrm{comb}}(\Sigma, \mathbb{Q})$, using the combinatorial intersection cohomology theory for fans developed by Barthel, Brasselet, Fieseler, and Kaup. We conjecture that this space is spanned by the combinatorial cycle classes corresponding to torus-invariant subvarieties. We verify this conjecture for all projective toric varieties of dimension $n \le 3$ and for the class of simplicial projective toric varieties. Finally, we provide an algorithmic framework to verify the conjecture for arbitrary rational fans.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Komjath studied the list chromatic number of infinite graphs and introduced the notion of restricted list chromatic number. For a graph $X=(V_X,E_X)$ and a cardinal $\kappa$, we say that $X$ is restricted list colorable for $\kappa$ if for every $L:V_X\to[\kappa]^\kappa$ there is a choice function $c$ of $L$ such that $c(v)\neq c(w)$ whenever ${v,w}\in E_X$. In this paper, we discuss a variation, stationary list colorability for $\kappa$, obtained by replacing $[\kappa]^\kappa$ with the set of all stationary subsets of $\kappa$. We compare the stationary list colorability with other coloring properties. Among other things, we prove that the stationary list colorability is essentially different from other coloring properties including the restricted list colorability. We also prove the consistency result showing that for some $\kappa&lt;\lambda$, restricted and stationary list colorability at $\kappa$ do not imply the corresponding properties at $\lambda$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07373v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we establish a connection between copositivity, that is, nonnegativity on the positive orthant, of sparse real Laurent polynomials and discriminants. Specifically, we consider Laurent polynomials in the positive orthant with fixed support and fixed coefficient signs. We provide a criterion to decide whether a given polynomial is copositive that is based in determining the intersection points of the signed discriminant and a path going through the coefficients of the polynomial. If the signed support satisfies a combinatorial condition termed nonseparability, we show additionally that this intersection consists of one point, and that tracking one path in homotopy continuation methods suffices to decide upon copositivity.
  Building on these results, we show that any copositive polynomial with nonseparable signed support can be decomposed into a sum of nonnegative circuit polynomials, generalising thereby previously known supports having this property.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Geometric Polynomials via Geometric Polynomials and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to show that harmonic geometric polynomials can be represented in terms of geometric polynomials. This problem was first considered by Keller [14]; however, the corresponding coefficients were not fully determined. In the present work, we provide several explicit representations of harmonic geometric polynomials in terms of geometric polynomials. Moreover, several applications of one of these representations are subsequently developed. In particular, we obtain a generalization of the classical identity for the harmonic numbers, compute an integral involving harmonic geometric polynomials and an integral involving products of harmonic geometric and geometric polynomials in terms of Bernoulli numbers. These integral formulas lead to new explicit expressions for Bernoulli numbers. In addition, we give several recurrence relations for harmonic geometric polynomials and evaluate a finite sum involving harmonic numbers and positive powers of integers.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Decision Problems for Relational Pattern Languages under Various Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patterns are words with terminals and variables. The language of a pattern is the set of words obtained by uniformly substituting all variables with words that contain only terminals. In their original definition, patterns only allow for multiple distinct occurrences of some variables to be related by the equality relation, represented by using the same variable multiple times. In an extended notion, called relational patterns and relational pattern languages, variables may be related by arbitrary other relations. We extend the ongoing investigation of the main decision problems for patterns (namely, the membership problem, the inclusion problem, and the equivalence problem) to relational pattern languages under a wide range of individual relations. It is shown show that - even for many much simpler or less restrictive relations - the complexity and (un)decidability characteristics of these problems do not change compared to the classical case where variables are related only by equality.</description>

Abstract: We consider the spherical variety of quadratic forms over a quadratically closed field of characteristic 2, and determine its orbits for the action of the Borel subgroup of upper triangular matrices. We exhibit a connection between these orbits and the Catalan triangle numbers. In addition, we describe explicitly a natural Weyl group action on the set of Borel orbit double covers</description>

      <title>Quantitative indistinguishability and sparse and dense clusters in factor of IID percolations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chifan-Ioana (2010) implies that, for any factor of IID percolation on any nonamenable Cayley graph $G$, there is a countable set of (strong) indistinguishability classes for non-hyperfinite clusters. We introduce quantitative strengthenings, called (qI) and (qSI): for $\eta$-non-hyperfinite clusters, there are at most $M(G,\eta)&lt;\infty$ (strong) indistinguishability classes, for any FIID percolation.
  We first show that (qI) and (qSI) for any $G$ are equivalent to the ``sparse implies thin'' property (SiT): any FIID percolation with $\eta$-non-hyperfinite clusters has density at least $c(G,\eta)&gt;0$. Also, (SiT) is independent of the finite generating set of a group. We prove, using entropy inequalities, that (SiT) holds for free groups, even for weak FIIDs. On the other hand, recent work of Jard\'on-S\'anchez, Mellick, Poulin, and Wr\'obel implies that (SiT) fails for weak FIIDs on non-exact, i.e., not property (A) groups.
  Furthermore, (SiT) implies that the Bernoulli graphing over any non-hyperfinite FIID cluster is strongly ergodic, and that indistinguishability for non-hyperfinite FIID clusters is equivalent to strong indistinguishability. These results follow from the work of Chifan-Ioana for every nonamenable Cayley graph, but with non-probabilistic proofs.
  We also prove, again using entropy inequalities, this time for all nonamenable Cayley graphs, that any FIID percolation with high enough expected degree must have a density close to 1, and there must be a single indistinguishability class of such clusters. On Kazhdan groups, there must be a single such cluster.
  Our results have finite counterparts: in any large girth $d$-regular graph sequence, any FIID subgraph of average degree at least $2+\delta$ must have density at least $c(d,\delta)&gt;0$. In the uniform random d-regular graph $G_{n,d}$, this holds for every subgraph of average degree at least $2+\delta$.</description>

      <title>The local homological structure of generalized splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized splines are a simultaneous generalization of GKM theory -- which studies equivariant cohomology -- and classical splines, which provide piecewise approximations of functions. Generalized splines can also be understood via schemes, with the interpolation constraints -- or so-called GKM-condition -- encoded by gluing along certain closed subschemes. This view provides a local-global principle, with the local pictures retaining the generalized spline structure. Consequently, the behavior of generalized splines over local rings controls certain global phenomena, such as projectivity and often freeness.
  We introduce an interface between the homological study of local rings and the combinatorial study of generalized splines. We identify precisely how the generalized spline structure coordinates with the existing homological local ring machinery. This is accomplished by two exact sequences that provide a regulatory structure on the local cohomology of a generalized spline module. As an application, we use this to prove that for any edge-labeled graph $G$ with principal ideal labels, and any Cohen-Macaulay ring $R$ of Krull dimension 2 at each maximal ideal, the module of splines $R_G$ is free, provided it has finite projective dimension. As a special case, this implies every generalized spline module over $k[x,y]$ with principal edge labels is free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14216v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of cellular automata (CA) called stable cellular automata (SCA) that preserve stability by reflection, modulo-recurrent, and richness. After applying these automata to Sturmian words, we determine some of their combinatorial properties. Next, we calculate the classical and palindromic complexity functions of these words. Finally, we demonstrate that these words are $2$-balanced and establish their abelian complexity function.</description>

      <title>Disconnected Common Graphs via Supersaturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09296v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $H$ is said to be common if the number of monochromatic labelled copies of $H$ in a $2$-colouring of the edges of a large complete graph is asymptotically minimized by a random colouring. It is well known that the disjoint union of two common graphs may be uncommon; e.g., $K_2$ and $K_3$ are common, but their disjoint union is not. We investigate the commonality of disjoint unions of multiple copies of $K_3$ and $K_2$. As a consequence of our results, we obtain an example of a pair of uncommon graphs whose disjoint union is common. Our approach is to reduce the problem of showing that certain disconnected graphs are common to a constrained optimization problem in which the constraints are derived from supersaturation bounds related to Razborov's Triangle Density Theorem. We also improve bounds on the Ramsey multiplicity constant of a triangle with a pendant edge and the disjoint union of $K_3$ and $K_2$.</description>

      <title>Complete non-ambiguous trees and associated permutations: new enumerative results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a link between complete non-ambiguous trees (CNATs) and permutations exhibited by Daniel Chen and Sebastian Ohlig in recent work. In this, they associate a certain permutation to the leaves of a CNAT, and show that the number of $n$-permutations that are associated with exactly one CNAT is $2^{n-2}$. We connect this to work by the first author and co-authors linking complete non-ambiguous trees and the acyclic orientation number of the associated permutation graph. This allows us to prove a number of conjectures by Chen and Ohlig on the number of $n$-permutations that are associated with exactly $k$ CNATs for various $k &gt; 1$, via various bijective correspondences between such permutations. We also exhibit a new bijection between $(n-1)$-permutations and CNATs whose permutation is the decreasing permutation $n(n-1)\cdots1$. This bijection maps the left-to-right minima of the permutation to dots on the top row of the corresponding CNAT, and descents of the permutation to empty rows of the CNAT.</description>

      <title>Colorings of $k$-sets with low discrepancy on small sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $0&lt;\delta\leq 1$, let $R_k(m;\delta)$ denote the smallest $N$ such that every coloring of $k$-element subsets by two colors yields an $m$-element set $M$ with relative discrepancy $\delta$, which means that one color class has at least $(\frac{1+\delta}2){m\choose k}$ elements. The number $R_k(m;\delta)$ may be viewed as an extension of the usual $k$-hypergraph Ramsey number because $R_k(m)=R_k(m,1)$. Our main result is the following theorem.
  %\begin{theorem} For some constants $c,k_0$, and $\eps&gt;0$, and for all $k\geq k_0$, $c\log k\leq n\leq k/11$, \[ R_k(k+n);2^{-\eps n})\geq \tw_{\lfloor k/n\rfloor}(2). \] %\end{theorem}
  In particular, for $n=\lceil c\log k\rceil$, we get a tower of height $\delta k/\log k$ and relative discrepancy polynomial in~$k$.</description>

      <title>Hypertree shrinking avoiding low degree vertices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shrinking operation converts a hypergraph into a graph by choosing, from each hyperedge, two endvertices of a corresponding graph edge. A hypertree is a hypergraph which can be shrunk to a tree on the same vertex set. Klimo\v{s}ov\'{a} and Thomass\'{e} [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 156 (2022), 250--293] proved (as a tool to obtain their main result on edge-decompositions of graphs into paths of equal length) that any rank $3$ hypertree $T$ can be shrunk to a tree where the degree of each vertex is at least $1/100$ times its degree in $T$. We prove a stronger and a more general bound, replacing the constant $1/100$ with $1/2k$ when the rank is $k$. In place of entropy compression (used by Klimo\v{s}ov\'{a} and Thomass\'{e}), we use a hypergraph orientation lemma combined with a characterisation of edge-coloured graphs admitting rainbow spanning trees.</description>

      <title>Hyper-bishops, Hyper-rooks, and Hyper-queens: Percentage of Safe Squares on Higher Dimensional Chess Boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04423v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $n$ queens problem considers the maximum number of safe squares on an $n \times n$ chess board when placing $n$ queens; the answer is only known for small $n$. Miller, Sheng and Turek considered instead $n$ randomly placed rooks, proving the proportion of safe squares converges to $1/e^2$. We generalize and solve when randomly placing $n$ hyper-rooks and $n^{k-1}$ line-rooks on a $k$-dimensional board, using combinatorial and probabilistic methods, with the proportion of safe squares converging to $1/e^k$. We prove that the proportion of safe squares on an $n \times n$ board with bishops in 2 dimensions converges to $2/e^2$. This problem is significantly more interesting and difficult; while a rook attacks the same number of squares wherever it's placed, this is not so for bishops. We expand to the $k$-dimensional chessboard, defining line-bishops to attack along $2$-dimensional diagonals and hyper-bishops to attack in the $k-1$ dimensional subspace defined by its diagonals in the $k-2$ dimensional subspace. We then combine the movement of rooks and bishops to consider the movement of queens in 2 dimensions, as well as line-queens and hyper-queens in $k$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>A degenerate version of Brion's formula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{p} \subset V$ be a polytope and $\xi \in V_{\mathbb{C}}^*$. We obtain an expression for $I(\mathfrak{p}; \alpha) := \int_{\mathfrak{p}} e^{\langle \alpha, x \rangle} dx$ as a sum of meromorphic functions in $\alpha \in V^*_{\mathbb{C}}$ parametrized by the faces $\mathfrak{f}$ of $\mathfrak{p}$ on which $\langle \xi, x \rangle$ is constant. Each term only depends on the local geometry of $\mathfrak{p}$ near $\mathfrak{f}$ (and on $\xi$) and is holomorphic at $\alpha = \xi$. When $\langle \xi, \cdot \rangle$ is only constant on the vertices of $\mathfrak{p}$ our formula reduces to Brion's formula.
  Suppose $\mathfrak{p}$ is a rational polytope with respect to a lattice $\Lambda$. We obtain an expression for $S(\mathfrak{p}; \alpha) := \sum_{\lambda \in \mathfrak{p} \cap \Lambda} e^{\langle \alpha, \lambda \rangle}$ as a sum of meromorphic functions parametrized by the faces $\mathfrak{f}$ on which $e^{\langle \xi, x \rangle} = 1$ on a finite index sublattice of $\text{lin}(\mathfrak{f}) \cap \Lambda$. Each term only depends on the local geometry of $\mathfrak{p}$ near $\mathfrak{f}$ (and on $\xi$ and $\Lambda$) and is holomorphic at $\alpha = \xi$. When $e^{\langle \xi, \cdot \rangle} \neq 1$ at any non-zero lattice point on a line through the origin parallel to an edge of $\mathfrak{p}$, our formula reduces to Brion's formula, and when $\xi = 0$, it reduces to the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial.
  Our formulas are particularly useful for understanding how $I(\mathfrak{p}(h); \xi)$ and $S(\mathfrak{p}(h); \xi)$ vary in a family of polytopes $\mathfrak{p}(h)$ with the same normal fan. When considering dilates of a fixed polytope, our formulas may be viewed as polytopal analogues of Laplace's method and the method of stationary phase. Such expressions naturally show up in analysis on symmetric spaces and affine buildings.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Hardness Results for Conflict-free Choosability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A '(partial) conflict-free coloring' of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ is an assignment of colors to (a subset of) the vertex set of $\mathcal{H}$ such that every hyperedge in $\mathcal{H}$ has a vertex whose color is distinct from every other vertex in that hyperedge. The minimum number of colors required for such a coloring is known as the '(partial) conflict-free chromatic number' of $\mathcal{H}$. It is easy to see that the conflict-free chromatic number of a hypergraph is at most its partial conflict-free chromatic number plus one. Conflict-free coloring has also been studied on the open/closed neighborhood hypergraphs of a given graph under the name open/closed neighborhood conflict-free coloring. In this paper, we study partial and full list variants of conflict-free coloring where, for every vertex $v$, we are given a list of admissible colors $L_v$ such that $v$ is allowed to be colored only from $L_v$.
  Bhyravarapu, Kalyanasundaram, and Mathew [Journal of Graph Theory, 2021] showed that the closed-neighborhood conflict-free chromatic number of any graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$ is at most $O(\ln^2 \Delta)$. In this paper, we extend the $O(\ln^2 \Delta)$ upper bound to the partial list variant of the closed-neighborhood conflict-free chromatic number. Further, we establish computational complexity results concerning the list open/closed-neighborhood conflict-free chromatic numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple graph of order $n$. A Majority Roman Dominating Function (MRDF) on a graph G is a function $f: V\rightarrow\{-1, +1, 2\}$ if the sum of its function values over at least half the closed neighborhoods is at least one , this is , for at least half of the vertices $v\in V$, $f(N[v])\geq 1$. Moreover, every vertex u with $f(u)=-1$ is adjacent to at least one vertex $w$ with $f(w)=2$. The Majority Roman Domination number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\gamma_{MR}(G)$ , is the minimum value of $\sum_{v\in{V(G)}}f(v)$ over all Majority Roman Dominating Function $f$ of $G$.

      <title>Joint equidistributions of mesh patterns 123 and 321 with symmetric and minus-antipodal shadings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend recent results by Lv and Kitaev by proving 20 (out of 22 possible) joint equidistributions of mesh patterns 123 and 321 with symmetric shadings, as well as all 36 joint equidistributions of these patterns with minus-antipodal shadings. Our results link several joint equidistributions of mesh patterns to various integer sequences, including unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind, harmonic numbers, and the numbers of inversion sequences avoiding a certain vincular pattern studied by Lin and Yan.</description>

      <title>Full subcomplexes of Bier spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full subcomplexes of a simplicial complex encode essential structure for understanding the complex itself. For a simplicial complex $K$, possibly with a ghost vertex, the Bier sphere of $K$ is a simplicial sphere obtained as the deleted join of $K$ and its combinatorial Alexander dual. In this paper, we determine the homotopy types of all full subcomplexes of Bier spheres. As applications, we provide a formula for the bigraded Betti numbers of the Bier sphere of $K$ in terms of full subcomplexes of $K$, and we explicitly describe the cohomology of real toric manifolds associated with Bier spheres.</description>

      <title>Set families: restricted distances via restricted intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12296v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denote by $f_D(n)$ the maximum size of a set family $\mathcal{F}$ on $[n] \stackrel{\mbox{\normalfont\tiny def}}{=} \{1, \dots, n\}$ with distance set $D$. That is, $|A \bigtriangleup B| \in D$ holds for every pair of distinct sets $A, B \in \mathcal{F}$. Kleitman's celebrated discrete isodiametric inequality states that $f_D(n)$ is maximized at Hamming balls of radius $d/2$ when $D = \{1, \dots, d\}$. We study the generalization where $D$ is a set of arithmetic progression and determine $f_D(n)$ asymptotically for all homogeneous $D$. In the special case when $D$ is an interval, our result confirms a conjecture of Huang, Klurman, and Pohoata. Moreover, we demonstrate a dichotomy in the growth of $f_D(n)$, showing linear growth in $n$ when $D$ is a non-homogeneous arithmetic progression. Different from previous combinatorial and spectral approaches, we deduce our results by converting the restricted distance problems to restricted intersection problems.
  Our proof ideas can be adapted to prove upper bounds on $t$-distance sets in Hamming cubes (also known as binary $t$-codes), which has been extensively studied by algebraic combinatorialists community, improving previous bounds from polynomial methods and optimization approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of joint equidistributions of mesh patterns 123 and 132 with the same symmetric shadings was recently initiated by Kitaev and Lv, where 75 of 80 potential joint equidistributions were proven. In this paper, we prove 112 out of 126 potential joint equidistributions of mesh patterns 123 and 132 with the same minus antipodal shadings. As a byproduct, we present 562 joint equidistribution results for non-symmetric and non-minus-antipodal shadings. To achieve this, we construct bijections, find recurrence relations, and obtain generating functions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the joint distributions of several pairs of mesh patterns are related to the unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind.</description>

      <title>Ramsey numbers for sparse graphs versus path or cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11835v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ramsey numbers $r(G, C_k)$ and $r(G, P_k)$ involving cycles and paths are fundamental objects in extremal combinatorics. We substantially improve the seminal 1982 result of Burr, Erd\H{o}s, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp by weakening the key conditions required on the graph $G$. Our improvements are mainly driven by a novel reconstruction of the end-edge matching and an enhancement of the dichotomy lemma of Burr et al. (1982).
  For odd cycles $C_k$ ($k\ge3$), we prove that $r(G, C_k) = 2n-1$ holds for connected $n$-vertex graphs $G$ under two density regimes: either $n = \Omega(k^2)$ with $e(G) \le (1 + O(1/k^2)) n$, or $n = \Omega(k)$ with minimum degree $\delta(G)\ge2$ and $e(G) \le (1 + O(1/k^2)) n$.
  For paths $P_k$ ($k\ge2$), we prove that $r(G, P_k) = \max\{ n + \lfloor k/2\rfloor - 1, n + k - 2 - \alpha' - \gamma \},$ under analogous relaxed conditions: either $n = \Omega(k^2)$ with $e(G) \le (1 + O(1/k^2)) n$, or $n = \Omega(k)$ with $\delta(G)\ge2$ and $e(G) \le (1 + O(1/k)) n$. Here $\alpha'$ is the independence number of an appropriate subgraph of $G$ and $\gamma=0$ if $k-1$ divides $n+k-3-\alpha'$, and $\gamma=1$ otherwise.
  Consequently, our results unify and recover the classical exact results $r(C_n,C_k)=2n-1$ for odd $k\ge3$ and $n=\Omega(k)$, and $r(P_n,P_k)=r(C_n,P_k)=n+\left\lfloor\frac{k}{2}\right\rfloor-1$ for $k\ge2$ and $n=\Omega(k)$. In these corollaries, the requirement $n=\Omega(k)$ is tight up to a constant factor, and the quadratic condition $n=\Omega(k^2)$ for general sparse graphs highlights the significant effect of leaves.</description>

      <title>A proof of the Kim-Vu sandwich conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2004, Kim and Vu conjectured that, when $d=\omega(\log n)$, the random $d$-regular graph $G_d(n)$ can be sandwiched with high probability between two random binomial graphs $G(n,p)$ with edge probabilities asymptotically equal to $\frac{d}{n}$. That is, there should exist $p_*=(1-o(1))\frac{d}{n}$, $p^*=(1+o(1))\frac{d}{n}$ and a coupling $(G_*,G,G^*)$ such that $G_*\sim G(n,p_*)$, $G\sim G_d(n)$, $G^*\sim G(n,p^*)$, and $\mathbb{P}(G_*\subset G\subset G^*)=1-o(1)$. Known as the sandwich conjecture, such a coupling is desirable as it would allow properties of the random regular graph to be inferred from those of the more easily studied binomial random graph. The conjecture was recently shown to be true when $d\gg\log^4n$ by Gao, Isaev and McKay. In this paper, we prove the sandwich conjecture in full. We do so by analysing a natural coupling procedure introduced in earlier work by Gao, Isaev and McKay, which had only previously been done when $d\gg n/\sqrt{\log n}$.</description>

Abstract: The closed neighborhood complex $\mathcal{N}[G]$ of a simple graph $G$ is the simplicial complex whose simplices are finite sets of vertices contained in a closed neighborhood of a vertex in $G$. We reveal that the closed neighborhood complex has close connections with other concepts, including the independence complex of the canonical double covering and the independence complex of the neighborhood hypergraph. Furthermore, we show that the fundamental group of the closed neighborhood complex is isomorphic to Grigor'yan--Lin--Muranov--Yau's fundamental group of a graph introduced in the study of path homology.</description>

      <title>On the nullspace of split graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nullspace of the adjacency matrix of split graphs, whose vertex set can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. We introduce the clique-kernel, a subspace that decides whether clique vertices lie in the support of a kernel eigenvector, and we prove that its dimension is at most one. This yields the formula $null(Sp) = null(R) + \dim(\mathrm{Cker}(Sp))$, which fully describes the nullity of a split graph in terms of the biadjacency submatrix $R$. We also analyze unbalanced split graphs through the concept of swing vertices and characterize the structure of their kernel supports. Furthermore, we study the behavior of the nullspace under Tyshkevich composition and derive a closed formula for the determinant. These results provide a unified algebraic framework for understanding when a split graph is singular and how its combinatorial structure determines its nullspace.</description>

      <title>The chromatic number of finite projective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chromatic number of the finite projective space $\mathrm{PG}(n-1,q)$, denoted $\chi_q(n)$, is the minimum number of colors needed to color its points so that no line is monochromatic. We establish a recursive upper bound $\chi_q(n) \leq \chi_q(d) + \chi_q(n - d)$ for all $1 \leq d &lt; n$ and use it to prove new upper bounds on $\chi_q(n)$ for all $q$. For $q = 2$, we further refine this recursion and prove that \[ \chi_2(n) \le \lfloor 2n/3 \rfloor + 1 \] for all $n \ge 2$, and that this bound is tight for all $n \le 7$. In particular, this recovers all previously known cases for $n \le 6$ and resolves the first open case $n = 7$. On the lower-bound side, using a connection with multicolor Ramsey numbers for triangles, we note that \[ \chi_2(n) \ge (1 - o(1))\,\frac{n}{\log n}. \]
  We also consider $\chi_q(t;n)$, the minimum number of colors needed to color the points of $\mathrm{PG}(n-1,q)$ with no monochromatic $(t - 1)$-dimensional subspace, and establish an equivalence between $\chi_q(t;n)$ and the multicolor vector-space Ramsey numbers $R_q(t;k)$. Using this equivalence together with our upper bounds on $\chi_q(t;n)$, we improve, for every fixed $t$, the best known lower bounds on $R_q(t;k)$ from $\Omega_q(\log k)$ to $\Omega(k)$.</description>

      <title>The Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa (Marton) Conjecture in Integers and Finite Fields via Spectral Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We settle the Polynomial Freiman--Ruzsa (PFR/Marton) conjecture for the integers and for cyclic groups. More precisely, we show that if $A$ is a finite subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ with $|A+A| \le K|A|$, then there is a subgroup $H$ of index at most $K^{O(1)}$ such that $A$ is contained in at most $K^{O(1)}$ cosets of $H$. The proof is based on a new spectral stability dichotomy for the $L^4$ Fourier mass of $\mathbf{1}_A$: either this mass is concentrated on a span of size $K^{O(1)}$, or, after passing to a quotient of codimension $K^{O(1)}$, the doubling constant of the image of $A$ decreases by a definite power of $K$. Using Freiman modeling we transfer this dichotomy to cyclic groups, obtain polynomial Bogolyubov-type bounds, and deduce Marton's conjecture in $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$. As a corollary, we also recover and extend the finite-field formulation of Marton's conjecture: in odd characteristic we obtain a direct spectral proof, and together with the characteristic-2 result of Green, Gowers, Manners, and Tao this yields a complete resolution of the conjecture for all finite fields. For context beyond finite fields, we recall their theorem for abelian groups of bounded exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2005.06326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial Game Theory(CGT)is a branch of Game Theory that has developed largely independently of Economic Game Theory (EGT), and is concerned with deep mathematical properties of two-player zero-sum games recursively defined over various combinatorial structures. The aim of this work is to lay the foundations for bridging the conceptual and technical gaps between CGT and EGT, here interpreted as multiplayer Extensive Form Games, so that they can be treated within a unified framework. More specifically, we introduce a class of $n$-player, general-sum games, called {\sc Cumulative Games}, which can be analyzed using tools from both CGT and EGT. We show how two of the most fundamental definitions of CGT, the outcome function and the disjunctive sum operator, naturally extend to the class of {\sc Cumulative Games}. The outcome function allows for efficient equilibrium computation under certain restrictions, while the disjunctive sum operator lets us define a partial order over games according to the advantage that a given player has. Finally, we show that any Extensive Form Game can be written as a {\sc Cumulative Game}.</description>

Abstract: We study a family of determinantal ideals whose decompositions encode the structural zeros in conditional independence models with hidden variables. We provide explicit decompositions of these ideals and, for certain subclasses of models, we show that this is a decomposition into radical ideals by displaying Gr\"obner bases for the components. We identify conditions under which the components are prime, and establish formulas for the dimensions of these prime ideals.
  Moreover, we show that the components in the decomposition can be grouped into equivalence classes defined by their combinatorial structure, and we derive a closed formula for the number of such classes.</description>

The proof is by contradiction, it is simply shown that the tiling complement of such a tile can not annihilate all $p$-subgroups.

      <title>Algebraic study on rooted products of graphs and multi-clique corona graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study rooted products of graphs from the perspective of combinatorial commutative algebra. For edge ideals, we introduce the 2-Cohen-Macaulayness with respect to a vertex and use it to investigate when edge ideals of rooted products of graphs are Cohen-Macaulay. Moreover, we completely determine when attaching a graph on at most six vertices to a given graph as rooted products, yields a Cohen-Macaulay edge ideal. Also, we define mulit-clique corona graphs as a generalization of clique-corona graphs and multi-whisker graphs. We prove that multi-clique corona graphs are vertex decomposable and hence sequentially Cohen-Macaulay. Also, we give formulas for the projective dimension and the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity.</description>

Abstract: The $t$-connected ideal of a graph $G$ is generated by all connected induced subgraphs of $G$ with $t$ vertices. When $t = 2$, this coincides with the usual edge ideal of the graph. Following the work of Faridi et al., we give a classification of the graphs whose $t$-connected ideals are minimally resolved by their Scarf complex. We also consider the $t$-path ideal of a graph $G$ which is the ideal generated by all paths of length $t$ in $G$. In this case, we are able to give a classification of the same type for paths of length $t = 4$.</description>
