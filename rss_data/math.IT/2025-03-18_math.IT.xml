      <title>On polycyclic linear and additive codes associated to a trinomial over a finite chain ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate polycyclic codes associated with a trinomial of arbitrary degree $n$ over a finite chain ring $ R.$ We extend the concepts of $ n $-isometry and $ n $-equivalence known for constacyclic codes to this class of codes, providing a broader framework for their structural analysis. We describe the classes of $n$-equivalence and compute their number, significantly reducing the study of trinomial codes over $R$. Additionally, we examine the special case of trinomials of the form $ x^n - a_1x - a_0 \in R[x] $ and analyze their implications. Finally, we consider the extension of our results to certain trinomial additive codes over $ R.$</description>

      <title>Robust Full-Space Physical Layer Security for STAR-RIS-Aided Wireless Networks: Eavesdropper with Uncertain Location and Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A robust full-space physical layer security (PLS) transmission scheme is proposed in this paper considering the full-space wiretapping challenge of wireless networks supported by simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS). Different from the existing schemes, the proposed PLS scheme takes account of the uncertainty on the eavesdropper's position within the 360$^\circ$ service area offered by the STAR-RIS. Specifically, the large system analytical method is utilized to derive the asymptotic expression of the average security rate achieved by the security user, considering that the base station (BS) only has the statistical information of the eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI) and the uncertainty of its location. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed PLS scheme, we first formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the weighted sum rate of the security user and the public user. This optimization is conducted under the power allocation constraint, and some practical limitations for STAR-RIS implementation, through jointly designing the active and passive beamforming variables. A novel iterative algorithm based on the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) and cross-entropy optimization (CEO) methods is proposed to effectively address the established non-convex optimization problem with discrete variables. Simulation results indicate that the proposed robust PLS scheme can effectively mitigate the information leakage across the entire coverage area of the STAR-RIS-assisted system, leading to superior performance gain when compared to benchmark schemes encompassing traditional RIS-aided scheme.</description>

      <title>Coding methods for string reconstruction from erroneous prefix-suffix compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of zeros and the number of ones in a binary string are referred to as the composition of the string, and the prefix-suffix compositions of a string are a multiset formed by the compositions of the prefixes and suffixes of all possible lengths of the string. In this work, we present binary codes of length n in which every codeword can be efficiently reconstructed from its erroneous prefix-suffix compositions with at most t composition errors. All our constructions have decoding complexity polynomial in n and the best of our constructions has constant rate and can correct $t = \Theta(n)$ errors. As a comparison, no prior constructions can afford to efficiently correct $t = \Theta(n)$ arbitrary composition errors.
  Additionally, we propose a method of encoding h arbitrary strings of the same length so that they can be reconstructed from the multiset union of their error-free prefix-suffix compositions, at the expense of h-fold coding overhead. In contrast, existing methods can only recover h distinct strings, albeit with code rate asymptotically equal to 1/h. Building on the top of the proposed method, we also present a coding scheme that enables efficient recovery of h strings from their erroneous prefix-suffix compositions with $t = \Theta(n)$ errors.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Analysis of Energy-Harvesting Backscatter Communications with Tag Selection in Nakagami-m Fading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backscatter communication is an energy-efficient technique that enables sustainable wireless connectivity with a minimal environmental impact. In this paper, the secrecy performance of practical non-linear energy-harvesting backscatter communications with various tag selection schemes is analyzed in Nakagami-m fading channels. We consider four tag selection schemes: sub-optimal, minimal eaves-dropping, optimal, and random tag selection. Closed-form expressions for secrecy outage probability (SOP) and intercept probability (IP) are derived for each scheme, along with asymptotic expressions to provide deeper insights. The impact of system and fading parameters on SOP and IP is investigated, and simulation results are presented to validate the accuracy of the analytical expressions.</description>

      <title>XAI-Driven Client Selection for Federated Learning in Scalable 6G Network Slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, network slicing has embraced artificial intelligence (AI) models to manage the growing complexity of communication networks. In such a situation, AI-driven zero-touch network automation should present a high degree of flexibility and viability, especially when deployed in live production networks. However, centralized controllers suffer from high data communication overhead due to the vast amount of user data, and most network slices are reluctant to share private data. In federated learning systems, selecting trustworthy clients to participate in training is critical for ensuring system performance and reliability. The present paper proposes a new approach to client selection by leveraging an XAI method to guarantee scalable and fast operation of federated learning based analytic engines that implement slice-level resource provisioning at the RAN-Edge in a non-IID scenario. Attributions from XAI are used to guide the selection of devices participating in training. This approach enhances network trustworthiness for users and addresses the black-box nature of neural network models. The simulations conducted outperformed the standard approach in terms of both convergence time and computational cost, while also demonstrating high scalability.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Relevance Based Sensor Selection for Edge-AI Empowered Sensing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) mobile network is envisioned to incorporate sensing and edge artificial intelligence (AI) as two key functions. Their natural convergence leads to the emergence of Integrated Sensing and Edge AI (ISEA), a novel paradigm enabling real-time acquisition and understanding of sensory information at the network edge. However, ISEA faces a communication bottleneck due to the large number of sensors and the high dimensionality of sensory features. Traditional approaches to communication-efficient ISEA lack awareness of semantic relevance, i.e., the level of relevance between sensor observations and the downstream task. To fill this gap, this paper presents a novel framework for semantic-relevance-aware sensor selection to achieve optimal end-to-end (E2E) task performance under heterogeneous sensor relevance and channel states. E2E sensing accuracy analysis is provided to characterize the sensing task performance in terms of selected sensors' relevance scores and channel states. Building on the results, the sensor-selection problem for accuracy maximization is formulated as an integer program and solved through a tight approximation of the objective. The optimal solution exhibits a priority-based structure, which ranks sensors based on a priority indicator combining relevance scores and channel states and selects top-ranked sensors. Low-complexity algorithms are then developed to determine the optimal numbers of selected sensors and features. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show substantial accuracy gain achieved by the proposed selection scheme compared to existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Cross-Layer Security for Semantic Communications: Metrics and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different from traditional secure communication that focuses on symbolic protection at the physical layer, semantic secure communication requires further attention to semantic-level task performance at the application layer. There is a research gap on how to comprehensively evaluate and optimize the security performance of semantic communication. In order to fill this gap, a unified semantic security metric, the cross-layer semantic secure rate (CLSSR), is defined to estimate cross-layer security requirements at both the physical layer and the application layer. Then, we formulate the maximization problem of the CLSSR with the mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). We propose a hierarchical AI-native semantic secure communication network with a reinforcement learning (RL)-based semantic resource allocation scheme, aiming to ensure the cross-layer semantic security (CL-SS). Finally, we prove the convergence of our proposed intelligent resource allocation, and the simulation results demonstrate that our proposed CLSS method outperforms the traditional physical layer semantic security (PL-SS) method in terms of both task reliability and CLSSR.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS-Assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Multi-antenna Users and Hardware Impairments Over Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs) can provide ubiquitous connectivity and enhance coverage. This paper explores a STAR-RIS-assisted cell-free massive MIMO system featuring multi-antenna users, multi-antenna access points (APs), and multi-element STAR-RISs, accounting for transceiver hardware impairments. We first establish the system model of STAR-RIS-assisted cell-free massive MIMO systems with multi-antenna users. Subsequently, we analyze two uplink implementations: local processing and centralized decoding (Level 1), and fully centralized processing (Level 2), both implementations incorporating hardware impairments. We study the local and global minimum mean square error (MMSE) combining schemes to maximize the uplink spectral efficiency (SE) for Level 1 and Level 2, respectively. The MMSE-based successive interference cancellation detector is utilized to compute the uplink SE. We introduce the optimal large-scale fading decoding at the central processing unit and derive closed-form SE expressions utilizing maximum ratio combining at APs for Level 1. Our numerical results reveal that hardware impairments negatively affect SE performance, particularly at the user end. However, this degradation can be mitigated by increasing the number of user antennas. Enhancing the number of APs and STAR-RIS elements also improves performance and mitigates performance degradation. Notably, unlike conventional results based on direct links, our findings show that Level 2 consistently outperforms Level 1 with arbitrary combining schemes for the proposed STAR-RIS-assisted system.</description>

      <title>Function-Correcting Codes for b-Symbol Read Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Function-correcting codes are an innovative class of codes that are designed to protect a function evaluation of the data against errors or corruptions. Due to its usefulness in machine learning applications and archival data storage, where preserving the integrity of computation is crucial, Lenz et al. recently introduced function-correcting codes for binary symmetric channels to safeguard function evaluation against errors. Xia et al. expanded this concept to symbol-pair read channels over binary fields. The current paper further advances the theory by developing function-correcting codes for b-symbol read channels over finite fields. We introduce the idea of irregular b-symbol distance codes and establish bounds on their performance over finite fields. This concept helps in understanding the behavior of function-correcting codes in more complex settings. We also present a graphical approach of the problem of constructing function-correcting b-symbol codes. Furthermore, we apply these general concepts to specific classes of functions and compare the redundancy of function-correcting b-symbol codes with classical b-symbol codes. Our findings demonstrate that function-correcting b-symbol codes achieve lower redundancy while maintaining reliability.</description>

      <title>Low-PAPR OFDM-ISAC Waveform Design Based on Frequency-Domain Phase Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform design is a crucial issue in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). This paper introduces an OFDM-ISAC waveform design that utilizes the entire spectrum simultaneously for both communication and sensing by leveraging a novel degree of freedom (DoF): the frequency-domain phase difference (PD). Based on this concept, we develop a novel PD-based OFDM-ISAC waveform structure and utilize it to design a PD-based Low-PAPR OFDM-ISAC (PLPOI) waveform. The design is formulated as an optimization problem incorporating four key constraints: the time-frequency relationship equation, frequency-domain unimodular constraints, PD constraints, and time-domain low PAPR requirements. To solve this challenging non-convex problem, we develop an efficient algorithm, ADMM-PLPOI, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PLPOI waveform achieves significant improvements in both PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional OFDM-ISAC waveforms.</description>

      <title>New quantum codes from homothetic-BCH codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce homothetic-BCH codes. These are a family of $q^2$-ary classical codes $\mathcal{C}$ of length $\lambda n_1$, where $\lambda$ and $n_1$ are suitable positive integers such that the punctured code $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{C}$ in the last $\lambda n_1 - n_1$ coordinates is a narrow-sense BCH code of length $n_1$. We prove that whenever $\mathcal{B}$ is Hermitian self-orthogonal, so is $\mathcal{C}$.
  As a consequence, we present a procedure to obtain quantum stabilizer codes with lengths than cannot be reached by BCH codes. With this procedure we get new quantum codes according to Grassl's table.
  To prove our results, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for Hermitian self-orthogonality of BCH codes of a wide range of lengths.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching Antennas (PAs) represent a revolutionary flexible antenna technology that leverages dielectric waveguides and electromagnetic coupling to mitigate large-scale path loss. This letter is the first to explore channel estimation for Pinching-Antenna SyStems (PASS), addressing their uniquely ill-conditioned and underdetermined channel characteristics. In particular, two efficient deep learning-based channel estimators are proposed. 1) PAMoE: This estimator incorporates dynamic padding, feature embedding, fusion, and mixture of experts (MoE) modules, which effectively leverage the positional information of PAs and exploit expert diversity. 2) PAformer: This Transformer-style estimator employs the self-attention mechanism to predict channel coefficients in a per-antenna manner, which offers more flexibility to adaptively deal with dynamic numbers of PAs in practical deployment. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) the proposed deep learning-based channel estimators outperform conventional methods and exhibit excellent zero-shot learning capabilities, and 2) PAMoE delivers higher channel estimation accuracy via MoE specialization, while PAformer natively handles an arbitrary number of PAs, trading self-attention complexity for superior scalability.</description>

      <title>Causal Emergence 2.0: Quantifying emergent complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems can be described at myriad different scales, and their causal workings often have multiscale structure (e.g., a computer can be described at the microscale of its hardware circuitry, the mesoscale of its machine code, and the macroscale of its operating system). While scientists study and model systems across the full hierarchy of their scales, from microphysics to macroeconomics, there is debate about what the macroscales of systems can possibly add beyond mere compression. To resolve this longstanding issue, here a new theory of emergence is introduced wherein the different scales of a system are treated like slices of a higher-dimensional object. The theory can distinguish which of these scales possess unique causal contributions, and which are not causally relevant. Constructed from an axiomatic notion of causation, the theory's application is demonstrated in coarse-grains of Markov chains. It identifies all cases of macroscale causation: instances where reduction to a microscale is possible, yet lossy about causation. Furthermore, the theory posits a causal apportioning schema that calculates the causal contribution of each scale, showing what each uniquely adds. Finally, it reveals a novel measure of emergent complexity: how widely distributed a system's causal workings are across its hierarchy of scales.</description>

Abstract: The rapid growth of mobile banking (m-banking), especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, has reshaped the financial sector. This study analyzes consumer reviews of m-banking apps from five major Canadian banks, collected from Google Play and iOS App stores. Sentiment analysis and topic modeling classify reviews as positive, neutral, or negative, highlighting user preferences and areas for improvement. Data pre-processing was performed with NLTK, a Python language processing tool, and topic modeling used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Sentiment analysis compared methods, with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) achieving 82\% accuracy for iOS reviews and Multinomial Naive Bayes 77\% for Google Play. Positive reviews praised usability, reliability, and features, while negative reviews identified login issues, glitches, and dissatisfaction with updates.This is the first study to analyze both iOS and Google Play m-banking app reviews, offering insights into app strengths and weaknesses. Findings underscore the importance of user-friendly designs, stable updates, and better customer service. Advanced text analytics provide actionable recommendations for improving user satisfaction and experience.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Source Coding using LDPC Codes for Compressed-Domain Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the emerging field of goal-oriented communications, the focus has shifted from reconstructing data to directly performing specific learning tasks, such as classification, segmentation, or pattern recognition, on the received coded data. In the commonly studied scenario of classification from compressed images, a key objective is to enable learning directly on entropy-coded data, thereby bypassing the computationally intensive step of data reconstruction. Conventional entropy-coding methods, such as Huffman and Arithmetic coding, are effective for compression but disrupt the data structure, making them less suitable for direct learning without decoding. This paper investigates the use of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes -- originally designed for channel coding -- as an alternative entropy-coding approach. It is hypothesized that the structured nature of LDPC codes can be leveraged more effectively by deep learning models for tasks like classification. At the receiver side, gated recurrent unit (GRU) models are trained to perform image classification directly on LDPC-coded data. Experiments on datasets like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR show that LDPC codes outperform Huffman and Arithmetic coding in classification tasks, while requiring significantly smaller learning models. Furthermore, the paper analyzes why LDPC codes preserve data structure more effectively than traditional entropy-coding techniques and explores the impact of key code parameters on classification performance. These results suggest that LDPC-based entropy coding offers an optimal balance between learning efficiency and model complexity, eliminating the need for prior decoding.</description>

      <title>Weighted cycle-based identification of influential node groups in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying influential node groups in complex networks is crucial for optimizing information dissemination, epidemic control, and viral marketing. However, traditional centrality-based methods often focus on individual nodes, resulting in overlapping influence zones and diminished collective effectiveness. To overcome these limitations, we propose Weighted Cycle (WCycle), a novel indicator that incorporates basic cycle structures and node behavior traits (edge weights) to comprehensively assess node importance. WCycle effectively identifies spatially dispersed and structurally diverse key node group, thereby reducing influence redundancy and enhancing network-wide propagation. Extensive experiments on six real-world networks demonstrate WCycle's superior performance compared to five benchmark methods across multiple evaluation dimensions, including influence propagation efficiency, structural differentiation, and cost-effectiveness. The findings highlight WCycle's robustness and scalability, establishing it as a promising tool for complex network analysis and practical applications requiring effective influence maximization.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning for AoD Estimation in MISO Downlink LoS Transmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the emerging of simultaneous localization and communication (SLAC), it becomes more and more attractive to perform angle of departure (AoD) estimation at the receiving Internet of Thing (IoT) user end for improved positioning accuracy, flexibility and enhanced user privacy. To address challenges like large number of real-time measurements required for latency-critical applications and enormous data collection for training deep learning models in conventional AoD estimation methods, we propose in this letter an unsupervised learning framework, which unifies training for both deterministic maximum likelihood (DML) and stochastic maximum likelihood (SML) based AoD estimation in multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink (DL) wireless transmissions. Specifically, under the line-of-sight (LoS) assumption, we incorporate both the received signals and pilot-sequence information, as per its availability at the DL user, into the input of the deep learning model, and adopt a common neural network architecture compatible with input data in both DML and SML cases. Extensive numerical results validate that the proposed unsupervised learning based AoD estimation not only improves estimation accuracy, but also significantly reduces required number of observations, thereby reducing both estimation overhead and latency compared to various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Novel Double Pruning method for Imbalanced Data using Information Entropy and Roulette Wheel Selection for Breast Cancer Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate illness diagnosis is vital for effective treatment and patient safety. Machine learning models are widely used for cancer diagnosis based on historical medical data. However, data imbalance remains a major challenge, leading to hindering classifier performance and reliability. The SMOTEBoost method addresses this issue by generating synthetic data to balance the dataset, but it may overlook crucial overlapping regions near the decision boundary and can produce noisy samples. This paper proposes RE-SMOTEBoost, an enhanced version of SMOTEBoost, designed to overcome these limitations. Firstly, RE-SMOTEBoost focuses on generating synthetic samples in overlapping regions to better capture the decision boundary using roulette wheel selection. Secondly, it incorporates a filtering mechanism based on information entropy to reduce noise, and borderline cases and improve the quality of generated data. Thirdly, we introduce a double regularization penalty to control the synthetic samples proximity to the decision boundary and avoid class overlap. These enhancements enable higher-quality oversampling of the minority class, resulting in a more balanced and effective training dataset. The proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques when evaluated on imbalanced datasets. Compared to the top-performing sampling algorithms, RE-SMOTEBoost demonstrates a notable improvement of 3.22\% in accuracy and a variance reduction of 88.8\%. These results indicate that the proposed model offers a solid solution for medical settings, effectively overcoming data scarcity and severe imbalance caused by limited samples, data collection difficulties, and privacy constraints.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced quickest change detection of transmission loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sudden increase of loss in an optical communications channel can be caused by a malicious wiretapper, or for a benign reason such as inclement weather in a free-space channel or an unintentional bend in an optical fiber. We show that adding a small amount of squeezing to bright phase-modulated coherent-state pulses can dramatically increase the homodyne detection receiver's sensitivity to change detection in channel loss, without affecting the communications rate. We further show that augmenting blocks of $n$ pulses of a coherent-state codeword with weak continuous-variable entanglement generated by splitting squeezed vacuum pulses in a temporal $n$-mode equal splitter progressively enhances this change-detection sensitivity as $n$ increases; the aforesaid squeezed-light augmentation being the $n=1$ special case. For $n$ high enough, an arbitrarily small amount of quantum-augmented photons per pulse diminishes the change-detection latency by the inverse of the pre-detection channel loss. This superadditivity-like phenomenon in the entanglement-augmented relative entropy rate, which quantifies the latency of change-point detection, may find other uses. We discuss the quantum limit of quickest change detection and a receiver that achieves it, tradeoffs between continuous and discrete-variable quantum augmentation, and the broad problem of joint classical-and-quantum communications and channel-change-detection that our study opens up.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the spectral efficiency for millimeter wave downlink with beam misalignment in urban macro scenario. For this purpose, we use a new approach based on the modified Shannon formula, which considers the propagation environment and antenna system coefficients. These factors are determined based on a multi-ellipsoidal propagation model. The obtained results show that under non-line-of-sight conditions, the appropriate selection of the antenna beam orientation may increase the spectral efficiency in relation to the direct line to a user.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present an empirical verification of the method of determining the Doppler spectrum (DS) from the power angular spectrum (PAS). Measurements were made for the frequency of 3.5 GHz, under non-line-of-sight conditions in suburban areas characteristic of a university campus. In the static scenario, the measured PAS was the basis for the determination of DSs, which were compared with the DSs measured in the mobile scenario. The obtained results show that the proposed method gives some approximation to DS determined with the classic methods used so far.</description>

      <title>Variability of radio signal attenuation by single deciduous tree versus reception angle at 80 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vegetation significantly affects radio signal attenuation, influenced by factors such as signal frequency, plant species, and foliage density. Existing attenuation models typically address specific scenarios, like single trees, rows of trees, or green spaces, with the ITU-R P.833 recommendation being a widely recognized standard. Most assessments for single trees focus on the primary radiation direction of the transmitting antenna. This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluating radio signal scattering by a single deciduous tree. Through measurements at 80 GHz and a bandwidth of approximately 2 GHz, we analyze how total signal attenuation varies with the reception angle relative to the transmitter-tree axis. The findings from various directional measurements contribute to a comprehensive attenuation model applicable to any reception angle and also highlight the impact of bandwidth on the received signal level.</description>

      <title>SING: Semantic Image Communications using Null-Space and INN-Guided Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint source-channel coding systems based on deep neural networks (DeepJSCC) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in wireless image transmission. Existing methods primarily focus on minimizing distortion between the transmitted image and the reconstructed version at the receiver, often overlooking perceptual quality. This can lead to severe perceptual degradation when transmitting images under extreme conditions, such as low bandwidth compression ratios (BCRs) and low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In this work, we propose SING, a novel two-stage JSCC framework that formulates the recovery of high-quality source images from corrupted reconstructions as an inverse problem. Depending on the availability of information about the DeepJSCC encoder/decoder and the channel at the receiver, SING can either approximate the stochastic degradation as a linear transformation, or leverage invertible neural networks (INNs) for precise modeling. Both approaches enable the seamless integration of diffusion models into the reconstruction process, enhancing perceptual quality. Experimental results demonstrate that SING outperforms DeepJSCC and other approaches, delivering superior perceptual quality even under extremely challenging conditions, including scenarios with significant distribution mismatches between the training and test data.</description>

      <title>Finite Samples for Shallow Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the ability of finite samples to identify two-layer irreducible shallow networks with various nonlinear activation functions, including rectified linear units (ReLU) and analytic functions such as the logistic sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent. An ``irreducible" network is one whose function cannot be represented by another network with fewer neurons. For ReLU activation functions, we first establish necessary and sufficient conditions for determining the irreducibility of a network. Subsequently, we prove a negative result: finite samples are insufficient for definitive identification of any irreducible ReLU shallow network. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that for a given irreducible network, one can construct a finite set of sampling points that can distinguish it from other network with the same neuron count. Conversely, for logistic sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent activation functions, we provide a positive result. We construct finite samples that enable the recovery of two-layer irreducible shallow analytic networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the exact identification of two-layer irreducible networks using finite sample function values. Our findings provide insights into the comparative performance of networks with different activation functions under limited sampling conditions.</description>

      <title>Estimating stationary mass, frequency by frequency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose we observe a trajectory of length $n$ from an $\alpha$-mixing stochastic process over a finite but potentially large state space. We consider the problem of estimating the probability mass placed by the stationary distribution of any such process on elements that occur with a certain frequency in the observed sequence. We estimate this vector of probabilities in total variation distance, showing universal consistency in $n$ and recovering known results for i.i.d. sequences as special cases. Our proposed methodology carefully combines the plug-in (or empirical) estimator with a recently-proposed modification of the Good--Turing estimator called \textsc{WingIt}, which was originally developed for Markovian sequences. En route to controlling the error of our estimator, we develop new performance bounds on \textsc{WingIt} and the plug-in estimator for $\alpha$-mixing stochastic processes. Importantly, the extensively used method of Poissonization can no longer be applied in our non i.i.d. setting, and so we develop complementary tools -- including concentration inequalities for a natural self-normalized statistic of mixing sequences -- that may prove independently useful in the design and analysis of estimators for related problems.</description>

      <title>The Density Formula Approach for Non-reversible Isomorphism Theorems, with Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical isomorphism theorems for reversible Markov chains have played an important role in studying the properties of local time processes of strongly symmetric Markov processes~\cite{mr06}, bounding the cover time of a graph by a random walk~\cite{dlp11}, and in topics related to physics such as random walk loop soups and Brownian loop soups~\cite{lt07}. Non-reversible versions of these theorems have been discovered by Le Jan, Eisenbaum, and Kaspi~\cite{lejan08, ek09, eisenbaum13}. Here, we give a density-formula-based proof for all these non-reversible isomorphism theorems, extending the results in \cite{bhs21}. Moreover, we use this method to generalize the comparison inequalities derived in \cite{eisenbaum13} for permanental processes and derive an upper bound for the cover time of non-reversible Markov chains.</description>

      <title>Robust Deep Joint Source Channel Coding for Task-Oriented Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communications based on deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC) aim to improve communication efficiency by transmitting only task-relevant information. However, ensuring robustness to the stochasticity of communication channels remains a key challenge in learning-based JSCC. In this paper, we propose a novel regularization technique for learning-based JSCC to enhance robustness against channel noise. The proposed method utilizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a regularizer term in the training loss, measuring the discrepancy between two posterior distributions: one under noisy channel conditions (noisy posterior) and one for a noise-free system (noise-free posterior). Reducing this KL divergence mitigates the impact of channel noise on task performance by keeping the noisy posterior close to the noise-free posterior. We further show that the expectation of the KL divergence given the encoded representation can be analytically approximated using the Fisher information matrix and the covariance matrix of the channel noise. Notably, the proposed regularization is architecture-agnostic, making it broadly applicable to general semantic communication systems over noisy channels. Our experimental results validate that the proposed regularization consistently improves task performance across diverse semantic communication systems and channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for composite quantum hypothesis testing and a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimal error exponents of binary composite i.i.d. state discrimination are trivially bounded by the worst-case pairwise exponents of discriminating individual elements of the sets representing the two hypotheses, and in the finite-dimensional classical case, these bounds in fact give exact single-copy expressions for the error exponents. In contrast, in the non-commutative case, the optimal exponents are only known to be expressible in terms of regularized divergences, resulting in formulas that, while conceptually relevant, practically not very useful. In this paper, we develop further an approach initiated in [Mosonyi, Szil\'agyi, Weiner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 68(2):1032--1067, 2022] to give improved single-copy bounds on the error exponents by comparing not only individual states from the two hypotheses, but also various unnormalized positive semi-definite operators associated to them. Here, we show a number of equivalent characterizations of such operators giving valid bounds, and show that in the commutative case, considering weighted geometric means of the states, and in the case of two states per hypothesis, considering weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means, are optimal for this approach. As a result, we give a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means as the only $2$-variable operator geometric means that are block additive, tensor multiplicative, and satisfy the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality. We also extend our results to composite quantum channel discrimination, and show an analogous optimality property of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means of two quantum channels, a notion that seems to be new. We extend this concept to defining the notion of superoperator perspective function and establish some of its basic properties, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Optimal Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves from Likelihood Ratio Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.01956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, giving the maximum probability of detection as a function of the probability of false alarm, is a key information-theoretic indicato of the difficulty of a binary hypothesis testing problem (BHT). It is well known that the optimal ROC curve for a given BHT, corresponding to the likelihood ratio test, is determined by the probability distribution of the observed data under each of the two hypotheses. In some cases, these two distributions may be unknown or computationally intractable, but independent samples of the likelihood ratio can be observed. This raises the problem of estimating the optimal ROC for a BHT from such samples. The maximum likelihood estimator of the optimal ROC curve is derived, and it is shown to converge almost surely to the true optimal ROC curve in the Levy metric, as the number of observations tends to infinity. Finite sample size bounds are obtained for three other estimators: the classical empirical estimator, based on estimating the two types of error probabilities from two separate sets of samples, and two variations of the maximum likelihood estimator called the split estimator and fused estimator, respectively. The maximum likelihood estimator is observed in simulation experiments to be considerably more accurate than the empirical estimator, especially when the number of samples obtained under one of the two hypotheses is small. The area under the maximum likelihood estimator is derived; it is a consistent estimator of the area under the true optimal ROC curve.</description>

      <title>Computation of a Unified Graph-Based Rate Optimization Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04981v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a graph-based rate optimization problem and consider its computation, which provides a unified approach to the computation of various theoretical limits, including the (conditional) graph entropy, rate-distortion functions and capacity-cost functions with side information. Compared with their classical counterparts, theoretical limits with side information are much more difficult to compute since their characterizations as optimization problems have larger and more complex feasible regions. Following the unified approach, we develop effective methods to resolve the difficulty. On the theoretical side, we derive graph characterizations for rate-distortion and capacity-cost functions with side information and simplify the characterizations in special cases by reducing the number of decision variables. On the computational side, we design an efficient alternating minimization algorithm for the graph-based problem, which deals with the inequality constraint by a flexible multiplier update strategy. Moreover, simplified graph characterizations are exploited and deflation techniques are introduced, so that the computing time is greatly reduced. Theoretical analysis shows that the algorithm converges to an optimal solution. By numerical experiments, the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm are illustrated and its significant advantage over existing methods is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>The Best Time for an Update: Risk-Sensitive Minimization of Age-Based Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Popular methods to quantify transmitted data quality are the Age of Information (AoI), the Query Age of Information (QAoI), and the Age of Incorrect Information (AoII). We consider these metrics in a point-to-point wireless communication system, where the transmitter monitors a process and sends status updates to a receiver. The challenge is to decide on the best time for an update, balancing the transmission energy and the age-based metric at the receiver. Due to the inherent risk of high age-based metric values causing complications such as unstable system states, we introduce the new concept of risky states to denote states with high age-based metric. We use this new notion of risky states to quantify and minimize this risk of experiencing high age-based metrics by directly deriving the frequency of risky states as a novel risk-metric. Building on this foundation, we introduce two risk-sensitive strategies for AoI, QAoI and AoII. The first strategy uses system knowledge, i.e., channel quality and packet arrival probability, to find an optimal strategy that transmits when the age-based metric exceeds a tunable threshold. A lower threshold leads to higher risk-sensitivity. The second strategy uses an enhanced Q-learning approach and balances the age-based metric, the transmission energy and the frequency of risky states without requiring knowledge about the system. Numerical results affirm our risk-sensitive strategies' high effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Rate-Distortion-Perception Tradeoff for Gaussian Vector Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) tradeoff for a Gaussian vector source coding problem where the goal is to compress the multi-component source subject to distortion and perception constraints. Specifically, the RDP setting with either the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence or Wasserstein-2 metric as the perception loss function is examined, and it is shown that for Gaussian vector sources, jointly Gaussian reconstructions are optimal. We further demonstrate that the optimal tradeoff can be expressed as an optimization problem, which can be explicitly solved. An interesting property of the optimal solution is as follows. Without the perception constraint, the traditional reverse water-filling solution for characterizing the rate-distortion (RD) tradeoff of a Gaussian vector source states that the optimal rate allocated to each component depends on a constant, called the water level. If the variance of a specific component is below the water level, it is assigned a zero compression rate. However, with active distortion and perception constraints, we show that the optimal rates allocated to the different components are always positive. Moreover, the water levels that determine the optimal rate allocation for different components are unequal. We further treat the special case of perceptually perfect reconstruction and study its RDP function in the high-distortion and low-distortion regimes to obtain insight to the structure of the optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Sensory Data Sharing in ISAC System: Fundamental Limits and Waveform Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simultaneous acquisition and sharing of sensory data through a dual-functional signaling strategy termed the communication-assisted sensing (CAS) system in this paper, has the potential to provide users with beyond-line-of-sight sensing capabilities. We mainly focus on three primary aspects, namely, the information-theoretic framework, the optimal distribution of channel input, and the optimal waveform design for Gaussian signals. First, we establish the information-theoretic framework and develop a modified source-channel separation theorem (MSST) tailored for CAS systems. The proposed MSST elucidates the relationship between achievable distortion, coding rate, and communication channel capacity in cases where the distortion metric is separable for sensing and communication (S&amp;C) processes. Second, we present an optimal channel input design for dual-functional signaling, which aims to minimize CAS distortion under the constraints of the MSST and resource budget. We then conceive a two-step Blahut-Arimoto (BA)-based optimal search algorithm to numerically solve the functional optimization problem. Third, in light of the current signaling strategy, we further propose an optimal waveform design for Gaussian signaling in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) CAS systems. The associated covariance matrix optimization problem is addressed using a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based waveform design algorithm. Finally, we provide numerical simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and to show the unique performance tradeoff between S&amp;C processes.</description>

      <title>From Concept to Reality: 5G Positioning with Open-Source Implementation of UL-TDoA in OpenAirInterface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05217v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents, for the first time, an open-source implementation of the 3GPP Uplink Time Difference of Arrival (UL-TDoA) positioning method using the OpenAirInterface (OAI) framework. UL-TDoA is a critical positioning technique in 5G networks, leveraging the time differences of signal arrival at multiple base stations to determine the precise location of User Equipment (UE). This implementation aims to democratize access to advanced positioning technology by integrating UL-TDoA capabilities into both the Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network (CN) components of OAI, providing a comprehensive and 3GPP-compliant solution. The development includes the incorporation of essential protocol procedures, message flows, and interfaces as defined by 3GPP standards. Validation is conducted using two distinct methods: an OAI-RF simulator-based setup for controlled testing and an O-RAN-based Localization Testbed at EURECOM in real-world conditions. The results demonstrate the viability of this open-source UL-TDoA implementation, enabling precise positioning in various environments. By making this implementation publicly available, the study paves the way for widespread research, development, and innovation in the field of 5G positioning technologies, fostering collaboration and accelerating the advancement of cellular network positioning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class of linear block codes which simultaneously generalizes Gabidulin codes and a class of skew cyclic codes is defined. For these codes, both a Hartmann-Tzeng-like bound and a Roos-like bound, with respect to their rank distance, are described, and corresponding nearest-neighbor decoding algorithms are presented. Additional necessary conditions so that decoding can be done up to the described bounds are studied. Subfield subcodes and interleaved codes from the considered class of codes are also described, since they allow an unbounded length for the codes, providing a decoding algorithm for them; additionally, both approaches are shown to yield equivalent codes with respect to the rank metric.</description>

      <title>Effective Application of Normalized Min-Sum Decoding for Short BCH Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The algebraic rigidity of BCH codes challenges the development of parallelizable and efficient decoders for high-throughput applications. To address this, we propose a hybrid scheme combining normalized min-sum and order statistics decoding, achieving near-maximum likelihood performance for short BCH codes while retaining the benefits of the normalized min-sum decoder over a wide SNR range. First, a heuristic method constructs a parity-check matrix with low density, appropriate redundancy, and fewer length-4 cycles through binary sum and random row cyclic shifts, forming a solid foundation for decoder design. The impact of row redundancy and rank deficiency in the dual code's minimum-weight codewords on frame error rate is analyzed. In the revised normalized min-sum decoder, three types of random automorphisms enhance decoding diversity, while aggregated messages accelerate convergence. For BCH codes of length 63 and 127, the proposed approach achieves a 1-2 dB bit error rate advantage over parallelizable alternatives or requires up to two orders of magnitude fewer iterations than other iterative rivals. These results highlight its effectiveness in hybrid decoding for ultra-reliable, low-latency communications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work by Shehadeh and Kschischang provides a simple capacity-achieving scheme for channels with polarization-dependent loss (PDL) under common modeling assumptions via a careful choice of orthogonal-design-based precoding and interference cancellation. This letter extends that work with a simulation-based demonstration showing that this scheme remains highly effective at mitigating PDL in the highly practical setting of 16-QAM with Chase-decoded extended Hamming inner codes rather than the near-capacity inner codes considered in the original work. An alternative near-optimal variation of this scheme is also provided requiring only one inner code rather than two and suffering no penalty in the absence of PDL, making it much more practical.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Information Freshness of IEEE 802.11ax Uplink OFDMA-Based Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The latest WiFi standard, IEEE 802.11ax (WiFi 6), introduces a novel uplink random access mechanism called uplink orthogonal frequency division multiple access-based random access (UORA). While existing work has evaluated the performance of UORA using conventional performance metrics, such as throughput and delay, its information freshness performance has not been thoroughly investigated in the literature. This is of practical significance as WiFi 6 and beyond are expected to support real-time applications. This paper presents the first attempt to fill this gap by investigating the information freshness, quantified by the Age of Information (AoI) metric, in UORA networks. We establish an analytical framework comprising two discrete-time Markov chains (DTMCs) to characterize the transmission states of stations (STAs) in UORA networks. Building on the formulated DTMCs, we derive an analytical expression for the long-term average AoI (AAoI), facilitating the optimization of UORA parameters for enhanced AoI performance through exhaustive search. To gain deeper design insights and improve the effectiveness of UORA parameter optimization, we derive a closed-form expression for the AAoI and its approximated lower bound for a simplified scenario characterized by a fixed backoff contention window and generate-at-will status updates. By analyzing the approximated lower bound of the AAoI, we propose efficient UORA parameter optimization algorithms that can be realized with only a few comparisons of different possible values of the parameters to be optimized. Simulation results validate our analysis and demonstrate that the AAoI achieved through our proposed parameter optimization algorithm closely approximates the optimal AoI performance obtained via exhaustive search, outperforming the round-robin and max-AoI policies in large and low-traffic networks.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna-Aided Robust Secure Transmission for RSMA-ISAC Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper leverages fluid antenna (FA) and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) to enhance the physical layer security (PLS) of an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. We consider a practical multi-user multi-input single-output (MU-MISO) system, where a base station (BS) equipped with fixed position antennas (FPAs) employs RSMA to communicate with multiple single-FA users, while an eavesdropping target may potentially wiretap the signals. The system adopts a novel rate splitting (RS) scheme, where the common layer stream serves a dual purpose: it conveys valid data to legitimate users (LUs) while simultaneously generating jamming signals to confuse potential eavesdroppers. We establish the problem and propose the optimization algorithm under two conditions: perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) conditions. Specifically, under perfect the CSI condition, we address the non-convex optimization problem by proposing an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which decomposes the problem into two subproblems: beamforming matrix optimization and the adjustment of FA positions. For beamforming optimization, we utilize semidefinite programming (SDP) and successive convex approximation (SCA) to convert the problem into a more tractable convex form. Given a fixed beamforming matrix, SCA is applied to handle the surrogate upper bound of the constraints. In the case of imperfect CSI, the continuous nature of CSI errors leads to an infinite number of constraints. To overcome this challenge, we propose an AO-based algorithm that incorporates the S-Procedure and SCA to obtain a high-quality beamforming matrix and effective FA positions. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FA-aided RSMA-ISAC system significantly enhances security compared to traditional FPA-based and SDMA-based systems.</description>

      <title>The Conditional Cauchy-Schwarz Divergence with Applications to Time-Series Data and Sequential Decision Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence was developed by Pr\'{i}ncipe et al. in 2000. In this paper, we extend the classic CS divergence to quantify the closeness between two conditional distributions and show that the developed conditional CS divergence can be simply estimated by a kernel density estimator from given samples. We illustrate the advantages (e.g., rigorous faithfulness guarantee, lower computational complexity, higher statistical power, and much more flexibility in a wide range of applications) of our conditional CS divergence over previous proposals, such as the conditional KL divergence and the conditional maximum mean discrepancy. We also demonstrate the compelling performance of conditional CS divergence in two machine learning tasks related to time series data and sequential inference, namely time series clustering and uncertainty-guided exploration for sequential decision making. The code of conditional CS divergence is available at https://github.com/SJYuCNEL/conditional_CS_divergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel techniques are among the most popular and powerful approaches of data science. Among the key features that make kernels ubiquitous are (i) the number of domains they have been designed for, (ii) the Hilbert structure of the function class associated to kernels facilitating their statistical analysis, and (iii) their ability to represent probability distributions without loss of information. These properties give rise to the immense success of Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) which is able to capture joint independence of random variables under mild conditions, and permits closed-form estimators with quadratic computational complexity (w.r.t. the sample size). In order to alleviate the quadratic computational bottleneck in large-scale applications, multiple HSIC approximations have been proposed, however these estimators are restricted to $M=2$ random variables, do not extend naturally to the $M\ge 2$ case, and lack theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose an alternative Nystr\"om-based HSIC estimator which handles the $M\ge 2$ case, prove its consistency, and demonstrate its applicability in multiple contexts, including synthetic examples, dependency testing of media annotations, and causal discovery.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Discrete-Time Control and Filtering Limitations by the I-MMSE Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fundamental limitations or performance trade-offs/limits are important properties and constraints of both control and filtering systems. Among various trade-off metrics, total information rate that characterizes the sensitivity trade-offs and time-averaged performance of control and filtering systems was conventionally studied by using the differential entropy rate and Kolmogorov-Bode formula. In this paper, by extending the famous I-MMSE (mutual information -- minimum mean-square error) relationships to the discrete-time additive white Gaussian channels with and without feedback, a new paradigm is introduced to estimate and analyze total information rate as a control and filtering trade-off metric. Under this framework, we explore the trade-off properties of total information rate for a variety of the discrete-time control and filtering systems, e.g., LTI, LTV, and nonlinear, and propose an alternative approach to investigate total information rate via optimal estimation.</description>

      <title>Exact asymptotic order for generalised adaptive approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we present an abstract approach to study asymptotic orders for adaptive approximations with respect to a monotone set function $\mathfrak{J}$ defined on dyadic cubes. We determine the exact upper order in terms of the critical value of the corresponding $\mathfrak{J}$-partition function, and we are able to provide upper and lower bounds in term of fractal-geometric quantities. With properly chosen $\mathfrak{J}$, our new approach has applications in many different areas of mathematics, including the spectral theory of Krein-Feller operators, quantization dimensions of compactly supported probability measures, and the exact asymptotic order for Kolmogorov, Gelfand and linear widths for Sobolev embeddings into $L_{\mu}^p$-spaces.</description>

      <title>On a Rice theorem for dynamical properties of SFTs on groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group with undecidable domino problem, such as $\mathbb{Z}^2$. We prove that all nontrivial dynamical properties for sofic $G$-subshifts are undecidable, that this is not true for $G$-SFTs, and an undecidability result for dynamical properties of $G$-SFTs similar to the Adian-Rabin theorem. Furthermore we prove a Rice-like result for dynamical invariants asserting that every computable real-valued invariant for $G$-SFTs that is monotone by disjoint unions and products is constant.</description>

      <title>Resilience of Rademacher chaos of low degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The resilience of a Rademacher chaos is the maximum number of adversarial sign-flips that the chaos can sustain without having its largest atom probability significantly altered. Inspired by probabilistic lower-bound guarantees for the resilience of linear Rademacher chaos, obtained by Bandeira, Ferber, and Kwan (Advances in Mathematics, Vol. $319$, $2017$), we provide probabilistic lower-bound guarantees for the resilience of Rademacher chaos of arbitrary yet sufficiently low degree.
  Our main results distinguish between Rademacher chaos of order two and those of higher order. In that, our first main result pertains to the resilience of decoupled bilinear Rademacher forms where different asymptotic behaviour is observed for sparse and dense matrices. For our second main result, we bootstrap our first result in order to provide resilience guarantees for quadratic Rademacher chaos. Our third main result, generalises the first and handles the resilience of decoupled Rademacher chaos of arbitrary yet sufficiently low order.
  Our results for decoupled Rademacher chaos of order two and that of higher order whilst are established through the same conceptual framework, differ substantially. A difference incurred due to the implementation of the same conceptual argument. The order two result is established using Dudley's maximal inequality for sub-Gaussian processes, the Hanson-Wright inequality, as well as the Kolmogorov-Rogozin inequality. To handle higher order chaos, appeals to Dudley's inequality as well as the Hanson-Wright inequality are replaced with tools suited for random tensors. Appeals to the Hanson-Wright inequality are replaced with appeals to a concentration result for random tensors put forth by Adamczak and Wolff.
  Our results are instance-dependent and thus allow for the efficient computation of resilience guarantees provided the order of the chaos is constant.</description>

      <title>The fermionic massless modular Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an explicit expression for the modular hamiltonian of the von Neumann algebras associated to the unit double cone for the (fermionic) quantum field theories of the 2-component Weyl (helicity 1/2) field, and of the 4-component massless Dirac and Majorana fields. To this end, we represent the one particle spaces of these theories in terms of solutions of the corresponding wave equations, and obtain the action of the modular group on them. As an application, we compute the relative entropy between the vacuum of the massless Majorana field and one particle states associated to waves with Cauchy data localized in the spatial unit ball.</description>

      <title>Unified Fourier bases for signals on random graphs with group symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently proposed approach to graph signal processing (GSP) based on graphons. We show how the graphon-based approach to GSP applies to graphs sampled from a stochastic block model derived from a weighted Cayley graph. When SBM block sizes are equal, a nice Fourier basis can be derived from the representation theory of the underlying group. We explore how the SBM Fourier basis is affected when block sizes are not uniform. When block sizes are nearly uniform, we demonstrate that the group Fourier basis closely approximates the SBM Fourier basis. More specifically, we quantify the approximation error using matrix perturbation theory. When block sizes are highly non-uniform, the group-based Fourier basis can no longer be used. However, we show that partial information regarding the SBM Fourier basis can still be obtained from the underlying group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use an information-theoretic argument due to O'Connell (2000) to prove that every sufficiently symmetric event concerning a countably infinite family of independent and identically distributed random variables is deterministic (i.e., has a probability of either 0 or 1). The i.i.d. condition can be relaxed. This result encompasses the Hewitt-Savage zero-one law and the ergodicity of the Bernoulli process, but also applies to other scenarios such as infinite random graphs and simple renormalization processes.</description>

      <title>A Versatility Measure for Parametric Risk Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parametric statistical methods play a central role in analyzing risk through its underlying frequency and severity components. Given the wide availability of numerical algorithms and high-speed computers, researchers and practitioners often model these separate (although possibly statistically dependent) random variables by fitting a large number of parametric probability distributions to historical data and then comparing goodness-of-fit statistics. However, this approach is highly susceptible to problems of overfitting because it gives insufficient weight to fundamental considerations of functional simplicity and adaptability. To address this shortcoming, we propose a formal mathematical measure for assessing the versatility of frequency and severity distributions prior to their application. We then illustrate this approach by computing and comparing values of the versatility measure for a variety of probability distributions commonly used in risk analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kneser--Poulsen conjecture asserts that the volume of a union of balls in Euclidean space cannot be increased by bringing their centres pairwise closer. We prove that its natural information-theoretic counterpart is true. This follows from a complete answer to a question asked in arXiv:2210.12842 about Gaussian convolutions, namely that the R\'enyi entropy comparisons between a probability measure and its contractive image are preserved when both undergo simultaneous heat flow. An inequality that unifies Costa's result on the concavity of entropy power with the entropic Kneser--Poulsen theorem is also presented.</description>

      <title>An Information Criterion for Controlled Disentanglement of Multimodal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal representation learning seeks to relate and decompose information inherent in multiple modalities. By disentangling modality-specific information from information that is shared across modalities, we can improve interpretability and robustness and enable downstream tasks such as the generation of counterfactual outcomes. Separating the two types of information is challenging since they are often deeply entangled in many real-world applications. We propose Disentangled Self-Supervised Learning (DisentangledSSL), a novel self-supervised approach for learning disentangled representations. We present a comprehensive analysis of the optimality of each disentangled representation, particularly focusing on the scenario not covered in prior work where the so-called Minimum Necessary Information (MNI) point is not attainable. We demonstrate that DisentangledSSL successfully learns shared and modality-specific features on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets and consistently outperforms baselines on various downstream tasks, including prediction tasks for vision-language data, as well as molecule-phenotype retrieval tasks for biological data. The code is available at https://github.com/uhlerlab/DisentangledSSL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At present, in lattice-based linearly homomorphic signature schemes, especially under the standard model, there are very few schemes with tight security. This paper constructs the first lattice-based linearly homomorphic signature scheme that achieves tight security against existential unforgeability under chosen-message attacks (EUF-CMA) in the standard model. Furthermore, among existing schemes, the scheme proposed in this paper also offers certain advantages in terms of public key size, signature length, and computational cost.</description>

      <title>On H-Intersecting Graph Families and Counting of Homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02894v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work derives an upper bound on the maximum cardinality of a family of graphs on a fixed number of vertices, in which the intersection of every two graphs in that family contains a subgraph that is isomorphic to a specified graph H. Such families are referred to as H-intersecting graph families. The bound is derived using the combinatorial version of Shearer's lemma, and it forms a nontrivial extension of the bound derived by Chung, Graham, Frankl, and Shearer (1986), where H is specialized to a triangle. The derived bound is expressed in terms of the chromatic number of H, while a relaxed version, formulated using the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$-function of the complement of H, offers reduced computational complexity. Additionally, a probabilistic version of Shearer's lemma, combined with properties of the Shannon entropy, are employed to establish bounds related to the enumeration of graph homomorphisms, providing further insights into the interplay between combinatorial structures and information-theoretic principles.</description>
