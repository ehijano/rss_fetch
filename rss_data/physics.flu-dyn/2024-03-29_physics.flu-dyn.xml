      <title>Natural convection in a vertical channel. Part 1. Wavenumber interaction and Eckhaus instability in a narrow domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convection in a vertical channel subjected to a horizontal temperature gradient is numerically investigated. Previous numerical simulations reveal a variety of behaviors: steady, time-periodic and chaotic. We extend previous numerical investigations by constructing stable and unstable branches of equilibria and periodic orbits of the underlying Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations by parametric continuation. In a narrow domain of vertical aspect ratio ten, the observed flow structures are dominated by the competition between three and four co-rotating rolls. We identify the invariant solution branches underlying the observed flow dynamics, characterize the bifurcations creating those branches and link the observed bifurcation scenarios to the symmetries of the primary branches. Specifically, we show that D4 symmetry dictates that several intermediate branches bifurcate simultaneously from the four-roll branch, while D3 symmetry requires that the intersection of these intermediate branches with the three-roll branch be transcritical. We observe other manifestations of the competition between three and four rolls, in which the symmetry in time or in the transverse direction is broken, leading to limit cycles or wavy rolls, respectively. Our work highlights the interest of combining numerical simulations, bifurcation theory, and group theory, in order to understand the transitions between and origin of flow patterns.</description>

      <title>Generalisation of the Spectral Difference scheme for the diffused-interface five equation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work focuses on the generalisation of the Spectral Difference (SD) scheme to the reduced Baer-Nunziato system known as five-equation model for the simulation of two immiscible compressible fluids. This five equation model is considered with the additional Allen-Cahn regularisation to avoid both over-diffusion and over-thinning of the phase field representing the interface. Finally, in order to preserve contact discontinuities, in the reconstruction step of the spectral difference scheme, a change of variables from conservative to primitive is used. This approach is shown to be beneficial in avoiding pressure oscillations at material interfaces. An extensive series of numerical tests are proposed to assess accuracy and robustness of the present method. Both kinematic (Rider-Kothe vortex) and two-phase flow problems (Rayleigh-Taylor instability, shock-droplet interaction, Taylor-Green vortex) are considered.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Relationship between Simulation Parameters and Flow Variables in Simulating Atmospheric Gravity Waves in Wind Energy Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wind farms, particularly offshore clusters, are becoming larger than ever before. Besides influencing wind farms and local meteorology downstream, large wind farms can trigger atmospheric gravity waves in the inversion layer and the free atmosphere aloft. Wind farm-induced gravity waves can cause adverse pressure gradients upstream of the wind farm, that contribute to the global blockage effect, and favorable pressure gradients above and downstream of the wind farm that enhance wake recovery.
  Numerical modeling is a powerful means of studying wind farm-induced atmospheric gravity waves, but it comes with the challenge of handling spurious reflections of these waves from domain boundaries. Approaches like radiation boundary conditions and forcing zones are used to avoid the reflections. However, the simulation setup heavily relies on ad-hoc processes. For instance, the widely used Rayleigh damping method requires ad-hoc tuning to acquire a setup only applicable to a particular case. To surmount this hurdle, we conduct a systematic LES study for flow over a 2D hill and through wind farm canopies that explores the dependence of domain size and damping layer setup on parameters driving linearly stratified atmospheric flows.
  Mainly the internal waves in the free atmosphere reflect from the boundaries, therefore by simulation linearly stratified conditions we focus on internal waves only. The Froude number drives most of the internal wave properties, such as wavelengths, amplitude, and direction. Therefore, the domain sizing and Rayleigh damping layer setup mainly depends on the Froude number. We anticipated the effective wavelengths to be the correct length scale to size the domain and damping layer thickness. Also, the damping coefficient is scaled with Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency.</description>

      <title>The Sun's differential rotation is controlled by high-latitude baroclinically unstable inertial modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapidly rotating fluids have a rotation profile which depends only on the distance from the rotation axis, in accordance with the Taylor-Proudman theorem. Although the Sun was expected to be such a body, helioseismology showed that the rotation rate in the convection zone is closer to constant on radii. It has been postulated that this deviation is due to the poles being warmer than the equator by a few degrees. Using numerical simulations, we show that the pole-to-equator temperature difference cannot exceed 7 Kelvin as a result of the back-reaction of the high-latitude baroclinically unstable inertial modes. The observed amplitudes of the modes further indicate that this maximum temperature difference is reached in the Sun. We conclude that the Sun's latitudinal differential rotation reaches its maximum allowed value.</description>

      <title>A unified SHTC multiphase model of continuum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified nonequilibrium model of continuum mechanics for compressible multiphase flows. The model, which is formulated within the framework of Symmetric Hyperbolic Thermodynamically Compatible (SHTC) equations, can describe the arbitrary number of phases that can be heat-conducting inviscid and viscous fluids}, as well as elastoplastic solids. The phases are allowed to have different velocities, pressures, temperatures, and shear stresses, while the material interfaces are treated as diffuse interfaces with the volume fraction playing the role of the interface field. To relate our model to other multiphase approaches, we reformulate the SHTC governing equations in terms of the phase state parameters and put them in the form of Baer-Nunziato-type models. It is the Baer-Nunziato form of the SHTC equations which is then solved numerically using a robust second-order path-conservative MUSCL-Hancock finite volume method on Cartesian meshes. Due to the fact that the obtained governing equations are very challenging, we restrict our numerical examples to a simplified version of the model, focusing on the isentropic limit for three-phase mixtures. To address the stiffness properties of the relaxation source terms present in the model, the implemented scheme incorporates a semi-analytical time integration method specifically designed for the non-linear stiff source terms governing the strain relaxation. The validation process involves a wide range of benchmarks and several applications for compressible multiphase problems. Notably, results are presented for multiphase flows in all the relaxation limit cases of the model, including inviscid and viscous Newtonian fluids, as well as non-linear hyperelastic and elastoplastic solids.</description>

      <title>twoPhaseInterTrackFoam: an OpenFOAM module for Arbitrary Lagrangian/Eulerian Interface Tracking with Surfactants and Subgrid-Scale Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an implementation of the unstructured Finite-Volume Arbitrary Lagrangian / Eulerian (ALE) Interface-Tracking method for simulating incompressible, immiscible two-phase flows as an OpenFOAM module. In addition to interface-tracking capabilities that include tracking of two fluid phases, an implementation of a Subgrid-Scale (SGS) modeling framework for increased accuracy when simulating sharp boundary layers is enclosed. The SGS modeling framework simplifies embedding subgrid-scale profiles into the unstructured Finite Volume discretization. Our design of the SGS model library significantly simplifies adding new SGS models and applying SGS modeling to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in OpenFOAM.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Turbulence: Closure as a partial differential equation constrained optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning is increasingly becoming a promising pathway to improving the accuracy of sub-grid scale (SGS) turbulence closure models for large eddy simulations (LES). We leverage the concept of differentiable turbulence, whereby an end-to-end differentiable solver is used in combination with physics-inspired choices of deep learning architectures to learn highly effective and versatile SGS models for two-dimensional turbulent flow. We perform an in-depth analysis of the inductive biases in the chosen architectures, finding that the inclusion of small-scale non-local features is most critical to effective SGS modeling, while large-scale features can improve pointwise accuracy of the \textit{a-posteriori} solution field. The velocity gradient tensor on the LES grid can be mapped directly to the SGS stress via decomposition of the inputs and outputs into isotropic, deviatoric, and anti-symmetric components. We see that the model can generalize to a variety of flow configurations, including higher and lower Reynolds numbers and different forcing conditions. We show that the differentiable physics paradigm is more successful than offline, \textit{a-priori} learning, and that hybrid solver-in-the-loop approaches to deep learning offer an ideal balance between computational efficiency, accuracy, and generalization. Our experiments provide physics-based recommendations for deep-learning based SGS modeling for generalizable closure modeling of turbulence.</description>
