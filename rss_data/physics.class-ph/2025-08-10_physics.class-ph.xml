      <title>Nonlinear dispersive waves in soft elastic laminates under finite magneto-deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered media can be used as acoustic filters, allowing only waves of certain frequencies to propagate. In soft magneto-active laminates, the shear wave band gaps (i.e., the frequency intervals for which shear waves cannot propagate) can be adjusted after fabrication by exploiting the magneto-elastic coupling. In the present study, the control of shear wave propagation in magneto-active stratified media is revisited by means of homogenisation theory, and extended to nonlinear waves of moderate amplitude. Building upon earlier works, the layers are modelled by means of a revised hard-magnetic material theory for which the total Cauchy stress is symmetric, and the incompressible elastic response is of generalised neo-Hookean type (encompassing Yeoh, Fung-Demiray, and Gent materials). Using asymptotic homogenisation, a nonlinear dispersive wave equation with cubic nonlinearity is derived, under certain simplifying assumptions. In passing, an effective strain energy function describing such laminates is obtained. The combined effects of nonlinearity and wave dispersion contribute to the formation of solitary waves, which are analysed using the homogenised wave equation and a modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) approximation of the latter. The mKdV equation is compared to direct numerical simulations of the impact problem, and various consequences of these results are explored. In particular, we show that an upper bound for the speed of solitary waves can be adjusted by varying the applied magnetic field, or by modifying the properties of the microstructure.</description>

      <title>Dispersion Characteristics of a Glide-Symmetric Square Patch Metamaterial with Giant Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dispersion characteristics of a highly anisotropic metamaterial comprised of metal square patches arranged in a glide symmetry pattern and submerged in vacuum. Theoretical formulas are proposed to describe the electromagnetic tensors of a corresponding uniaxial effective medium with dielectric and magnetic responses. In addition, this work employs theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to examine the interaction between the metamaterial and electromagnetic waves across a broad spectral range. Band diagrams and isofrequency contours show good agreement between theoretical and numerical results for low frequencies and certain directions of propagation at higher frequencies. The ease of designing the metamaterial structure for various applications is facilitated by the derived theoretical formulas, which enable accurate prediction of the electromagnetic response across a wide range of frequencies based on geometric parameters.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the longstanding challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating classical Newtonian potential theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that improves both the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method employs Lie group theory and exponential mapping to characterize vector flows associated with rotational deformations. We derive functional equations for perturbations in density and gravitational potential, resolved analytically using the shift operator and Neumann series. This extends Clairaut's classical linear theory into the nonlinear regime. The resulting formulation yields an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing hydrostatic equilibrium under rotation without assuming slow rotation. This generalized Clairaut equation incorporates nonlinear effects and accommodates large rotational speeds. We validate the theory by deriving exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and the unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques to analyze radial harmonics of the shape function and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order spectral corrections and derive boundary conditions for radial harmonics. This enables accurate computation of Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments, offering a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational deformations in astrophysical systems.</description>
