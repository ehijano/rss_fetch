      <description>arXiv:2404.16902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present in this paper a compilation of solar atlases from $\lambda$ 3000 {\AA} to $\lambda$ 8800 {\AA} with spectral lines identified by the Moore table and with the corresponding equivalent Lande factors g*. We used two spectra at disk centre ($\mu$ = 1.0), from Delbouille and Kurucz, and two spectra at the limb from Stenflo and Gandorfer, respectively at $\mu$ = 0.145 and $\mu$ = 0.10.</description>

      <title>Notes on the Practical Application of Nested Sampling: MultiNest, (Non)convergence, and Rectification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nested sampling is a promising tool for Bayesian statistical analysis because it simultaneously performs parameter estimation and facilitates model comparison. MultiNest is one of the most popular nested sampling implementations, and has been applied to a wide variety of problems in the physical sciences. However, MultiNest results are frequently unreliable, and accompanying convergence tests are a necessary component of any analysis. Using simple, analytically tractable test problems, I illustrate how MultiNest (1) can produce systematically biased estimates of the Bayesian evidence, which are more significantly biased for problems of higher dimensionality; (2) can derive posterior estimates with errors on the order of $\sim100\%$; (3) is more likely to underestimate the width of a credible interval than to overestimate it - to a minor degree for smooth problems, but much more so when sampling noisy likelihoods. Nevertheless, I show how MultiNest can be used to jump-start Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling or more rigorous nested sampling techniques, potentially accelerating more trustworthy measurements of posterior distributions and Bayesian evidences, and overcoming the challenge of Markov chain Monte Carlo initialization.</description>

      <title>High-Redshift Extragalactic Science with the Single Aperture Large Telescope for Universe Studies (SALTUS) Space Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an overview of the high-redshift extragalactic science case for the Single Aperture Large Telescope for Universe Studies (SALTUS) far-infrared NASA probe-class mission concept. Enabled by its 14m primary reflector, SALTUS offers enormous gains in spatial resolution and spectral sensitivity over previous far-IR missions. SALTUS would be a versatile observatory capable of responding to the scientific needs of the extragalactic community in the 2030s, and a natural follow-on to the near- and mid-IR capabilities of JWST. Key early-universe science goals for SALTUS focus on understanding the role of galactic feedback processes in regulating galaxy growth across cosmic time, and charting the rise of metals and dust from the early universe to the present. This paper summarizes these science cases and the performance metrics most relevant for high-redshift observations.</description>

      <title>Milky Way and Nearby Galaxies Science with the Single Aperture Large Telescope for Universe Studies (\textit{SALTUS}) Space Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an overview of the Milky Way and nearby galaxies science case for the \textit{Single Aperture Large Telescope for Universe Studies} (SALTUS) far-infrared NASA probe-class mission concept. SALTUS offers enormous gains in spatial resolution and spectral sensitivity over previous far-IR missions, thanks to its cold ($&lt;$40~K) 14-m primary mirror. Key Milky Way and nearby galaxies science goals for SALTUS focus on understanding the role of star formation in feedback in the Local Universe. In addition to this science case, SALTUS would open a new window to to of Galactic and extragalactic communities in the 2030s, enable fundamentally new questions to be answered, and be a far-IR analog to the near- and mid-IR capabilities of JWST. This paper summarizes the Milky Way and nearby galaxies science case and plans for notional observing programs in both guaranteed and guest (open) time.</description>

      <title>Star-Image Centering with Deep Learning II: HST/WFPC2 Full Field of View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an expanded and improved deep-learning (DL) methodology for determining centers of star images on HST/WFPC2 exposures. Previously, we demonstrated that our DL model can eliminate the pixel-phase bias otherwise present in these undersampled images; however that analysis was limited to the central portion of each detector.
  In the current work we introduce the inclusion of global positions to account for the PSF variation across the entire chip and instrumental magnitudes to account for nonlinear effects such as charge transfer efficiency. The DL model is trained using a unique series of WFPC2 observations of globular cluster 47 Tuc, data sets comprising over 600 dithered exposures taken in each of two filters, F555W and F814W.
  It is found that the PSF variations across each chip correspond to corrections of the order of 100 mpix, while magnitude effects are at a level of about 10 mpix. Importantly, pixel-phase bias is eliminated with the DL model; whereas, with a classic centering algorithm, the amplitude of this bias can be up to 40 mpix. Our improved DL model yields star-image centers with uncertainties of 8-10 mpix across the full field of view of WFPC2.</description>

      <title>A new approach to analyse single-site video observations: A Tau Her 2022 case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present a continuation of the work that was based on video observations of the Tau Her 2022 outburst from the McDonald Observatory, Texas, US. On the night of the maximum in 2022 we detected 626 individual Tau Her meteors, for which we estimated photovisual magnitudes and analysed their distribution on the sky to determine the radiant position in an innovative way. The derived population index is $5.56 \pm 1.83$, while the radiant position for the mid-time of the observations is: $\mathrm{RA} = 209.71 ^\circ \pm 1.01 ^\circ$, $\mathrm{Dec} = 27.73 ^\circ \pm 0.07 ^\circ$. Both measurements are in good agreement with other results in the literature, although our population index seems to be higher than most of the published values. We speculate this might be due to the higher sensitivity of our equipment to fainter meteors.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the Far-Infrared Polarimetry Approach Envisioned for the PRIMA Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest in the study of magnetic fields and the properties of interstellar dust, explored through increasingly capable far-IR/submillimeter polarimetry, along with maturing detector technology, have set the stage for a transformative leap in polarization mapping capability using a cryogenic space telescope. We describe the approach pursued by the proposed Probe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) to make ultra-deep maps of intensity and polarization in four bands in the 91-232 micron range. A simple, polarimetry-optimized PRIMA Polarimetric Imager (PPI) is designed for this purpose, consisting of arrays of single-polarization Kinetic Inductance Detectors oriented with three angles which allow measurement of Stokes I, Q, and U in single scans. In this study, we develop an end-to-end observation simulator to perform a realistic test of the approach for the case of mapping a nearby galaxy. The observations take advantage of a beam-steering mirror to perform efficient, two-dimensional, crossing scans. Map making is based on 'destriping' approaches demonstrated for Herschel/SPIRE and Planck. Taking worst-case assumptions for detector sensitivity including 1/f noise, we find excellent recovery of simulated input astrophysical maps, with I, Q, and U detected at near fundamental limits. We describe how PPI performs detector relative calibration and mitigates the key systematic effects to accomplish PRIMA polarization science goals.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Radiation Hydrodynamics scheme with gravity tree-based adaptive optimization algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling the interaction between ionizing photons emitted from massive stars and their environment is essential to further our understanding of galactic ecosystems. We present a hybrid Radiation-Hydrodynamics (RHD) scheme that couples an SPH code to a grid-based Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer code. The coupling is achieved by using the particle positions as generating sites for a Voronoi grid, and applying a precise mapping of particle-interpolated densities onto the grid cells that ensures mass conservation. The mapping, however, can be computationally infeasible for large numbers of particles. We introduce our tree-based algorithm for optimizing coupled RHD codes. Astrophysical SPH codes typically utilize tree-building procedures to sort particles into hierarchical groups (referred to as nodes) for evaluating self-gravity. Our algorithm adaptively walks the gravity tree and transforms the extracted nodes into pseudo-SPH particles, which we use for the grid construction and mapping. This method allows for the temporary reduction of fluid resolution in regions that are less affected by the radiation. A neighbour-finding scheme is implemented to aid our smoothing length solver for nodes. We show that the use of pseudo-particles produces equally accurate results that agree with benchmarks, and achieves a speed-up that scales with the reduction in the final number of particle-cell pairs being mapped.</description>

      <title>Energy Recovery System for Large Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a kinetic energy recovery system for large telescopes is presented, with the Atacama Large Aperture Submm Telescope (AtLAST) as a possible target application. The system consists of supercapacitors integrated in the DC-link of motor inverters through a bidirectional DC-DC converter. The optimal system design, based on the energy flow analysis within the telescope's power electronics, is introduced. The proposed system is simulated as part of the telescope's drives, providing not only a significant reduction in energy consumption of the telescope due to motion, but also remarkably reducing (or shaving) grid power peaks. We find that the system presented here can contribute to making both current and future observatories more sustainable.</description>

      <title>ANAIS-112 three years data: a sensitive model independent negative test of the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) are well-motivated candidates for dark matter. One signature of galactic WIMPs is the annual modulation expected in a detector's interaction rate, which arises from Earth's rotation around the Sun. Over two decades, the DAMA/LIBRA experiment has observed such modulation with 250 kg of NaI(Tl) scintillators, in accordance with WIMP expectations but inconsistent with the negative results of other experiments. The signal, however, depends on the target, so in order to either validate or refute the DAMA signal it is necessary to replicate the experiment using the same material. This is the goal of the ANAIS-112 experiment, currently underway since August 2017 with 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl). In this work, we present a reanalysis of three years of data employing an improved analysis chain to enhance the experimental sensitivity. The results presented here are consistent with the absence of modulation and inconsistent with DAMA's observation at nearly 3$\sigma$ C.L., with the potential to reach a 5$\sigma$ level within 8 years of data collection. Additionally, we explore the impact of different scintillation quenching factors in the comparison between ANAIS-112 and DAMA/LIBRA.</description>

      <title>Archives of Photographic PLates for Astronomical USE (APPLAUSE) Digitisation of astronomical plates and their integration into the International Virtual Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Archives of Photographic PLates for Astronomical USE (APPLAUSE) project is aimed at digitising astronomical photographic plates from three major German plate collections, making them accessible through integration into the International Virtual Observatory (IVO). Photographic plates and related materials (logbooks, envelopes, etc.) were scanned with commercial flatbed scanners. Astrometric and photometric calibrations were carried out with the developed PyPlate software, using Gaia EDR3 data as a reference. The APPLAUSE data publication complies with IVO standards. The latest data release contains images and metadata from 27 plate collections from the partner institutes in Hamburg, Bamberg, and Potsdam, along with digitised archives provided by Tautenburg, Tartu, and Vatican observatories. Altogether, over two billion calibrated measurements extracted from about 70,000 direct photographic plates can readily be used to create long-term light curves. For instance, we constructed the historic light curve of the enigmatic dipping star KIC 8462852. We found no evidence of previously assumed variations on timescales of decades in our light curve. Potential uses of APPLAUSE images for transient sources can be appreciated by following the development of the nova shell of GK Per (1901) over time and the change in brightness of two extragalactic supernovae. The database holds about 10,000 spectral plates. We made use of objective prism plates to follow the temporal changes of Nova DN Gem through 1912 and 1913, highlighting an outburst in early 1913.</description>

      <title>Bayesian synthesis of astrometric wobble and total light curves in close binary supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test the potential of Bayesian synthesis of upcoming multi-instrument data to extract orbital parameters and individual light curves of close binary supermassive black holes (CB-SMBH) with subparsec separations. Next generation (ng) interferometers, will make possible the observation of astrometric wobbles in CB-SMBH. Combining them with periodic variable time-domain data from surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), allows for a more information on CB-SMBH candidates compared to standalone observational methods. Our method reliably determines binary parameters and component fluxes from binary total flux across long-term, intermediate and short-term binary dynamics and observational configurations, assuming ten annual observations, even in short period "q-accrete" objects. Expected CB-SMBH astrometric wobbles constructed from binary dynamical parameters, might serve in refining observational strategies for CB-SMBH. Combination of inferred mass ratio, light curves of binary components, and observed photocenter wobbles can be a proxy for the activity states of CB-SMBH components.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Subtleties in the Scaling of the 'Terminal Momentum' For Galaxy Formation Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In galaxy formation simulations, it is increasingly common to represent supernovae (SNe) at finite resolution (when the Sedov-Taylor phase is unresolved) via hybrid energy-momentum coupling with some 'terminal momentum' $p_{\rm term}$ (depending weakly on ambient density and metallicity) that represents unresolved work from an energy-conserving phase. Numerical implementations can ensure momentum and energy conservation of such methods, but these require that couplings depend on the surrounding gas velocity field (radial velocity $\langle v_{r} \rangle$). This raises the question of whether $p_{\rm term}$ should also be velocity-dependent, which we explore analytically and in simulations. We show that for simple spherical models, the dependence of $p_{\rm term}$ on $\langle v_{r} \rangle$ introduces negligible corrections beyond those already imposed by energy conservation if $\langle v_{r} \rangle \ge 0$. However, for SNe in some net converging flow ($\langle v_{r} \rangle&lt;0$), naively coupling the total momentum when a blastwave reaches the standard cooling/snowplow phase (or some effective cooling time/velocity/temperature criterion) leads to enormous $p_{\rm term}$ and potentially pathological behaviors. We propose an alternative $\Delta$-Momentum formulation which represents the differential SNe effect and show this leads to opposite behavior of $p_{\rm term}$ in this limit. We also consider a more conservative velocity-independent formulation. Testing in numerical simulations, these directly translate to large effects on predicted star formation histories and stellar masses of massive galaxies, explaining differences between some models and motivating further study in idealized simulations.</description>

      <title>An improved correction of radial-velocity systematic for the SOPHIE spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High precision spectrographs might exhibit temporal variations of their reference velocity or nightly zero point (NZP). One way to monitor the NZP is to measure bright stars, which are assumed to have an intrinsic radial velocity variation much smaller than the instrument's precision. While this method is effective in most cases, it does not fully propagate the uncertainty arising from NZP variations. We present a new method to correct for NZP variations in radial-velocity time series. This method uses Gaussian Processes based on ancillary information to model these systematic effects. It enables us to propagate the uncertainties of this correction into the overall error budget. Another advantage of this approach is that it relies on ancillary data collected simultaneously with the spectra rather than solely on dedicated observations of constant stars. We applied this method to the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory using a few instrument's housekeeping data, such as the internal pressure and temperature variations. Our results demonstrate that this method effectively models the red noise of constant stars, even with a limited amount of housekeeping data, while preserving the signals of exoplanets. Using both simulations with mock planets and real data, we found that this method improves the false-alarm probability of detections by several orders of magnitude. By simulating numerous planetary signals, we were able to detect up to 10 percent more planets with small amplitude radial velocity signals. We used this new correction to reanalysed the planetary system around HD158259 and improved the detection of the outermost planets. We also suggest decreasing the observing cadence of the constant stars to optimise telescope time for scientific targets.</description>

      <title>The Inefficiency of Genetic Programming for Symbolic Regression -- Extended Version</title>

Abstract: We analyse the search behaviour of genetic programming for symbolic regression in practically relevant but limited settings, allowing exhaustive enumeration of all solutions. This enables us to quantify the success probability of finding the best possible expressions, and to compare the search efficiency of genetic programming to random search in the space of semantically unique expressions. This analysis is made possible by improved algorithms for equality saturation, which we use to improve the Exhaustive Symbolic Regression algorithm; this produces the set of semantically unique expression structures, orders of magnitude smaller than the full symbolic regression search space. We compare the efficiency of random search in the set of unique expressions and genetic programming. For our experiments we use two real-world datasets where symbolic regression has been used to produce well-fitting univariate expressions: the Nikuradse dataset of flow in rough pipes and the Radial Acceleration Relation of galaxy dynamics. The results show that genetic programming in such limited settings explores only a small fraction of all unique expressions, and evaluates expressions repeatedly that are congruent to already visited expressions.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the long-studied radial velocity (RV) target HD26965 using recent observations from the NASA-NSF 'NEID' precision Doppler facility. Leveraging a suite of classical activity indicators, combined with line-by-line RV analyses, we demonstrate that the claimed 45-day signal previously identified as a planet candidate is most likely an activity-induced signal. Correlating the bulk (spectrally-averaged) RV with canonical line activity indicators confirms a multi-day 'lag' between the observed activity indicator time series and the measured RV. When accounting for this lag, we show that much of the observed RV signal can be removed by a linear detrending of the data. Investigating activity at the line-by-line level, we find a depth-dependent correlation between individual line RVs and the bulk RVs, further indicative of periodic suppression of convective blueshift causing the observed RV variability, rather than an orbiting planet. We conclude that the combined evidence of the activity correlations and depth dependence is consistent with a radial velocity signature dominated by a rotationally-modulated activity signal at a period of $\sim$42 days. We hypothesize that this activity signature is due to a combination of spots and convective blueshift suppression. The tools applied in our analysis are broadly applicable to other stars, and could help paint a more comprehensive picture of the manifestations of stellar activity in future Doppler RV surveys.</description>
