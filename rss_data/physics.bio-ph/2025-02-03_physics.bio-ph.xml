      <title>Hydrated Cable Bacteria Exhibit Protonic Conductivity Over Long Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the direct measurement of proton transport along filamentous Desulfobulbaceae, or cable bacteria. Cable bacteria are filamentous multicellular microorganisms that have garnered much interest due to their ability to serve as electrical conduits, transferring electrons over several millimeters. Our results indicate that cable bacteria can also function as protonic conduits because they contain proton wires that transport protons at distances greater than 100 um. We find that protonic conductivity ({\sigma}P) along cable bacteria varies between samples and is measured as high as 114 +/- 28 uS cm^-1 at 25-degrees C and 70-percent relative humidity (RH). For cable bacteria, the protonic conductance (GP) and {\sigma}P are dependent upon the RH, increasing by as much as 26-fold between 60-percent and 80-percent RH. This observation implies that proton transport occurs via the Grotthuss mechanism along water associated with cable bacteria, forming proton wires. In order to determine {\sigma}P and GP along cable bacteria, we implemented a protocol using a modified transfer-printing technique to deposit either palladium interdigitated protodes (IDP), palladium transfer length method (TLM) protodes, or gold interdigitated electrodes(IDE) on top of cable bacteria. Due to the relatively mild nature of the transfer-printing technique, this method should be applicable to a broad array of biological samples and curved materials. The observation of protonic conductivity in cable bacteria presents possibilities for investigating the importance of long-distance proton transport in microbial ecosystems and to potentially build biotic or biomimetic scaffolds to interface with materials via proton-mediated gateways or channels.</description>

      <title>BARCODE: Biomaterial Activity Readouts to Categorize, Optimize, Design and Engineer for high throughput screening and characterization of dynamically restructuring soft materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active, responsive, nonequilibrium materials, at the forefront of materials engineering, offer dynamical restructuring, mobility and other complex life-like properties. Yet, this enhanced functionality comes with significant amplification of the size and complexity of the datasets needed to characterize their properties, thereby challenging conventional approaches to analysis. To meet this need, we present BARCODE (Biomaterial Activity Readouts to Categorize, Optimize, Design and Engineer), an open-access software that automates high throughput screening of microscopy video data to enable nonequilibrium material optimization and discovery. BARCODE produces a unique fingerprint or barcode of performance metrics that visually and quantitatively encodes dynamic material properties with minimal file size. Using three complementary material agnostic analysis branches, BARCODE significantly reduces data dimensionality and size, while providing rich, multiparametric outputs and rapid tractable characterization of activity and structure. We analyze a series of datasets of cytoskeleton networks and cell monolayers to demonstrate the ability of BARCODE to accelerate and streamline screening and analysis, reveal unexpected correlations and emergence, and enable broad non-expert data access, comparison, and sharing.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional chiral active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model for helical motion of microorganisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active movement is essential for the survival of microorganisms like bacteria, algae and unicellular parasites, for example the ones causing the disease malaria. In three dimensions, both swimming and gliding microorganisms often exhibit helical trajectories. Here we introduce a stochastic dynamics model for chiral self-propelled particles, for which both propulsion force and torque are internally generated, the latter stochastically by an Ornstein Uhlenbeck process. We demonstrate that a truncated version of the full model can be solved analytically, in very good agreement with computer simulations for the full model. Our main result is that this model allows for larger long-time mean squared displacements for helical compared to straight 3D movement at the same speed, suggesting an evolutionary benefit of the often observed helical movements of microorganisms, and opposite to the reduction of diffusion caused by chirality in 2D. We then provide an experimental example by analyzing imaging data for malaria parasites that glide through hydrogels on helical trajectories.</description>

      <title>Towards Fast, Specialized Machine Learning Force Fields: Distilling Foundation Models via Energy Hessians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The foundation model (FM) paradigm is transforming Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs), leveraging general-purpose representations and scalable training to perform a variety of computational chemistry tasks. Although MLFF FMs have begun to close the accuracy gap relative to first-principles methods, there is still a strong need for faster inference speed. Additionally, while research is increasingly focused on general-purpose models which transfer across chemical space, practitioners typically only study a small subset of systems at a given time. This underscores the need for fast, specialized MLFFs relevant to specific downstream applications, which preserve test-time physical soundness while maintaining train-time scalability. In this work, we introduce a method for transferring general-purpose representations from MLFF foundation models to smaller, faster MLFFs specialized to specific regions of chemical space. We formulate our approach as a knowledge distillation procedure, where the smaller "student" MLFF is trained to match the Hessians of the energy predictions of the "teacher" foundation model. Our specialized MLFFs can be up to 20 $\times$ faster than the original foundation model, while retaining, and in some cases exceeding, its performance and that of undistilled models. We also show that distilling from a teacher model with a direct force parameterization into a student model trained with conservative forces (i.e., computed as derivatives of the potential energy) successfully leverages the representations from the large-scale teacher for improved accuracy, while maintaining energy conservation during test-time molecular dynamics simulations. More broadly, our work suggests a new paradigm for MLFF development, in which foundation models are released along with smaller, specialized simulation "engines" for common chemical subsets.</description>
