      <title>Benchmarking AlphaFold3's protein-protein complex accuracy and machine learning prediction reliability for binding free energy changes upon mutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AlphaFold 3 (AF3), the latest version of protein structure prediction software, goes beyond its predecessors by predicting protein-protein complexes. It could revolutionize drug discovery and protein engineering, marking a major step towards comprehensive, automated protein structure prediction. However, independent validation of AF3's predictions is necessary. Evaluated using the SKEMPI 2.0 database which involves 317 protein-protein complexes and 8338 mutations, AF3 complex structures give rise to a very good Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.86 for predicting protein-protein binding free energy changes upon mutation, slightly less than the 0.88 achieved earlier with the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures. Nonetheless, AF3 complex structures led to a 8.6% increase in the prediction RMSE compared to original PDB complex structures. Additionally, some of AF3's complex structures have large errors, which were not captured in its ipTM performance metric. Finally, it is found that AF3's complex structures are not reliable for intrinsically flexible regions or domains.</description>

      <title>Kirigami: large convolutional kernels improve deep learning-based RNA secondary structure prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel fully convolutional neural network (FCN) architecture for predicting the secondary structure of ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules. Interpreting RNA structures as weighted graphs, we employ deep learning to estimate the probability of base pairing between nucleotide residues. Unique to our model are its massive 11-pixel kernels, which we argue provide a distinct advantage for FCNs on the specialized domain of RNA secondary structures. On a widely adopted, standardized test set comprised of 1,305 molecules, the accuracy of our method exceeds that of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) secondary structure prediction software, achieving a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) over 11-40% higher than that of other leading methods on overall structures and 58-400% higher on pseudoknots specifically.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Protein-Ligand Docking: Are We There Yet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of ligand binding on protein structures and their in vivo functions carry numerous implications for modern biomedical research and biotechnology development efforts such as drug discovery. Although several deep learning (DL) methods and benchmarks designed for protein-ligand docking have recently been introduced, to date no prior works have systematically studied the behavior of docking methods within the practical context of (1) using predicted (apo) protein structures for docking (e.g., for broad applicability); (2) docking multiple ligands concurrently to a given target protein (e.g., for enzyme design); and (3) having no prior knowledge of binding pockets (e.g., for pocket generalization). To enable a deeper understanding of docking methods' real-world utility, we introduce PoseBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for practical protein-ligand docking. PoseBench enables researchers to rigorously and systematically evaluate DL docking methods for apo-to-holo protein-ligand docking and protein-ligand structure generation using both single and multi-ligand benchmark datasets, the latter of which we introduce for the first time to the DL community. Empirically, using PoseBench, we find that all recent DL docking methods but one fail to generalize to multi-ligand protein targets and also that template-based docking algorithms perform equally well or better for multi-ligand docking as recent single-ligand DL docking methods, suggesting areas of improvement for future work. Code, data, tutorials, and benchmark results are available at https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/PoseBench.</description>
