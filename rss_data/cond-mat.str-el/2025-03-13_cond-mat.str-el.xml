      <title>Elastic Response and Instabilities of Anomalous Hall Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous Hall crystals (AHCs) are exotic phases of matter that simultaneously break continuous translation symmetry and exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect. AHCs have recently been proposed as an explanation for the observation of an integer quantum anomalous Hall phase in a multilayer graphene system. Despite intense theoretical and experimental interest, little is known about the mechanical properties of AHCs. We study the elastic properties of AHCs, first by utilizing a continuum model with uniform Berry curvature. In contrast to Wigner crystals, we find that the stiffness of the AHC weakens and eventually vanishes as electronic interactions are increased. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the triangular lattice AHC arising in an experimentally relevant parameter regime of a realistic model of rhombohedral pentalayer graphene is unstable, emphasizing the importance of understanding the mechanical properties of AHCs for interpreting experiments.</description>

      <title>Towards Excitations and Dynamical Quantities in Correlated Lattices with Density Matrix Embedding Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density matrix embedding theory (DMET) provides a framework to describe ground-state expectation values in strongly correlated systems, but its extension to dynamical quantities is still an open problem. We demonstrate one route to obtaining excitations and dynamical spectral functions by using the techniques of DMET to approximate the matrix elements that arise in a single-mode inspired excitation ansatz. We demonstrate this approach in the 1D Hubbard model, comparing the neutral excitations, single-particle density of states, charge, and spin dynamical structure factors to benchmarks from the Bethe ansatz and density matrix renormalization group. Our work highlights the potential of these ideas in building computationally efficient approaches for dynamical quantities.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Hybridization Dynamics in the Quasi-One-Dimensional Kondo Lattice CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$ Revealed by Ultrafast Optical Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ultrafast dynamics of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$ using optical pump-probe spectroscopy. Time-resolved pump-probe reflectivity measurements reveal a strong anisotropy in the photoinduced response, which is a direct consequence of the material's unique electronic structure. The temperature dependence of the relaxation dynamics provides evidence for the formation of two distinct hybridization gaps that appear at different temperatures in the heavy fermion state. A direct gap of 2$\Delta_{dir}$ $\approx$ 50 meV that persists up to $T^\dag$ $\approx$ 90 K, well above the coherence temperature $T^*$ $\approx$ 20 K. We attribute this higher-temperature gap to the hybridization fluctuations. An indirect gap of 2$\Delta_{ind}$ $\approx$ 10 meV opens closer to $T^*$, signifying the development of long-range coherence in the heavy fermion state. Furthermore, we find that the hybridization gap can be suppressed with increasing pump fluence, indicating a delicate interplay between photoexcitation and the coherent heavy fermion state. Our results provide insights into the interplay of Kondo physics and low dimensionality in CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, and establish ultrafast optical spectroscopy as a sensitive probe of anisotropic hybridization in heavy fermion materials.</description>

      <title>Local probe evidence supporting altermagnetism in Co$_{1/4}$NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muon spin rotation (${\mu}$SR), combined with muon stopping site and local field analysis, was used to investigate the magnetic properties of cobalt intercalated 2H-NbSe$_2$ (Co$_{1/4}$NbSe$_2$). Co$_{1/4}$NbSe$_2$ is predicted to be an altermagnet, and whilst neutron diffraction has proposed its magnetic structure, microscopic details such as the magnetic volume fraction remain unclear. Therefore, a local probe investigation of its magnetism is essential. Here, we report the determination of the magnetically ordered volume fraction, ordered moment size, and magnetic structure. Our results reveal a sharp second-order transition to a full-volume-fraction, homogeneous magnetic order below $T_\mathrm{N}~=~168~$K. The moments are aligned antiparallel along the $c$-axis, consistent with neutron diffraction and altermagnetism. ${\mu}$SR reveals that the state remains stable under a $c$-axis magnetic field up to $0.78~$T, with magnetisation measurements suggesting this robust regimes extends to at least $5$~T. Within the time resolution of ${\mu}$SR, no precursor slow altermagnetic fluctuations were detected above $T_\mathrm{N}$, which is important for interpreting the band splitting in the paramagnetic state reported by photoemission studies. These findings support altermagnetism in Co$_{1/4}$NbSe$_2$ and motivate further experiments to explore the tunability of its magnetic and electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Microscopic evidence for spin-spinless stripe order with reduced Ni moments within $ab$ plane for bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ probed by $^{139}$La-NQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic electronic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ have been selectively investigated by nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) at the La(2) site outside the NiO$_2$ bilayers. The La(2)$_{\rm a}$ site of the ideal La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ is clearly distinguished from the La(2)$_{\rm b}$ site close to the local defects. Below 150K, almost half of the intrinsic La(2)$_{\rm a}$ sites are dominated by a finite internal field within the $ab$ plane, while the other half are dominated by zero internal field. The result is fully consistent with the single spin-spinless stripe order of ($\cdots\uparrow\circ\downarrow\circ\uparrow\circ\cdots$), where the reduced Ni magnetic moments are parallel to the $ab$-plane. Even for the La(2)$_{\rm b}$ site, the result is also explained within the same model by considering the inhomogeneous internal magnetic fields enhanced around the nearby defects such as oxygen vacancies. These findings provide unambiguous microscopic evidence for the single spin-spinless stripe order below 150 K at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced strange metal phase in a metallic kagome ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strange metallicity with $T$-linear electrical resistance preceding high-$T_c$ superconductivity remains an enigmatic, yet crucial, signature of correlation physics. Using electrical transport and magnetization measurements up to 50 GPa, we show that such a strange-metal phase is formed in pressurized kagome ferromagnet CrNiAs. In contrast to other kagome materials, a linear suppression of the Curie temperature is found, with the ferromagnetic quantum critical point at $p_{\rm{c}} \approx 12.5$ GPa. Remarkably, from $p_{\rm{c}}$ up to the highest measured pressure, characteristic strange-metal behavior is observed, whereas magnetic field reinstates the Fermi liquid. Electronic structure calculations reveal robust weakly dispersive bands persisting unchanged beyond $p_{\rm{c}}$, possibly at the origin of the $T$-linear electrical resistance. This establishes pressurized kagome ferromagnets as an intriguing platform for strange-metal behavior.</description>

      <title>Two distinct quantum critical behaviors in the doped two-dimensional periodic Anderson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum criticality in the doped two-dimensional periodic Anderson model with the hybridization acting as a tuning parameter. Employing the dynamical vertex approximation we find two distinct quantum critical behaviors. One is a quantum critical point between the antiferromagnetically ordered and the Kondo state, both metallic with itinerant $f$ electrons. Here, we obtained the critical exponent $\gamma \approx 1$ for the temperature dependence of the antiferromagnetic susceptibility. We observe a \emph{second} quantum critical behavior with $\gamma=2$ above the continuing zero-temperature magnetic order, at a quantum critical point where the $f$ electrons turn from localized to itinerant.</description>

      <title>Universal Properties of Critical Mixed States from Measurement and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the universal properties of mixed quantum matter obtained from "single-shot" adaptive evolution, in which a quantum-critical ground-state is manipulated through a single round of local measurements and local unitary operations conditioned on spatially-distant measurement outcomes. The resulting mixed quantum states are characterized by altered long-distance correlations between local observables, mixed-state entropy, and entanglement negativity. By invoking a coarse-grained, continuum description of single-shot adaptation in (1+1) dimensions, we find that the extensive mixed-state entropy exhibits a sub-leading, constant correction ($\gamma$), while the entanglement negativity can grow logarithmically with sub-region size, with a coefficient ($\alpha$); both constants can attain universal values which are distinct from the expected behavior in any quantum-critical ground-state. We investigate these properties in single-shot adaptation on ($i$) the critical point between a one-dimensional $Z_{2}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order and a symmetry-broken state, and ($ii$) a spinful Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. In the former case, adaptive evolution that decoheres one sublattice of the SPT can yield a critical mixed-state in which $\alpha$ attains a universal value, which is half of that in the original state. In the latter case, we show how adaptation -- involving feedback on the spin degrees of freedom, after measuring the local charge -- modifies long-distance correlations, and determine via an exact replica field-theoretic calculation that $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ vary continuously with the strength of feedback. Numerical studies confirm these results.</description>

      <title>Odd-parity altermagnetism through sublattice currents: From Haldane-Hubbard model to general bipartite lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the sublattice currents as a feasible route to odd-parity altermagnetism (ALM), where nonrelativistic collinear spin splitting occurs in the bands as an odd function of momentum. In contrast to previously classified ALMs, the sublattice currents break the time-reversal symmetry in nonmagnetic crystal structures and allow for such odd-parity spin splitting. A representative example is the Haldane-Hubbard model at half filling. Although the compensated collinear magnetic ground state was previously recognized as antiferromagnetism, we show that sublattice currents induce spin splitting in the bands and therefore turn it into an odd-parity ALM. Interestingly, its topological version serves as an example of ALM Chern insulator. We further generalize the Haldane-Hubbard model to common two- and three-dimensional bipartite lattices. With spin splitting from sublattice currents, the compensated collinear magnetic ground states at half filling are generally odd-parity ALM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractonic matter with dipole symmetry can be coupled to a two-index symmetric tensor gauge field. In this work, we show that this symmetric tensor field, along with other related generalized Maxwell theories, can be consistently coupled to curved backgrounds in a covariant and gauge-invariant way by reformulating dipole symmetry using conventional vector gauge fields. We identify a family of curved geometries where global dipole symmetry is preserved and derive energy-momentum conservation laws as Ward identities associated with background diffeomorphisms. Our results pave the way for future extensions, including generalizations to higher-order multipole theories.</description>

      <title>Robust Simulations of Many-Body Symmetry-Protected Topological Phase Transitions on a Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology and symmetry play critical roles in characterizing quantum phases of matter. Recent advancements have unveiled symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in many-body systems as a unique class of short-range entangled states, notable for their nontrivial edge modes and characteristic ground-state entanglement gap. In this study, we demonstrate the robust simulation of many-body ground states of an Ising-cluster model on a quantum computer. By employing the method of quantum imaginary-time evolution (QITE) combined with enhanced zero-noise extrapolation techniques, we achieve accurate measurements of the transition between trivial and cluster SPT phases. Furthermore, we measured the characteristic edge modes and their associated topological entanglement properties, such as the second R\'enyi entropy, reduced density matrix, and entanglement spectral gap. Our work demonstrates the potential of using QITE in investigating sophisticated quantum phase transitions and critical phenomena on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Mixed Anomalies of Magnetic Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resolve the existence of mixed 't Hooft anomalies between the electric and magnetic (solitonic) symmetries in $\sigma$-models and gauge theories. We identify the anomaly as naturally originating from a higher group in the Whitehead tower of the target space. In particular, the magnetic charges (topological solitons) can be interpreted as higher connections on the stages of the Whitehead tower, when pulled back to spacetime. This allows us to derive the form of the $(d+1)$-dim topological theory which classifies the anomaly by inflow. We also find novel features of these anomalies resulting from the mapping class group of the target space. We give many explicit examples, including a discussion of the cases where the higher magnetic symmetries become non-invertible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to compute the symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy of spherical regions in higher-dimensional conformal field theories. By employing Casini-Huerta-Myers mapping, we transform the entanglement problem into thermodynamic calculations in hyperbolic space. This method is demonstrated through computations in both free field theories and holographic field theories. For large hyperbolic space volume, our results reveal a universal expansion structure of symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy, with the equipartition property holding up to the constant order. Using asymptotic analysis techniques, we prove this expansion structure and the equipartition property in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic low-temperature magnetic properties on the ultra-clean UTe$_2$ with $T_{\rm c}$ = 2.1 K revealed by $^{125}$Te NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09109v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To investigate the intrinsic magnetic properties of UTe$_2$, we performed $^{125}$Te-NMR measurements on the ultra-clean single-crystalline UTe$_2$ with superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ = 2.1~K and compared the results with those of the $T_{\rm c}$ = 1.6~K sample. The broadening of the linewidth of the NMR spectrum in the $a$-axis magnetic field and the low-temperature magnetic fluctuations observed in the 1.6~K sample are suppressed in the ultra-clean sample, indicating that such magnetic properties originate from a tiny amount of U deficiency. The present results suggest that the magnetic properties in UTe$_2$ are sensitive to the U deficiency. We also observed a peculiar angular dependence of the NMR quantities due to large magnetic anisotropy with the $a$-axis as the magnetic easy axis.</description>

Abstract: The cuprate superconductor La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$ (LBCO) near $x=0.125$ is a striking example of intertwined electronic orders, where 3D superconductivity is anomalously suppressed, allowing spin and charge stripe order to develop, in a manner consistent with the emergence of a pair-density-wave (PDW) state. Understanding this interplay remains a key challenge in cuprates, highlighting the necessity of external tuning for deeper insight. While in-plane (within the CuO plane) uniaxial stress enhances superconductivity and suppresses stripe order, the effects of $c$-axis compression (perpendicular to the CuO plane) remains largely unexplored. Here, we use muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR) and AC susceptibility with an in situ piezoelectric stress device to investigate the spin-stripe order and superconductivity in LBCO-0.115 under $c$-axis compression. The measurements reveal a gradual suppression of the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) with increasing $c$-axis stress, in stark contrast to the strong enhancement observed under in-plane stress. We further show that while in-plane stress rapidly reduces both the magnetic volume fraction ($V_{\rm m}$) and the spin-stripe ordering temperature ($T_{\rm so}$), $c$-axis compression has no effect, with $V_{\rm m}$ and $T_{\rm so}$ exhibiting an almost unchanged behavior up to the highest applied stress of 0.21 GPa. These findings demonstrate a strong anisotropy in stress response, underscoring the critical role of crystallographic anisotropy in governing competing electronic phases in LBCO.</description>

      <title>Comparing quantum complexity and quantum fidelity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum complexity measures the difficulty of obtaining a given state starting from a typically unentangled state. In this work, we show that complexity, when defined through the minimization of a Riemannian cost functional over the manifold of Gaussian states, provides the same information as quantum fidelity and is therefore capable of detecting quantum phase transitions. However, it does not offer a more refined analysis than entanglement entropy for a given state. We conclude that incorporating a notion of spatial locality into the computation of complexity is essential to uncover new physics beyond what is accessible through entanglement entropy and fidelity.</description>

      <title>Diagnostics of Hilbert space fragmentation, freezing transition and its effects in the family of quantum East models involving varying ranges of facilitated hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the effect of strong-to-weak fragmentation transition, namely freezing transition, and its rich characteristics in a family of one-dimensional spinless fermionic models involving short-to-long-range facilitated hoppings with an East constraint. Focusing on this family of models with range-$q$ terms, our investigation furnishes an exhaustive understanding of the fractured Hilbert space utilizing the enumerative combinatorics and transfer matrix methods. This further allows us to get insight into the freezing transition in this family of models with the help of the generalization of Catalan numbers introduced by Frey and Sellers for $q&gt;1$, further revealing that increasing the range of constraints drives the transition to transpire at lower filling fractions as $n_c = 1/(q+1)$. This distinct fragmentation structure also yields the emergence of ground states at multiple fillings; further, the ground state exhibits signatures of criticality with logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy. Thereafter, our investigation exemplifies that the above transition has a profound impact on the thermalization of bulk and boundary autocorrelators at long times, which includes an intricate filling-dependent inhomogeneous long-time autocorrelation profiles across the chain in OBCs. Finally, we probe the effect of the same on the transport at intermediate times in PBCs, restricting ourselves to models up to range-3 constraints. This investigation discloses a vast range of anomalous transport possibilities, ranging from size-stretched exponential relaxation through superdiffusive to subdiffusive behaviors akin to the fragmentation structure supported by the filling fraction and range of constraints. In brevity, our paper reveals intriguing possibilities conspired by an intriguing interplay between constraints with varying ranges, fragmentation structure, and freezing transition.</description>

Abstract: Strange metals develop near quantum critical points in a variety of strongly correlated systems. Some of the issues that are central to the field include how the quantum-critical state loses quasiparticles, how it drives superconductivity, and to what extent the strange-metal physics in different classes of correlated systems are interconnected. In this Review, we survey some of these issues from the vantage point of heavy fermion metals. We will describe the notion of Kondo destruction and how it leads to several crucial effects. These include a transformation of the Fermi surface from large to small when the system is tuned across the quantum-critical point, a loss of quasiparticles everywhere on the Fermi surface when it is perched at the quantum-critical point, and a dynamical Planckian scaling in various physical properties including charge responses. We close with a discussion about the connections between the strange-metal physics in heavy fermion metals and its counterparts in the cuprates and other correlated materials.</description>

Abstract: We prove a general approximate quantization rule $ \int_{L_{E}}^{R_{E}}k_0(x)$ $dx=(N+\frac{1}{2})\pi $ or $ \oint k_0(x)$ $dx=(2N+1)\pi $ (including both forward and backward processes) for the bound states in the potential well of the $n$th-order Schr\"{o}dinger equations $ e^{-i\pi n/2}{{}\frac{d^n\Psi(x)}{d x^n} } =[E-{} V(x)]\Psi(x) ,$ where ${} k_0(x)=(E-V(x) )^{1/n}$ with $N\in\mathbb{N}_{0} $, $n$ is an even natural number, and $L_{E}$ and $R_{E}$ the boundary points between the classically forbidden regions and the allowed region. The only hypothesis is that all exponentially growing components are negligible, which is appropriate for not narrow wells. Applications including the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation will be discussed.</description>

Abstract: Coupled-cluster and Green's function theories are highly successful in treating many-body electron correlation and there has been significant interest in identifying and leveraging connections between them. Here we present a diagrammatic definition of the irreducible coupled-cluster self-energy that directly embeds coupled-cluster theory within the framework of many-body field theory. The EOM-CC treatment emerges naturally from our definition via the Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations, providing a unified description of RPA, $GW$-BSE and CC theory for ground state and excitation energies. This clarifies the origin of previously established connections between RPA, $GW$-BSE and coupled-cluster theory, and exposes the relationship between vertex corrections and the coupled-cluster amplitude equations.</description>

      <title>Fractionalization Signatures in the Dynamics of Quantum Spin Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the signatures of fractionalization in quantum spin liquids by studying different phases of the Kitaev honeycomb model in the presence of an out-of-plane magnetic field through which the model becomes non-integrable. Using the infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) ansatz, along with analytical calculations and exact diagonalization, we calculate dynamical signatures of fractionalized particles through spin-spin and dimer-dimer correlations. Our analysis demonstrates the ability of these correlations to discern distinct fractionalized quantum sectors, namely Majorana fermions and the emergent $Z_2$ fluxes, in both the chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase under weak field and the emergent intermediate gapless phase (IGP) under moderate field. Importantly, our calculation reveals the nature of IGP observed at moderate fields, a region of ongoing debate, indicating that this phase is a Majorana metal induced by strong flux fluctuations.</description>

      <title>DFT+DMFT study of correlated electronic structure in the monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By preforming DFT+DMFT calculations, we systematically investigate the correlated electronic structure in the newly discovered monolayer-trilayer (ML-TL) phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La327). Our calculated Fermi surfaces are in good agreement with the result of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We find that 1313-La327 is a multiorbital correlated metal. An orbital-selective Mott behavior is found in ML in our zero- and finite-temperature calculations. The ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits a Mott behavior, while the ML Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is metallic due to self-doping. We also find a large static local spin susceptibility of ML Ni, suggesting that there is large spin fluctuation in 1313-La327. The TL Ni-$e_g$ orbitals possess similar electronic correlation to those in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The $e_g$ orbitals of the outer-layer Ni in TL show non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Besides, large weight of high-spin states are found in TL-outer Ni and ML Ni, implying Hundness. Under 16 GPa, a Lifshitz transition is revealed by our calculations and a La-related band crosses the Fermi level. Our work provides a theoretical reference for studying other potential mixed-stacked nickelate superconductors.</description>

Abstract: We study phases and transitions of a triangular Hubbard model subject to commensurate magnetic field, called the Hofstadter-Hubbard model. At filling one fermion per site, for the number of fermion flavors 2 &lt;= N &lt;= 4, we identify three distinct phases and calculate critical interaction strength from self-consistent mean-field approximation. Integer quantum Hall, chiral spin liquid, and valence bond solid (or stripe) states could be realized upon varying the Hubbard interaction U. We study the critical transport behavior using quantum Boltzmann equations for general N for the putative continuous transition from quantum Hall states to chiral spin liquid. The critical behavior serves as strong signatures of the critical theory and consequently of the existence of chiral spin liquid as the proximate phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid approach combining Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) method with projected entangled pair state (PEPS) ansatz. This hybrid method regards PEPS as a trial state and a guiding wave function in GFMC. By leveraging PEPS's proficiency in capturing quantum state entanglement and GFMC's efficient parallel architecture, the hybrid method is well-suited for the accurate and efficient treatment of frustrated quantum spin systems. As a benchmark, we applied this approach to study the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions (PBC). Compared with other numerical methods, our approach integrating PEPS and GFMC shows competitive accuracy in the performance of ground-state energy. This paper provides systematic and comprehensive discussion of the approach of our previous work.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that macroscopically-normalizable zero-energy wavefunctions of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in a two-dimensional inhomogeneous magnetic field are spin-polarized and exactly calculable with degeneracy equaling the number of flux quanta linking the whole system. Extending this argument to massless Dirac fermions subjected to magnetic fields that have \textit{zero} net flux but are doubly periodic in real space, we show that there exist \textit{only two} Bloch-normalizable zero-energy eigenstates, one for each spin flavor. This result is immediately relevant to graphene multilayer systems subjected to doubly-periodic strain fields, which at low energies, enter the Hamiltonian as periodic pseudo-gauge vector potentials. Furthermore, we explore various related settings including nonlinearly-dispersing band structure models and systems with singly-periodic magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Mirror Chern Bands and Weyl Nodal Loops in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electronic spectra of altermagnets are a fertile ground for nontrivial topology due to the unique interplay between time-reversal and crystalline symmetries. This is reflected in the unconventional Zeeman splitting between bands of opposite spins, which emerges in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and displays nodes along high-symmetry directions. Here, we argue that even for a small SOC, the direction of the magnetic moments in the altermagnetic state has a profound impact on the electronic spectrum, enabling novel topological phenomena to appear. By investigating microscopic models for two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) altermagnets, motivated in part by rutile materials, we demonstrate the emergence of hitherto unexplored Dirac crossings between bands of the same spin but opposite sublattices. The direction of the moments determines the fate of these crossings when the SOC is turned on. We focus on the case of out-of-plane moments, which forbid an anomalous Hall effect and thus ensure that no weak magnetization is triggered in the altermagnetic state. In the 2D model, the SOC gaps out the Dirac crossings, resulting in mirror Chern bands that enable the Quantum Spin Hall Effect and undergo a topological transition to trivial bands upon increasing the magnitude of the magnetic moment. On the other hand, in the 3D model the crossings persist even in the presence of SOC, forming Weyl nodal loops protected by mirror symmetry. Finally, we discuss possible ways to control these effects in altermagnetic material candidates.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and universality in stationary state of long-range Kitaev model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the signature of quantum criticality in the long-time stationary state of the long-range Kitaev chain by performing various quench protocols. In this model, the pairing interaction decays with distance according to a power law with exponent $\alpha$. Using quantum information-theoretic measures, such as mutual information and logarithmic negativity, we show that, irrespective of the values of $\alpha$, critical-to-critical quench displays quantum criticality even in the stationary state. Remarkably, in the presence of long-range pairing interactions, where fermionic correlators decay algebraically even at non-critical points, signature of quantum criticality persists in the stationary state. Furthermore, the effective central charge, calculated from both mutual information and logarithmic negativity of stationary state following a critical-to-critical quench, agrees with the central charge of the corresponding ground states for both $\alpha = 0$ and $\alpha = 2$. Therefore, information of the universality class can be inferred from the stationary state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of \emph{interlayer} interaction terms in the competition between different superconducting gap symmetries in the bilayer nickelate $\text{La}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ under high pressure. We study a two-layer, two-orbital electron model that encompasses both intra- and interlayer Coulomb interaction terms within the matrix random-phase approximation. We find that interlayer interactions favor a $d_{xy}$-wave superconducting pairing symmetry over the $s^{\pm}$-wave symmetry, which has been found to prevail when interlayer interactions are disregarded. Moreover, our findings indicate that interlayer interactions enhance the interorbital pairing, incorporating contributions from all three electron pockets, arising from both $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital character, resulting in nodes within the gap function (not present in the $s^{\pm}$-wave state) and consequently favoring the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing.</description>

      <title>Local ergotropy dynamically witnesses many-body localized phases</title>

Abstract: Many-body localization is a dynamical phenomenon characteristic of strongly interacting and disordered many-body quantum systems which fail to achieve thermal equilibrium. From a quantum information perspective, the fingerprint of this phenomenon is the logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy over time. We perform intensive numerical simulations, applied to a paradigmatic model system, showing that the local ergotropy, the maximum extractable work via local unitary operations on a small subsystem in the presence of Hamiltonian coupling, dynamically witnesses the change from ergodic to localized phases. Within the many-body localized phase, both the local ergotropy and its quantum fluctuations slowly vary over time with a characteristic logarithmic law analogous to the behaviour of entanglement entropy. This showcases how directly leveraging local control, instead of local observables or entropies analyzed in previous works, provides a thermodynamic marker of localization phenomena based on the locally extractable work.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Partial Transpose in the Overlap Matrix Framework for Entanglement Negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, the overlap matrix approach has been developed to compute quantum entanglement in free-fermion systems, particularly to calculate entanglement entropy and entanglement negativity. This method involves the use of partial trace and partial transpose operations within the overlap matrix framework. However, previous studies have only considered the conventional partial transpose in fermionic systems, which does not account for fermionic anticommutation relations. Although the concept of a fermionic partial transpose was introduced in \cite{Shapourian2017prb}, it has not yet been systematically incorporated into the overlap matrix framework. In this paper, we introduce the fermionic partial transpose into the overlap matrix approach, provide a systematic analysis of the validity of partial trace and partial transpose operations, and derive an explicit formula for calculating entanglement negativity in bipartite systems. Additionally, we numerically compute the logarithmic negativity of two lattice models to verify the Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law. For tripartite geometries, we uncover limitations of the overlap matrix method and demonstrate that the previously reported logarithmic negativity result for a homogeneous one-dimensional chain in a disjoint interval geometry exceeds its theoretical upper bound. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of partial trace and partial transpose operations in different representations.</description>
