      <title>Cryptanalysis of a multivariate CCZ scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the multivariate scheme Pesto, which was introduced by Calderini, Caminata, and Villa. In this scheme, the public polynomials are obtained by applying a CCZ transformation to a set of quadratic secret polynomials. As a consequence, the public key consists of polynomials of degree 4. In this work, we show that the public degree 4 polynomial system can be efficiently reduced to a system of quadratic polynomials. This seems to suggest that the CCZ transformation may not offer a significant increase in security, contrary to what was initially believed.</description>

      <title>Domino tilings, nonintersecting lattice paths and subclasses of Koutschan-Krattenthaler-Schlosser determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Koutschan, Krattenthaler and Schlosser recently considered a family of binomial determinants. In this work, we give combinatorial interpretations of two subclasses of these determinants in terms of domino tilings and nonintersecting lattice paths, thereby partially answering a question of theirs. Furthermore, the determinant evaluations established by Koutschan, Krattenthaler and Schlosser produce many product formulas for our weighted enumerations of domino tilings and nonintersecting lattice paths. However, there are still two enumerations left corresponding to conjectural formulas made by the three. We hereby prove the two conjectures using the principle of holonomic Ansatz plus the approach of modular reduction for creative telescoping, and hence fill the gap.</description>

      <title>A non-commutative algorithm for multiplying 4x4 matrices using 48 non-complex multiplications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13242v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quest for non-commutative matrix multiplication algorithms in small dimensions has seen a lot of recent improvements recently. In particular, the number of scalar multiplications required to multiply two $4\times4$ matrices was first reduced in \cite{Fawzi:2022aa} from 49 (two recursion levels of Strassen's algorithm) to 47 but only in characteristic 2 or more recently to 48 in \cite{alphaevolve} but over complex numbers. We propose an algorithm in 48 multiplications with only rational coefficients, hence removing the complex number requirement. It was derived from the latter one, under the action of an isotropy which happen to project the algorithm on the field of rational numbers. We also produce a straight line program of this algorithm, reducing the leading constant in the complexity, as well as an alternative basis variant of it, leading to an algorithm running in $\frac{19}{16} n^{2+\frac{\log_2 3}{2}} +o\left(n^{2+\frac{log_2 3}{2}}\right)$ operations over any ring containing an inverse of 2.</description>

      <title>Computation of the Hilbert Series for the Support-Minors Modeling of the MinRank Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The MinRank problem is a simple linear algebra problem: given matrices with coefficients in a field, find a non trivial linear combination of the matrices that has a small rank.  There are several algebraic modeling of the problem. The main ones are: the Kipnis-Shamir modeling, the Minors modeling and the Support-Minors modeling. The Minors modeling has been studied by Faug{\`e}re et al. in 2010, where the authors provide an analysis of the complexity of computing a Gr{\"o}bner basis of the modeling, through the computation of the exact Hilbert Series for a generic instance. For the Support-Minors modeling, the first terms of the Hilbert Series are given by Bardet et al. in 2020 based on an heuristic and experimental work.  In this work, we provide a formula and a proof for the complete Hilbert Series of the Support Minors modeling for generic instances. This is done by adapting well known results on determinantal ideals to an ideal generated by a particular subset of the set of all minors of a matrix of variables. We then show that this ideal is generated by</description>
