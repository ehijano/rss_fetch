      <title>Modelling brain connectomes networks: Solv is a worthy competitor to hyperbolic geometry!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding suitable embeddings for connectomes (spatially embedded complex networks that map neural connections in the brain) is crucial for analyzing and understanding cognitive processes. Recent studies have found two-dimensional hyperbolic embeddings superior to Euclidean embeddings in modeling connectomes across species, especially human connectomes. However, those studies had limitations: geometries other than Euclidean, hyperbolic, or spherical were not considered. Following William Thurston's suggestion that the networks of neurons in the brain could be successfully represented in Solv geometry, we study the goodness-of-fit of the embeddings for 21 connectome networks (8 species). To this end, we suggest an embedding algorithm based on Simulating Annealing that allows us to embed connectomes to Euclidean, Spherical, Hyperbolic, Solv, Nil, and product geometries. Our algorithm tends to find better embeddings than the state-of-the-art, even in the hyperbolic case. Our findings suggest that while three-dimensional hyperbolic embeddings yield the best results in many cases, Solv embeddings perform reasonably well.</description>

      <title>Steiner symmetrization on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to introduce a generalization of Steiner symmetrization in Euclidean space for spherical space, which is the dual of the Steiner symmetrization in hyperbolic space introduced by Peyerimhoff (J. London Math. Soc. (2) 66: 753-768, 2002). We show that this symmetrization preserves volume in every dimension, and convexity in the spherical plane, but not in dimensions $n &gt; 2$. In addition, we investigate the monotonicity properties of the perimeter and diameter of a set under this process, and find conditions under which the image of a spherically convex disk under a suitable sequence of Steiner symmetrizations converges to a spherical cap. We apply our results to prove a spherical analogue of a theorem of Sas, and to confirm a conjecture of Besau and Werner (Adv. Math. 301: 867-901, 2016) for centrally symmetric spherically convex disks. We also prove a spherical variant of a theorem of Winternitz.</description>

      <title>A Mattila-Sj\"olin theorem for simplices in low dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07198v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that if a compact set $E \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $d \geq 3$, has Hausdorff dimension greater than $\frac{(4k-1)}{4k}d+\frac{1}{4}$ when $3 \leq d&lt;\frac{k(k+3)}{(k-1)}$ or $d- \frac{1}{k-1}$ when $\frac{k(k+3)}{(k-1)} \leq d$, then the set of congruence class of simplices with vertices in $E$ has nonempty interior. By set of congruence class of simplices with vertices in $E$ we mean $$\Delta_{k}(E) = \left \{ \vec{t} = (t_{ij}) : |x_i-x_j|=t_{ij} ; \ x_i,x_j \in E ; \ 0\leq i &lt; j \leq k \right \} \subset \mathbb{R}^{\frac{k(k+1)}{2}}$$ where $2 \leq k &lt;d$. This result improves our previous work in the sense that we now can obtain a Hausdorff dimension threshold which allow us to guarantee that the set of congruence class of triangles formed by triples of points of $E$ has nonempty interior when $d=3$ as well as extending to all simplices. The present work can be thought of as an extension of the Mattila-Sj\"olin theorem which establishes a non-empty interior for the distance set instead of the set of congruence classes of simplices.</description>

      <title>Box dimension of generalized affine fractal interpolation functions (II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a generalized affine fractal interpolation function with vertical scaling functions. In this paper, we prove the monotonicity of spectral radii of vertical scaling matrices without additional assumptions. We also obtain the irreducibility of these matrices under certain conditions. By these results, we estimate $\mathrm{dim}_B \Gamma f$, the box dimension of the graph of $f$, by the limits of spectral radii of vertical scaling matrices. We also estimate $\mathrm{dim}_B \Gamma f$ directly by the sum function of vertical scaling functions. As an application, we study the box dimension of the graph of a generalized Weierstrass-type function.</description>

      <title>Equality cases of the Alexandrov--Fenchel inequality are not in the polynomial hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05764v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Describing the equality conditions of the Alexandrov--Fenchel inequality has been a major open problem for decades. We prove that in the case of convex polytopes, this description is not in the polynomial hierarchy unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to a finite level. This is the first hardness result for the problem, and is a complexity counterpart of the recent result by Shenfeld and van Handel (arXiv:archive/201104059), which gave a geometric characterization of the equality conditions. The proof involves Stanley's order polytopes and employs poset theoretic technology.</description>
