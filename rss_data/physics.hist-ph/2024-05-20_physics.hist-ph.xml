      <title>Why the wavefunction already is an object on space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of quantum mechanics, the fact that the wavefunction is defined on the $3\mathbf{n}$-dimensional configuration space rather than on the $3$-dimensional space seemed uncanny to many, including Schr\"odinger, Lorentz, and Einstein. Even today, this continues to be seen as an important problem in the foundations of quantum mechanics.
  In this article it will be shown that the wavefunction already is a genuine object on space. While this may seem surprising, the wavefunction has no qualitatively new features that were not previously encountered in the objects known from Euclidean geometry and classical physics. This will be shown to be true also in Felix Klein's Erlangen Program. This fits naturally in the classification of quantum particles by the representations of the spacetime isometries realized by Wigner and Bargmann, adding another layer of confirmation. Once we realize that all quantum experiments take place in space, they can be interpreted naturally and consistently with the wavefunction being an object on space.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Physics at the South Pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geographic South Pole provides unique opportunities to study cosmic particles in the Southern Hemisphere. It represents an optimal location to deploy large-scale neutrino telescopes in the deep Antarctic ice, such as AMANDA or IceCube. In both cases, the presence of an array, constructed to observe extensive air showers, enables hybrid measurements of cosmic rays. While additional neutron monitors can provide information on solar cosmic rays, large detector arrays, like SPASE or IceTop, allow for precise measurements of cosmic rays with energies above several $100\,\rm{TeV}$. In coincidence with the signals recorded in the deep ice, which are mostly due to the high-energy muons produced in air showers, this hybrid detector setup provides important information about the nature of cosmic rays.
  In this review, we will discuss the historical motivation and developments towards measurements of cosmic rays at the geographic South Pole and highlight recent results reported by the IceCube Collaboration. We will emphasize the important contributions by Thomas K. Gaisser and his colleagues that ultimately led to the rich Antarctic research program which today provides crucial insights into cosmic-ray physics.</description>
