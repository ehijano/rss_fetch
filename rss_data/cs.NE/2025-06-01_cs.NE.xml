      <title>Proxy Target: Bridging the Gap Between Discrete Spiking Neural Networks and Continuous Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer low-latency and energy-efficient decision making through neuromorphic hardware, making them compelling for Reinforcement Learning (RL) in resource-constrained edge devices. Recent studies in this field directly replace Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by SNNs in existing RL frameworks, overlooking whether the RL algorithm is suitable for SNNs. However, most RL algorithms in continuous control are designed tailored to ANNs, including the target network soft updates mechanism, which conflict with the discrete, non-differentiable dynamics of SNN spikes. We identify that this mismatch destabilizes SNN training in continuous control tasks. To bridge this gap between discrete SNN and continuous control, we propose a novel proxy target framework. The continuous and differentiable dynamics of the proxy target enable smooth updates, bypassing the incompatibility of SNN spikes, stabilizing the RL algorithms. Since the proxy network operates only during training, the SNN retains its energy efficiency during deployment without inference overhead. Extensive experiments on continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that compared to vanilla SNNs, the proxy target framework enables SNNs to achieve up to 32% higher performance across different spiking neurons. Notably, we are the first to surpass ANN performance in continuous control with simple Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons. This work motivates a new class of SNN-friendly RL algorithms tailored to SNN's characteristics, paving the way for neuromorphic agents that combine high performance with low power consumption.</description>

Abstract: Deep Learning, driven by neural networks, has led to groundbreaking advancements in Artificial Intelligence by enabling systems to learn and adapt like the human brain. These models have achieved remarkable results, particularly in data-intensive domains, supported by massive computational infrastructure. However, deploying such systems in Aerospace, where real time data processing and ultra low latency are critical, remains a challenge due to infrastructure limitations. This paper proposes a novel concept: the Airborne Neural Network a distributed architecture where multiple airborne devices each host a subset of neural network neurons. These devices compute collaboratively, guided by an airborne network controller and layer specific controllers, enabling real-time learning and inference during flight. This approach has the potential to revolutionize Aerospace applications, including airborne air traffic control, real-time weather and geographical predictions, and dynamic geospatial data processing. By enabling large-scale neural network operations in airborne environments, this work lays the foundation for the next generation of AI powered Aerospace systems.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Representation Learning of Neuronal Dynamics and Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how neuronal networks reorganize in response to external stimuli and give rise to behavior is a central challenge in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, existing methods often fail to capture the evolving structure of neural connectivity in ways that capture its relationship to behavior, especially in dynamic, uncertain, or high-dimensional settings with sufficient resolution or interpretability. We introduce the Temporal Attention-enhanced Variational Graph Recurrent Neural Network (TAVRNN), a novel framework that models time-varying neuronal connectivity by integrating probabilistic graph learning with temporal attention mechanisms. TAVRNN learns latent dynamics at the single-unit level while maintaining interpretable population-level representations, to identify key connectivity patterns linked to behavior. TAVRNN generalizes across diverse neural systems and modalities, demonstrating state-of-the-art classification and clustering performance. We validate TAVRNN on three diverse datasets: (1) electrophysiological data from a freely behaving rat, (2) primate somatosensory cortex recordings during a reaching task, and (3) biological neurons in the DishBrain platform interacting with a virtual game environment. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic embedding techniques, revealing previously unreported relationships between adaptive behavior and the evolving topological organization of neural networks. These findings demonstrate that TAVRNN offers a powerful and generalizable approach for modeling neural dynamics across experimental and synthetic biological systems. Its architecture is modality-agnostic and scalable, making it applicable across a wide range of neural recording platforms and behavioral paradigms.</description>

      <title>Do Language Models Use Their Depth Efficiently?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern LLMs are increasingly deep, and depth correlates with performance, albeit with diminishing returns. However, do these models use their depth efficiently? Do they compose more features to create higher-order computations that are impossible in shallow models, or do they merely spread the same kinds of computation out over more layers? To address these questions, we analyze the residual stream of the Llama 3.1 and Qwen 3 family of models. We find: First, comparing the output of the sublayers to the residual stream reveals that layers in the second half contribute much less than those in the first half, with a clear phase transition between the two halves. Second, skipping layers in the second half has a much smaller effect on future computations and output predictions. Third, for multihop tasks, we are unable to find evidence that models are using increased depth to compose subresults in examples involving many hops. Fourth, we seek to directly address whether deeper models are using their additional layers to perform new kinds of computation. To do this, we train linear maps from the residual stream of a shallow model to a deeper one. We find that layers with the same relative depth map best to each other, suggesting that the larger model simply spreads the same computations out over its many layers. All this evidence suggests that deeper models are not using their depth to learn new kinds of computation, but only using the greater depth to perform more fine-grained adjustments to the residual. This may help explain why increasing scale leads to diminishing returns for stacked Transformer architectures.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Self-Attention Dynamics: An Energy-Agnostic Perspective from Jacobians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in energy-based formulations. Next, to investigate more general SA architectures capable of oscillatory dynamics without necessarily admitting an energy function, we analyze the Jacobian matrix of the state. We reveal that normalization layers effectively normalize the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues, forcing the dynamics close to a critical state. This significantly enhances inference performance. Furthermore, we utilize the Jacobian perspective to develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring inference dynamics.</description>
