      <title>Letokhov-Chebotayev intracavity trapping spectroscopy of H$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the early days of laser spectroscopy Letokhov and Chebotayev proposed a scheme for measuring narrow spectral lines where the resolution is not restricted to Doppler effects because the molecules are entrained in a standing-wave light field. Now, such one-dimensional trapping in the intensity maxima of an intracavity field, slightly detuned from resonance, is experimentally demonstrated in the measurement of the very weak S(0) (2-0) quadrupole overtone transition in H$_2$ at 1189 nm. The trapping manifests as an extremely narrow absorption feature at the predicted zero-recoil position, a 70 kHz shift from the blue-recoil component observed in Lamb-dip spectroscopy. A quantitative analysis of the saturation and trapping conditions supports the findings.</description>

      <title>Electronic phase-locking for three-color, two-pathway coherent control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a new method of two-pathway coherent control using three narrow-band cw laser sources, phase locked in an optical phase-lock loop, to maintain the high degree of optical coherence required for the coherent control process. In addition, we derive expressions for two-photon transition amplitudes and demonstrate their dependence on the polarization of the field components. This phase-locking technique expands the set of interactions to which coherent control techniques may be applied. It also allows for a constant low-frequency offset between the optical interactions, producing a continuous and constant phase ramp between the interactions, facilitating phase-sensitive detection of the modulating atomic signal. We illustrate this technique with two-photon vs.~one-photon excitation of a $\Delta F = 1$ component, and alternatively a $\Delta F = 0$ component, of the $6s \: ^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow 7s \: ^2S_{1/2}$ transition of atomic cesium.</description>

      <title>Angular Geometry of Atomic Multipole Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple way to calculate Rabi frequencies is outlined for interactions of atomic or nuclear multipole moments with laser fields that focuses on their relative geometry. The resulting expression takes the form of a dot product between the laser polarization and a vector spherical harmonic, thereby naturally connecting to the multipole's far-field spontaneous-emission pattern and providing a way to visualize the interaction. Since the vector spherical harmonics are not yet a standard tool in quantum science, their relevant properties are reviewed. This approach is illustrated in the calculation of a variety of beam effects, yielding both perturbative corrections and some nontrivial cases with non-vanishing coupling.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable dissipative entanglement between many spin ensembles: from robust quantum sensing to many-body state engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An attractive approach for stabilizing entangled many-body spin states is to employ engineered dissipation. Most existing proposals either target relatively simple collective spin states, or require numerous independent and complex dissipative processes. Here, we show a surprisingly versatile scheme for many-body reservoir engineering that relies solely on fully collective single-excitation decay, augmented with local Hamiltonian terms. Crucially, all these ingredients are readily available in cavity QED setups. Our method is based on splitting the spin system into groups of sub-ensembles, and provides an easily tunable setup for stabilizing a broad family of pure, highly entangled states with closed-form analytic descriptions. Our results have immediate application to multi-ensemble quantum metrology, enabling Heisenberg-limited sensing of field gradients and curvatures. Notably, the generated states have robustness against common-mode phase noise, and only require simple Ramsey-style measurements. The same setup also allows the stabilization of entangled states in a 1D chain of spin ensembles with symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, and have a direct connection to the outputs of sequential unitary circuits. In particular, we present an efficient method for engineering the celebrated spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state.</description>

      <title>A three-dimensional acousto-optic deflector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) are widely used across physics, microscopy, neuroscience, and laser engineering, providing fast, precise, and non-mechanical control of light. While conventional AODs naturally support multiplexing in one and two dimensions, no analogous device has existed for three-dimensional control, leaving a critical gap in rapid focus tuning and 3D beam shaping. Here we demonstrate a three-dimensional AOD system capable of multiplexed axial and lateral beam control with high speed and large dynamic range. We achieve this by combining a double-pass AOD with a diffraction grating in the Littrow configuration to realize a compact frequency-tunable lens with multiplexing capability. Our device enables axial scanning over more than twenty Rayleigh ranges with switching rates up to 100 kHz, while simultaneous multi-tone driving produces arbitrary multi-focal beam profiles. By integrating the axial module with lateral deflection, we generate reconfigurable 3D optical patterns. This approach establishes a broadly applicable platform for multiplexed 3D beam control, with potential applications from high-resolution microscopy and laser processing to scalable neutral-atom quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Atomic Observables Induced by Cosmic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of cosmic fields made from yet unknown light bosons is predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model. They are especially of interest as possible constituents of dark matter. To detect such light and weakly interacting fields, atomic precision measurements offer one of the most sensitive platforms. In this work, we derive which atomic observables are sensitive to what kind of cosmic field couplings. For this we consider fields that couple either through scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial vector, or tensor couplings. We derive the corresponding non relativistic atomic potentials. Based on their symmetry properties, these can induce direct energy shifts or induce atomic electric dipole, magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole as well as nuclear Schiff and anapole moments.</description>

      <title>Selective high-order topological states and tunable chiral emission in atomic metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic metasurfaces (AMs) provide a powerful nanophotonic platform for integrating topological effects into quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we investigate the quantum optical and topological properties of a two-dimensional Kagome AM, going beyond the tight-binding approximation and incorporating all-to-all interactions. We reveal selective higher-order topological states with a unique dynamical ``chasing" behavior, protected by a generalized chiral symmetry and enabling efficient topological directional transfer. By introducing an impurity atom -- a giant atom -- coupled to all array atoms, we observe chiral emission patterns strongly dependent on the atomic polarization. This nonlocal coupling structure allows exploration of self-interference effects at subwavelength scales. Our findings establish AMs as a versatile platform for engineering tunable topological states and chiral quantum optical phenomena, with potential applications in customized light sources and photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of mechanical oscillators mediated by a Rydberg tweezer chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical systems provide a unique test bed for studying quantum phenomena at macroscopic length scales. However, realizing quantum states that feature quantum correlations among macroscopic mechanical objects remains an experimental challenge. Here, we propose a quantum system in which two micro-electromechanical oscillators interact through a chain of Rydberg atoms confined in optical tweezers. We demonstrate that the coherent dynamics of the system generate entanglement between the oscillators. Furthermore, we utilize the tunability of the radiative decay of the Rydberg atoms for dissipative entanglement generation. Our results highlight the potential to exploit the flexibility and tunability of Rydberg atom chains to generate nonclassical correlations between distant mechanical oscillators.</description>

      <title>Spectrometry of Captured Highly Charged Ions Produced Following Antiproton Annihilations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first capture and time-of-flight spectrometry of highly charged ions produced following antiproton annihilations in a Penning-Malmberg trap. At the AEgIS experiment, we employed a multi-step nested-trap technique to isolate ions from antiproton annihilations with ultra-low-density helium and argon gas. The capture and identification of highly-charged argon ions in charge-states up to $Ar^{5+}$ demonstrates a new method for in-trap synthesis. This work establishes a clear path towards the direct capture and mass spectrometry of cold nuclear annihilation fragments, which will enable a complementary tool for exploring the neutron to proton density ratio at the extreme nuclear periphery.</description>

      <title>Optimal Distillation of Qubit Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study coherence distillation under time-translation-invariant operations: given many copies of a quantum state containing coherence in the energy eigenbasis, the aim is to produce a purer coherent state while respecting the time-translation symmetry. This symmetry ensures that the output remains synchronized with the input and that the process can be realized by energy-conserving unitaries coupling the system to a reservoir initially in an energy eigenstate, thereby modeling thermal operations supplemented by a work reservoir or battery. For qubit systems, we determine the optimal asymptotic fidelity and show that it is governed by the purity of coherence, a measure of asymmetry derived from the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) Fisher information. In particular, we find that the lowest achievable infidelity (one minus fidelity) scales as $1/N$ times the reciprocal of the purity of coherence of each input qubit, where $N$ is the number of copies, giving this quantity a clear operational meaning. We additionally study many other interesting aspects of the coherence distillation problem for qubits, including computing higher-order corrections to the lowest achievable infidelity up to $O(1/N^3)$, and expressing the optimal channel as a boundary value problem that can be solved numerically.</description>

      <title>Neutrino force at all length scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model predicts a long-range force mediated by a pair of neutrinos, known as ``the neutrino force". It scales as $G_F^2/r^5$, where $G_F$ is the Fermi constant. However, as $r \lesssim \sqrt{G_F}$, the four-Fermi theory breaks down and the neutrino force no longer has the $1/r^5$ scaling. For the first time, we derive a complete expression for the neutrino force that is valid at all distances. For $r \gg \sqrt{G_F}$, the result reduces to the known $G_F^2/r^5$; for $r \ll \sqrt{G_F}$, it scales as $1/r$. We explore the implications of this result for atomic parity violation (APV) experiments. A key feature of the neutrino force is that it is a long-range effect compared to the atomic length scale. Thus, in general, it cannot be simply treated as a correction to the tree-level $Z$-exchange diagram without considering the atomic wavefunctions. We calculate the effects in muonium and positronium, finding that the neutrino force contributes about 4\% and 16\%, respectively, compared to the leading $ Z$ exchange. This indicates a significant impact on APV, with important implications for detecting the neutrino force and measuring the weak mixing angle in APV experiments.</description>

      <title>Multicomponent one-dimensional quantum droplets across the mean-field stability regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08392v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) energy correction at the edge of the mean-field stability regime is known to give rise to beyond mean-field structures in a wide variety of systems. In this work, we analytically derive the LHY energy for two-, three- and four-component one-dimensional bosonic short-range interacting mixtures across the mean-field stability regime. For varying intercomponent attraction in the two-component setting, quantitative deviations from the original LHY treatment emerge being imprinted in the droplet saturation density and width. On the other hand, for repulsive interactions an unseen early onset of phase-separation occurs for both homonuclear and heteronuclear mixtures. Closed LHY expressions for the fully-symmetric three- and four-component mixtures, as well as for mixtures comprised of two identical components coupled to a third independent component are provided and found to host a plethora of mixed droplet states. Our results are expected to inspire future investigations in multicomponent systems for unveiling exotic self-bound states of matter and unravel their nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</description>
