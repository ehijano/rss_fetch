      <title>Crescendo Beyond the Horizon: More Gravitational Waves from Domain Walls Bounded by Inflated Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) signals offer a unique window into the dynamics of the early universe. GWs may be generated by the topological defects produced in the early universe, which contain information on the symmetry of UV physics. We consider the case in which a two-step phase transition produces a network of domain walls bounded by cosmic strings. Specifically, we focus on the case in which there is a hierarchy in the symmetry-breaking scales, and a period of inflation pushes the cosmic string generated in the first phase transition outside the horizon before the second phase transition. We show that the GW signal from the evolution and collapse of this string-wall network has a unique spectrum, and the resulting signal strength can be sizeable. In particular, depending on the model parameters, the resulting signal can show up in a broad range of frequencies and can be discovered by a multitude of future probes, including the pulsar timing arrays and space- and ground-based GW observatories. As an example that naturally gives rise to this scenario, we present a model with the first phase transition followed by a brief period of thermal inflation driven by the field responsible for the second stage of symmetry breaking. The model can be embedded into a supersymmetric setup, which provides a natural realization of this scenario. In this case, the successful detection of the peak of the GW spectrum probes the soft supersymmetry breaking scale and the wall tension.</description>

      <title>On the sensitivity of nuclear clocks to new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent demonstration of laser excitation of the $\approx 8$ eV isomeric state of thorium-229 is a significant step towards a nuclear clock. The low excitation energy likely results from a cancellation between the contributions of the electromagnetic and strong forces. Physics beyond the Standard Model could disrupt this cancellation, highlighting nuclear clocks' sensitivity to new physics. Accurate predictions of the different contributions to nuclear transition energies, and therefore of the quantitative sensitivity of a nuclear clock, are challenging. We improve upon previous sensitivity estimates and assess a ''nightmare scenario'', where all binding energy differences are small and the new physics sensitivity is poor. A classical geometric model of thorium-229 suggests that fine-tuning is needed for such a scenario. We also propose a $d$-wave halo model, inspired by effective field theory. We show that it reproduces observations and suggests the ''nightmare scenario'' is unlikely. We find that the nuclear clock's sensitivity to variations in the effective fine structure constant is enhanced by a factor of order $10^4$. We finally propose auxiliary nuclear measurements to reduce uncertainties and further test the validity of the halo model.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis and first-order QCD transition with gravitational waves from a large lepton asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large primordial lepton asymmetry can lead to successful baryogenesis by preventing the restoration of electroweak symmetry at high temperatures, thereby suppressing the sphaleron rate. This asymmetry can also lead to a first-order cosmic QCD transition, accompanied by detectable gravitational wave (GW) signals. By employing next-to-leading order dimensional reduction we determine that the necessary lepton asymmetry is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than previously estimated. Incorporating an updated QCD equation of state that harmonizes lattice and functional QCD outcomes, we pinpoint the range of lepton flavor asymmetries capable of inducing a first-order cosmic QCD transition. To maintain consistency with observational constraints from the Cosmic Microwave Background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, achieving the correct baryon asymmetry requires entropy dilution by approximately a factor of ten. However, the first-order QCD transition itself can occur independently of entropy dilution. We propose that the sphaleron freeze-in mechanism can be investigated through forthcoming GW experiments such as $\mu$Ares.</description>

      <title>A QCD R-Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: R-parity can be extended to a continuous global U(1)${}_R$ symmetry. We investigate whether an anomalous U(1)${}_R$ can be identified as the PQ symmetry suitable for solving the strong CP problem within supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model. In this case, U(1)${}_R$ is broken at some intermediate scale and the QCD axion is the R-axion. Moreover, the R-symmetry can be naturally gauged via the Green-Schwartz mechanism within completions to supergravity, thus evading the axion quality problem. Obstacles to realizing this scenario are highlighted and phenomenologically viable approaches are identified.</description>

      <title>Incoherent diffractive production of jets in electron DIS off nuclei at high energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study incoherent diffractive production of two and three jets in electron-nucleus deep inelastic scattering (DIS) at small $x_{\scriptscriptstyle \rm Bj}$ using the color dipole picture and the effective theory of the Color Glass Condensate (CGC). We consider color fluctuations in the CGC weight-function as the source of the nuclear break-up and the associated momentum transfer $\sqrt{|t|}$. We focus on the regime in which the two jets are almost back-to-back in transverse space and have transverse momenta $P_{\perp}$ much larger than both the momentum transfer and the saturation scale $Q_s$. The cross section for producing such a hard dijet is parametrically dominated by large size fluctuations in the projectile wave-function that scatter strongly and for which a third, semi-hard, jet appears in the final state. The 2 + 1 jets cross section can be written in a factorized form in terms of incoherent quark and gluon diffractive transverse momentum distributions (DTMDs) when the third jet is explicit, or incoherent diffractive parton distribution functions (DPDFs) when the third jet is integrated over. We find that the DPDFs and the corresponding cross section saturate logarithmically when $|t| \ll Q_s^2$, while they fall like $1/|t|^2$ in the regime $Q_s^2 \ll |t| \ll P_{\perp}^2$. We further show that there is no angular correlation between the hard jet momentum and the momentum transfer. For typical EIC kinematics the 2 jets and 2 + 1 jets cross sections are of the same order.</description>

      <title>Net-proton fluctuations influenced by baryon stopping and quark deconfinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preliminary data from the Beam-Energy Scan II measurements by the STAR Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider suggest a dip in the fourth-to-second-order cumulant ratio when plotted vs. beam energy. At the same energy range where the structure appears, a transition from hadrons to quarks is expected, the deconfinement transition. In this paper, the role of quark deconfinement in establishing fluctuaitions in the early stages of the collision is considered. Two models are compared: one with stopping occurring on a baryon-by-baryon basis, and a second where stopping proceeds through quark degrees of freedom. In the latter model, the fluctuation of baryon number is significantly reduced and this signal is found to survive recombination into hadrons and the subsequent diffusion. The transformation from baryon to quark stopping thus produces a dip in the fourth-to-second-order cumulant ratio when plotted vs. beam energy, consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>Walking-dilaton hybrid inflation with $B-L$ Higgs embedded in dynamical scalegenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid inflationary scenario based on eight-flavor hidden QCD with the hidden colored fermions being in part gauged under $U(1)_{B-L}$. This hidden QCD is almost scale-invariant, so-called walking, and predicts the light scalar meson (the walking dilaton) associated with the spontaneous scale breaking, which develops the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) type potential as the consequence of the nonperturbative scale anomaly, hence plays the role of an inflaton of the small-field inflation. The $U(1)_{B-L}$ Higgs is coupled to the walking dilaton inflaton, which is dynamically induced from the so-called bosonic seesaw mechanism. We explore the hybrid inflation system involving the walking dilaton inflaton and the $U(1)_{B-L}$ Higgs as a waterfall field. We find that observed inflation parameters tightly constrain the $U(1)_{B-L}$ breaking scale as well as the walking dynamical scale to be $\sim 10^9$ GeV and $\sim 10^{14}$ GeV, respectively, so as to make the waterfall mechanism worked. The lightest walking pion mass is then predicted to be around 500 GeV. Phenomenological perspectives including embedding of the dynamical electroweak scalegenesis and possible impacts on the thermal leptogenesis are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Production of $\psi (4040)$, $\psi (4160)$, and $\psi (4415)$ mesons in strong interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using inelastic scattering of charmed strange mesons by open-charm mesons in Pb-Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, we study the production of $\psi (4040)$, $\psi (4160)$, and $\psi (4415)$ mesons. Master rate equations with the inelastic scattering are established. The scattering is caused by quark interchange in association with color interactions between all constituent pairs in different mesons. We consider fifty-one reactions between charmed strange mesons and open-charm mesons. Unpolarized cross sections for the reactions are obtained from a temperature-dependent interquark potential. Temperature dependence of the cross sections leads to that contributions of the reactions to the production of $\psi (4040)$, $\psi (4160)$, and $\psi (4415)$ change with decreasing temperature during evolution of hadronic matter. For central Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV it turned out from the master rate equations that the $\psi(4040)$ number density is larger than the $\psi(4160)$ number density which is larger than the $\psi(4415)$ number density.</description>

      <title>Effects of Final State Interactions on Landau Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In certain kinematic and particle mass configurations, triangle singularities may lead to line-shapes which mimic the effects of resonances. This well-known effect is scrutinized here in the presence of final-state rescattering. The goal is achieved first by utilizing general arguments provided by Landau equations, and second by applying a modern scattering formalism with explicit two- and three-body unitarity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-loop scattering amplitudes are difficult to evaluate due to singularities of the integrals involved, especially with increasing number of loops, external legs, and mass scales. For the first time at two loops, we enable their direct numerical integration by tackling infrared, ultraviolet and threshold singularities simultaneously using local subtractions. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by calculating previously unknown perturbative corrections for processes of interest to the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <title>On-shell effective field theory and quantum transport for hard photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an effective field theory for the description of high energetic or hard photons, the on-shell effective theory (OSEFT). The OSEFT describes the so called eikonal or semi-classical optical limit, allowing for corrections organized in a systematic expansion on inverse powers of the photon energy. We derive the OSEFT from the Maxwell Lagrangian, and study its different properties, such as the gauge symmetry and reparametrization invariance. The theory can be finally formulated in terms of a gauge invariant vector gauge field, without the need to introduce gauge-fixing. We then use the OSEFT to compute corrections to the Wigner photon function, and derive its associated side jump effect from reparametrization invariance. Finally, we discuss how to properly define the Stokes parameters from transport theory once quantum effects are considered, so as to preserve their well-defined properties under Lorentz transformations.</description>

      <title>Exclusive factorization beyond leading twist meets saturation physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework combining the higher-twist formalism of exclusive processes in the $s$ channel with the semi-classical effective description of small-$x$ physics in the $t$ channel. We apply it to transversely polarized light vector meson production, $\gamma^{*} p \rightarrow V (\rho, \varphi ,\omega) \; p$, which starts at the next-to-leading power and for which a purely collinear treatment leads to end-point singularities. The result is obtained in the most general kinematics, including both forward and non-forward cases by preserving the full impact parameter dependence in the non-perturbative correlators, in both momentum and coordinate space representations. A systematic expansion of the Wilson lines in terms of Reggeized gluon fields is performed in order to obtain the results in the weak-field BFKL approximation. These new results will allow for investigating the dilute-to-dense regime transition of QCD for a wide class of observables.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an alternative to the axion mechanism for addressing the charge parity (CP) problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Our approach involves imposing CP as an inherent symmetry of the Lagrangian, which is then spontaneously broken. To generate the correct texture for the Yukawa matrices, we introduce a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that is softly broken by the scalar potential. By identifying a benchmark point for the Yukawa couplings that aligns with the measured quark masses, the CKM matrix, and low-energy flavor-changing constraints, our findings suggest that this model offers a viable solution to the CP problem.</description>

      <title>On the two-loop BSM corrections to $h\longrightarrow \gamma\gamma$ in a triplet extension of the SM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the two-loop BSM contributions to the $h\longrightarrow \gamma\gamma$ decay width in the SM extended with a real triplet of $SU(2)$. We consider scenarios in which the neutral components of doublet and triplet do not mix, so that the lighter neutral scalar $h$ has (at least approximately) SM-like couplings to fermions and gauge bosons. We focus on the two-loop corrections controlled by the quartic scalar couplings, and obtain explicit and compact formulas for the $h \gamma \gamma$ amplitude by means of a low-energy theorem that connects it to the derivative of the photon self-energy w.r.t. the Higgs field. We briefly discuss the numerical impact of the newly-computed contributions, showing that they may be required for a precise determination of $\Gamma[h\rightarrow \gamma \gamma]$ in scenarios where the quartic scalar couplings are large.</description>

      <title>Thermal pressure on ultrarelativistic bubbles from a semiclassical formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a planar bubble wall that is traveling at an ultrarelativistic speed through a thermal plasma. This situation may arise during a first order electroweak phase transition in the early universe. As particles cross the wall, it is assumed that their mass grows from $m_a$ to $m_b$, and they are decelerated causing them to emit massless radiation. We are interested in the momentum transfer to the wall, the thermal pressure felt by the wall, and the resultant terminal velocity of the wall. We employ the semiclassical current radiation (SCR) formalism to perform these calculations. An incident charged particle is treated as a point-like classical electromagnetic current, and the spectrum of quantum electromagnetic radiation (photons) is derived by calculating appropriate matrix elements. To understand how the spectrum depends on the thickness of the wall, we explore simplified models for the current corresponding to an abrupt and a gradual deceleration. For the model of abrupt deceleration, we find that the SCR formalism can reproduce the $P_\mathrm{therm} \propto \gamma_w^0$ scaling found in earlier work by assuming that the emission is soft, but if the emission is not soft the SCR formalism can be used to obtain $P_\mathrm{therm} \propto \gamma_w^2$ instead. For the model of gradual deceleration, we find that the wall thickness $L_w$ enters to cutoff the otherwise log-flat radiation spectrum above a momentum of $\sim \gamma_w^2 / L_w$, and we discuss the connections with classical electromagnetic bremsstrahlung.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exclusive diffractive meson production represents a golden channel for investigating gluonic saturation inside nucleons and nuclei. In this letter, we settle a systematic framework to deal with beyond leading power corrections at small-$x$, including the saturation regime, and obtain the $\gamma^{*} \rightarrow M (\rho, \phi, \omega)$ impact factor with both incoming photon and outgoing meson carrying arbitrary polarizations. This is of particular interest since the saturation scale at modern colliders, although entering a perturbative regime, is not large enough to prevents higher-twist effects to be sizable.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18211</link>

Abstract: The Dark Abelian Sector Model (DASM) is an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics with an additional spontaneously broken $U_\text{d}(1)$ gauge symmetry connected to a dark sector, i.e. the SM particles do not carry the corresponding charge. In addition to the gauge boson resulting from the extra $U_\text{d}(1)$ gauge symmetry, the particle content is extended by a further Higgs boson, one Dirac fermion as well as right-handed neutrinos. Employing the $U_Y(1)$ field-strength tensor as well as the SM Higgs mass operator (the only two singlet operators of the SM with dimension less than four) and the right-handed neutrino fields, we open three portals to the dark sector.
  After an introduction of the model, we discuss a renormalization scheme for the complete model with a special focus on the renormalization of the mixing angles. Finally, as an example of application, we present the prediction for the W-boson mass derived from muon decay in the DASM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the application of quantum optimal control (QOC) techniques to state preparation of lattice field theories on quantum computers. As a first example, we focus on the Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions. We demonstrate that QOC can significantly speed up the ground state preparation compared to gate-based methods, even for models with long-range interactions. Using classical simulations, we explore the dependence on the inter-qubit coupling strength and the device connectivity, and we study the optimization in the presence of noise. While our simulations indicate potential speedups, the results strongly depend on the device specifications. In addition, we perform exploratory studies on the preparation of thermal states. Our results motivate further studies of QOC techniques in the context of quantum simulations for fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Observability of dynamical tides in merging eccentric neutron star binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While dynamical tides only become relevant during the last couple of orbits for circular inspirals, orbital eccentricity can increase their impact during earlier phases of the inspiral by exciting tidal oscillations at each close encounter. We investigate the effect of dynamical tides on the orbital evolution of eccentric neutron star binaries using post-Newtonian numerical simulations and constructing an analytic stochastic model. Our study reveals a strong dependence of dynamical tides on the pericenter distance, with the energy transferred to dynamical tides over that dissipated in gravitational waves (GWs) exceeding $\sim1\%$ at separations $r_\mathrm{p}\lesssim50$ km for large eccentricities. We demonstrate that the effect of dynamical tides on orbital evolution can manifest as a phase shift in the GW signal. We show that the signal-to-noise ratio of the GW phase shift can reach the detectability threshold of 8 with a single aLIGO detector at design densitivity for eccentric neutron star binaries at a distance of $40$ Mpc. This requires a pericenter distance of $r_\mathrm{p0}\lesssim68$ km ($r_\mathrm{p0}\lesssim76$ km) at binary formation with eccentricity close to 1 for a reasonable tidal deformability and f-mode frequency of 500 and $1.73$ kHz (700 and $1.61$ kHz), respectively. The observation of the phase shift will enable measuring the f-mode frequency of neutron stars independently from their tidal deformability, providing significant insights into neutron star seismology and the properties of the equation of state. We also explore the potential of distinguishing between equal-radius and twin-star binaries, which could provide an opportunity to reveal strong first-order phase transitions in the nuclear equation of state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A relativistic action for scalar condensate-fermion mixture is considered where both the scalar boson and the fermion fields are coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field. The dynamics of the gauge field is governed by a linear combination of the Maxwell term and the Lorentz invariant $\mathbf{E\cdot B}$ term with a constant coefficient $\theta$. We obtain an effective action describing an emergent fermion-fermion interaction and fermion-vortex tube interaction by using the particle-string duality, and find that the $\theta$ term can significantly affect the interaction of fermions and vortices. We also perform a dimensional reduction to show a $\theta$ dependent flux attachment to the itinerant fermions.</description>

      <title>Heavy-flavor mesons in a strong electric field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very strong electromagnetic field can be generated in peripheral relativistic heavy ion collisions. This work is devoted to exploring the interplay between the effects of a constant external electric field and confining potential on heavy-flavor mesons. As the corresponding vector potential linearly depends on one spatial coordinate for a constant electric field, it might be able to overcome the linear confining potential of QCD and induce deconfinement. To perform analytic calculations and for comparison, one and two dimensional systems are studied together with the realistic three dimensional systems. The one dimensional Schr$\ddot{\text o}$dinger equation can be solved analytically with the help of Airy functions, and deconfinement is indeed realized when the electric field is larger than the string tension. Focus on the confining case, the two and three dimensional Schr$\ddot{\text o}$dinger equations can be solved analytically in large $r$ limit with the help of elliptic cosine/sine functions, and the wave functions are dominated by the region antiparallel to the electric field. When a more realistic potential is applied, a non-monotonic feature is found for $\Upsilon(2S)$ and $\Upsilon(3S)$-like mesons with increasing electric field.</description>

      <title>Extracting the symmetries of nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries play a pivotal role in our understanding of the properties of quantum many-body systems. While there are theorems and a well-established toolbox for systems in thermal equilibrium, much less is known about the role of symmetries and their connection to dynamics out of equilibrium. This arises due to the direct link between a system's thermal state and its Hamiltonian, which is generally not the case for nonequilibrium dynamics. Here we present a pathway to identify the effective symmetries and to extract them from data in nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems. Our approach is based on exact relations between correlation functions involving different numbers of spatial points, which can be viewed as nonequilibrium versions of (equal-time) Ward identities encoding the symmetries of the system. We derive symmetry witnesses, which are particularly suitable for the analysis of measured or simulated data at different snapshots in time. To demonstrate the potential of the approach, we apply our method to numerical and experimental data for a spinor Bose gas. We investigate the important question of a dynamical restoration of an explicitly broken symmetry of the Hamiltonian by the initial state. Remarkably, it is found that effective symmetry restoration can occur long before the system equilibrates. We also use the approach to define and identify spontaneous symmetry breaking far from equilibrium, which is of great relevance for applications to nonequilibrium phase transitions. Our work opens new avenues for the classification and analysis of quantum as well as classical many-body dynamics in a large variety of systems, ranging from ultracold quantum gases to cosmology.</description>

Abstract: Scalar fields which are favorite among the possible candidates for the dark energy usually have degenerate minima at $\pm \phi_{min}$. In the presented work, we discuss a two Higgs doublet model with the non-degenerate vacuum named inert uplifted double well type two-Higgs doublet model (UDW-2HDM) for the dark energy. It is shown that when the both Higgs doublets lie in their respective true minima then one Higgs doublet can cause the current accelerated expansion of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Probing coalescence of light nuclei via femtoscopy and azimuthal anisotropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The production mechanism of light nuclei in heavy-ion collisions is vital to understanding the intricate details of nucleon-nucleon interactions. The coalescence of nucleons is a well-known mechanism that attempts to explain the production mechanism of these light clusters. This work investigates the formation mechanism of these nucleon clusters with a combination of coalescence and femtoscopy of nucleons and nuclei. It is achieved by appending a coalescence and correlation afterburner (\texttt{CRAB}) to the \texttt{SMASH} transport model. To have a proper view of the anisotropy of light nuclei clusters, a mean-field approach to \texttt{SMASH} is applied. The anisotropic coefficients of various light nuclei clusters are calculated and compared to experimental measurements. To incorporate hydrodynamics into the picture, the anisotropic measurements are completed in a hybrid \texttt{SMASH}+\texttt{vHLLE} mode. In both approaches, the femtoscopy of nucleons and light nuclei is performed, reported with CRAB, and compared to the latest experimental measurements. An insight into cluster formation time is drawn by extracting the emission source size with the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshits (LL) model.</description>

      <title>Neutrino cosmology after DESI: tightest mass upper limits, preference for the normal ordering, and tension with terrestrial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements have led to tight upper limits on the neutrino mass sum, potentially in tension with oscillation constraints requiring $\sum m_{\nu} \gtrsim 0.06\,{\text{eV}}$. Under the physically motivated assumption of positive $\sum m_{\nu}$, we study the extent to which these limits are tightened by adding other available cosmological probes, and robustly quantify the preference for the normal mass ordering over the inverted one, as well as the tension between cosmological and terrestrial data. Combining DESI data with Cosmic Microwave Background measurements and several late-time background probes, the tightest $2\sigma$ limit we find without including a local $H_0$ prior is $\sum m_{\nu}&lt;0.05\,{\text{eV}}$. This leads to a strong preference for the normal ordering, with Bayes factor relative to the inverted one of $46.5$. Depending on the dataset combination and tension metric adopted, we quantify the tension between cosmological and terrestrial observations as ranging between $2.5\sigma$ and $5\sigma$. These results are strenghtened when allowing for a time-varying dark energy component with equation of state lying in the physically motivated non-phantom regime, $w(z) \geq -1$, highlighting an interesting synergy between the nature of dark energy and laboratory probes of the mass ordering. If these tensions persist and cannot be attributed to systematics, either or both standard neutrino (particle) physics or the underlying cosmological model will have to be questioned.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Observing High-redshift Radio-loud Quasars in the SKA Era: Paving the Way for 21-cm Forest Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 21-cm forest is a sensitive probe for the early heating process and small-scale structures during the epoch of reionization (EoR), to be realized with the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Its detection relies on the availability of radio-bright background sources, among which the radio-loud quasars are very promising, but their abundance during the EoR is still poorly constrained due to limited observations. Here, we use a physics-driven model to forecast future radio-loud quasar observations. We fit the parameters of the model using observational data of high-redshift quasars. Assuming Eddington accretion, the model yields an average lifetime of $t_{\rm q} \sim 10^{5.3}$yr for quasars at $z\sim6$, consistent with recent results obtained from quasar proximity zone pre-study. We show that if the radio-loud fraction of quasars evolves with redshift, it will significantly reduce the abundance of observable radio-loud quasars in the SKA era, making 21-cm forest studies challenging. With a constant radio-loud fraction, our model suggests that a one-year sky survey conducted with SKA-LOW has the capability to detect approximately 20 radio-loud quasars at $z\sim 9$, with sufficient sensitivity to resolve individual 21-cm forest lines.</description>

      <title>Weyl gauge invariant DBI action in conformal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the analogue of the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action in Weyl conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions to obtain a Weyl gauge invariant theory. For $d=4$, in a leading order expansion the DBI action becomes the general Weyl quadratic gravity action associated to this geometry, that has the same gauge symmetry; this is broken spontaneously and Einstein-Hilbert gravity is recovered in the broken phase, with $\Lambda&gt;0$. The series expansion of the DBI action also contains additional non-polynomial terms that can be generated at quantum level in Weyl quadratic gravity in $d=4$, by a regularisation that respects this gauge symmetry. Such a regularisation is automatically provided by the DBI action in $d$ dimensions. If the Weyl gauge boson of dilatations is `pure gauge', the DBI action recovers in the leading order the conformal gravity action plus a locally Weyl invariant dilaton action. All fields are of geometric origin, with no added matter or compensating Weyl scalars, etc. The calculation is done in a Weyl {\it gauge covariant} and {\it metric} formulation of Weyl conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Discovery Potential for Decaying Dark Matter and Faint X-ray Sources with XRISM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical emission lines arising from particle decays can offer unique insights into the nature of dark matter (DM). Using dedicated simulations with background and foreground modeling, we comprehensively demonstrate that the recently launched XRISM space telescope with powerful X-ray spectroscopy capabilities is particularly well-suited to probe decaying DM, such as sterile neutrinos and axion-like particles, in the mass range of few to tens of keV. We analyze and map XRISM's DM discovery potential parameter space by considering Milky Way Galactic DM halo, including establishing an optimal line-of-sight search, as well as dwarf galaxies where we identify Segue 1 as a remarkably promising target. We demonstrate that with only 100 ks exposure XRISM/Resolve instrument is capable of probing the underexplored DM parameter window around few keV and testing DM couplings with sensitivity that exceeds by two orders existing Segue 1 limits. Further, we demonstrate that XRISM/Xtend instrument sensitivity enables discovery of the nature of faint astrophysical X-ray sources, especially in Segue 1, which could shed light on star-formation history. We discuss implications for decaying DM searches with improved detector energy resolution in future experiments.</description>

Abstract: The determination of the nuclear spectral function from the measured cross section of the electron-nucleus scattering process $e + A \to e^\prime + p + (A-1)$is discussed, and illustrated for the case of a carbon target. The theoretical model based on the local density approximation, previously employed to derive the spectral function from a combination of accurate theoretical calculations and experimental data, has been developed further by including additional information obtained from measurements performed with high missing energy resolution. The implications for the analysis of $\gamma$-ray emission associated with nuclear deexcitation are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental characteristics of slow roll inflation is its generation of tensor perturbations, which manifest as stochastic gravitational waves (GWs). Slow roll inflation results in a nearly scale-invariant GW spectrum that maintains its scale invariance as it transitions into the radiation-dominated era. However, introducing an intermediate reheating phase can modify the spectral tilt, depending on the equation of state governing that particular epoch. These GWs, especially on smaller scales, are anticipated to be observable by forthcoming GW detectors. In this study, we initially delineate the parameter space encompassing the inflationary energy scale, reheating temperature, and equation of state in a model-independent manner, focusing on the spectra detectable by GW detectors such as LISA, ET, DECIGO, and BBO. We also examine the implications for the $\alpha$-attractor model of inflation and explore the observational constraints on $n_s-r$ prediction in the light of GW detection. Then, we point out the probable ranges for various non-gravitational and gravitational coupling between the inflaton and Standard Model particles considering the perturbative reheating. If one assumes PBHs were formed during the early reheating era, such detection of GW signal also sheds light on the probing PBH parameters. Note that for the case of PBH domination, we also consider the contribution of the induced GW due to the density function in PBH distribution, which helps to decode the phase of early PBH domination. Finally, to test the production of other cosmological relics through future GW missions, we consider dark matter produced via gravitational interaction in the early universe.</description>

Abstract: We consider Dark Matter self-interactions mediated by ultralight scalars. We show that effectively massless mediators lead to an enhancement of the matter power spectrum, while heavier mediators lead to a suppression, together with a feature around their Jeans scale. We derive the strongest present constraints by combining Planck and BOSS data. The recent DESI measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations exhibit a mild preference for long-range self-interactions, as strong as 4 per mille of the gravitational coupling. Forthcoming data from DESI itself and Euclid will confirm or disprove such a hint.</description>

      <title>Indirect Probe of Electroweak-Interacting Particles at $\mu$TRISTAN $\mu^+\mu^+$ Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08434</link>

Abstract: Recently, a novel collider, called $\mu$TRISTAN, has been proposed, offering the capability to achieve high-energy collisions of anti-muons. This high-energy collider presents an exceptional opportunity for the discovery of electroweak-interacting massive particles (EWIMPs), which are predicted by various new physics models. In a lepton collider like $\mu$TRISTAN, the potential for discovering EWIMPs extends beyond their direct production. Quantum corrections arising from EWIMP loops can significantly enhance our prospects for discovery by precise measurement of Standard Model processes. This study focuses on the indirect detection method within the $\mu$TRISTAN experiment, with a specific emphasis on TeV-scale EWIMP dark matter scenarios that yield the correct thermal relic density. At collision energies for $ \sqrt{s} = O(1-10)$ TeV, these EWIMPs introduce noticeable effects, typically in the range of $O(0.1-1)$\%. Our findings indicate that at $\sqrt{s} = 2\, (10)$ TeV, with an integrated luminosity of 10 ab$^{-1}$, the $\mu$TRISTAN can detect Higgsino at a mass of 1.3 (3.0) TeV and Wino at a mass of 1.9 (4.4) TeV, assuming an optimistic level of systematic uncertainty in the observation of the Standard Model processes.</description>

      <title>On the cosmology and terrestrial signals of sexaquark dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the hypothesis that sexaquarks, hypothetical stable six-quark states, could be a significant component of the dark matter. We expand on previous studies of sexaquark cosmology, accounting for the possibility that some relevant interaction cross sections might be strongly suppressed below expectations based on dimensional analysis. We update direct-detection constraints on stable sexaquarks comprising a subdominant fraction of the dark matter, as well as limits on the annihilation of an antisexaquark component from Super-Kamiokande. We argue that the scenario where sexaquarks comprise a $O(1)$ fraction of the dark matter would require either a suppression of $O(10^{-19})$ in sexaquark interactions with baryons, combined with a very high yield of net sexaquark number from the quark-hadron transition, or else a very strong suppression of the cross section for antisexaquark annihilation on nucleons (24+ orders of magnitude below the QCD scale). Independently, we find that a sexaquark component comprising more than $O(10^{-3})$ of the dark matter can be excluded from direct-detection bounds, unless its scattering cross section is severely suppressed compared to the expected scale of strong and even electromagnetic interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational interaction is ubiquitous and the effect of gravitational particle production necessarily contributes to the dark matter abundance. A simple candidate of dark matter is a scalar particle, whose only renormalizable interaction is the Higgs portal coupling. We show that the abundance of Higgs portal dark matter is significantly affected by the gravitational production effect. In particular, the gravitational production from the coherently oscillating inflaton field during the reheating often gives dominant contribution.</description>

      <title>Impact of the cosmic neutrino background on long-range force searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light bosons can mediate long-range forces. We show that light bosonic mediators interacting with a background medium, in particular, with the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B), may induce medium-dependent masses which could effectively screen long-range forces from detection. This leads to profound implications for long-range force searches in e.g. the E\"ot-Wash, MICROSCOPE, and lunar laser-ranging (LLR) experiments. For instance, we find that when the coupling of the mediator to neutrinos is above $3\times10^{-10}$ or $5\times10^{-13}$, bounds from LLR and experiments employing the Sun as an attractor, respectively, would be entirely eliminated. Larger values of the coupling can also substantially alleviate bounds from searches conducted at shorter distances.</description>

      <title>Light single-gluon hybrid states with various (exotic) quantum numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the QCD sum rule method to study the light single-gluon hybrid states with various (exotic) quantum numbers. We construct twenty-four single-gluon hybrid currents, and use eighteen of them to calculate the masses of forty-four single-gluon hybrid states with the quark-gluon contents $\bar q q g$ ($q=u/d$) and $\bar s s g$. We concentrate on the hybrid states with the exotic quantum number $J^{PC} = 1^{-+}$, whose masses and widths are calculated to be $M_{|\bar q q g;1^-1^{-+}\rangle} =1.67^{+0.15}_{-0.17}$ GeV, $\Gamma_{|\bar q q g;1^-1^{-+}\rangle} = 530^{+540}_{-330}$ MeV, $M_{|\bar q q g;0^+1^{-+}\rangle} = 1.67^{+0.15}_{-0.17}$ GeV, $\Gamma_{|\bar q q g;0^+1^{-+}\rangle} = 120^{+160}_{-110}$ MeV, $M_{|\bar s s g;0^+1^{-+}\rangle} = 1.84^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$ GeV, and $\Gamma_{|\bar s s g;0^+1^{-+}\rangle} = 100^{+110}_{-~80}$ MeV. Our results support the interpretations of the $\pi_1(1600)$ and $\eta_1(1855)$ as the hybrid states $|\bar q q g;1^-1^{-+}\rangle$ and $|\bar s s g;0^+1^{-+}\rangle$, respectively. Considering the uncertainties, our results suggest that the $\pi_1(1600)$ and $\eta_1(1855)$ may also be interpreted as the hybrid states $|\bar q q g;1^-1^{-+}\rangle$ and $|\bar q q g;0^+1^{-+}\rangle$, respectively. To differentiate these two assignments and to verify whether they are hybrid states or not, we propose to examine the $a_1(1260) \pi$ decay channel in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing flavor violation and baryogenesis via primordial gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that observations of primordial gravitational waves of inflationary origin can shed light into the scale of flavor violation in a flavon model which also explains the mass hierarchy of fermions. The energy density stored in oscillations of the flavon field around the minimum of its potential redshifts as matter and is expected to dominate over radiation in the early universe. At the same time, the evolution of primordial gravitational waves acts as bookkeeping to understand the expansion history of the universe. Importantly, the gravitational wave spectrum is different if there is an early flavon dominated era compared to radiation domination expected from a standard cosmological model and this spectrum gets damped by the entropy released in flavon decays, determined by the mass of the flavon field $m_S$ and new scale of flavor violation $\Lambda_{\rm FV}$. We derive analytical expressions of the frequency above which the spectrum is damped, as-well-as the amount of damping, in terms of $m_S$ and $\Lambda_{\rm FV}$. We show that the damping of the gravitational wave spectrum would be detectable at BBO, DECIGO, U-DECIGO, $\mu-$ARES, LISA, CE and ET detectors for $\Lambda_{\rm FV}=10^{5-10}$ GeV and $m_S=\mathcal{O({\rm TeV})}$. Furthermore, the flavon decays can source the baryon asymmetry of the universe. We identify the $m_S-\Lambda_{\rm FV}$ parameter space where the observed baryon asymmetry $\eta \sim 10^{-10}$ is produced and can be tested by gravitational wave detectors like LISA and ET. We also discuss our results in the context of the recently measured stochastic gravitational background signals by NANOGrav.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A reaction model for $\gamma + p \to J/\psi + p$ photoproduction, which exposes the $c \bar c$ content of the photon in making the transition $\gamma\to c\bar c + \mathbb P \to J/\psi$ and couples the intermediate $c \bar c$ system to the proton's valence quarks via Pomeron ($\mathbb P $) exchange, is used to deliver a description of available data, viz. both differential and total cross sections from near threshold, where data has newly been acquired, to invariant mass $W \approx 300\,$GeV. The study suggests that it is premature to link existing $\gamma + p \to J/\psi + p$ data with, for instance, in-proton gluon distributions, the quantum chromodynamics trace anomaly, or pentaquark production. Further developments in reaction theory and higher precision data are necessary before the validity of any such connections can be assessed.</description>

      <title>Estimate for the neutrino magnetic moment from pulsar kick velocities induced at the birth of strange quark matter neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the magnetic moment of electron neutrinos by computing the neutrino chirality flip rate that can occur in the core of a strange quark matter neutron star at birth. We show that this process allows neutrinos to anisotropically escape, thus inducing the star kick velocity. Although the flip from left- to right-handed neutrinos is assumed to happen in equilibrium, the no-go theorem does not apply because right-handed neutrinos do not interact with matter and the reverse process does not happen, producing the loss of detailed balance. For simplicity, we model the star core as consisting of strange quark matter. We find that even when the energy released in right-handed neutrinos is a small fraction of the total energy released in left-handed neutrinos, the process describes kick velocities for natal conditions, which are consistent with the observed ones and span the correct range of radii, temperatures and chemical potentials for typical magnetic field intensities. The neutrino magnetic moment is estimated to be $\mu_\nu \sim 3.6 \times 10^{-18}\mu_B$, where $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton. This value is more stringent than the bound found for massive neutrinos in a minimal extension of the \mbox{standard model.}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensions of the Standard Model with masses at or below the GeV scale are motivated by searches for dark matter and precision measurements in the quark and lepton flavour sectors, including that of the muon anomalous magnetic moment. An excellent experimental environment to test such light new physics is given by the Belle II experiment, which foresees to take up to 50 ab$^{-1}$ of data. Here we consider a model with an additional gauged $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ symmetry that introduces a neutral gauge boson, a Dark Photon, with possibly large couplings to muon- and tau-flavored leptons, including neutrinos. Dark Photon mixing with the Standard Model photon is loop induced, allowing it to couple to electrically charged fermions other than muons and taus. We systematically investigate the possible search strategies for Dark Photons with four fermions final states. We identified search channels with muons as the most promising ones, and we analyse the kinematic distributions to obtain cuts that optimise the sensitivity of Belle II searches for the Dark Photon. Summarising the sensitivities from the most promising search channels we provide a comprehensive overview of future searches at Belle II.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, we estimate the in-medium mass shift of the two-flavored heavy mesons $B_c, B_c^*, B_s, B_s^*, D_s$ and $D_s^*$ in symmetric nuclear matter. The estimates are made by evaluating the lowest order one-loop self-energies. The enhanced excitations of intermediate state heavy-light quark mesons in symmetric nuclear matter are the origin of their negative mass shift. Our results show that the magnitude of the mass shift for the $B_c$ meson ($\bar{b} c$ or $b \bar{c}$) is larger than those of the $\eta_c (\bar{c} c)$ and $\eta_b (\bar{b} b)$, different from a naive expectation that it would be in-between of them. While, that of the $B_c^*$ shows the in-between of the $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$. We observe that the lighter vector meson excitation in each meson self-energy gives a dominant contribution for the corresponding meson mass shift, $B_c, B_s,$ and $D_s$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the interactions between mesons and baryons in the open heavy sectors to identify potential triple-heavy molecular pentaquarks. We derive the meson-baryon interaction potentials using the vector meson exchange mechanism within the extended local hidden gauge formalism. The scattering amplitudes are computed by solving the coupled-channel Bethe-Salpeter equation, revealing several bound systems. By analyzing the poles of these amplitudes in the complex plane, we determine the masses and widths of these bound states. Additionally, we evaluate the couplings and compositeness of different channels within each bound system to assess their molecular characteristics. Our predictions include four $\Omega_{ccc}$-like states, four $\Omega_{bbb}$-like states, fourteen $\Omega_{bcc}$-like states, and ten $\Omega_{bbc}$-like states, which could be targets for future experimental investigations.</description>

Abstract: The holographic Schwinger effect is investigated in systems with Nf = 0, Nf = 2, and Nf = 2+1 using the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) model, incorporating equation of state and baryon number susceptibility information from lattice QCD. It is found that the critical electric field is smallest for Nf = 0, indicating that the Schwinger effect is more likely to occur than in systems with Nf = 2 and Nf = 2+ 1. The critical electric field decreases with increasing chemical potential and temperature across all systems. Additionally, potential analysis confirms that the maximum total potential energy increases with the number of flavors, suggesting that existing particles may reduce the probability of particle pair production.</description>

      <title>Separation of Infrared and Bulk in Thermal QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New thermal phase of QCD, featuring scale invariance in the infrared (IR), was proposed to exist both in the pure-glue (N$_f$=0) and the ``real-world" (N$_f$=2+1) settings. Among key aspects of the proposal is that the system in this {\it IR phase} separates into two independent components: the scale-invariant IR part and the non-invariant bulk. Such scenario requires non-analyticities in the theory and, in case of pure-glue QCD, they were found to arise via Anderson-like mobility edges in Dirac spectra ($\lambda_\fir \!=\! 0$, $\pm \lambda_\text{A} \!\neq\! 0$) manifested in dimension function $d_\fir(\lambda)$. Here we present first evidence that this mechanism is also at work in ``real-world QCD" (N$_f$=2+1 theory at physical quark masses and $a\!=\!0.105\,$fm), supporting the existence of the proposed IR regime. Indeed, at $T\!=\!234\,$MeV, we find the dimensional jump between zero modes and lowest near-zero modes very close to unity ($d_\fir\!=\!3$ to $d_\fir \!\simeq \!2$), exactly like in pure-glue QCD in IR phase. However, no jump is found at $T\!=\!187\,$ MeV which is in the intermediate region between chiral crossover at $T_c \approx 155\,$MeV and the onset $T_\fir$ of IR phase, originally estimated at $200 &lt; T_\fir &lt; 250\,$MeV.</description>

      <title>Impact of (magneto-)thermoelectric effect on diffusion of conserved charges in hot and dense hadronic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric effect, which describes the generation of an electric field induced by temperature and conserved charge chemical potential gradients, in the hot and dense hadronic matter created in heavy-ion collisions. Utilizing the Boltzmann kinetic theory within the repulsive mean-field hadron resonance gas model, we evaluate both the diffusion thermopower matrix and diffusion coefficient matrix for the baryon number ($B$), electric charge ($Q$), and strangeness ($S$). The Landau-Lifshitz choice for the rest frame of the fluid is enforced in the derivation. We find that the thermoelectric effect hinders the diffusion processes of multiple conserved charges, particularly reducing the coupling between electric charge and baryon number (strangeness) in baryon (strangeness) diffusion. Given that the repulsive mean-field interactions between hadrons have a significant effect on the diffusion thermopower matrix and diffusion coefficient matrix in the baryon-rich region, we extend the investigation to include the impact of magnetic fields, analyzing the magneto-thermoelectric effect on both the diffusion coefficient matrix and the Hall-like diffusion coefficient matrix. The sensitivities of the magnetic field-dependent diffusion thermopower matrix and magneto-thermoelectric modified diffusion coefficient matrix to the choices of various transverse conditions are also studied.</description>

      <title>First detection of X-ray pulsations and spectrum of the high Galactic latitude pulsar PSR J0837-2454 and direct Urca cooling implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PSR J0837-2454 is a young 629 ms radio pulsar whose uncertain distance has important implications. A large distance would place the pulsar far out of the Galactic plane and suggest it is the result of a runaway star, while a short distance would mean the pulsar is extraordinarily cold. Here we present further radio observations and the first deep X-ray observation of PSR J0837-2454. Data from the Parkes Murriyang telescope show flux variations over short and long timescales and also yield an updated timing model, while the position and proper motion (and, less strongly, parallax) of the pulsar are constrained by a number of low-significance detections with the Very Long Baseline Array. XMM-Newton data enable detection of X-ray pulsations for the first time from this pulsar and yield a spectrum that is thermal and blackbody-like, with a cool blackbody temperature ~70 eV or atmosphere temperature ~50 eV, as well as a small hotspot. The spectrum also indicates the pulsar is at a small distance of &lt;~1 kpc, which is compatible with the marginal VLBA parallax constraint that favours a distance of &gt;~330 pc. The low implied luminosity (~7.6x10^31 erg s^-1 at 0.9 kpc) suggests PSR J0837-2454 has a mass high enough that fast neutrino emission from direct Urca reactions operates in this young star and points to a nuclear equation of state that allows for direct Urca reactions at the highest densities present in neutron star cores.</description>

      <title>On the deep superstring spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a covariant method of constructing entire trajectories of physical states in superstring theory in the critical dimension. It is inspired by a recently developed covariant technology of excavating bosonic string trajectories, that is facilitated by the observation that the Virasoro constraints can be written as linear combinations of lowering operators of a bigger algebra, namely a symplectic algebra, which is Howe dual to the spacetime Lorentz algebra. For superstrings, it is the orthosymplectic algebra that appears instead, with its lowest weight states forming the simplest class of physical trajectories in the NS sector. To construct the simplest class in the R sector, the lowest weight states need to be supplemented with other states, which we determine. Deeper trajectories are then constructed by acting with suitable combinations of the raising operators of the orthosymplectic algebra, which we illustrate with several examples.</description>

      <title>Role of the symmetry energy slope in neutron stars: exploring the model-dependency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using six different parametrizations of the quantum hadrodynamics (one of which is original), I study how different values of the symmetry energy slope ($L)$ affect some microscopic and macroscopic properties of neutron stars, such as the proton fraction, the maximum mass, the radius of the canonical 1.4$M_\odot$ star and its dimensionless tidal parameter $\Lambda$. I show that while most quantities present the same qualitative results, the tidal parameter can increase or decrease with the slope, depending on the model. Moreover, special attention is given to the minimum mass that enables the direct URCA process to occur in neutron stars' interiors ($M_{DU})$. Assuming the weak constraint $M_{DU}~&gt;~1.35M_\odot$, we see that the maximum value of $L$ that satisfies it lies between 79 and 86 MeV. A range of only 7 MeV. Therefore, $M_{DU}$ is an easy way to impose upper bounds to the slope.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves in Sneutrino Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition in a supersymmetric scenario where sneutrino is the inflaton in a hybrid inflationary framework. We obtain a spectral index ($n_s \simeq 0.966$), and a tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r\simeq 0.0056-10^{-11}$), consistent with the current Planck data satisfying PBH as dark matter (DM) and detectable Gravitational Wave (GW) signal. Our findings show that the mass of PBH and the peak in the GW spectrum is correlated with the right-handed (s)neutrino mass. We identify parameter space where PBHs can be the entire DM candidate of the universe (with mass $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$) or a fraction of it. This can be tested in future observatories, for example, with amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2$ $\sim 10^{-9}$ and peak frequency $f\sim 0.1$ Hz in LISA and $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2 \sim 10^{-11}$ and peak frequency of $\sim 10$ Hz in ET via second-order GW signals. We study two models of sneutrino inflation: Model$-1$ involves canonical sneutrino kinetic term which predicts the sub-Planckian mass parameter $M$, while the coupling between a gauge singlet and the waterfall field, $\beta$, needs to be quite large whereas, for the model$-2$ involving $\alpha-$attractor canonical sneutrino kinetic term, $\beta$ can take a natural value. Estimating explicitly, we show that both models have mild fine-tuning. We also derive an analytical expression for the power spectrum in terms of the microphysics parameters of the model like (s)neutrino mass, etc. that fits well with the numerical results. The typical reheat temperature for both the models is around $10^{7}-10^{8}$~GeV suitable for non-thermal leptogenesis.</description>
