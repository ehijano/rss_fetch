      <title>Analysis of a Cahn--Hilliard model for viscoelastoplastic two-phase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Cahn--Hilliard two-phase model describing the flow of two viscoelastoplastic fluids, which arises in geodynamics. A phase-field variable indicates the proportional distribution of the two fluids in the mixture. The motion of the incompressible mixture is described in terms of the volume-averaged velocity. Besides a volume-averaged Stokes-like viscous contribution, the Cauchy stress tensor in the momentum balance contains an additional volume-averaged internal stress tensor to model the elastoplastic behavior. This internal stress has its own evolution law featuring the nonlinear Zaremba-Jaumann time-derivative and the subdifferential of a non-smooth plastic potential. The well-posedness of this system is studied in two cases: Based on a regularization by stress-diffusion we obtain the existence of Leray-Hopf-type weak solutions. In order to deduce existence results also in the absence of the regularization, we introduce the concept of dissipative solutions, which is based on an estimate for the relative energy.
  We discuss general properties of dissipative solutions and show their existence for the viscoelastoplastic two-phase model in the setting of stress-diffusion. By a limit passage in the relative energy inequality for vanishing stress-diffusion, we conclude an existence result for the non-regularized model.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Monge-Amp\`ere Equation on a Cylinder: Well-Posedness and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a rigorous analytic framework for the hyperbolic Monge-Amp\`ere equation on strip-like domains, which model wrinkled patterns in thin elastic sheets. Our work addresses the rigid side of the classical rigidity-flexibility dichotomy by defining this regime not by high smoothness, but by the more fundamental property of partial convexity. The hodograph transformation is the natural tool for this setting, as its validity is predicated on partial convexity. It converts the nonlinear Monge-Amp\`ere equation into a linear damped wave equation, allowing us to formulate a well-posed Cauchy-Goursat problem. A key challenge is the corner singularity that arises where characteristic and non-characteristic boundary data meet. To resolve this, we develop a parametrix-corrector decomposition that captures the solution's inherent singular behavior. This method recasts the problem as a singular Volterra integral equation, for which we prove the existence and uniqueness of a new class of hodograph weak solutions. Finally, we derive energy estimates to establish the quantitative stability of these rigid solutions under perturbations of the underlying curvature function.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal critical problems with mixed boundary conditions and nearly resonant perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following nonlocal critical problem with mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions, \begin{equation} \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  (-\Delta)^su=\lambda u+|u|^{2_s^*-2}u &amp;\text{in}\ \Omega,\\ \mkern+38.5mu u=0&amp; \text{on}\ \Sigma_{\mathcal{D}},\\ \mkern+24mu \displaystyle \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}=0 &amp;\text{on}\ \Sigma_{\mathcal{N}},
  \end{array}
  \right. \end{equation} where $(-\Delta)^s$, $s\in (1/2,1)$, is the spectral fractional Laplacian operator, $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$, $N&gt;2s$, is a smooth bounded domain, $2_s^*=\frac{2N}{N-2s}$ denotes the critical fractional Sobolev exponent, $\lambda&gt;0$ is a real parameter, $\nu$ is the outwards normal to $\partial\Omega$, $\Sigma_{\mathcal{D}}$, $\Sigma_{\mathcal{N}}$ are smooth $(N-1)$--dimensional submanifolds of $\partial\Omega$ such that $\Sigma_{\mathcal{D}}\cup\Sigma_{\mathcal{N}}=\partial\Omega$, $\Sigma_{\mathcal{D}}\cap\Sigma_{\mathcal{N}}=\emptyset$ and $\Sigma_{\mathcal{D}}\cap\overline{\Sigma}_{\mathcal{N}}=\Gamma$ is a smooth $(N-2)$--dimensional submanifold of $\partial\Omega$. By employing both a $\nabla$-theorem combined with a linking-type theorem, we prove the existence of multiple solutions when the parameter $\lambda$ is in a left neighborhood of a given eigenvalue of $(-\Delta)^s$.</description>

      <title>Discrete Nonlinear Schr\"odinger versus Ablowitz-Ladik: Existence and dynamics of generalized NLS-type lattices over a nonzero background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of well-posedness of the generalized Ablowitz-Ladik and Discrete Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations with \textit{nonzero} boundary conditions on the infinite lattice is far less understood than in the case where the models are supplemented with vanishing boundary conditions. This question remains largely unexplored even in the standard case of cubic nonlinearities in which, in particular, the Ablowitz-Ladik equation is completely integrable while the Discrete Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation is not (in contrast with its continuous counterpart). We establish local well-posedness for both of these generalized nonlinear systems supplemented with a broad class of nonzero boundary conditions and, in addition, derive analytical upper bounds for the minimal guaranteed lifespan of their solutions. These bounds depend explicitly on the norm of the initial data, the background, and the nonlinearity exponents. In particular, they suggest the possibility of finite-time collapse (blow-up) of solutions. Furthermore, by comparing models with different nonlinearity exponents, we prove estimates for the distance between their respective solutions (measured in suitable metrics), valid up to their common minimal guaranteed lifespan. Highly accurate numerical studies illustrate that solutions of the generalized Ablowitz-Ladik equation may collapse in finite time. Importantly, the numerically observed blow-up time is in excellent agreement with the theoretically predicted order of the minimal guaranteed lifespan. Furthermore, in the case of the Discrete Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a finite lattice we prove global existence of solutions; this is consistent with our numerical observations of the phenomenon of \textit{quasi-collapse}, manifested by narrow oscillatory spikes that nevertheless persist throughout time -- continued in pdf ...</description>

      <title>Non-degeneracy and uniqueness of ground states to nonlinear elliptic equations with mixed local and nonlocal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the non-degeneracy and uniqueness of ground states to the following nonlinear elliptic equation with mixed local and nonlocal operators, $$ -\Delta u +(-\Delta)^s u + \lambda u=|u|^{p-2}u \quad \mbox{in} \,\,\, B, \quad u=0 \quad \mbox{in} \,\,\, \R^N \backslash {B}, $$ where $N \geq 2$, $0&lt;s&lt;1$, $2&lt;p&lt;2^*:=\frac{2N}{(N-2)^+}$, $\lambda &gt; -\lambda_1$, $(-\Delta)^s$ denotes the fractional Laplacian, $\lambda_1&gt;0$ denotes the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the operator $-\Delta +(-\Delta)^s$ in $B$ and $B$ denotes the unit ball in $\R^N$. We prove that the second eigenvalue to the linearized operator $-\Delta +(-\Delta)^s -(p-1)u^{p-2}$ in the space of radially symmetric functions is simple, the corresponding eigenfunction changes sign precisely once in the radial direction, where $u$ is a ground state. By applying a new Hopf type lemma, we then get that $-\lambda$ cannot be an eigenvalue of the linearized operator, which in turns leads to the non-degeneracy of the ground state. Moreover, by establishing a Picone type identity with respect to antisymmetric functions, we then derive the non-degeneracy of the ground state in the space of non-radially symmetric functions. Relying on the non-degeneracy of ground states and adapting a blow-up argument together with a continuation argument, we then obtain the uniqueness of ground states.</description>

      <title>The Mimura Integral: A Unified Framework for Riemann and Lebesgue Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integral on Euclidean space, equivalent to the Lebesgue integral, is constructed by extending the notion of Riemann sums. In contrast to the Henstock--Kurzweil and McShane integrals, the construction recovers the full measure-theoretic structure -- outer measure, inner measure, and measurable sets -- rather than merely reproducing integration with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Whereas the classical approach to Lebesgue theory proceeds through a two-layer framework of measure and integration, these layers are unified here into a single framework, thereby avoiding duplication. Compared with the Daniell integral, the method is more concrete and accessible, serving both as an alternative to the Riemann integral and as a natural bridge to abstract Lebesgue theory.</description>

      <title>On a fractional Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman-type monotonicity formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, by exploiting mean value properties of $s$-harmonic functions, we introduce some monotonicity formulas in the nonlocal setting. We take into account intrinsically nonlocal functionals mimicking those introduced by Alt, Caffarelli and Friedman in the seminal work [Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. (1984)]. Our approach is purely nonlocal and does not rely on the extension technique. As a byproduct we also established interior nonlocal gradient estimates and a nonlocal analogue of the Bochner identity.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem for connections in semi-linear wave equations on Lorentzian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper recovers Hermitian connections of semi-linear wave equations with cubic nonlinearity. The main novelty is in the geometric generality: we treat the case of an arbitrary globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold. Our approach is based on microlocal analysis of nonlinear wave interactions, which recovers a non-abelian broken light-ray transform, and the inversion of broken light-ray transforms on globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Weak-strong uniqueness for general cross-diffusion systems with volume filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak-strong uniqueness of solutions to a broad class of cross-diffusion systems with volume filling is established. In general, the diffusion matrices are neither symmetric nor positive definite. This issue is overcome by supposing that the equations possess a Boltzmann-type entropy structure, which ensures the existence of bounded weak solutions. In this framework, general conditions on the mobility matrix are identified that allow for the proof of the weak-strong uniqueness property by means of the relative entropy method. The core idea consists in analyzing an augmented mobility matrix that is positive definite only on a specific subspace. Several examples that meet the required assumptions are provided, together with a discussion on possible extensions.</description>

      <title>Sharp local well-posedness of $C^1$ vortex patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the boundary dynamics of vortex patches is globally well-posed in the H\"older space $C^{1,\alpha}$ for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, whereas the well-posedness in $C^1$ remains an open problem, even locally. In this paper, we establish the local well-posedness for vortex patches in the space $C^{1,\varphi}$ defined via a modulus of continuity $\varphi$ that satisfies certain structural assumptions. Our class includes curves that are strictly rougher than the H\"older-continuous ones, with prototypical examples being $\varphi(r) = (-\log r)^{-s}$ for $s&gt;3$. Motivated by the fact that the velocity operator in the contour dynamics equation is a nonlinear variant of the Hilbert transform, we study the system of equations satisfied by the curve parametrization $\gamma \in C^{1,\varphi}$ and its Hilbert transform. In doing so, we derive several properties of the Hilbert transform and its variants in critical spaces, which are essential for controlling the velocity operator and its Hilbert transform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study here mild solutions for the forced, incompressible fractional Boussinesq system. Under suitable estimates for the terms involved (in an adapted functional framework) we can invoque a fixed point argument in order to obtain mild solutions. Although many functional spaces can be considered, we are interested here in a critical setting which ensures the existence of global solutions and we will work in particular with parabolic Morrey spaces which provide one of the largest critical functional frameworks available for constructing mild solutions for the fractional Boussinesq equations.</description>

      <title>Enhancing PINN Performance Through Lie Symmetry Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents intersection of Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) and Lie symmetry group to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of solving partial differential equation (PDEs). Various methods have been developed to solve these equations. A Lie group is an efficient method that can lead to exact solutions for the PDEs that possessing Lie Symmetry. Leveraging the concept of infinitesimal generators from Lie symmetry group in a novel manner within PINN leads to significant improvements in solution of PDEs. In this study three distinct cases are discussed, each showing progressive improvements achieved through Lie symmetry modifications and adaptive techniques. State-of-the-art numerical methods are adopted for comparing the progressive PINN models. Numerical experiments demonstrate the key role of Lie symmetry in enhancing PINNs performance, emphasizing the importance of integrating abstract mathematical concepts into deep learning for addressing complex scientific problems adequately.</description>

      <title>On the propagation of mountain waves: linear theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive and establish a solution concept for the linear mountain wave problem in two dimensions. After linearizing the governing equations and a change of variables, the problem can be stated as a Dirichlet boundary value problem for a Helmholtz equation in terms of the vertical wind profile in the upper half-plane, with altitude-dependent potential (the Scorer parameter). To single out the correct solution, we have to make use of a radiation condition which is, due to the different physical situation, different from the classical Sommerfeld radiation condition for electromagnetic or acoustic waves. We rigorously develop a transform method and construct the physically correct solution, following Lyra's monotonicity criterion for mountain waves. In this procedure, we clearly recognize the two typical types of mountain waves: vertically propagating waves and trapped lee waves. This paper is the first rigorous work on Helmholtz-like equations in the upper half-plane subject to such a non-classical radiation condition.</description>

      <title>An all-topology two-fluid model for two-phase flows derived through Hamilton's Stationary Action Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel multi-fluid model for compressible two-phase flows. The model is derived through a newly developed Stationary Action Principle framework. It is fully closed and introduces a new interfacial quantity, the interfacial work. The closures for the interfacial quantities are provided by the variational principle. They are physically sound and well-defined for all type of flow topologies. The model is shown to be hyperbolic, symmetrizable, and admits an entropy conservation law. Its non-conservative products yield uniquely defined jump conditions which are provided. As such, it allows for the proper treatment of weak solutions. In the multi-dimensional setting, the model presents lift forces which are discussed. The model constitutes a sound basis for future numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Competition of small targets in planar domains: from Dirichlet to Robin and Steklov boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider steady-state diffusion in a bounded planar domain with multiple small targets on a smooth boundary. Using the method of matched asymptotic expansions, we investigate the competition of these targets for a diffusing particle and the crucial role of surface reactions on the targets. We start from the classical problem of splitting probabilities for perfectly reactive targets with Dirichlet boundary condition and improve some earlier results. We discuss how this approach can be generalized to partially reactive targets characterized by a Robin boundary condition. In particular, we show how partial reactivity reduces the effective size of the target. In addition, we consider more intricate surface reactions modeled by mixed Steklov-Neumann or Steklov-Neumann-Dirichlet problems. We provide the first derivation of the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for these spectral problems in the small-target limit. Finally, we show how our asymptotic approach can be extended to interior targets in the bulk and to exterior problems where diffusion occurs in an unbounded planar domain outside a compact set. Direct applications of these results to diffusion-controlled reactions are discussed.</description>

      <title>The Effective Reactivity for Capturing Brownian Motion by Partially Reactive Patches on a Spherical Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the trapping of diffusing ligands, modeled as Brownian particles, by a sphere that has $N$ partially reactive boundary patches, each of small area, on an otherwise reflecting boundary. For such a structured target, the partial reactivity of each boundary patch is characterized by a Robin boundary condition, with a local boundary reactivity $\kappa_i$ for $i=1,\ldots,N$. For any spatial arrangement of well-separated patches on the surface of the sphere, the method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to derive explicit results for the capacitance $C_{\rm T}$ of the structured target, which is valid for any $\kappa_i&gt;0$. This target capacitance $C_{\rm T}$ is defined in terms of a Green's matrix, which depends on the spatial configuration of patches, the local reactive capacitance $C_i(\kappa_i)$ of each patch and another coefficient that depends on the local geometry near a patch. The analytical dependence of $C_{i}(\kappa_i)$ on $\kappa_i$ is uncovered via a spectral expansion over Steklov eigenfunctions. For circular patches, the latter are readily computed numerically and provide an accurate fully explicit sigmoidal approximation for $C_{i}(\kappa_i)$. In the homogenization limit of $N\gg 1$ identical uniformly-spaced patches with $\kappa_i=\kappa$, we derive an explicit scaling law for the effective capacitance and the effective reactivity of the structured target that is valid in the limit of small patch area fraction. From a comparison with numerical simulations, we show that this scaling law provides a highly accurate approximation over the full range $\kappa&gt;0$, even when there is only a moderately large number of reactive patches.</description>

      <title>On the dependence of the nonlinear Schrodinger flow upon the power of the nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove continuity properties for the flow map associated to the defocusing energy-subcritical power-like nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation, when the power varies. We show local in time continuity in the energy space for any power, and global in time continuity for sufficiently large powers. When the linear dispersive rate is counterbalanced by a time-dependent rescaling, we show a uniform in time continuity of the squared modulus of this rescaled function, in Kantorovich distance, for any power, including long range cases in terms of scattering. The most difficult result addresses the convergence of suitably renormalized solutions to the solution of the logarithmic Schr{\"o}dinger equation, when the power goes to zero, uniformly in time, in Kantorovich distance. The proof relies on estimates for perturbed porous medium equations, involving the harmonic Fokker-Planck operator.</description>

      <title>Curl Measure Fields, the Generalized Stokes Theorem and Vorticity Fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze the class $\mathscr{CM}^{p}$ of curl-measure fields that are $p$-integrable vector fields whose distributional curl is a vector-valued finite Radon measure. These spaces provide a unifying framework for problems involving vorticity. A central focus of this paper is the development of Stokes-type theorems in low-regularity regimes, made possible by new trace theorems for curl-measure fields. To this end, we introduce Stokes functionals on so-called good manifolds, defined by the finiteness of manifold-adapted maximal operators. Using novel techniques that may be of independent interest, we establish results that are new even in classical settings, such as Sobolev spaces or their curl-variants $\mathrm{H}^{\mathrm{curl}}(\mathbb{R}^{3})$, which arise, for example, in the study of Maxwell's equations. The sharpness of our theorems is illustrated through several fundamental examples.</description>

      <title>On uniqueness of radial potentials for given Dirichlet spectra with distinct angular momenta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an inverse spectral problem for radial Schr\" odinger operators with singular potentials. First, we show that the knowledge of the Dirichlet spectra for infinitely many angular momenta~$\ell$ satisfying a M\"untz-type condition uniquely determines the potential. Then, in a neighborhood of the zero potential, we prove that the potential is uniquely determined by two Dirichlet spectra associated with distinct angular momenta in the cases \((\ell_1,\ell_2) = (0,1)\) and \((0,2)\). Our approach relies on an explicit analysis of the corresponding singular differential equation, combined with the classical Kneser--Sommerfeld formula. These results confirm, in the linearized setting and in these configurations, a conjecture originally formulated by Rundell and Sacks (2001).</description>

      <title>The distorted Fourier transform for the linearized Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the Hyperbolic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the stability problem for Ginzburg-Landau vortices on the hyperbolic plane, we develop the distorted Fourier transform for a general class of radial non-self-adjoint matrix Schr\"odinger operators on the hyperbolic plane. This applies in particular to the operator obtained by linearizing the equivariant Ginzburg-Landau equation on the hyperbolic plane around the degree one vortex. We systematically
  construct the distorted Fourier transform by writing the Stone formula for complex energies and taking the limit as the energy tends to the spectrum of the operator on the real line. This approach entails a careful analysis of the resolvent for complex energies in a neighborhood of the real line. It is the analogue of the approaches used in \cite{KS,ES2, LSS25}, where the limiting operator as $r\to\infty$ is not self-adjoint and which we carry out for all energies. Our analysis serves as the starting point for the study of the stability of the Ginzburg-Landau vortex under equivariant perturbations.</description>

      <title>Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation for optimal control of stochastic Wasserstein--Hamiltonian system on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic optimal control problems for Hamiltonian dynamics on graphs have wide-ranging applications in mechanics and quantum field theory, particularly in systems with graph-based structures. In this paper, we establish the existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions for a new class of Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations arising from the optimal control of stochastic Wasserstein--Hamiltonian systems (SWHSs) on graphs. One distinctive feature of these HJB equations is the simultaneous involvement of the Wasserstein geometry on the Wasserstein space over graphs and the Euclidean geometry in physical space. The nonlinear geometric structure, along with the logarithmic potential induced by the graph-based state equation, adds further complexity to the analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce an energy-truncation technique within the doubling of variables framework, specifically designed to handle the interaction between the interiorly defined Wasserstein space on graphs and the unbounded Euclidean space. In particular, our findings demonstrate the well-posedness of HJB equations related to optimal control problems for both stochastic Schr\"odinger equation with polynomial nonlinearity and stochastic logarithmic Schr\"odinger equation on graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to develop HJB equations for the optimal control of SWHSs on graphs.</description>

      <title>Weak Martingale Solutions of the Stochastic Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson-Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson-Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (SPLLG) system can characterize the spin transfer torque mechanism transferring the spin angular momentum to the magnetization dynamics through spin-magnetization coupling. We study the three-dimensional stochastic SPLLG system driven by a multiplicative stochastic force containing a continuous noise and a small jump noise. We establish the existence of weak martingale solutions based on the penalized functional technique, the Faedo-Galerkin approximation, stochastic compactness method, and a careful identification of the limit. Due to the strong coupling and strong nonlinearity caused by the SPLLG system and stochastic effects, some crucial difficulties have been encountered in obtaining energy estimates and avoiding non-negativity of the test function. We mainly utilize the structure of equations and the property of martingales developing the new energy estimates, and apply the three-layer approximation to overcome these difficulties. In particular, we extend the results by Z. Brze\'{z}niak and U. Manna (Comm. Math. Phys., 2019) and by L.H. Chai, C.J. Garc\'{\i}a-Cervera and X. Yang (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 2018) to both the stochastic case and the coupling case.</description>

      <title>The Hadamard parametrix on half-Minkowski with Robin boundary conditions: Fundamental solutions and Hadamard states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of constructing fundamental solutions and Hadamard states for a Klein-Gordon field in half-Minkowski spacetime with Robin boundary conditions in $d \geq 2$ spacetime dimensions. First, using a generalisation of the Robin-to-Dirichlet map exploited by Bondurant and Fulling [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. {\bf 38} 7 (2005)] in dimension $2$, we obtain a representation for the advanced and retarded Green operators in terms of a convolution with the kernel of the inverse Robin-to-Dirichlet map. This allows us to prove the uniqueness and support properties of the Green operators. Second, we obtain a local representation for the Hadamard parametrix that provides the correct local definition of Hadamard states in $d \geq 2$ dimensions, capturing `reflected' singularities from the spacetime boundary. We show that our fundamental solutions abide by this local parametrix representation. Finally, we prove the equivalence of our local Hadamard condition and the global Hadamard condition with a wave-front set described in terms of generalized broken bi-characteristics, obtaining a Radzikowski-like theorem in half-Minkowski spacetime.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a simple linear model of the cochlea as a set of vibrating strings. We make hypothesis that the information sent to the auditory cortex is the energy stored in the strings and consider all oscillation modes of the strings. We show the emergence of the sub-harmonic series whose existence was hypothesized in the XVI century to explain the consonance of the minor chord. We additionally show how the nonlinearity of the energy can be used to study the emergence of the combination tone (Tartini's third sound) shedding new light on this long debated subject.</description>

      <title>Finite element discretizations of bending plates with prestrained microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a finite element discretization of an elastic bending-plate model with an effective prestrain. The model has been obtained via homogenization and dimension reduction by B\"onlein at al. (2023). Its energy functional is the $\Gamma$-limit of a three-dimensional nonlinear microstructured elasticity functional. In the derived effective model, the microstructure is incorporated as a local corrector problem, a system of linear elliptic partial differential equations posed on a three-dimensional representative volume element. The discretization uses Discrete Kirchhoff Triangle elements for the macroscopic bending-plate problem on a mesh of scale $H$, and first-order Lagrange elements for the microscopic corrector problem on an axis-aligned mesh of scale $h$. We show that the discretized model $\Gamma$-converges to the continuous one as $(h,H)\to 0$,provided that there exists a microstructure mesh such that the elasticity tensor is Lipschitz continuous on each mesh element. This extends earlier results by Rumpf et al. (2024) to prestrained composites. Our argument does not require any rate of convergence for the microscopic discretization error. As a corollary, we also obtain convergence when $h \to 0$ and $H \to 0$ consecutively, and we prove that these limit processes commute.</description>

Numerical simulations are performed using these discrete equations and other discrete equations with a standard scheme. We show the results obtained using the structure-preserving scheme and provide more accurate and stable numerical solutions.</description>

      <title>Area minimizing hypersurfaces modulo $p$: a geometric free-boundary problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.08135v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider area minimizing $m$-dimensional currents $\mathrm{mod}(p)$ in complete $C^2$ Riemannian manifolds $\Sigma$ of dimension $m+1$. For odd moduli we prove that, away from a closed rectifiable set of codimension $2$, the current in question is, locally, the union of finitely many smooth minimal hypersurfaces coming together at a common $C^{1,\alpha}$ boundary of dimension $m-1$, and the result is optimal. For even $p$ such structure holds in a neighborhood of any point where at least one tangent cone has $(m-1)$-dimensional spine. These structural results are indeed the byproduct of a theorem that proves (for any modulus) uniqueness and decay towards such tangent cones. The underlying strategy of the proof is inspired by the techniques developed by Leon Simon in "Cylindrical tangent cones and the singular set of minimal submanifolds" (J. Diff. Geom. 1993) in a class of multiplicity one stationary varifolds. The major difficulty in our setting is produced by the fact that the cones and surfaces under investigation have arbitrary multiplicities ranging from $1$ to $\lfloor \frac{p}{2}\rfloor$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Helmholtz equation in a two dimensional open waveguide with a thin and high contrast core layer. We develop an asymptotic analysis of the Green function of the problem, and through it we identify and characterize the appearance of resonant frequencies. For waves originating outside of the core, the waveguide response at these resonant frequencies is vastly different than the response at non-resonant frequencies. Using this phenomenon and multifrequency measurements containing the first resonance, we propose, theoretically analyze, and numerically validate a reconstruction algorithm to identify the location, thickness and index of refraction of the core layer.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09903v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that buoyancy driven flows can be steered in an arbitrary time towards any state by applying as control only an external temperature profile in a subset of small measure. More specifically, we prove that the 2D incompressible Boussinesq system on the torus is globally approximately controllable via physically localized heating or cooling. In addition, our controls have an explicitly prescribed structure; even without such structural requirements, large data controllability results for Boussinesq flows driven merely by a physically localized temperature profile were so far unknown. The presented method exploits various connections between the model's underlying transport-, coupling-, and scaling mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Large-time existence results for the nonlocal NLS around ground state solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses about solutions of the nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger equation. We prove that the solution remains close to the orbit of the soliton for a large-time, if the initial data is close to the ground state solitons. The proof uses the hyperbolic dynamics near ground state, which exhibits properties of local structural stability of solutions with respect to the flows of the nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger equation.</description>

Abstract: We apply our idea, which previously we used in the analysis of the pure power NLS, consisting in spitting the virial inequality method into a large energy inequality combined with Kato smoothing, to the case of generalized Korteweg--De Vries pure power equations. We assume that a solution remains for all positive times very close to a soliton and then we prove an asymptotic stability result for $t\to +\infty$.</description>

Abstract: We study the following Liouville system defined on a flat torus \begin{equation} \left\{ \begin{array}{lr} -\Delta u_i=\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}\rho_j\Big(\frac{h_j e^{u_j}}{\int_\Omega h_j e^{u_j}}-1\Big),\nonumber u_j\in H_{per}^1(\Omega)\mbox{ for }i\in I=\{1,\cdots,n\}\nonumber, \end{array} \right. \end{equation} where $h_j\in C^3(\Omega)$, $h_j&gt;0$, $\rho_j&gt;0$ and $u=(u_1,..,u_n)$ is doubly periodic on $\partial\Omega$. The matrix $A=(a_{ij})_{n\times n}$ satisfies certain properties. One central problem about Liouville systems is whether multi-bubble solutions do exist. In this work we present a comprehensive construction of multi-bubble solutions in the most general setting.</description>

      <title>Elliptic boundary-value problems in some distribution spaces of generalized smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build a solvability theory of elliptic boundary-value problems in normed Sobolev spaces of generalized smoothness for any integrability exponent $p&gt;1$. The smoothness is given by a number parameter and a supplementary function parameter that varies slowly at infinity. These spaces are obtained by a combination of the methods of the complex interpolation with number parameter between Banach spaces and the quadratic interpolation with function parameter between Hilbert spaces applied to classical Sobolev spaces. We show that the spaces under study admit localization near a smooth boundary and describe their trace spaces in terms of Besov spaces with the same supplementary function parameter. We prove that a general differential elliptic problem induces Fredholm bounded operators on appropriate pairs of the spaces under study. We also find exact sufficient conditions for solutions of the problem to have a prescribed generalized or classical smoothness on a given set and establish corresponding a priori estimates of the solution. These results are specified for parameter-elliptic problems.</description>

      <title>Another look at quasilinear Schr\"odinger equations with prescribed mass via dual method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study the existence of ground state normalized solutions for the following quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation $-\Delta u-\Delta(u^2)u=h(u)+\lambda u,\,\, x\in\R^N$, under the mass constraint $\int_{\R^N}|u|^2\text{d}x=a,$ where $N\geq2$, $a&gt;0$ is a given mass, $\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier and $h$ is a nonlinear reaction term with some suitable conditions. By employing a suitable transformation $u=f(v)$, we reformulate the original problem into the equivalent form $-\Delta v =h(f(v))f'(v)+\lambda f(v)f'(v),\,\, x\in\R^N,$ with prescribed mass $ \int_{\R^N}|f(v)|^2\text{d}x=a. $ To address the challenge posed by the $L^2$-norm $\|f(v)\|^2_2$ not necessarily equaling
  $a$, we introduce a novel stretching mapping: $ v_t(x):=f^{-1}(t^{N/2}f(v(tx))). $ This construction, combined with a dual method and detailed analytical techniques, enables us to establish the following existence results:
  (1)Existence of solutions via constrained minimization using dual methods;
  (2) Existence of ground state normalized solutions under general
  $L^2$-supercritical growth conditions, along with nonexistence results, analyzed via dual methods;
  (3)Existence of normalized solutions under critical growth conditions, treated via dual methods.
  Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the ground state energy obtained in {\bf(P2)}. Our results extend and refine those of Colin-Jeanjean-Squassina [Nonlinearity 20: 1353-1385, 2010], of Jeanjean-Luo-Wang [J. Differ. Equ. 259: 3894-3928, 2015], of Li-Zou [Pacific J. Math. 322: 99-138, 2023], of Zhang-Li-Wang [Topol. Math. Nonl. Anal. 61: 465-489, 2023] and so on. We believe that the methodology developed here can be adapted to study related problems concerning the existence of normalized solutions for quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations via the dual method.</description>

      <title>Controllability of Boussinesq flows driven by finite-dimensional and physically localized forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show approximate controllability of Boussinesq flows in $\mathbb{T}^2 = \mathbb{R}^2 / 2\pi\mathbb{Z}^2$ driven by finite-dimensional controls that are supported in any fixed region $\omega \subset \mathbb{T}^2$. This addresses a Boussinesq version of a question by Agrachev and provides the first known example of incompressible fluids with this property. In this context, we complement results obtained for the Navier--Stokes system by Agrachev--Sarychev (Comm. Math. Phys. 265, 2006), where the controls are finite-dimensional but not localized in physical space, and Nersesyan--Rissel (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 78, 2025), where physically localized controls admit for special $\omega$ a degenerate but not finite-dimensional structure.
  For our proof, we study controllability properties of tailored convection equations governed by time-periodic degenerately forced Euler flows that provide a twofold geometric mechanism: transport of information through $\omega$ versus non-stationary mixing effects transferring energy from low-dimensional sources to higher frequencies. The temperature is then controlled by using Coron's return method, while the velocity is mainly driven by the buoyant force.
  When $\omega$ contains two cuts of $\mathbb{T}^2$, our approach allows to effectively construct low-dimensional control spaces of dimensions that are independent of the choice of $\omega$ within this class of control regions.</description>

      <title>Local uniqueness and non-degeneracy of blowup solutions for regular Liouville systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the following Liouville system defined on a compact Riemann surface $M$, \begin{equation}
  -\Delta u_i=\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}\rho_j\Big(\frac{h_j e^{u_j}}{\int_\Omega h_j e^{u_j}}-1\Big)\mbox{ in }M\mbox{ for }i=1,\cdots,n,\nonumber \end{equation} where the coefficient matrix $A=(a_{ij})_{n\times n}$ is nonnegative, $h_1, \ldots, h_n$ are positive smooth functions, and $\rho_1, \ldots, \rho_n$ are positive constants. For the blowup solutions, we establish their uniqueness and non-degeneracy based on natural assumptions. The main results significantly generalize corresponding results for single Liouville equations \cite{BartJevLeeYang2019,BartYangZhang20241,BartYangZhang20242}. To overcome several substantial difficulties, we develop certain tools and extend them into a more general framework applicable to similar situations. Notably, to address the considerable challenge of a continuum of standard bubbles, we refine the techniques from Huang-Zhang \cite{HuangZhang2022} and Zhang \cite{Zhang2006,Zhang2009} to achieve extremely precise pointwise estimates. Additionally, to address the limited information provided by the Pohozaev identity, we develop a useful Fredholm theory to discern the exact role that the Pohozaev identity plays for systems. The considerable difference between systems and a single equation is also reflected in the location of blowup points, where the uncertainty of the energy type of the blowup point makes it difficult to determine the sufficiency of pointwise estimates. In this regard, we extend our highly precise pointwise estimates to any finite order. This aspect is drastically distinct from analyses of single equations.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian controllability in perforated domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question at stake in Lagrangian controllability is whether one can move a patch of fluid particles to a target location by means of remote action in a given time interval. In the last two decades, positive results have been obtained both for the incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. However, for the latter, the case where the fluid is contained within domains bounded by solid boundaries with the no-slip condition has not been addressed, with respect to the difficulty caused by viscous boundary layers. In this paper, we investigate the Lagrangian controllability of viscous incompressible fluid in perforated domains for which the fraction of volume occupied by the holes is sufficiently small. Moreover, we quantitatively distinguish situations depending on the parameters for holes (diameter and distance) and for fluid (size of the initial data). Our approach relies on recent results on homogenization for evolutionary problems and on weak-strong stability estimates in measure of flows, alongside classical results on Runge-type approximations for elliptic equations and on Cauchy-Kowalevsky-type theorems for equations with analytic coefficients. Here, homogenization refers to the vanishing viscosity limit outside a porous medium, where (after scaling in time) the Navier-Stokes equations are homogenized to the Euler or Darcy equations. Indeed, in the proof, we act on the Navier-Stokes equations by strong and fast forcing to leverage inviscid approximations, which is a standard technique in the theory of controllability.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Cahn-Hilliard equation, which models phase separation in binary fluids, on the two-dimen\-sional torus in the presence of advection by a given background shear flow, satisfying certain conditions and of sufficiently large amplitude. By exploiting the resulting enhanced dissipation for the linearized operator, we prove that, with well-prepared data, the solution converges asymptotically at large times to the solution of a one-dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation, obtained by projecting the full equation in the direction orthogonal to the shear in a suitable sense. This result rigorously justified the observed phenomenon of striation in the concentration field.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Analysis of Some PDE and Steklov Eigenvalue Problems with Partially Reactive Patches in 3-D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider steady-state diffusion in a three-dimensional bounded domain with a smooth reflecting boundary that is partially covered by small partially reactive patches. By using the method of matched asymptotic expansions, we investigate the competition of these patches for a diffusing particle and the crucial role of surface reactions on these targets. After a brief overview of former contributions to this field, we first illustrate our approach by considering the classical problems of the mean first-reaction time (MFRT) and the splitting probability for partially reactive patches characterized by a Robin boundary condition. For a spherical domain, we derive a three-term asymptotic expansion for the MFRT and splitting probabilities in the small-patch limit. This expansion is valid for arbitrary reactivities, and also accounts for the effect of the spatial configuration of patches on the boundary. Secondly, we consider more intricate surface reactions modeled by mixed Steklov-Neumann or Steklov-Neumann-Dirichlet problems. We provide the first derivation of the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for these spectral problems in the small-patch limit for a spherical domain. Extensions of these asymptotic results to arbitrary domains and their physical applications are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We consider multiple solutions to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with a partial confinement, which is physically relevant to dynamics of the Bose-Einstein condensate. Our study not only verifies the existence of positive ground state solutions and the nonexistence of least energy sign-changing solutions but also sheds light on the symmetry associated with these solutions. A novel finding is the existence of saddle type nodal solutions with their nodal domains intersecting at the origin. Furthermore, we have developed some innovative techniques such as the method of moving planes and the Hopf lemma for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with partial confinement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1910.07464v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider invariant measures for the stochastic Burgers equation on $\mathbb{R}$, forced by the derivative of a spacetime-homogeneous Gaussian noise that is white in time and smooth in space. An invariant measure is indecomposable, or extremal, if it cannot be represented as a convex combination of other invariant measures. We show that for each $a\in\mathbb{R}$, there is a unique indecomposable law of a spacetime-stationary solution with mean $a$, in a suitable function space. We also show that solutions starting from spatially-decaying perturbations of mean-$a$ periodic functions converge in law to the extremal space-time stationary solution with mean $a$ as time goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Renormalization flow for the 2D nonlinear stochastic heat equation: pointwise statistics and universality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional stochastic heat equation with noise correlated at scale $\rho \ll 1$ and of strength $|\log\rho|^{-1/2}\sigma(v)$ depending nonlinearly on the solution $v$. Under certain conditions, the first author and Gu have shown that the one-point statistics of $v$ converge in law as $\rho\to 0$ to the terminal value of an associated forward-backward SDE. Here, we show that the 2D stochastic heat equation is stable under renormalization with a new effective nonlinearity tied to the decoupling function of the forward-backward SDE. This allows us to extend the pointwise results to a much broader class of nonlinearities. We also show that these limiting pointwise statistics are insensitive to the fine details of the noise, and thus universal.</description>

      <title>Formation of quiescent big bang singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hawking's singularity theorem says that cosmological solutions arising from initial data with positive mean curvature have a past singularity. However, the nature of the singularity remains unclear. We therefore ask: If the initial hypersurface has sufficiently large mean curvature, does the curvature necessarily blow up towards the singularity?
  In case the eigenvalues of the expansion-normalized Weingarten map are everywhere distinct and satisfy a certain algebraic condition (which in 3+1 dimensions is equivalent to them being positive), we prove that this is the case in the CMC Einstein-non-linear scalar field setting. More specifically, we associate a set of geometric expansion-normalized quantities to any initial data set with positive mean curvature. These quantities are expected to converge, in the quiescent setting, in the direction of crushing big bang singularities. Our main result says that if the mean curvature is large enough, relative to an appropriate Sobolev norm of these geometric quantities, and if the algebraic condition is satisfied, then a quiescent (as opposed to oscillatory) big bang singularity with curvature blow-up forms. This provides a stable regime of big bang formation without requiring proximity to any particular class of background solutions.
  An important recent result by Fournodavlos, Rodnianski and Speck demonstrates stable big bang formation for all the spatially flat and spatially homogeneous solutions to the Einstein-scalar field equations satisfying the algebraic condition. Here we obtain analogous stability results for any solution inducing data at the singularity, in the sense introduced by the third author, in particular generalizing the aforementioned result. Moreover, we are able to prove both future and past global non-linear stability of a large class of spatially locally homogeneous solutions.</description>

      <title>Spatial exponential decay of perturbations in optimal control of general evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the robustness of optimally controlled evolution equations with respect to spatially localized perturbations. We prove that if the involved operators are domain-uniformly stabilizable and detectable, then these localized perturbations only have a local effect on the optimal solution. We characterize this domain-uniform stabilizability and detectability for the transport equation with constant transport velocity, showing that even for unitary semigroups, optimality implies exponential damping. We extend this result to the case of a space-dependent transport velocity. Finally we leverage the results for the transport equation to characterize domain-uniform stabilizability of the wave equation. Numerical examples in one space dimension complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>$C^1$ invariant, stable and inertial manifolds for non-autonomous dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the version of the Lyapunov--Perron method operating on individual solutions to investigate the existence of invariant manifolds for non-autonomous dynamical systems, focusing in particular on inertial and stable manifolds. We establish a characterization of both types of manifolds in terms of solutions exhibiting a common growth behavior, analogous to the classical characterization involving hyperbolicity. Furthermore, we introduce a unified formulation of the gap condition, from which known sharp versions are derived. Finally, we show that the constructed inertial manifolds have $C^1$ regularity.</description>
