      <title>Greedy selection of optimal location of sensors for uncertainty reduction in seismic moment tensor inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address an optimal sensor placement problem through Bayesian experimental design for seismic full waveform inversion for the recovery of the associated moment tensor. The objective is that of optimally choosing the location of the sensors (stations) from which to collect the observed data. The Shannon expected information gain is used as the objective function to search for the optimal network of sensors. A closed form for such objective is available due to the linear structure of the forward problem, as well as the Gaussian modeling of the observational errors and prior distribution. The resulting problem being inherently combinatorial, a greedy algorithm is deployed to sequentially select the sensor locations that form the best network for learning the moment tensor. Numerical results are presented and analyzed under several instances of the problem, including: use of full three-dimensional velocity-models, cases in which the earthquake-source location is unknown, as well as moment tensor inversion under model misspecification</description>

      <title>Soft-constrained Schrodinger Bridge: a Stochastic Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger bridge can be viewed as a continuous-time stochastic control problem where the goal is to find an optimally controlled diffusion process with a pre-specified terminal distribution $\mu_T$. We propose to generalize this stochastic control problem by allowing the terminal distribution to differ from $\mu_T$ but penalizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two distributions. We call this new control problem soft-constrained Schr\"{o}dinger bridge (SSB). The main contribution of this work is a theoretical derivation of the solution to SSB, which shows that the terminal distribution of the optimally controlled process is a geometric mixture of $\mu_T$ and some other distribution. This result is further extended to a time series setting. One application of SSB is the development of robust generative diffusion models. We propose a score matching-based algorithm for sampling from geometric mixtures and showcase its use via a numerical example for the MNIST data set.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for particle gradient descent, and extensions of the log-Sobolev and Talagrand inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove non-asymptotic error bounds for particle gradient descent (PGD)~(Kuntz et al., 2023), a recently introduced algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of large latent variable models obtained by discretizing a gradient flow of the free energy. We begin by showing that, for models satisfying a condition generalizing both the log-Sobolev and the Polyak--{\L}ojasiewicz inequalities (LSI and P{\L}I, respectively), the flow converges exponentially fast to the set of minimizers of the free energy. We achieve this by extending a result well-known in the optimal transport literature (that the LSI implies the Talagrand inequality) and its counterpart in the optimization literature (that the P{\L}I implies the so-called quadratic growth condition), and applying it to our new setting. We also generalize the Bakry--\'Emery Theorem and show that the LSI/P{\L}I generalization holds for models with strongly concave log-likelihoods. For such models, we further control PGD's discretization error, obtaining non-asymptotic error bounds. While we are motivated by the study of PGD, we believe that the inequalities and results we extend may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A connection between Tempering and Entropic Mirror Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the connections between tempering (for Sequential Monte Carlo; SMC) and entropic mirror descent to sample from a target probability distribution whose unnormalized density is known. We establish that tempering SMC corresponds to entropic mirror descent applied to the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and obtain convergence rates for the tempering iterates. Our result motivates the tempering iterates from an optimization point of view, showing that tempering can be seen as a descent scheme of the KL divergence with respect to the Fisher-Rao geometry, in contrast to Langevin dynamics that perform descent of the KL with respect to the Wasserstein-2 geometry. We exploit the connection between tempering and mirror descent iterates to justify common practices in SMC and derive adaptive tempering rules that improve over other alternative benchmarks in the literature.</description>

      <title>Empirical sandwich variance estimator for iterated conditional expectation g-computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Iterated conditional expectation (ICE) g-computation is an estimation approach for addressing time-varying confounding for both longitudinal and time-to-event data. Unlike other g-computation implementations, ICE avoids the need to specify models for each time-varying covariate. For variance estimation, previous work has suggested the bootstrap. However, bootstrapping can be computationally intense and sensitive to the number of resamples used. Here, we present ICE g-computation as a set of stacked estimating equations. Therefore, the variance for the ICE g-computation estimator can be consistently estimated using the empirical sandwich variance estimator. Performance of the variance estimator was evaluated empirically with a simulation study. The proposed approach is also demonstrated with an illustrative example on the effect of cigarette smoking on the prevalence of hypertension. In the simulation study, the empirical sandwich variance estimator appropriately estimated the variance. When comparing runtimes between the sandwich variance estimator and the bootstrap for the applied example, the sandwich estimator was substantially faster, even when bootstraps were run in parallel. The empirical sandwich variance estimator is a viable option for variance estimation with ICE g-computation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive operator learning for infinite-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental computational issues in Bayesian inverse problems (BIP) governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) stem from the requirement of repeated forward model evaluations. A popular strategy to reduce such costs is to replace expensive model simulations with computationally efficient approximations using operator learning, motivated by recent progress in deep learning. However, using the approximated model directly may introduce a modeling error, exacerbating the already ill-posedness of inverse problems. Thus, balancing between accuracy and efficiency is essential for the effective implementation of such approaches. To this end, we develop an adaptive operator learning framework that can reduce modeling error gradually by forcing the surrogate to be accurate in local areas. This is accomplished by adaptively fine-tuning the pre-trained approximate model with train- ing points chosen by a greedy algorithm during the posterior computational process. To validate our approach, we use DeepOnet to construct the surrogate and unscented Kalman inversion (UKI) to approximate the BIP solution, respectively. Furthermore, we present a rigorous convergence guarantee in the linear case using the UKI framework. The approach is tested on a number of benchmarks, including the Darcy flow, the heat source inversion problem, and the reaction-diffusion problem. The numerical results show that our method can significantly reduce computational costs while maintaining inversion accuracy.</description>
