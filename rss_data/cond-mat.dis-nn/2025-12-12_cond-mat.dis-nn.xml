      <title>Stability of the symmetry-protected topological phase and Ising transitions in a disordered U(1) quantum link model on a ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the U(1) quantum link model in a ladder geometry, finding, by finite-size scaling, that the critical exponent $\nu=1$ and the central charge $c=1/2$ are consistent with the Ising universality class for all phase transitions observed. A blind application of the Harris criterion would suggest that this criticality is lost in the presence of the disorder. It turns out not to be the case. For the disorder affecting ladder's rung hoppings only, we have found that the transitions survive disappearing only for quite strong disorder. The disorder in the ladder's legs destroys the nonzero mass phase criticality, while the symmetry-protected topological phase for zero mass survives a small disorder. The observed robustness against disorder is explained qualitatively using field-theoretic arguments.</description>

      <title>Deep Thermalization and Measurements of Quantum Resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a unified framework for characterizing useful quantum phenomena subject to physical constraints, but are notoriously hard to assess in experimental systems. In this letter, we introduce a unified protocol for quantifying the resource-generating power (RGP) of arbitrary quantum evolutions applicable to multiple QRTs. It is based on deep thermalization (DT), which has recently gained attention for its role in the emergence of quantum state designs from partial projective measurements. Central to our approach is the use of projected ensembles, recently employed to probe DT, together with new twirling identities that allow us to directly infer the RGP of the underlying dynamics. These identities further reveal how resources build up and thermalize in generic quantum circuits. Finally, we show that quantum resources themselves undergo deep thermalization at the subsystem level, offering a complementary and another experimentally accessible route to infer the RGP. Our work connects deep thermalization to resource quantification, offering a new perspective on the essential role of various resources in generating state designs.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of the phase competition, mechanical and piezoelectric properties of pseudo-binary (SiC)(AlN) alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ongoing search for new piezoelectric materials offering adequate balance between piezoelectric response and other application-relevant properties has lead to the investigation of various alloy systems. In this work we study the alloy of the widely used AlN with SiC for their relative abundance, current use in other electronics applications and expected phase competition between wurtzite and other polymorphs, the kind of which has lead to some of the most interesting results notably between AlN and ScN. Here the pseudo-binary (SiC)(AlN) alloy is studied from first-principles over the entire composition range. Relevant crystalline phases are identified using the First-Principles Random Structure Sampling approach which, in accordance with previous bulk experiments, finds wurtzite, zincblende and rhombohedral phases to be the only statistically relevant phases of the alloy. Further study of these phases is done through Special Quasi-random Structures (SQS) and, in the case of the wurtzite phase, predictions of the stiffness, piezoelectric and dielectric tensors. Analysis of these tensors is done through the scope of a Bulk AcousticWave (BAW) filter application, where trends and trade-offs between the c-axis acoustic velocity and piezoelectric response enable identification of relevant compositions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum-classical matrix-product state and Lanczos methods for electron-phonon systems with strong electronic correlations: Application to disordered systems coupled to Einstein phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two quantum-classical hybrid methods for simulating the time-dependence of electron-phonon systems that treat electronic correlations numerically exactly and optical-phonon degrees of freedom classically. These are a time-dependent Lanczos and a matrix-product state method, each combined with the multi-trajectory Ehrenfest approach. Due to the approximations, reliable results are expected for the adiabatic regime of small phonon frequencies. We discuss the convergence properties of both methods for a system of interacting spinless fermions in one dimension and provide a benchmark for the Holstein chain. As a first application, we study the decay of charge density wave order in a system of interacting spinless fermions coupled to Einstein oscillators and in the presence of quenched disorder. We investigate the dependence of the relaxation dynamics on the electron-phonon coupling strength and provide numerical evidence that the coupling of strongly disordered systems to classical oscillators leads to delocalization, thus destabilizing the (finite-size) many-body localization in this system.</description>

      <title>Shaping chaos in bilayer graphene cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilayer graphene (BLG) cavities, where electrons are confined in finite graphene flakes, provide a suitable platform to study quantum chaotic phenomena in condensed matter systems due to the trigonal warping of the Fermi surface. Here, we investigate the effect of the misalignment between the BLG lattice and the cavity geometry, introduced by rotating the boundary relative to the lattice, which can drive the system towards chaos. Based on a tight-binding model, eigenenergy level statistics reveals that rotation leads to level repulsion following Wigner-Dyson statistics, while corresponding eigenstate analysis indicates a transition from near-integrability to spatially uncorrelated random waves. Analysis of the semiclassical ray-dynamics with the trigonal-warped dispersion unveils an ergodic phase space structure, providing a quantum-classical correspondence of the onset of chaos. These findings establish an avenue to quantum chaotic phenomena in BLG cavities with potential applications in quantum device engineering.</description>

      <title>Numerical renormalization of glassy dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quench dynamics of glassy systems are challenging. Due to aging, the system never reaches a stationary state but instead evolves on emergent scales that grow with its age. This slow evolution complicates field-theoretic descriptions, as the weak long-term memory and the absence of a stationary state hinder simplifications of the memory, always leading to the worst-case scaling of computational effort with the cubic power of the simulated time. Here, we present an algorithm based on two-dimensional interpolations of Green's functions, which resolves this issue and achieves sublinear scaling of computational cost. We apply it to the quench dynamics of the spherical mixed $p$-spin model to establish the existence of a phase transition between glasses with strong and weak ergodicity breaking at a finite temperature of the initial state. By reaching times three orders of magnitude larger than previously attainable, we determine the critical exponents of this transition. Interestingly, these are continuously varying and, therefore, non-universal. While we introduce and validate the method in the context of a glassy system, it is equally applicable to any model with overdamped excitations.</description>

      <title>Susceptibility for extremely low external fluctuations and critical behaviour of Greenberg-Hastings neuronal model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the scaling behaviour of the fluctuation susceptibility associated with the average activation in the Greenberg-Hastings neural network model and its relation to microscopic spontaneous activation. We found that, as the spontaneous activation probability tends to zero, a clear finite size scaling behaviour in the susceptibility emerges, characterized by critical exponents which follow already known scaling laws. This shows that the spontaneous activation probability plays the role of an external field conjugated to the order parameter of the dynamical activation transition. The roles of different kinds of activation mechanisms around the different dynamical phase transitions exhibited by the model are characterized numerically and using a mean field approximation.</description>

      <title>Universal Critical Scaling and Phase Diagram of the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect under Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard scaling theory dictates that disorder leads to immediate localization in one-dimensional Hermitian systems. We demonstrate that non-Hermitian topology fundamentally alters this paradigm, protecting transport up to a substantial critical disorder strength. By employing a numerically stable log-space transfer matrix approach up to thermodynamic scales (N=1000), we identify a sharp phase transition from the topological skin phase to the Anderson localized phase. Finite-size scaling analysis reveals that this transition belongs to a unique universality class with critical exponents \nu\approx1.50 and \beta\approx0.65. Furthermore, we map the global phase diagram, confirming that the critical disorder scales as W_c\propto\sqrt\gamma, consistent with localization suppression by an imaginary vector potential. Our results establish the rigorous limits of non-Hermitian topological protection in imperfect media.</description>

      <title>Towards probing velocity distributions in dense granular matter: Utilizing Fiber Bragg Gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Granular gases are commonly characterized through their velocity distribution, which provides access to the granular temperature. In experiments, velocity distributions are typically obtained by particle tracking, which however becomes limited at moderate and high particle densities. As a way forward, we propose a new technique for measuring particle velocities in situ by using a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor, which remains applicable at significantly higher particle densities.The FBG sensor detects strain pulses induced by particle-fiber collisions, from which the velocity of the impacting particle can be derived. Applying this method to an ensemble of granular particles allows to extract its velocity distributions as we present for a granular system excited by a vibrational shaker. We validate the extracted velocity distribution against conventional particle-tracking measurements, confirming the reliability of the FBG-based technique.</description>

      <title>State-space kinetic Ising model reveals task-dependent entropy flow in sparsely active nonequilibrium neuronal dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15440v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuronal ensemble activity, including coordinated and oscillatory patterns, exhibits hallmarks of nonequilibrium systems with time-asymmetric trajectories to maintain their organization. However, assessing time asymmetry from neuronal spiking activity remains challenging. The kinetic Ising model provides a framework for studying the causal, nonequilibrium dynamics in spiking recurrent neural networks. Recent theoretical advances in this model have enabled time-asymmetry estimation from large-scale steady-state data. Yet, neuronal activity often exhibits time-varying firing rates and coupling strengths, violating the steady-state assumption. To overcome this limitation, we developed a state-space kinetic Ising model that accounts for nonstationary and nonequilibrium properties of neural systems. This approach incorporates a mean-field method for estimating time-varying entropy flow, a key measure for maintaining the system's organization through dissipation. Applying this method to mouse visual cortex data revealed greater variability in causal couplings during task engagement despite reduced neuronal activity with increased sparsity. Moreover, higher-performing mice exhibited increased coupling-related entropy flow per spike during task engagement, suggesting more efficient computation in the higher-performing mice. These findings underscore the model's utility in uncovering intricate asymmetric causal dynamics in neuronal ensembles and linking them to behavior through the thermodynamic underpinnings of neural computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, also known as ``magic'', quantifies the deviation of quantum states from stabilizer states, capturing the complexity necessary for quantum computational advantage. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of nonstabilizerness in disordered many-body localized (MBL) systems using the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). Leveraging a phenomenological description based on the $\ell$-bit model, we analytically and numerically demonstrate that interactions profoundly influence nonstabilizerness spreading, inducing a power-law growth of SRE that markedly contrasts with the rapid saturation observed in ergodic systems. We validate our theoretical predictions through numerical simulations of the disordered transverse-field Ising model, showing excellent agreement across various disorder strengths, system sizes, and initial states. Additionally, we uncover a universal relationship between SRE and entanglement entropy, revealing their common scaling in the MBL regime independent of disorder strength and system size. Our results offer critical insights into the interplay of disorder, interactions, and complexity in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Proof of a perfect platonic representation hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we elaborate on and explain in detail the proof given by Ziyin et al. (2025) of the ``perfect" Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) for the embedded deep linear network model (EDLN). We show that if trained with the stochastic gradient descent (SGD), two EDLNs with different widths and depths and trained on different data will become Perfectly Platonic, meaning that every possible pair of layers will learn the same representation up to a rotation. Because most of the global minima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly Platonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six ways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence of the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of progressive sharpening. This implies that these two seemingly unrelated phenomena in deep learning can, surprisingly, have a common cause. Overall, the theory and proof highlight the importance of understanding emergent "entropic forces" due to the irreversibility of SGD training and their role in representation learning. The goal of this note is to be instructive while avoiding jargon and lengthy technical details.</description>

      <title>Epidemic threshold and localization of the SIS model on directed complex networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on directed complex networks within the quenched mean-field approximation. Combining results from random matrix theory with an analytic approach to the distribution of fixed-point infection probabilities, we derive the phase diagram and show that the model exhibits a nonequilibrium phase transition between the absorbing and endemic phases for $c \geq \lambda^{-1}$, where $c$ is the mean degree and $\lambda$ the average infection rate. Interestingly, the critical line is independent of the degree distribution but is highly sensitive to the form of the infection-rate distribution. We further show that the inverse participation ratio of infection probabilities diverges near the epidemic threshold, indicating that the disease may become localized on a small fraction of nodes. These results provide a systematic characterization of how network heterogeneities shape epidemic spreading on directed contact networks within the quenched mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>Robust Universality of Non-Hermitian Anderson Transitions: From Dyson Singularity to Model-Independent Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the universality of Anderson localization transitions in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems exhibiting the skin effect. By developing a numerically stable Log-Space Non-Hermitian Scaling (LNS) method, we overcome the severe floating-point overflow issues associated with the exponential growth of transmittance (T ~ exp(2 gamma L)), enabling precision finite-size scaling analysis up to system sizes of L = 1200. We probe the critical behavior across three distinct disorder landscapes: uniform diagonal, binary diagonal, and off-diagonal (random hopping) disorder. While the uniform model exhibits a standard mobility edge, the off-diagonal model reveals a Dyson-like singularity at the band center (E = 0), where the system resists localization even at strong disorder due to sublattice symmetry protection. However, upon symmetry breaking (E != 0), we demonstrate that all considered models, regardless of the disorder distribution (continuous vs. discrete) or Hamiltonian structure (site vs. bond randomness), belong to the same robust universality class. The critical exponents are determined as nu = 1.50 +/- 0.00 and beta ~ 0.65 through unambiguous data collapse, establishing a model-independent description of non-Hermitian localization transitions.</description>

Abstract: Biological neural networks learn complex behaviors from sparse, delayed feedback using local synaptic plasticity, yet the mechanisms enabling structured credit assignment remain elusive. In contrast, artificial recurrent networks solving similar tasks typically rely on biologically implausible global learning rules or hand-crafted local updates. The space of local plasticity rules capable of supporting learning from delayed reinforcement remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a meta-learning framework that discovers local learning rules for structured credit assignment in recurrent networks trained with sparse feedback. Our approach interleaves local neo-Hebbian-like updates during task execution with an outer loop that optimizes plasticity parameters via \textbf{tangent-propagation through learning}. The resulting three-factor learning rules enable long-timescale credit assignment using only local information and delayed rewards, offering new insights into biologically grounded mechanisms for learning in recurrent circuits.</description>
