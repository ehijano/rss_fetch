      <title>StarBASE-GP: Biologically-Guided Automated Machine Learning for Genotype-to-Phenotype Association Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Star-Based Automated Single-locus and Epistasis analysis tool - Genetic Programming (StarBASE-GP), an automated framework for discovering meaningful genetic variants associated with phenotypic variation in large-scale genomic datasets. StarBASE-GP uses a genetic programming-based multi-objective optimization strategy to evolve machine learning pipelines that simultaneously maximize explanatory power (r2) and minimize pipeline complexity. Biological domain knowledge is integrated at multiple stages, including the use of nine inheritance encoding strategies to model deviations from additivity, a custom linkage disequilibrium pruning node that minimizes redundancy among features, and a dynamic variant recommendation system that prioritizes informative candidates for pipeline inclusion. We evaluate StarBASE-GP on a cohort of Rattus norvegicus (brown rat) to identify variants associated with body mass index, benchmarking its performance against a random baseline and a biologically naive version of the tool. StarBASE-GP consistently evolves Pareto fronts with superior performance, yielding higher accuracy in identifying both ground truth and novel quantitative trait loci, highlighting relevant targets for future validation. By incorporating evolutionary search and relevant biological theory into a flexible automated machine learning framework, StarBASE-GP demonstrates robust potential for advancing variant discovery in complex traits.</description>

      <title>Self-orthogonalizing attractor neural networks emerging from the free energy principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attractor dynamics are a hallmark of many complex systems, including the brain. Understanding how such self-organizing dynamics emerge from first principles is crucial for advancing our understanding of neuronal computations and the design of artificial intelligence systems. Here we formalize how attractor networks emerge from the free energy principle applied to a universal partitioning of random dynamical systems. Our approach obviates the need for explicitly imposed learning and inference rules and identifies emergent, but efficient and biologically plausible inference and learning dynamics for such self-organizing systems. These result in a collective, multi-level Bayesian active inference process. Attractors on the free energy landscape encode prior beliefs; inference integrates sensory data into posterior beliefs; and learning fine-tunes couplings to minimize long-term surprise. Analytically and via simulations, we establish that the proposed networks favor approximately orthogonalized attractor representations, a consequence of simultaneously optimizing predictive accuracy and model complexity. These attractors efficiently span the input subspace, enhancing generalization and the mutual information between hidden causes and observable effects. Furthermore, while random data presentation leads to symmetric and sparse couplings, sequential data fosters asymmetric couplings and non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics, offering a natural extension to conventional Boltzmann Machines. Our findings offer a unifying theory of self-organizing attractor networks, providing novel insights for AI and neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Walking the Weight Manifold: a Topological Approach to Conditioning Inspired by Neuromodulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One frequently wishes to learn a range of similar tasks as efficiently as possible, re-using knowledge across tasks. In artificial neural networks, this is typically accomplished by conditioning a network upon task context by injecting context as input. Brains have a different strategy: the parameters themselves are modulated as a function of various neuromodulators such as serotonin. Here, we take inspiration from neuromodulation and propose to learn weights which are smoothly parameterized functions of task context variables. Rather than optimize a weight vector, i.e. a single point in weight space, we optimize a smooth manifold in weight space with a predefined topology. To accomplish this, we derive a formal treatment of optimization of manifolds as the minimization of a loss functional subject to a constraint on volumetric movement, analogous to gradient descent. During inference, conditioning selects a single point on this manifold which serves as the effective weight matrix for a particular sub-task. This strategy for conditioning has two main advantages. First, the topology of the manifold (whether a line, circle, or torus) is a convenient lever for inductive biases about the relationship between tasks. Second, learning in one state smoothly affects the entire manifold, encouraging generalization across states. To verify this, we train manifolds with several topologies, including straight lines in weight space (for conditioning on e.g. noise level in input data) and ellipses (for rotated images). Despite their simplicity, these parameterizations outperform conditioning identical networks by input concatenation and better generalize to out-of-distribution samples. These results suggest that modulating weights over low-dimensional manifolds offers a principled and effective alternative to traditional conditioning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of Genetic Fuzzy Systems (GFS) to model the self-noise generated by airfoils, a key issue in aeroaccoustics with significant implications for aerospace, automotive and drone applications. Using the publicly available Airfoil Self Noise dataset, various Fuzzy regression strategies are explored and compared. The paper evaluates a brute force Takagi Sugeno Kang (TSK) fuzzy system with high rule density, a cascading Geneti Fuzzy Tree (GFT) architecture and a novel clustered approach based on Fuzzy C-means (FCM) to reduce the model's complexity. This highlights the viability of clustering assisted fuzzy inference as an effective regression tool for complex aero accoustic phenomena. Keywords : Fuzzy logic, Regression, Cascading systems, Clustering and AI.</description>

      <title>Measuring and Controlling Solution Degeneracy across Task-Trained Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Task-trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used in neuroscience and machine learning to model dynamical computations. To gain mechanistic insight into how neural systems solve tasks, prior work often reverse-engineers individual trained networks. However, different RNNs trained on the same task and achieving similar performance can exhibit strikingly different internal solutions-a phenomenon known as solution degeneracy. Here, we develop a unified framework to systematically quantify and control solution degeneracy across three levels: behavior, neural dynamics, and weight space. We apply this framework to 3,400 RNNs trained on four neuroscience-relevant tasks-flip-flop memory, sine wave generation, delayed discrimination, and path integration-while systematically varying task complexity, learning regime, network size, and regularization. We find that higher task complexity and stronger feature learning reduce degeneracy in neural dynamics but increase it in weight space, with mixed effects on behavior. In contrast, larger networks and structural regularization reduce degeneracy at all three levels. These findings empirically validate the Contravariance Principle and provide practical guidance for researchers aiming to tailor RNN solutions-whether to uncover shared neural mechanisms or to model individual variability observed in biological systems. This work provides a principled framework for quantifying and controlling solution degeneracy in task-trained RNNs, offering new tools for building more interpretable and biologically grounded models of neural computation.</description>

      <title>Position: Scaling LLM Agents Requires Asymptotic Analysis with LLM Primitives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decomposing hard problems into subproblems often makes them easier and more efficient to solve. With large language models (LLMs) crossing critical reliability thresholds for a growing slate of capabilities, there is an increasing effort to decompose systems into sets of LLM-based agents, each of whom can be delegated sub-tasks. However, this decomposition (even when automated) is often intuitive, e.g., based on how a human might assign roles to members of a human team. How close are these role decompositions to optimal? This position paper argues that asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives is needed to reason about the efficiency of such decomposed systems, and that insights from such analysis will unlock opportunities for scaling them. By treating the LLM forward pass as the atomic unit of computational cost, one can separate out the (often opaque) inner workings of a particular LLM from the inherent efficiency of how a set of LLMs are orchestrated to solve hard problems. In other words, if we want to scale the deployment of LLMs to the limit, instead of anthropomorphizing LLMs, asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives should be used to reason about and develop more powerful decompositions of large problems into LLM agents.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of ReLU Networks through the ReLU Transition Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel theoretical framework for analyzing ReLU neural networks through the lens of a combinatorial object we term the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG). In this graph, each node corresponds to a linear region induced by the network's activation patterns, and edges connect regions that differ by a single neuron flip. Building on this structure, we derive a suite of new theoretical results connecting RTG geometry to expressivity, generalization, and robustness. Our contributions include tight combinatorial bounds on RTG size and diameter, a proof of RTG connectivity, and graph-theoretic interpretations of VC-dimension. We also relate entropy and average degree of the RTG to generalization error. Each theoretical result is rigorously validated via carefully controlled experiments across varied network depths, widths, and data regimes. This work provides the first unified treatment of ReLU network structure via graph theory and opens new avenues for compression, regularization, and complexity control rooted in RTG analysis.</description>

      <title>Scaling Up Liquid-Resistance Liquid-Capacitance Networks for Efficient Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present LrcSSM, a $\textit{nonlinear}$ recurrent model that processes long sequences as fast as today's linear state-space layers. By forcing the state-transition matrix to be diagonal and learned at every step, the full sequence can be solved in parallel with a single prefix-scan, giving $\mathcal{O}(TD)$ time and memory and only $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ sequential depth, for input-sequence length $T$ and a state dimension $D$. Moreover, LrcSSM offers a formal gradient-stability guarantee that other input-varying systems such as Liquid-S4 and Mamba do not provide. Lastly, for network depth $L$, as the forward and backward passes cost $\Theta(T\,D\,L)$ FLOPs, with its low sequential depth and parameter count $\Theta(D\,L)$, the model follows the compute-optimal scaling law regime ($\beta \approx 0.42$) recently observed for Mamba, outperforming quadratic-attention Transformers at equal compute while avoiding the memory overhead of FFT-based long convolutions. We show that on a series of long-range forecasting tasks, LrcSSM outperforms LRU, S5 and Mamba.</description>
