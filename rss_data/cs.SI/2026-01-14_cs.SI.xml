      <title>Ideological Isolation in Online Social Networks: A Survey of Computational Definitions, Metrics, and Mitigation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of online social networks has significantly reshaped the way individuals access and engage with information. While these platforms offer unprecedented connectivity, they may foster environments where users are increasingly exposed to homogeneous content and like-minded interactions. Such dynamics are associated with selective exposure and the emergence of filter bubbles, echo chambers, tunnel vision, and polarization, which together can contribute to ideological isolation and raise concerns about information diversity and public discourse. This survey provides a comprehensive computational review of existing studies that define, analyze, quantify, and mitigate ideological isolation in online social networks. We examine the mechanisms underlying content personalization, user behavior patterns, and network structures that reinforce content-exposure concentration and narrowing dynamics. This paper also systematically reviews methodological approaches for detecting and measuring these isolation-related phenomena, covering network-, content-, and behavior-based metrics. We further organize computational mitigation strategies, including network-topological interventions and recommendation-level controls, and discuss their trade-offs and deployment considerations. By integrating definitions, metrics, and interventions across structural/topological, content-based, interactional, and cognitive isolation, this survey provides a unified computational framework. It serves as a reference for understanding and addressing the key challenges and opportunities in promoting information diversity and reducing ideological fragmentation in the digital age.</description>

      <title>Efficient Maintenance of Leiden Communities in Large Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a well-known community detection algorithm, Leiden has been widely used in various scenarios such as large language model generation (e.g., Graph-RAG), anomaly detection, and biological analysis. In these scenarios, the graphs are often large and dynamic, where vertices and edges are inserted and deleted frequently, so it is costly to obtain the updated communities by Leiden from scratch when the graph has changed. Recently, one work has attempted to study how to maintain Leiden communities in the dynamic graph, but it lacks a detailed theoretical analysis, and its algorithms are inefficient for large graphs. To address these issues, in this paper, we first theoretically show that the existing algorithms are relatively unbounded via the boundedness analysis (a powerful tool for analyzing incremental algorithms on dynamic graphs), and also analyze the memberships of vertices in communities when the graph changes. Based on theoretical analysis, we develop a novel efficient maintenance algorithm, called Hierarchical Incremental Tree Leiden (HIT-Leiden), which effectively reduces the range of affected vertices by maintaining the connected components and hierarchical community structures. Comprehensive experiments in various datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HIT-Leiden. In particular, it achieves speedups of up to five orders of magnitude over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In heterogeneous graphs, we can observe complex structures such as tree-like or hierarchical structures. Recently, the hyperbolic space has been widely adopted in many studies to effectively learn these complex structures. Although these methods have demonstrated the advantages of the hyperbolic space in learning heterogeneous graphs, most existing methods still have several challenges. They rely heavily on tangent-space operations, which often lead to mapping distortions during frequent transitions. Moreover, their message-passing architectures mainly focus on local neighborhood information, making it difficult to capture global hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies between different types of nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HypHGT), which effectively and efficiently learns heterogeneous graph representations entirely within the hyperbolic space. Unlike previous message-passing based hyperbolic heterogeneous GNNs, HypHGT naturally captures both local and global dependencies through transformer-based architecture. Furthermore, the proposed relation-specific hyperbolic attention mechanism in HypHGT, which operates with linear time complexity, enables efficient computation while preserving the heterogeneous information across different relation types. This design allows HypHGT to effectively capture the complex structural properties and semantic information inherent in heterogeneous graphs. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of HypHGT, and the results demonstrate that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification task, with significantly reduced training time and memory usage.</description>

      <title>Bipartite structure and dynamics of political corruption networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Political corruption is inherently an affiliation process linking agents to corruption cases; yet it is often studied via one-mode projections that connect co-offenders within the same scandal, implying a loss of information that potentially confounds properties of agents and cases. Here, we adopt a bipartite representation to analyze datasets of corruption scandals in Brazil and Spain spanning nearly three decades. By tracking the temporal growth of these networks, we quantify density and redundancy measures to capture partner reuse and co-occurrence across cases. Networks in both countries become progressively sparser over time, and agent redundancy is systematically higher than case redundancy, indicating a small cadre of recidivists who recombine largely with novice partners rather than forming durable co-offending ties. These networks exhibit near-exponential degree distributions, reflecting low recidivism and likely high coordination costs and secrecy constraints of large-scale scandals. Our bipartite view further reveals a moderate cross-mode disassortative degree mixing between agents and cases, with high-degree agents distributing their activity across small cases and large scandals mainly comprising low-degree participants. Finally, identifying atypical individuals within the bipartite structure reveals criminal trajectories marked by a gradual rise in network embeddedness that can appear ordinary in agent-projected networks.</description>

      <title>An Extensive Study of Two-Node McCulloch-Pitts Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networks with two nodes are previously grouped into either two classes (mutually interactive, master-slave) or five classes (mutualism, competition, predator-prey, commensalism, amensalism). By allowing self-loops, the number of signed regulatory graphs increases to 39. We provide a complete summary of dynamical behaviors of the 39 two-node McCulloch-Pitts models when the link weights are constrained to three values [$-1$,0,$+1$] and Boolean node variables. Depending on whether the Boolean values are [$-1,1$] (bipolar) or [0,1] (binary), we show that the dynamics could also be different with the same signed regulatory graphs. We demonstrate that slight variations in the McCulloch-Pitts model (called variants) may lead to fundamentally different dynamics. We study the full model space and three kinds of robustness or stability: a) of a rule against parameter change on its overall dynamics, b) for a given state against parameter change on its final state, and c) against an initial state change on its final state. All these stability properties are loosely related to a model's limiting dynamics, with the fixed-point rules to be more stable in the first two types of robustness, but less stable in the third robustness type. These analyses pave the way towards a better understanding of a minimum complex system.</description>

      <title>Structural asymmetry as a fraud signature: detecting collusion with Heron's Information Coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fraud in public procurement remains a persistent challenge, especially in large, decentralized systems like Brazil's Unified Health System. We introduce Heron's Information Coefficient (HIC), a geometric measure that quantifies how subgraphs deviate from the global structure of a network. Applied to over eight years of Brazilian bidding data for medical supplies, this measure highlights collusive patterns that standard indicators may overlook. Unlike conventional robustness metrics, the Heron coefficient focuses on the interaction between active and inactive subgraphs, revealing structural shifts that may signal coordinated behavior, such as cartel formation. Synthetic experiments support these findings, demonstrating strong detection performance across varying corruption intensities and network sizes. While our results do not replace legal or economic analyses, they offer an effective complementary tool for auditors and policymakers to monitor procurement integrity more effectively. This study demonstrates that simple geometric insight can reveal hidden dynamics in real-world networks better than other Information Theoretic metrics.</description>

      <title>Human Mobility Datasets Enriched With Contextual and Social Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this resource paper, we present two publicly available datasets of semantically enriched human trajectories, together with the pipeline to build them. The trajectories are publicly available GPS traces retrieved from OpenStreetMap. Each dataset includes contextual layers such as stops, moves, points of interest (POIs), inferred transportation modes, and weather data. A novel semantic feature is the inclusion of synthetic, realistic social media posts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling multimodal and semantic mobility analysis. The datasets are available in both tabular and Resource Description Framework (RDF) formats, supporting semantic reasoning and FAIR data practices. They cover two structurally distinct, large cities: Paris and New York. Our open source reproducible pipeline allows for dataset customization, while the datasets support research tasks such as behavior modeling, mobility prediction, knowledge graph construction, and LLM-based applications. To our knowledge, our resource is the first to combine real-world movement, structured semantic enrichment, LLM-generated text, and semantic web compatibility in a reusable framework.</description>

      <title>IndRegBias: A Dataset for Studying Indian Regional Biases in English and Code-Mixed Social Media Comments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Warning: This paper consists of examples representing regional biases in Indian regions that might be offensive towards a particular region.
  While social biases corresponding to gender, race, socio-economic conditions, etc., have been extensively studied in the major applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP), biases corresponding to regions have garnered less attention. This is mainly because of (i) difficulty in the extraction of regional bias datasets, (ii) disagreements in annotation due to inherent human biases, and (iii) regional biases being studied in combination with other types of social biases and often being under-represented. This paper focuses on creating a dataset IndRegBias, consisting of regional biases in an Indian context reflected in users' comments on popular social media platforms, namely Reddit and YouTube. We carefully selected 25,000 comments appearing on various threads in Reddit and videos on YouTube discussing trending topics on regional issues in India. Furthermore, we propose a multilevel annotation strategy to annotate the comments describing the severity of regional biased statements. To detect the presence of regional bias and its severity in IndRegBias, we evaluate open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and Indic Language Models (ILMs) using zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning strategies. We observe that zero-shot and few-shot approaches show lower accuracy in detecting regional biases and severity in the majority of the LLMs and ILMs. However, the fine-tuning approach significantly enhances the performance of the LLM in detecting Indian regional bias along with its severity.</description>
