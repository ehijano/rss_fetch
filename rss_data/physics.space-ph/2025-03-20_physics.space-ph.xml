      <title>First observations of a geomagnetic superstorm with a sub-L1 monitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecasting the geomagnetic effects of solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is currently an unsolved problem. CMEs, responsible for the largest values of the north-south component of the interplanetary magnetic field, are the key driver of intense and extreme geomagnetic activity. Observations of southward interplanetary magnetic fields are currently only accessible directly through in situ measurements by spacecraft in the solar wind. On 10-12 May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm since 2003 took place, caused by five interacting CMEs. We clarify the relationship between the CMEs, their solar source regions, and the resulting signatures at the Sun-Earth L1 point observed by the ACE spacecraft at 1.00 AU. The STEREO-A spacecraft was situated at 0.956 AU and 12.6{\deg} west of Earth during the event, serving as a fortuitous sub-L1 monitor providing interplanetary magnetic field measurements of the solar wind. We demonstrate an extension of the prediction lead time, as the shock was observed 2.57 hours earlier at STEREO-A than at L1, consistent with the measured shock speed at L1, 710 km/s, and the radial distance of 0.04 AU. By deriving the geomagnetic indices based on the STEREO-A beacon data, we show that the strength of the geomagnetic storm would have been decently forecasted, with the modeled minimum SYM-H=-478.5 nT, underestimating the observed minimum by only 8%. Our study sets an unprecedented benchmark for future mission design using upstream monitoring for space weather prediction.</description>

      <title>How the CME on 21 April 2023 Triggered the First Severe Geomagnetic Storm of Solar Cycle 25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first severe (G4) geomagnetic storm of Solar Cycle 25 occurred on 23-24 April 2023, following the arrival of a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) on 23 April. The characteristics of this CME, measured from coronagraphs (speed and mass), did not indicate that it would trigger such an intense geomagnetic storm. In this work, our aim is to understand why this CME led to such a geoeffective outcome. Our analysis spans from the source active region to the corona and inner heliosphere through 1 au using multiwavelength, multi-viewpoint remote sensing observations and in situ data. We find that rotation and possibly deflection of the CME resulted in an axial magnetic field nearly parallel to the ecliptic plane during the Earth encounter, which might explain the storm's severity. Additionally, we find that imaging away from the Sun-Earth line is crucial in hindcasting the CME Time-of-Arrival at Earth. The position (0.39 au) and detailed images from the SoloHI telescope onboard the Solar Orbiter mission, in combination with SOHO and STEREO images, helped decisively with the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the CME.</description>
