      <title>Costly punishment sustains indirect reciprocity under low defection detectability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation is fundamental to human societies, and indirect reciprocity, where individuals cooperate to build a positive reputation for future benefits, plays a key role in promoting it. Previous theoretical and experimental studies have explored both the effectiveness and limitations of costly punishment in sustaining cooperation. While empirical observations show that costly punishment by third parties is common, some theoretical models suggest it may not be effective in the context of indirect reciprocity, raising doubts about its potential to enhance cooperation. In this study, we theoretically investigate the conditions under which costly punishment is effective. Building on a previous model, we introduce a new type of error in perceiving actions, where defection may be mistakenly perceived as cooperation. This extension models a realistic scenario where defectors have a strong incentive to disguise their defection as cooperation. Our analysis reveals that when defection is difficult to detect, norms involving costly punishment can emerge as the most efficient evolutionarily stable strategies. These findings demonstrate that costly punishment can play a crucial role in promoting cooperation within indirect reciprocity.</description>

      <title>Social Influence and Consensus Building: Introducing a q-Voter Model with Weighted Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a dynamical model of opinion formation in which an individual's opinion is influenced by interactions with a group of other agents. We introduce a bias towards one of the opinions in a manner not considered earlier to the best of our knowledge. When the bias is neutral, the model is reduced to a mean-field voter model. We analyze the behavior and steady states of the system, identifying three distinct regimes based on the bias level: one favoring negative opinions, one favoring positive opinions, and a neutral case. In large systems, the equilibrium properties become independent of the size of the group, indicating that only the bias influences the final outcome. However, for small groups, the time to reach equilibrium depends on the size of the group. Our results show that even a small initial bias leads to a consensus where all agents eventually share the same opinion when the bias is not neutral. The system exhibits universal behavior, with critical slowing down occurring near the neutral bias point, marking it as a critical dynamical threshold. The time required to reach consensus scales logarithmically when the bias is non-neutral and linearly when it is neutral. Although short-term dynamics depends on group size for small groups, long-term behavior is governed solely by the bias.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for a discrete-time SIR model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a nonstandard finite difference scheme for the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) continuous model. We prove that our discretized system is dynamically consistent with its continuous counterpart and we derive its exact solution. We end with the analysis of the long-term behavior of susceptible, infected and removed individuals, illustrating our results with examples. In contrast with the SIR discrete-time model available in the literature, our new model is simultaneously mathematically and biologically sound.</description>

      <title>Mobility-GNN: a human mobility-based graph neural network for tracking and analyzing the spatial dynamics of the synthetic opioid crisis in the USA, 2013-2020</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09945v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic opioids are the most common drugs involved in drug-involved overdose mortalities in the U.S. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2018, about 70% of all drug overdose deaths involved opioids and 67% of all opioid-involved deaths were accounted for by synthetic opioids. In this study, we investigated the spread of synthetic opioids between 2013 and 2020 in the U.S., and analyzed the relationship between the spatiotemporal pattern of synthetic opioid-involved deaths and another key opioid, heroin, and compared patterns of deaths involving these two types of drugs during this time period. Spatial connections between counties were incorporated into a graph convolutional neural network model to represent and analyze the spread of synthetic opioid-involved deaths, and in the context of heroin-involved deaths.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Equilibrium Approach to Adam Smith's Labor Theory of Value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adam Smith's inquiry into the emergence and stability of the self-organization of the division of labor in commodity production and exchange is considered using statistical equilibrium methods from statistical physics. We develop a statistical equilibrium model of the distribution of independent direct producers in a hub-and-spoke framework that predicts both the center of gravity of producers across lines of production as well as the endogenous fluctuations between lines of production that arise from Smith's concept of "perfect liberty". The ergodic distribution of producers implies a long-run balancing of "advantages to disadvantages" across lines of employment and gravitation of market prices around Smith's natural prices.</description>

      <title>Mean Residual Life Ageing Intensity Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ageing intensity function is a powerful analytical tool that provides valuable insights into the ageing process across diverse domains such as reliability engineering, actuarial science, and healthcare. Its applications continue to expand as researchers delve deeper into understanding the complex dynamics of ageing and its implications for society. One common approach to defining the ageing intensity function is through the hazard rate or failure rate function, extensively explored in scholarly literature. Equally significant to the hazard rate function is the mean residual life function, which plays a crucial role in analyzing the ageing patterns exhibited by units or components. This article introduces the mean residual life ageing intensity (MRLAI) function to delve into component ageing behaviours across various distributions. Additionally, we scrutinize the closure properties of the MRLAI function across different reliability operations. Furthermore, a new order termed the mean residual life ageing intensity order is defined to analyze the ageing behaviour of a system, and the closure property of this order under various reliability operations is discussed.</description>

      <title>Beyond Signal and Noise: Unraveling Scale Invariance in Neuroscience and Financial Networks with Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is increasingly crucial in investigating the shape of complex data structures across scientific fields, particularly in neuroscience and finance. This study delves into persistent homology, a TDA component initially aimed at differentiating between signal and noise. We explore two methodologies: the conventional cycle length approach and the novel death-birth ratio method proposed by Bobrowski and Skraba. Analyzing rs-fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project and daily $S\&amp;P 500$ financial networks, our study compares these methods in identifying significant cycles. A key discovery is a robust relationship between z-score thresholds applied to bar lengths or ratios and behavioural traits in brain networks and market volatility in financial networks. In the brain, this is evident in the strong correlation between significant 1-cycles, brain volumes, and sex-based differences. In financial markets, a fractal pattern emerges, where market volatility negatively correlates with the number of significant cycles, indicating that more complex market topologies are associated with increased stability. Our findings also imply a fractal nature of 1-cycles at both population levels and across multiple days in the stock market. The distribution of significant loops, marked by high z-scores, remains consistent across various z-score thresholds, revealing a scale-invariant, fractal structure in both data sets. Given the scale invariance in these fractal structures, the traditional TDA distinction between signal and noise becomes less meaningful. This suggests that all scales of cycle length are relevant, challenging the conventional approach of segregating signal from noise and broadening the scope of TDA to reveal intricate, scale-invariant relationships in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Competitive and Weighted Evolving Simplicial Complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simplex-based network is referred to as a higher-order network, in which describe that the interactions can include more than two nodes. Many multicomponent interactions can be grasped through simplicial complexes, which have recently found applications in social, technological, and biological contexts. The paper first proposes a competitive evolving model of higher-order networks. We introduce the difference equation analysis approach in the high-order network to make the analysis network more rigorous. It avoids the assumption that the degrees of nodes are continuous in the traditional analysis network. We obtain an analytical expression for the distribution of higher-order degrees by employing the theory of Poisson processes. The established results indicate that in a d-order network the scale-free behavior for the (d-1)-dim simplex with respect to the d-order degree is controlled by the competitiveness factor. As the competitiveness increases, the d-order degree of the (d-1)-dim simplex is bent under the logarithmic coordinates. While the e(&lt;d-1)-dim simplex with respect to the d-order degree exhibits scale-free behavior. Second, by considering the weight changes of the neighboring simplices, as triggered by the selected simplex, a new weighted evolving model in higher-order networks is proposed. The results of the competitive evolving model of higher-order networks are used to analyze the weighted evolving model so that obtained are the analytical expressions of the higher-order degree distribution and higher-order strength density function of weighted higher-order networks. The outcomes of the simulation experiments are consistent with the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>H$_2$ and CO$_2$ Network Strategies for the European Energy System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen and carbon dioxide transport can both play an essential role in climate-neutral energy systems. Hydrogen networks help serve regions with high energy demand, while excess emissions are transported away in carbon dioxide networks. For the synthesis of carbonaceous fuels, it is less clear which input should be transported: hydrogen to carbon point sources or carbon to low-cost hydrogen. We explore both networks' potential synergies and competition in a cost-optimal carbon-neutral European energy system. In a direct comparison, a hydrogen network is more cost-effective than a carbon network, as it serves to transport hydrogen to demand and to point source of carbon for utilization. However, in a hybrid scenario where both networks are present, the carbon network effectively complements the hydrogen network, promoting carbon capture from distributed biomass and reducing reliance on direct air capture. The layouts of the hydrogen and carbon dioxide networks are robust if the climate target is tightened to be net-negative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A tournament is called incentive incompatible if it allows for a situation where a team could be strictly better off by losing. This paper uncovers that the entry rules of the UEFA Champions League, the most prestigious club football competition in Europe, suffer from this shortcoming again from the 2024/25 season. Consequently, a match with misaligned incentives has been barely avoided in the 2023/24 German Bundesliga. Two straightforward solutions are recommended to safeguard the integrity of the competition. Fairness can be easily guaranteed by reversing the order of two articles in the UEFA Champions League regulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the complex nature of spatial information is crucial for problem solving in social and environmental sciences. This study investigates how the underlying patterns of spatial data can significantly influence the outcomes of spatial predictions. Recognizing unique characteristics of spatial data, such as spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity, we delve into the fundamental differences and similarities between spatial and non-geospatial prediction models. Through the analysis of six different datasets of environment and socio-economic variables, comparing geospatial models with non-geospatial models, our research highlights the pervasive nature of spatial dependence beyond geographical boundaries. This innovative approach not only recognizes spatial dependence in geographic spaces defined by latitude and longitude but also identifies its presence in non-geographic, attribute-based dimensions. Our findings reveal the pervasive influence of spatial dependence on prediction outcomes across various domains, and spatial dependence significantly influences prediction performance across all spaces. Our findings suggest that the strongest spatial dependence is typically found in geographic space for environment variables, a trend that does not uniformly apply to socio-economic variables. This investigation not only advances the theoretical framework for spatial data analysis, but also proposes new methodologies for accurately capturing and expressing spatial dependence under complex conditions. Our research extends spatial analysis to non-geographic dimensions such as social networks and gene expression patterns, emphasizing the role of spatial dependence in improving prediction accuracy, thereby supporting interdisciplinary applications across fields such as geographic information science, environmental science, economics, sociology, and bioinformatics.</description>

      <title>Triadic Temporal Exponential Random Graph Models (TTERGM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal exponential random graph models (TERGM) are powerful statistical models that can be used to infer the temporal pattern of edge formation and elimination in complex networks (e.g., social networks). TERGMs can also be used in a generative capacity to predict longitudinal time series data in these evolving graphs. However, parameter estimation within this framework fails to capture many real-world properties of social networks, including: triadic relationships, small world characteristics, and social learning theories which could be used to constrain the probabilistic estimation of dyadic covariates. Here, we propose triadic temporal exponential random graph models (TTERGM) to fill this void, which includes these hierarchical network relationships within the graph model. We represent social network learning theory as an additional probability distribution that optimizes Markov chains in the graph vector space. The new parameters are then approximated via Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation. We show that our TTERGM model achieves improved fidelity and more accurate predictions compared to several benchmark methods on GitHub network data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14668v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a statistical physics model of a neutral community, where each agent can represent identical plant species growing in the vertical direction with sunlight in the form of rich-get-richer competition. Disturbance added to this ecosystem, which makes an agent restart from the lowest growth level, is realized as a stochastic resetting. We show that in this model for sufficiently strong competition, vertical diversity characterized by a family of Hill numbers robustly emerges as a local maximum at intermediate disturbance.</description>
