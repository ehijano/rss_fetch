      <title>Impedance Trajectory Analysis during Power Swing for Grid-Forming Inverter with Different Current Limiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) are capable of emulating the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) through the careful design of the control loops. However, the current limiter in the control loops of the GFM IBR poses challenges to the effectiveness of power swing detection functions designed for SG-based systems. Among various current limiting strategies, current saturation algorithms (CSAs), widely employed for their strict current limiting capability, are the focus of this paper. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the conditions for entering and exiting the current saturation mode of the GFM IBR under three CSAs. Furthermore, the corresponding impedance trajectories observed by the distance relay on the GFM IBR side are investigated. The analysis results reveal that the unique impedance trajectories under these CSAs markedly differ from those associated with SGs. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the conventional power swing detection scheme may lose functionality due to the rapid movement of the trajectory or its failure to pass through the detection zones. Conclusions are validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink.</description>

      <title>Waste Animal Bone-derived Calcium Phosphate Particles with High Solar Reflectance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly reflective Calcium Phosphate (CAP) nanoparticles have been obtained from waste chicken and porcine bones. Chicken and pork bones have been processed and calcined at temperatures between 600{\deg}C and 1200{\deg}C to remove organic material and resulting in CAP bio-ceramic compounds with high reflectance. The reflectivity of the materials in the solar wavelength region is on par with chemically synthesized CAP. The high reflectivity, consistently over 90%, as well as the size distribution and packing density of the nanoparticles obtained in these early bone studies make a strong case for pursuing this avenue to obtain pigment for high solar reflectivity applications, such as passive daytime radiative cooling. The results presented indicate a viable path toward a cost-effective and eco-friendly source of highly reflective cooling pigments. By sourcing calcium phosphates from animal bones, there is also the potential to divert large quantities of bone waste generated by the meat industry from landfills, further contributing toward sustainability and energy reduction efforts in the construction industry and beyond.</description>

      <title>Tunable Multilayer Surface Plasmon Resonance Biosensor for Trace-Level Toxin Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on a novel multilayer surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor designed for detecting trace-level toxins in liquid samples with exceptional precision and efficiency. Leveraging the Kretschmann configuration, the proposed design integrates advanced two-dimensional materials, including black phosphorus (BP) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), to significantly enhance the performance metrics of the sensor. Key innovations include the optimization of sensitivity through precise material layering, minimization of full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) to improve signal resolution, and maximization of the figure of merit (FoM) for superior detection accuracy. Numerical simulations are employed to validate the structural and functional enhancements of the biosensor. The results demonstrate improved interaction between the evanescent field and the analyte, enabling detection at trace concentrations with higher specificity. This biosensor is poised to contribute to advancements in biochemical sensing, environmental monitoring, and other critical applications requiring high-sensitivity toxin detection.</description>

      <title>Estimating unknown dynamics and cost as a bilinear system with Koopman-based Inverse Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of approximating unknown system dynamics and costs by representing them as a bilinear system using Koopman-based Inverse Optimal Control (IOC). Using optimal trajectories, we construct a bilinear control system in transformed state variables through a modified Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (EDMDc) that maintains exact dynamical equivalence with the original nonlinear system. We derive Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) optimality conditions for this system, which closely resemble those of the inverse Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem due to the consistent control input and state independence from the control. This similarity allows us to apply modified inverse LQR theory, offering a more tractable and robust alternative to nonlinear Inverse Optimal Control methods, especially when dealing with unknown dynamics. Our approach also benefits from the extensive analytical properties of bilinear control systems, providing a solid foundation for further analysis and application. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through theoretical analysis, simulation studies and a robotic experiment, highlighting its potential for broader applications in the approximation and design of control systems.</description>

      <title>Joint Power and Spectrum Orchestration for D2D Semantic Communication Underlying Energy-Efficient Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has been recently deemed a promising next-generation wireless technique to enable efficient spectrum savings and information exchanges, thus naturally introducing a novel and practical network paradigm where cellular and device-to-device (D2D) SemCom approaches coexist. Nevertheless, the involved wireless resource management becomes complicated and challenging due to the unique semantic performance measurements and energy-consuming semantic coding mechanism. To this end, this paper jointly investigates power control and spectrum reuse problems for energy-efficient D2D SemCom cellular networks. Concretely, we first model the user preference-aware semantic triplet transmission and leverage a novel metric of semantic value to identify the semantic information importance conveyed in SemCom. Then, we define the additional power consumption from semantic encoding in conjunction with basic power amplifier dissipation to derive the overall system energy efficiency (semantics/Joule). Next, we formulate an energy efficiency maximization problem for joint power and spectrum allocation subject to several SemCom-related and practical constraints. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management solution by employing the fractional-to-subtractive problem transformation and decomposition while developing a three-stage method with theoretical analysis of its optimality guarantee and computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the adequate performance superiority of our proposed solution compared with different benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Real Time Scheduling Framework for Multi Object Detection via Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the energy constraints in autonomous mobile agents (AMAs), such as unmanned vehicles, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are increasingly favored as a more efficient alternative to traditional artificial neural networks. AMAs employ multi-object detection (MOD) from multiple cameras to identify nearby objects while ensuring two essential objectives, (R1) timing guarantee and (R2) high accuracy for safety. In this paper, we propose RT-SNN, the first system design, aiming at achieving R1 and R2 in SNN-based MOD systems on AMAs. Leveraging the characteristic that SNNs gather feature data of input image termed as membrane potential, through iterative computation over multiple timesteps, RT-SNN provides multiple execution options with adjustable timesteps and a novel method for reusing membrane potential to support R1. Then, it captures how these execution strategies influence R2 by introducing a novel notion of mean absolute error and membrane confidence. Further, RT-SNN develops a new scheduling framework consisting of offline schedulability analysis for R1 and a run-time scheduling algorithm for R2 using the notion of membrane confidence. We deployed RT-SNN to Spiking-YOLO, the SNN-based MOD model derived from ANN-to-SNN conversion, and our experimental evaluation confirms its effectiveness in meeting the R1 and R2 requirements while providing significant energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Automating Physics-Based Reasoning for SysML Model Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: System and software design benefits greatly from formal modeling, allowing for automated analysis and verification early in the design phase. Current methods excel at checking information flow and component interactions, ensuring consistency, and identifying dependencies within Systems Modeling Language (SysML) models. However, these approaches often lack the capability to perform physics-based reasoning about a system's behavior represented in SysML models, particularly in the electromechanical domain. This significant gap critically hinders the ability to automatically and effectively verify the correctness and consistency of the model's behavior against well-established underlying physical principles. Therefore, this paper presents an approach that leverages existing research on function representation, including formal languages, graphical representations, and reasoning algorithms, and integrates them with physics-based verification techniques. Four case studies (coffeemaker, vacuum cleaner, hairdryer, and wired speaker) are inspected to illustrate the model's practicality and effectiveness in performing physics-based reasoning on systems modeled in SysML. This automated physics-based reasoning is broken into two main categories: (i) structural, which is performed on BDD and IBD, and (ii) functional, which is then performed on activity diagrams. This work advances the field of automated reasoning by providing a framework for verifying structural and functional correctness and consistency with physical laws within SysML models.</description>

      <title>Low-Thrust Many-Revolution Trajectory Design Under Operational Uncertainties for DESTINY+ Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DESTINY+ is a planned JAXA medium-class Epsilon mission from Earth to deep space using a low-thrust, many-revolution orbit. Such a trajectory design is a challenging problem not only for trajectory design but also for flight operations, and in particular, it is essential to evaluate the impact of operational uncertainties to ensure mission success. In this study, we design the low-thrust trajectory from Earth orbit to a lunar transfer orbit by differential dynamic programming using the Sundman transformation. The results of Monte Carlo simulations with operational uncertainties confirm that the spacecraft can be successfully guided to the lunar transfer orbit by using the feedback control law of differential dynamic programming in the angular domain.</description>

      <title>Agricultural Industry Initiatives on Autonomy: How collaborative initiatives of VDMA and AEF can facilitate complexity in domain crossing harmonization needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The agricultural industry is undergoing a significant transformation with the increasing adoption of autonomous technologies. Addressing complex challenges related to safety and security, components and validation procedures, and liability distribution is essential to facilitate the adoption of autonomous technologies. This paper explores the collaborative groups and initiatives undertaken to address these challenges. These groups investigate inter alia three focal topics: 1) describe the functional architecture of the operational range, 2) define the work context, i.e., the realistic scenarios that emerge in various agricultural applications, and 3) the static and dynamic detection cases that need to be detected by sensor sets. Linked by the Agricultural Operational Design Domain (Agri-ODD), use case descriptions, risk analysis, and questions of liability can be handled. By providing an overview of these collaborative initiatives, this paper aims to highlight the joint development of autonomous agricultural systems that enhance the overall efficiency of farming operations.</description>

      <title>TransRAD: Retentive Vision Transformer for Enhanced Radar Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in environment perception capabilities for autonomous driving and intelligent robotics, cameras and LiDARs remain notoriously unreliable in low-light conditions and adverse weather, which limits their effectiveness. Radar serves as a reliable and low-cost sensor that can effectively complement these limitations. However, radar-based object detection has been underexplored due to the inherent weaknesses of radar data, such as low resolution, high noise, and lack of visual information. In this paper, we present TransRAD, a novel 3D radar object detection model designed to address these challenges by leveraging the Retentive Vision Transformer (RMT) to more effectively learn features from information-dense radar Range-Azimuth-Doppler (RAD) data. Our approach leverages the Retentive Manhattan Self-Attention (MaSA) mechanism provided by RMT to incorporate explicit spatial priors, thereby enabling more accurate alignment with the spatial saliency characteristics of radar targets in RAD data and achieving precise 3D radar detection across Range-Azimuth-Doppler dimensions. Furthermore, we propose Location-Aware NMS to effectively mitigate the common issue of duplicate bounding boxes in deep radar object detection. The experimental results demonstrate that TransRAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both 2D and 3D radar detection tasks, achieving higher accuracy, faster inference speed, and reduced computational complexity.

      <title>Digital Twin-Enabled Real-Time Control in Robotic Additive Manufacturing via Soft Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart manufacturing systems increasingly rely on adaptive control mechanisms to optimize complex processes. This research presents a novel approach integrating Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning with digital twin technology to enable real-time process control in robotic additive manufacturing. We demonstrate our methodology using a Viper X300s robot arm, implementing two distinct control scenarios: static target acquisition and dynamic trajectory following. The system architecture combines Unity's simulation environment with ROS2 for seamless digital twin synchronization, while leveraging transfer learning to efficiently adapt trained models across tasks. Our hierarchical reward structure addresses common reinforcement learning challenges including local minima avoidance, convergence acceleration, and training stability. Experimental results show rapid policy convergence and robust task execution in both simulated and physical environments, with performance metrics including cumulative reward, value prediction accuracy, policy loss, and discrete entropy coefficient demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. This work advances the integration of reinforcement learning with digital twins for industrial robotics applications, providing a framework for enhanced adaptive real-time control for smart additive manufacturing process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the online nonstochastic control problem of a linear time-invariant system under convex state and input constraints that need to be satisfied at all times. We propose an algorithm called Online Gradient Descent with Buffer Zone for Convex Constraints (OGD-BZC), designed to handle scenarios where the system operates within general convex safety constraints. We demonstrate that OGD-BZC, with appropriate parameter selection, satisfies all the safety constraints under bounded adversarial disturbances. Additionally, to evaluate the performance of OGD-BZC, we define the regret with respect to the best safe linear policy in hindsight. We prove that OGD-BZC achieves $\tilde{O} (\sqrt{T})$ regret given proper parameter choices. Our numerical results highlight the efficacy and robustness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>DIAL: Distribution-Informed Adaptive Learning of Multi-Task Constraints for Safety-Critical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning has traditionally relied on predefined constraint functions to ensure safety in complex real-world tasks, such as autonomous driving. However, defining these functions accurately for varied tasks is a persistent challenge. Recent research highlights the potential of leveraging pre-acquired task-agnostic knowledge to enhance both safety and sample efficiency in related tasks. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method to learn shared constraint distributions across multiple tasks. Our approach identifies the shared constraints through imitation learning and then adapts to new tasks by adjusting risk levels within these learned distributions. This adaptability addresses variations in risk sensitivity stemming from expert-specific biases, ensuring consistent adherence to general safety principles even with imperfect demonstrations. Our method can be applied to control and navigation domains, including multi-task and meta-task scenarios, accommodating constraints such as maintaining safe distances or adhering to speed limits. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating superior safety performance and success rates compared to baselines, all without requiring task-specific constraint definitions. These findings underscore the versatility and practicality of our method across a wide range of real-world tasks.</description>

      <title>Neural Operator based Reinforcement Learning for Control of first-order PDEs with Spatially-Varying State Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control of distributed parameter systems affected by delays is a challenging task, particularly when the delays depend on spatial variables. The idea of integrating analytical control theory with learning-based control within a unified control scheme is becoming increasingly promising and advantageous. In this paper, we address the problem of controlling an unstable first-order hyperbolic PDE with spatially-varying delays by combining PDE backstepping control strategies and deep reinforcement learning (RL). To eliminate the assumption on the delay function required for the backstepping design, we propose a soft actor-critic (SAC) architecture incorporating a DeepONet to approximate the backstepping controller. The DeepONet extracts features from the backstepping controller and feeds them into the policy network. In simulations, our algorithm outperforms the baseline SAC without prior backstepping knowledge and the analytical controller.</description>

      <title>Joint Design and Pricing of Extended Warranties for Multiple Automobiles with Different Price Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended warranties (EWs) are significant source of revenue for capital-intensive products like automobiles. Such products consist of multiple subsystems, providing flexibility in EW customization, for example, bundling a tailored set of subsystems in an EW contract. This, in turn, enables the creation of a service menu with different EW contract options. From the perspective of a third-party EW provider servicing a fleet of automobile brands, we develop a novel model to jointly optimize the design and pricing of EWs in order to maximize the profit. Specifically, the problem is to determine which contracts should be included in the EW menu and identify the appropriate price for each contract. As the complexity of the joint optimization problem increases exponentially with the number of subsystems, two solution approaches are devised to solve the problem. The first approach is based on a mixed-integer second-order cone programming reformulation, which guarantees optimality but is applicable only for a small number of subsystems. The second approach utilizes a two-step iteration process, offering enhanced computational efficiency in scenarios with a large number of subsystems. Through numerical experiments, the effectiveness of our model is validated, particularly in scenarios characterized by high failure rates and a large number of subsystems.</description>

      <title>Multilayered Intelligent Reflecting Surface for Long-Range Underwater Acoustic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a multilayered acoustic reconfigurable intelligent surface (ML-ARIS) architecture designed for the next generation of underwater communications. ML-ARIS incorporates multiple layers of piezoelectric material in each acoustic reflector, with the load impedance of each layer independently adjustable via a control circuit. This design increases the flexibility in generating reflected signals with desired amplitudes and orthogonal phases, enabling passive in-phase and quadrature (IQ) modulation using a single acoustic reflector. Such a feature enables precise beam steering, enhancing sound levels in targeted directions while minimizing interference in surrounding environments. Extensive simulations and tank experiments were conducted to verify the feasibility of ML-ARIS. The experimental results indicate that implementing IQ modulation with a multilayer structure is indeed practical in real-world scenarios, making it possible to use a single reflection unit to generate reflected waves with high-resolution amplitudes and phases.</description>

      <title>Performance guarantees for optimization-based state estimation using turnpike properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop novel accuracy and performance guarantees for optimal state estimation of general nonlinear systems (in particular, moving horizon estimation, MHE). Our results rely on a turnpike property of the optimal state estimation problem, which essentially states that the omniscient infinite-horizon solution involving all past and future data serves as turnpike for the solutions of finite-horizon estimation problems involving a subset of the data. This leads to the surprising observation that MHE problems naturally exhibit a leaving arc, which may have a strong negative impact on the estimation accuracy. To address this, we propose a delayed MHE scheme, and we show that the resulting performance (both averaged and non-averaged) is approximately optimal and achieves bounded dynamic regret with respect to the infinite-horizon solution, with error terms that can be made arbitrarily small by an appropriate choice of the delay. In various simulation examples, we observe that already a very small delay in the MHE scheme is sufficient to significantly improve the overall estimation error by 20-25 % compared to standard MHE (without delay). This finding is of great importance for practical applications (especially for monitoring, fault detection, and parameter estimation) where a small delay in the estimation is rather irrelevant but may significantly improve the estimation results.</description>

      <title>Optimum Monitoring and Job Assignment with Multiple Markov Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of systems termed Markov Machines (MM) which process job requests with exponential service times. Assuming a Poison job arrival process, these MMs oscillate between two states, free and busy. We consider the problem of sampling the states of these MMs so as to track their states, subject to a total sampling budget, with the goal of allocating external job requests effectively to them. For this purpose, we leverage the $\textit{binary freshness metric}$ to quantify the quality of our ability to track the states of the MMs, and introduce two new metrics termed $\textit{false acceptance ratio}$ (FAR) and $\textit{false rejection ratio}$ (FRR) to evaluate the effectiveness of our job assignment strategy. We provide optimal sampling rate allocation schemes for jointly monitoring a system of $N$ heterogeneous MMs.</description>

      <title>Reducing Simulation Effort for RIS Optimization using an Efficient Far-Field Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) via a previously introduced method is effective, but time-consuming, because multiport impedance or scatter matrices are required for each transmitter and receiver position, which generally must be obtained through full-wave simulation. Herein, a simple and efficient far-field approximation is introduced, to extrapolate scatter matrices for arbitrary receiver and transmitter positions from only a single simulation while still maintaining high accuracy suitable for optimization purposes. This is demonstrated through comparisons of the optimized capacitance values and further supported by empirical measurements.</description>

      <title>Robust Fuel-Optimal Landing Guidance for Hazardous Terrain using Multiple Sliding Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In any spacecraft landing mission, fuel-efficient precision soft landing while avoiding nearby hazardous terrain is of utmost importance. Very few existing literature have attempted addressing both the problems of precision soft landing and terrain avoidance simultaneously. To this end, an optimal terrain avoidance landing guidance (OTALG) was recently developed, which showed promising performance in avoiding the terrain while consuming near-minimum fuel. However, its performance significantly degrades in the face of external disturbances, indicating lack of robustness. To mitigate this problem, in this paper, a near fuel-optimal guidance law is developed to avoid terrain and achieve precision soft landing at the desired landing site. Expanding the OTALG formulation using sliding mode control with multiple sliding surfaces (MSS), the presented guidance law, named `MSS-OTALG', improves precision soft landing accuracy. Further, the sliding parameter is designed to allow the lander to avoid terrain by leaving the trajectory enforced by the sliding mode and eventually returning to it when the terrain avoidance phase is completed. And finally, the robustness of the MSS-OTALG is established by proving practical fixed-time stability. Extensive numerical simulations are also presented to showcase its performance in terms of terrain avoidance, low fuel consumption, and accuracy of precision soft landing under bounded atmospheric perturbations, thrust deviations, and constraints. Comparative studies against existing relevant literature validate a balanced trade-off of all these performance measures achieved by the developed MSS-OTALG.</description>

      <title>A general framework for supporting economic feasibility of generator and storage energy systems through capacity and dispatch optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integration of various electricity-generating technologies (such as natural gas, wind, nuclear, etc.) with storage systems (such as thermal, battery electric, hydrogen, etc.) has the potential to improve the economic competitiveness of modern energy systems. Driven by the need to efficiently assess the economic feasibility of various energy system configurations in early system concept development, this work outlines a versatile computational framework for assessing the net present value of various integrated storage technologies. The subsystems' fundamental dynamics are defined, with a particular emphasis on balancing critical physical and economic domains to enable optimal decision-making in the context of capacity and dispatch optimization. In its presented form, the framework formulates a linear, convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved using a direct transcription approach in the open-source software DTQP. Three case studies demonstrate and validate the framework's capabilities, highlighting its value and computational efficiency in facilitating the economic assessment of various energy system configurations. In particular, natural gas with thermal storage and carbon capture, wind energy with battery storage, and nuclear with hydrogen are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Min-Max MPC for Linear Systems: Robustness and Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven controllers design is an important research problem, in particular when data is corrupted by the noise. In this paper, we propose a data-driven min-max model predictive control (MPC) scheme using noisy input-state data for unknown linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The unknown system matrices are characterized by a set-membership representation using the noisy input-state data. Leveraging this representation, we derive an upper bound on the worst-case cost and determine the corresponding optimal state-feedback control law through a semidefinite program (SDP). We prove that the resulting closed-loop system is robustly stabilized and satisfies the input and state constraints. Further, we propose an adaptive data-driven min-max MPC scheme which exploits additional online input-state data to improve closed-loop performance. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Conformal Robust Control of Linear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: End-to-end engineering design pipelines, in which designs are evaluated using concurrently defined optimal controllers, are becoming increasingly common in practice. To discover designs that perform well even under the misspecification of system dynamics, such end-to-end pipelines have now begun evaluating designs with a robust control objective in place of the nominal optimal control setup. Current approaches of specifying such robust control subproblems, however, rely on hand specification of perturbations anticipated to be present upon deployment or margin methods that ignore problem structure, resulting in a lack of theoretical guarantees and overly conservative empirical performance. We, instead, propose a novel methodology for LQR systems that leverages conformal prediction to specify such uncertainty regions in a data-driven fashion. Such regions have distribution-free coverage guarantees on the true system dynamics, in turn allowing for a probabilistic characterization of the regret of the resulting robust controller. We then demonstrate that such a controller can be efficiently produced via a novel policy gradient method that has convergence guarantees. We finally demonstrate the superior empirical performance of our method over alternate robust control specifications, such as $H_{\infty}$ and LQR with multiplicative noise, across a collection of engineering control systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16649v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven framework to learn a finite-dimensional approximation of a Koopman operator for approximating the state evolution of a dynamical system under noisy observations. To this end, our proposed solution has two main advantages. First, the proposed method only requires the measurement noise to be bounded. Second, the proposed method modifies the existing deep Koopman operator formulations by characterizing the effect of the measurement noise on the Koopman operator learning and then mitigating it by updating the tunable parameter of the observable functions of the Koopman operator, making it easy to implement. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on several standard benchmarks. We then compare the presented method with similar methods proposed in the latest literature on Koopman learning.</description>

Abstract: We address the problem of controlling the density of a large ensemble of follower agents by acting on a group of leader agents that interact with them. Using coupled partial integro-differential equations to describe leader and follower density dynamics, we establish feasibility conditions and develop two control architectures ensuring global stability. The first employs feed-forward control on the followers' and a leaders' density feedback. The second implements a dual feedback loop through a reference-governor that adapts the leaders' density based on both populations measurements. Our methods, initially developed in a one-dimensional setting, are extended to multi-dimensional cases, and validated through numerical simulations for representative control applications, both for groups of infinite and finite size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a stochastic model predictive control framework for nonlinear systems subject to unbounded process noise with closed-loop guarantees. First, we provide a conceptual shrinking-horizon framework that utilizes general probabilistic reachable sets and minimizes the expected cost. Then, we provide a tractable receding-horizon formulation that uses a nominal state to minimize a deterministic quadratic cost and satisfy tightened constraints. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates recursive feasibility, satisfaction of chance constraints, and bounds on the expected cost for the resulting closed-loop system. We provide a constructive design for probabilistic reachable sets of nonlinear continuously differentiable systems using stochastic contraction metrics. Numerical simulations highlight the computational efficiency and theoretical guarantees of the proposed method. Overall, this paper provides a framework for computationally tractable stochastic predictive control with closed-loop guarantees for nonlinear systems with unbounded noise.</description>

Abstract: The continuous shift of computational bottlenecks to the memory access and data transfer, especially for AI applications, poses the urgent needs of re-engineering the computer architecture fundamentals. Many edge computing applications, like wearable and implantable medical devices, introduce increasingly more challenges to conventional computing systems due to the strict requirements of area and power at the edge. Emerging technologies, like Resistive RAM (RRAM), have shown a promising momentum in developing neuro-inspired analogue computing paradigms capable of achieving high classification capabilities alongside high energy efficiency. In this work, we present a novel RRAM-based Analogue Content Addressable Memory (ACAM) for on-line analogue template matching applications. This ACAM-based template matching architecture aims to achieve energy-efficient classification where low energy is of utmost importance. We are showcasing a highly tuneable novel RRAM-based ACAM pixel implemented using a commercial 180nm CMOS technology and in-house RRAM technology and exhibiting low energy dissipation of approximately 0.036pJ and 0.16pJ for mismatch and match, respectively, at 66MHz with 3V voltage supply. A proof-of-concept system-level implementation based on this novel pixel design is also implemented in 180nm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIMEC) networks opens a significant opportunity for the rapidly growing low altitude economy (LAE), facilitating the development of various applications by offering efficient communication and computing services. However, the heterogeneous nature of SAGIMEC networks, coupled with the stringent computational and communication requirements of diverse applications in the LAE, introduces considerable challenges in integrating SAGIMEC into the LAE. In this work, we first present a digital twin-assisted SAGIMEC paradigm for LAE, where digital twin enables reliable network monitoring and management, while SAGIMEC provides efficient computing offloading services for Internet of Things sensor devices (ISDs). Then, a joint satellite selection, computation offloading, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation and UAV trajectory control optimization problem (JSC4OP) is formulated to maximize the quality of service (QoS) of ISDs. Given the complexity of JSC4OP, we propose an online decentralized optimization approach (ODOA) to address the problem. Specifically, JSC4OP is first transformed into a real-time decision-making optimization problem (RDOP) by leveraging Lyapunov optimization. Then, to solve the RDOP, we introduce an online learning-based latency prediction method to predict the uncertain system environment and a game theoretic decision-making method to make real-time decisions. Finally, theoretical analysis confirms the effectiveness of the ODOA, while the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ODOA outperforms other alternative approaches in terms of overall system performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-invasive parametrisation of physics-based battery models can be performed by fitting the model to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data containing features related to the different physical processes. However, this requires an impedance model to be derived, which may be complex to obtain analytically. We have developed the open-source software PyBaMM-EIS that provides a fast method to compute the impedance of any PyBaMM model at any operating point using automatic differentiation. Using PyBaMM-EIS, we investigate the impedance of the single particle model, single particle model with electrolyte (SPMe), and Doyle-Fuller-Newman model, and identify the SPMe as a parsimonious option that shows the typical features of measured lithium-ion cell impedance data. We provide a grouped parameter SPMe and analyse the features in the impedance related to each parameter. Using the open-source software PyBOP, we estimate 18 grouped parameters both from simulated impedance data and from measured impedance data from a LG M50LT lithium-ion battery. The parameters that directly affect the response of the SPMe can be accurately determined and assigned to the correct electrode. Crucially, parameter fitting must be done simultaneously to data across a wide range of states-of-charge. Overall, this work presents a practical way to find the parameters of physics-based models.</description>

      <title>Benchmark Study of Transient Stability during Power-Hardware-in-the-Loop and Fault-Ride-Through capabilities of PV inverters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13503</link>

Abstract: The deployment of PV inverters is rapidly expanding across Europe, where these devices must increasingly comply with stringent grid requirements.This study presents a benchmark analysis of four PV inverter manufacturers, focusing on their Fault Ride Through capabilities under varying grid strengths, voltage dips, and fault durations, parameters critical for grid operators during fault conditions.The findings highlight the influence of different inverter controls on key metrics such as total harmonic distortion of current and voltage signals, as well as system stability following grid faults.Additionally, the study evaluates transient stability using two distinct testing approaches.The first approach employs the current standard method, which is testing with an ideal voltage source. The second utilizes a Power Hardware in the Loop methodology with a benchmark CIGRE grid model.The results reveal that while testing with an ideal voltage source is cost-effective and convenient in the short term, it lacks the ability to capture the dynamic interactions and feedback loops of physical grid components.This limitation can obscure critical real world factors, potentially leading to unexpected inverter behavior and operational challenges in grids with high PV penetration.This study underscores the importance of re-evaluating conventional testing methods and incorporating Power Hardware in the Loop structures to achieve test results that more closely align with real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>Learning-Augmented Online Control for Decarbonizing Water Infrastructures</title>

Abstract: Water infrastructures are essential for drinking water supply, irrigation, fire protection, and other critical applications. However, water pumping systems, which are key to transporting water to the point of use, consume significant amounts of energy and emit millions of tons of greenhouse gases annually. With the wide deployment of digital water meters and sensors in these infrastructures, Machine Learning (ML) has the potential to optimize water supply control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, the inherent vulnerability of ML methods in terms of worst-case performance raises safety concerns when deployed in critical water infrastructures. To address this challenge, we propose a learning-augmented online control algorithm, termed LAOC, designed to dynamically schedule the activation and/or speed of water pumps. To ensure safety, we introduce a novel design of safe action sets for online control problems. By leveraging these safe action sets, LAOC can provably guarantee safety constraints while utilizing ML predictions to reduce energy and environmental costs. Our analysis reveals the tradeoff between safety requirements and average energy/environmental cost performance. Additionally, we conduct an experimental study on a building water supply system to demonstrate the empirical performance of LAOC. The results indicate that LAOC can effectively reduce environmental and energy costs while guaranteeing safety constraints.</description>

      <title>Scaling Robust Optimization for Multi-Agent Robotic Systems: A Distributed Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel distributed robust optimization scheme for steering distributions of multi-agent systems under stochastic and deterministic uncertainty. Robust optimization is a subfield of optimization which aims to discover an optimal solution that remains robustly feasible for all possible realizations of the problem parameters within a given uncertainty set. Such approaches would naturally constitute an ideal candidate for multi-robot control, where in addition to stochastic noise, there might be exogenous deterministic disturbances. Nevertheless, as these methods are usually associated with significantly high computational demands, their application to multi-agent robotics has remained limited. The scope of this work is to propose a scalable robust optimization framework that effectively addresses both types of uncertainties, while retaining computational efficiency and scalability. In this direction, we provide tractable approximations for robust constraints that are relevant in multi-robot settings. Subsequently, we demonstrate how computations can be distributed through an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) approach towards achieving scalability and communication efficiency. All improvements are also theoretically justified by establishing and comparing the resulting computational complexities. Simulation results highlight the performance of the proposed algorithm in effectively handling both stochastic and deterministic uncertainty in multi-robot systems. The scalability of the method is also emphasized by showcasing tasks with up to hundreds of agents. The results of this work indicate the promise of blending robust optimization, distribution steering and distributed optimization towards achieving scalable, safe and robust multi-robot control.</description>

      <title>Remaining Useful Life Prediction for Batteries Utilizing an Explainable AI Approach with a Predictive Application for Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17931</link>

Abstract: Accurately estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a battery is essential for determining its lifespan and recharge requirements. In this work, we develop machine learning-based models to predict and classify battery RUL. We introduce a two-level ensemble learning (TLE) framework and a CNN+MLP hybrid model for RUL prediction, comparing their performance against traditional, deep, and hybrid machine learning models. Our analysis evaluates various models for both prediction and classification while incorporating interpretability through SHAP. The proposed TLE model consistently outperforms baseline models in RMSE, MAE, and R squared error, demonstrating its superior predictive capabilities. Additionally, the XGBoost classifier achieves an impressive 99% classification accuracy, validated through cross-validation techniques. The models effectively predict relay-based charging triggers, enabling automated and energy-efficient charging processes. This automation reduces energy consumption and enhances battery performance by optimizing charging cycles. SHAP interpretability analysis highlights the cycle index and charging parameters as the most critical factors influencing RUL. To improve accessibility, we developed a Tkinter-based GUI that allows users to input new data and predict RUL in real time. This practical solution supports sustainable battery management by enabling data-driven decisions about battery usage and maintenance, contributing to energy-efficient and innovative battery life prediction.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Sampling for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing efficient algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenging because the size of the joint state and action spaces grows exponentially in the number of agents. These difficulties are exacerbated when balancing sequential global decision-making with local agent interactions. In this work, we propose a new algorithm $\texttt{SUBSAMPLE-MFQ}$ ($\textbf{Subsample}$-$\textbf{M}$ean-$\textbf{F}$ield-$\textbf{Q}$-learning) and a decentralized randomized policy for a system with $n$ agents. For $k\leq n$, our algorithm learns a policy for the system in time polynomial in $k$. We show that this learned policy converges to the optimal policy on the order of $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$ as the number of subsampled agents $k$ increases. We empirically validate our method in Gaussian squeeze and global exploration settings.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Decision-Making for Digital Twin in Additive Manufacturing with Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital Twin-a virtual replica of a physical system enabling real-time monitoring, model updating, prediction, and decision-making-combined with recent advances in machine learning (ML), offers new opportunities for proactive control strategies in autonomous manufacturing. However, achieving real-time decision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by accurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for real-time decision-making, using a multi-variate deep neural network (DNN), named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Different from the models in conventional MPC which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of predicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot (multi-step), significantly accelerating MPC. Using Directed Energy Deposition additive manufacturing as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC in achieving melt pool temperature tracking to ensure part quality, while reducing porosity defects by regulating laser power to maintain melt pool depth constraints. In this work, we first show that TiDE is capable of accurately predicting melt pool temperature and depth. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed MPC achieves precise temperature tracking while satisfying melt pool depth constraints within a targeted dilution range (10%-30%), reducing potential porosity defects. Compared to the PID controller, MPC results in smoother and less fluctuating laser power profiles with competitive or superior melt pool temperature control performance. This demonstrates MPC's proactive control capabilities, leveraging time-series prediction and real-time optimization, positioning it as a powerful tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process optimization in manufacturing.</description>
