      <title>Dynamics of a Model of Polluted Lakes via Fractal-Fractional Operators with Two Different Numerical Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ Mittag-Leffler type kernels to solve a system of fractional differential equations using fractal-fractional (FF) operators with two fractal and fractional orders. Using the notion of FF-derivatives with nonsingular and nonlocal fading memory, a model of three polluted lakes with one source of pollution is investigated. The properties of a non-decreasing and compact mapping are used in order to prove the existence of a solution for the FF-model of polluted lake system. For this purpose, the Leray-Schauder theorem is used. After exploring stability requirements in four versions, the proposed model of polluted lakes system is then simulated using two new numerical techniques based on Adams-Bashforth and Newton polynomials methods. The effect of fractal-fractional differentiation is illustrated numerically. Moreover, the effect of the FF-derivatives is shown under three specific input models of the pollutant: linear, exponentially decaying, and periodic.</description>

      <title>Permanence and Uniform Asymptotic Stability of Positive Solutions of SAIQH Models on Time Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A susceptible, asymptomatic, infectious, quarantined, and hospitalized (SAIQH) compartmental model on time scales is introduced and a suitable Lyapunov function is defined. Main results include: the proof that the system is permanent; proof of existence of solution; and sufficient conditions implying the dynamic system to have a unique almost periodic solution that is uniformly asymptotically stable. An example is presented supporting the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Kato's chaos of multiple mappings and its continuous self-maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2016, Hou and Wang introduced the concept of multiple mappings based on iterated function system, which is an important branch of fractal theory. In this paper, we introduce the definitions of sensitivity, accessibility, and Kato's chaos of multiple mappings from a set-valued perspective. We show that multiple mappings and its continuous self-maps do not imply each other in terms of sensitivity and accessibility. While a sufficient condition for multiple mappings to be sensitive, accessible and Kato's chaotic is provided, respectively. And the sensitivity, accessibility, and Kato's chaos of multiple mappings are preserved under topological conjugation.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Noise: A CBF Approach for Nonlinear Control with Integral Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many physical phenomena involving mobile agents involve time-varying scalar fields, e.g., quadrotors that emit noise. As a consequence, agents can influence and can be influenced by various environmental factors such as noise. This paper delves into the challenges of controlling such agents, focusing on scenarios where we would like to prevent excessive accumulation of some quantity over select regions and extended trajectories. We use quadrotors that emit noise as a primary example, to regulate the trajectory of such agents in the presence of obstacles and noise emitted by the aerial vehicles themselves. First, we consider constraints that are defined over accumulated quantities, i.e functionals of the entire trajectory, as opposed to those that depend solely on the current state as in traditional Higher order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBF). Second, we propose a method to extend constraints from individual points to lines and sets by using efficient over-approximations. The efficacy of the implemented strategies is verified using simulations. Although we use quadrotors as an example, the same principles can equally apply to other scenarios, such as light emission microscopy or vehicle pollution dispersion. The technical contribution of this paper is twofold.</description>

      <title>Residuality of Dynamical Morphisms for Amenable Group Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the classical Baire category approach, used in proving the finite generator theorem of Krieger, the homomorphism theorem of Sinai and the isomorphism theorem of Ornstein, applying a similar reasoning to the case of actions of countably infinite amenable groups. In principle we follow the lines of the paper by Burton, Keane and Serafin (\cite{BKS}), showing that measures defining homomorphisms or isomorphisms form residual subsets in suitably chosen spaces of joinings.</description>

      <title>Existence of traveling wave solutions in continuous OV models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In traffic flow, self-organized wave propagation, which characterizes congestion, has been reproduced in macroscopic and microscopic models. Hydrodynamic models, a subset of macroscopic models, can be derived from microscopic-level car-following models, and the relationship between these models has been investigated. However, most validations have relied on numerical methods and formal analyses; therefore, analytical approaches are necessary to rigorously ensure their validity. This study aims to investigate the relationship between macroscopic and microscopic models based on the properties of the solutions corresponding to congestion with sparse and dense waves. Specifically, we demonstrate the existence of traveling wave solutions in macroscopic models and investigate their properties.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations in planar, quadratic mass-action networks with few reactions and low molecularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study bifurcations in mass-action networks with two chemical species and reactant complexes of molecularity no more than two. We refer to these as planar, quadratic networks as they give rise to (at most) quadratic differential equations on the nonnegative quadrant of the plane. Our aim is to study bifurcations in networks in this class with the fewest possible reactions, and the lowest possible product molecularity. We fully characterise generic bifurcations of positive equilibria in such networks with up to four reactions, and product molecularity no higher than three. In these networks we find fold, Andronov--Hopf, Bogdanov--Takens and Bautin bifurcations, and prove the non-occurrence of any other generic bifurcations of positive equilibria. In addition, we present a number of results which go beyond planar, quadratic networks. For example, we show that mass-action networks without conservation laws admit no bifurcations of codimension greater than $m-2$, where $m$ is the number of reactions; we fully characterise quadratic, rank-one mass-action networks admitting fold bifurcations; and we write down some necessary conditions for Andronov--Hopf and cusp bifurcations in mass-action networks. Finally, we draw connections with a number of previous results in the literature on nontrivial dynamics, bifurcations, and inheritance in mass-action networks.</description>

      <title>Generalized multiple Borel-Cantelli Lemma in dynamics and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple Borel-Cantelli Lemma is a criterion that characterizes the occurrence of multiple rare events on the same time scale. We generalize the multiple Borel-Cantelli Lemma in dynamics established by Dolgopyat, Fayad and Liu [J. Mod. Dyn. 18 (2022) 209--289], broadening its applications to encompass several non-smooth systems with absolute continuous measures. Utilizing this generalization, we derive multiple Logarithm Law for hitting time and recurrence of dispersing billiard maps and piecewise expanding maps under some regular conditions, including tent map, Lorentz-like map and Gauss map.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of One-Dimensional Quasi-Affine Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the one-dimensional quasi-affine map $x\mapsto \left\lfloor \lambda x +\mu \right\rfloor$, providing a complete description of the map's periodic points, and of the limit points of every $x\in\mathbb{R}$ under the map, for all real parameter values. Specifically, we establish the existence of regions of parameter values for which the map possesses $n$ fixed points for all $n\in\mathbb{N}_0\cup \{\infty\}$, an explicit formula for the number of 2-cycles possessed by the map, and the $\omega$-limit set of any $x\in\mathbb{R}$ under the map, which, depending on the parameter values, is either a singleton of a fixed point, a 2-cycle, $\{-\infty,\infty\}$, $\{\infty\}$, or $\{-\infty\}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider actions of a tileable amenable group $\Gamma$ on a topological space $X$. For a continuous function on $X$, we define the entropy of the number of homologically detectable critical point of the average of that function over $\Gamma$. This number is bounded below by the sum of the Betti number entropy. This result is thus a generalization of a standard Morse inequality in differential geometry to this setting.</description>

Abstract: An error in the statement and proof of Theorem 7 in [D.Corona, A. Della Corte. The critical exponent functions. Comptes Rendus Math\'ematique, 360(G4), 315-332, 2024] has been identified. The theorem was used to prove analytical and dynamical properties of a class of interval maps there introduced, called the critical exponent functions. We show here that most of the properties of these maps established in [D.Corona, A. Della Corte. The critical exponent functions. Comptes Rendus Math\'ematique, 360(G4), 315-332, 2024] can be recovered with minor adjustments. Moreover, we propose as a conjecture a weaker form of Theorem 7.</description>

      <title>Exploring Geometrical Properties of Chaotic Systems Through an Analysis of the Rulkov Neuron Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While extensive research has been conducted on chaos emerging from a dynamical system's temporal dynamics, the research documented in this paper examines extreme sensitivity to initial conditions in discrete-time dynamical systems from a geometrical perspective. The heart of this paper focuses on two simple neuron maps developed by Nikolai F. Rulkov in the early 2000s and the complex geometrical structures that emerge from them. Beginning with a conversational introduction to the geometry of chaos, this paper integrates mathematics, physics, neurobiology, computational modeling, and electrochemistry to present original research that provides a novel perspective on how types of geometrical sensitivity to initial conditions appear in discrete-time neuron systems.
  This paper was developed in the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Quantum Lab as part of a senior research project.</description>

      <title>Integrating time-resolved $nrf2$ gene-expression data into a full GUTS model as a proxy for toxicodynamic damage in zebrafish embryo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The immense production of the chemical industry requires an improved predictive risk assessment that can handle constantly evolving challenges while reducing the dependency of risk assessment on animal testing. Integrating 'omics data into mechanistic models offers a promising solution by linking cellular processes triggered after chemical exposure with observed effects in the organism. With the emerging availability of time-resolved RNA data, the goal of integrating gene expression data into mechanistic models can be approached. We propose a biologically anchored TKTD model, which describes key processes that link the gene expression level of the stress regulator $nrf2$ to detoxification and lethality by associating toxicodynamic damage with $nrf2$ expression. Fitting such a model to complex datasets consisting of multiple endpoints required the combination of methods from molecular biology, mechanistic dynamic systems modeling and Bayesian inference. In this study we successfully integrate time-resolved gene expression data into TKTD models, and thus provide a method for assessing the influence of molecular markers on survival. This novel method was used to test whether, $nrf2$, can be applied to predict lethality in zebrafish embryos. With the presented approach we outline a method to successively approach the goal of a predictive risk assessment based on molecular data.</description>

Abstract: We consider labelings of a finite regular tree by a finite alphabet subject to restrictions specified by a nonnegative transition matrix, propose an algorithm for determining whether the set of possible configurations on the last row of the tree is independent of the symbol at the root, and prove that the algorithm succeeds in a bounded number of steps, provided that the dimension of the tree is greater than or equal to the maximum row sum of the transition matrix. (The question was motivated by calculation of topological pressure on trees and is an extension of the idea of primitivity for nonnegative matrices.)</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamics of geodesics of Fuchsian meromorphic connections with real periods, giving a precise characterization of the possible $\omega$-limit sets of simple geodesics in this case. The main tools are the study of the singular flat metric associated to the meromorphic connection, an explicit description of the geodesics nearby a Fuchsian pole with real residue larger than $-1$ and a far-reaching generalization to our case of the classical Teichm\"uller lemma for quadratic differentials.</description>

Abstract: This paper works on the structure of infinitely connected Fatou damains of rational maps in terms of Koebe uniformization. Due to the complicated boundary behavior, the existing uniformization results are failed to apply in general. We proved that if the rational map is geometrically finite, then its infinitely connected attracting Fatou damain is conformally homeomorphic to a circle domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each natural number $n$, we consider the subgroup $\mathcal{R}_n$ of Homeo$_+[0,1]$ made by the elements that are linear except for a subset whose Cantor-Bendixson rank is less than or equal to $n$. These groups of generalized piecewise-linear transformations yield an ascending chain of groups as we increase $n$. We study how the notion of distorted element changes along this chain. Our main result establishes that for each natural number $n$, there exits an element that is undistorted of $\mathcal{R}_n$ yet distorted in $\mathcal{R}_{n+1}$. Actually, such an element is explicitly constructed.</description>

      <title>Prescribed exponential stabilization of a one-layer neural network with delayed feedback: Insights in seizure prevention and neural control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides control-oriented delay-based modelling of a one-layer neural network of Hopfield-type subject to an external input designed as delayed feedback. The specificity of such a model is that it makes the considered neuron less susceptible to seizure caused by its inherent dynamic instability. This modelling exploits a recently set partial pole placement for linear functional differential equations, which relies on the coexistence of real spectral values, allowing the explicit prescription of the closed-loop solution's exponential decay. The proposed framework improves some pioneering and scarce results from the literature on the characterization of the exact solution's exponential decay when a simple real spectral value exists. Indeed, it improves neural stability when the inherent dynamic is stable and provides insights into the design of a one-layer neural network that can be stabilized exponentially with delayed feedback and with a prescribed decay rate regardless of whether the inherent neuron dynamic is stable or unstable.</description>

      <title>Complex fractal trainability boundary can arise from trivial non-convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training neural networks involves optimizing parameters to minimize a loss function, where the nature of the loss function and the optimization strategy are crucial for effective training. Hyperparameter choices, such as the learning rate in gradient descent (GD), significantly affect the success and speed of convergence. Recent studies indicate that the boundary between bounded and divergent hyperparameters can be fractal, complicating reliable hyperparameter selection. However, the nature of this fractal boundary and methods to avoid it remain unclear. In this study, we focus on GD to investigate the loss landscape properties that might lead to fractal trainability boundaries. We discovered that fractal boundaries can emerge from simple non-convex perturbations, i.e., adding or multiplying cosine type perturbations to quadratic functions. The observed fractal dimensions are influenced by factors like parameter dimension, type of non-convexity, perturbation wavelength, and perturbation amplitude. Our analysis identifies "roughness of perturbation", which measures the gradient's sensitivity to parameter changes, as the factor controlling fractal dimensions of trainability boundaries. We observed a clear transition from non-fractal to fractal trainability boundaries as roughness increases, with the critical roughness causing the perturbed loss function non-convex. Thus, we conclude that fractal trainability boundaries can arise from very simple non-convexity. We anticipate that our findings will enhance the understanding of complex behaviors during neural network training, leading to more consistent and predictable training strategies.</description>

      <title>Non-Negative Universal Differential Equations With Applications in Systems Biology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal differential equations (UDEs) leverage the respective advantages of mechanistic models and artificial neural networks and combine them into one dynamic model. However, these hybrid models can suffer from unrealistic solutions, such as negative values for biochemical quantities. We present non-negative UDE (nUDEs), a constrained UDE variant that guarantees non-negative values. Furthermore, we explore regularisation techniques to improve generalisation and interpretability of UDEs.</description>

      <title>Emergence of quantum dynamics from chaos: The case of prequantum cat maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Faure and Tsujii have recently proposed a novel quantization procedure, named natural quantization, for smooth symplectic Anosov diffeomorphisms. Their method starts with prequantization, which is also the first step of geometric quantization as proposed by Kostant-Souriau-Kirillov, and then relies on the Ruelle-Pollicott spectrum of the prequantum transfer operator, which they show to have a particular band structure. The appeal of this new quantization scheme resides in its naturalness: the quantum behavior appears dynamically in the classical correlation functions of the prequantum transfer operator. In this paper, we explicitly work out the case of cat maps on the $2n$-dimensional torus, showing in particular that the outcome is equivalent to that of the usual Weyl quantization. We also provide a concrete construction of all the prequantum cat maps.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a group with undecidable domino problem (such as $\mathbb{Z}^2$). We prove the undecidability of all nontrivial dynamical properties for sofic $G$-subshifts, that such a result fails for SFTs, and an undecidability result for dynamical properties of $G$-SFTs similar to the Adian-Rabin theorem. For $G$ amenable we prove that topological entropy is not computable from presentations of SFTs, and a more general result for dynamical invariants taking values in partially ordered sets.</description>

      <title>Data-driven network analysis using local delay embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven methods for the identification of the governing equations of dynamical systems or the computation of reduced surrogate models play an increasingly important role in many application areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. Given only measurement or observation data, data-driven modeling techniques allow us to gain important insights into the characteristic properties of a system, without requiring detailed mechanistic models. However, most methods assume that we have access to the full state of the system, which might be too restrictive. We show that it is possible to learn certain global dynamical features from local observations using delay embedding techniques, provided that the system satisfies a localizability condition -- a property that is closely related to the observability and controllability of linear time-invariant systems.</description>

      <title>Results on Dynamics of Bungee set of Composite Entire Functions in the Eremenko-Lyubich Class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we have discussed the dynamics of composite entire functions in terms of relationship between bungee set, repelling periodic points (to be denoted by $RP$) and rationally indifferent fixed point set. We have established relation between the dynamics of composite function and the functions taken for composition. We showed that the union of their Bungee sets contains Bungee set of the composite function. We also showed that $RP$ set of composite functions contains the $ RP$ set of functions used for the composition. We have mostly dealt with the permutable functions of class $\mathcal{B}$. These results hold true when we have a composite function in which one function is a periodic translation of another.</description>

      <title>Tradeoffs between convergence rate and noise amplification for momentum-based accelerated optimization algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study momentum-based first-order optimization algorithms in which the iterations utilize information from the two previous steps and are subject to an additive white noise. This setup uses noise to account for uncertainty in either gradient evaluation or iteration updates, and it includes Polyak's heavy-ball and Nesterov's accelerated methods as special cases. For strongly convex quadratic problems, we use the steady-state variance of the error in the optimization variable to quantify noise amplification and identify fundamental stochastic performance tradeoffs. Our approach utilizes the Jury stability criterion to provide a novel geometric characterization of conditions for linear convergence, and it reveals the relation between the noise amplification and convergence rate as well as their dependence on the condition number and the constant algorithmic parameters. This geometric insight leads to simple alternative proofs of standard convergence results and allows us to establish ``uncertainty principle'' of strongly convex optimization: for the two-step momentum method with linear convergence rate, the lower bound on the product between the settling time and noise amplification scales quadratically with the condition number. Our analysis also identifies a key difference between the gradient and iterate noise models: while the amplification of gradient noise can be made arbitrarily small by sufficiently decelerating the algorithm, the best achievable variance for the iterate noise model increases linearly with the settling time in the decelerating regime. Finally, we introduce two parameterized families of algorithms that strike a balance between noise amplification and settling time while preserving order-wise Pareto optimality for both noise models.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic degrees and Zariski dense orbits of cohomologically hyperbolic maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A dominant rational self-map on a projective variety is called $p$-cohomologically hyperbolic if the $p$-th dynamical degree is strictly larger than other dynamical degrees. For such a map defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, we study lower bounds of the arithmetic degrees, existence of points with Zariski dense orbit, and finiteness of preperiodic points. In particular, we prove that, if $f$ is an $1$-cohomologically hyperbolic map on a smooth projective variety, then (1) the arithmetic degree of a $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-point with generic $f$-orbit is equal to the first dynamical degree of $f$; and (2) there are $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-points with generic $f$-orbit. Applying our theorem to the recently constructed rational map with transcendental dynamical degree, we confirm that the arithmetic degree can be transcendental.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new method for combining in situ buoy measurements with Earth system models (ESMs) to improve the accuracy of temperature predictions in the ocean. The technique utilizes the dynamics \textit{and} modes identified in ESMs alongside buoy measurements to improve accuracy while preserving features such as seasonality. We use this technique, which we call Dynamic Basis Function Interpolation, to correct errors in localized temperature predictions made by the Model for Prediction Across Scales Ocean component (MPAS-O) with the Global Drifter Program's in situ ocean buoy dataset.</description>

Abstract: For all Zarski dense Anosov subgroups of a semisimple real algebraic group, we prove that their limit sets are Ahlfors regular for intrinsic conformal premetrics. As a consequence, we obtain that a Patterson-Sullivan measure is equal to the Hausdorff measure if and only if the associated linear form is symmetric. We also discuss several applications, including analyticity of $(p,q)$-Hausdorff dimensions on the Teichm\"uller spaces, new upper bounds on the growth indicator, and $L^2$-spectral properties of associated locally symmetric manifolds.</description>

      <title>Data-driven approximation of Koopman operators and generators: Convergence rates and error bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global information about dynamical systems can be extracted by analysing associated infinite-dimensional transfer operators, such as Perron-Frobenius and Koopman operators as well as their infinitesimal generators. In practice, these operators typically need to be approximated from data. Popular approximation methods are extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) and generator extended mode decomposition (gEDMD). We propose a unified framework that leverages Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the operator of interest on a finite-dimensional space spanned by a set of basis functions. Our framework contains EDMD and gEDMD as special cases, but can also be used to approximate more general operators. Our key contributions are proofs of the convergence of the approximating operator and its spectrum under non-restrictive conditions. Moreover, we derive explicit convergence rates and account for the presence of noise in the observations. Whilst all these results are broadly applicable, they also refine previous analyses of EDMD and gEDMD. We verify the analytical results with the aid of several numerical experiments.</description>
