      <title>Is memory all you need? Data-driven Mori-Zwanzig modeling of Lagrangian particle dynamics in turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of Lagrangian particles in turbulence play a crucial role in mixing, transport, and dispersion processes in complex flows. Their trajectories exhibit highly non-trivial statistical behavior, motivating the development of surrogate models that can reproduce these trajectories without incurring the high computational cost of direct numerical simulations of the full Eulerian field. This task is particularly challenging because reduced-order models typically lack access to the full set of interactions with the underlying turbulent field. Novel data-driven machine learning techniques can be very powerful in capturing and reproducing complex statistics of the reduced-order/surrogate dynamics. In this work, we show how one can learn a surrogate dynamical system that is able to evolve a turbulent Lagrangian trajectory in a way that is point-wise accurate for short-time predictions (with respect to Kolmogorov time) and stable and statistically accurate at long times. This approach is based on the Mori--Zwanzig formalism, which prescribes a mathematical decomposition of the full dynamical system into resolved dynamics that depend on the current state and the past history of a reduced set of observables and the unresolved orthogonal dynamics due to unresolved degrees of freedom of the initial state. We show how by training this reduced order model on a point-wise error metric on short time-prediction, we are able to correctly learn the dynamics of the Lagrangian turbulence, such that also the long-time statistical behavior is stably recovered at test time. This opens up a range of new applications, for example, for the control of active Lagrangian agents in turbulence.</description>

      <title>Subharmonic entrainment and limit cycle modulation by high frequency excitation: A Renormalization group approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the possibility of a sub-harmonic $(1{:}2)$ entrainment and supercritical Hopf bifurcation in a van der Pol-Duffing oscillator that has been excited by two frequencies, comprising a slow parametric drive and a fast external forcing, through the variation of the amplitude of the external fast signal. We also deduce the condition for the threshold parametric strength required to generate sub-harmonic oscillation. The Blekhman perturbation (direct partition of motion) and the Renormalization group technique have been employed to study how the signal amplitude plays a pivotal role in modulating the limit cycle dynamics as well as the subharmonic generation. Studies of nonlinear responses and bifurcations of such driven nonlinear systems are usually done by treating the strength of the fast drive as the control parameter. Here we show that, beyond its role in allowing one to study the dynamics with the slow and fast components nicely separated, the amplitude of the high-frequency signal can also be treated as an independent control parameter for controlling both the limit cycle behavior and the onset of subharmonic oscillation in the oscillator. Our analytical estimations are well supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Propagation of extreme events in multiplex neuronal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous studies, the propagation of extreme events across nodes in monolayer networks has been extensively studied. In this work, we extend this investigation to explore the propagation of extreme events between two distinct layers in a multiplex network. We consider a two-layer network, where one layer is globally coupled and exhibits extreme events, while the second layer remains uncoupled. The interlayer connections between the layers are either unidirectional or bidirectional. We find that unidirectional coupling between the layers can induce extreme events in the uncoupled layer, whereas bidirectional coupling tends to mitigate extreme events in the globally coupled layer. To characterize extreme and non-extreme states, we use probability plots to identify distinct regions in the parameter space. Additionally, we study the robustness of extreme events emergence by examining various network topologies in the uncoupled layer. The mechanism behind the occurrence of extreme events is explored, with a particular focus on the transition from asynchronous states to a fully synchronized excitable state. For numerical simulations, we use nonidentical FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons at each node, which captures the dynamical behavior of both coupled and uncoupled layers. Our findings suggest that extreme events in the uncoupled layer emerge through the gradual disappearance of disorder, accompanied by occasional bursts of synchronized activity. Results obtained in this work will serve a starting point in understanding the dynamics behind the propagation of extreme events in real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Making rare events typical in $d$-dimensional chaotic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the deterministic nature of chaotic systems, fluctuations in their trajectories arise solely from the choice of initial conditions. Some of these dynamical fluctuations may lead to extremely unlikely scenarios. Understanding the impact of such rare events and the trajectories that give rise to them is of significant interest across disciplines. Yet, identifying the initial conditions responsible for those events is a challenging task due to the inherent sensitivity to small perturbations of chaotic dynamics. In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 227201 (2023)], this challenge was addressed by finding the effective dynamics that make rare events typical for one-dimensional chaotic maps. Here we extend such large-deviation framework to $d$-dimensional chaotic maps. Specifically, for any such map, we propose a method to find an effective topologically-conjugate map which reproduces the rare-event statistics in the long-time limit. We demonstrate the applicability of this result using several observables of paradigmatic examples of two-dimensional chaos, namely the two-dimensional tent map and Arnold's cat map.</description>
