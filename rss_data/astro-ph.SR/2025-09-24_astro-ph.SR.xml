      <title>Automatic Classification of Magnetic Chirality of Solar Filaments from H-Alpha Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we classify the magnetic chirality of solar filaments from H-Alpha observations using state-of-the-art image classification models. We establish the first reproducible baseline for solar filament chirality classification on the MAGFiLO dataset. The MAGFiLO dataset contains over 10,000 manually-annotated filaments from GONG H-Alpha observations, making it the largest dataset for filament detection and classification to date. Prior studies relied on much smaller datasets, which limited their generalizability and comparability. We fine-tuned several pre-trained, image classification architectures, including ResNet, WideResNet, ResNeXt, and ConvNeXt, and also applied data augmentation and per-class loss weights to optimize the models. Our best model, ConvNeXtBase, achieves a per-class accuracy of 0.69 for left chirality filaments and $0.73$ for right chirality filaments.</description>

      <title>Solar photospheric spectrum microvariability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding low-mass planets around solar-type stars requires to understand the physical variability of the host star, which greatly exceeds the planet-induced radial-velocity modulation. This project aims at analyzing - observationally and theoretically - the character and physical origins of fluctuations in solar photospheric absorption lines. Observationally, photospheric equivalent-width variations were measured in 1000 selected spectra from three years of HARPS-N data of the Sun-as-a-star, showing changes that largely shadow the chromospheric CaII H&amp;K activity-cycle signal, but with much smaller amplitudes on sub-percent levels. Among iron lines, the greatest are for FeII in the blue, while the trends change sign among lines in the green MgI triplet and between Balmer lines. No variation was seen in the semi-forbidden MgI 457.1 nm. Theoretically, hydrodynamic 3D modeling of solar surface convection produced time sequences of synthetic high-resolution spectral atlases. Radial velocities averaged over small simulation areas jitter by some +-150 m/s, scaling to 2 m/s for the full solar disk on timescales of granular convection. Among different lines, jittering is in phase, but amplitudes differ by about one tenth of their values: greater for stronger and for ionized lines, decreasing at longer wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulations Confirm Wave-Induced Shear Mixing in Stellar Interiors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internal Gravity Waves (IGWs) are thought to cause mixing in stellar interiors, a process that has been widely studied both theoretically and numerically. Our aim is to determine the physical mechanism responsible for the wave-induced mixing in stellar interiors. We compare the mixing profiles obtained from two-dimensional (2D) equatorial hydrodynamical and tracer particle simulations with theoretical predictions from R. J. Garcia Lopez &amp; H. C. Spruit (1991) and J. P. Zahn (1992) on wave mixing due to wave-induced shear turbulence. Our results show that, despite not satisfying the vertical shear instability threshold, the mixing profiles from the simulations agree remarkably well with the theoretical predictions of both prescriptions, strongly suggesting that shear from IGWs plays an important role in mixing even at low shear rates. This agreement remains robust across different stellar masses, ages, rotation and simulation parameters. This provides an important step in providing realistic parameterisations for wave mixing in stellar structure and evolution models.</description>

      <title>Selected $\beta$ Cephei pulsators in eclipsing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of five eclipsing binary systems containing $\beta$ Cephei-type pulsating components. These systems were identified using the high-precision Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry and complemented by high-resolution spectroscopic data from multiple instruments (e.g., HARPS, FEROS, UVES). For each target, we derived fundamental parameters including masses, radii, effective temperatures, and metallicities through a combined analysis of light curves and radial velocity data. The atmospheric parameters were determined via spectral disentangling and MCMC-based fitting techniques. Absolute parameters were used to position components on the HR diagram, and evolutionary status was assessed using MESA/MIST stellar tracks. Frequency analysis revealed multiple significant pulsation modes in all systems. Our study increases the number of well-characterized $\beta$ Cephei pulsators in binaries and provides high-precision benchmarks for stellar evolution and asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>The Timescales of Embedded Star Formation as Observed in STARFORGE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation occurs within dusty molecular clouds that are then disrupted by stellar feedback. However, the timing and physical mechanisms that govern the transition from deeply embedded to exposed stars remain uncertain. Using the STARFORGE simulations, we analyze the evolution of ``embeddedness'', identifying what drives emergence. We find the transition from embedded to exposed is fast for individual stars, within 1.3 Myr after the star reaches its maximum mass. This rapid transition is dominated by massive stars, which accrete while remaining highly obscured until their feedback eventually balances, then overcomes, the local accretion. For these massive stars, their maximum mass is reached simultaneously with their emergence. Once these stars are revealed, their localized, pre-supernova feedback then impacts the cloud, driving gas clearance. Because massive stars dominate the luminosity, their fast, local evolution dominates the light emergence from the dust. We calculate the dependence of these processes on the mass of the cloud and find that emergence always depends on when massive stars form, which scales with the cloud's free-fall time. We also examine the evolution of dust emission and H$\alpha$ luminosity. We find that dust dominates the luminosity for roughly 2 Myrs before stellar luminosity becomes more luminous. These results suggest that deeply embedded star-forming clusters tend to be rare compared to those partially exposed. Thus, because the initial embedding of the most luminous stars is highly local, the emergence of stars is a faster, earlier, more local event than the overall disruption of the cloud by gas expulsion.</description>

      <title>Theory, Simulations and Observations of Stellar Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar mergers are responsible for a large variety of astrophysical phenomena. They form blue straggler stars, give rise to spectacular transients, and produce some of the most massive stars in the Universe. Here, we focus on mergers from binary evolution and stellar collisions but do not cover mergers involving compact objects. We review how mergers come about, explain the physics and outcome of the merger process, discuss the evolution and ultimate fates of merged stars, and relate to observations. Our main conclusions are: (i) Mergers of main-sequence stars often fully rejuvenate and have interior structures similar to genuine single stars. (ii) Contrarily, mergers involving post-main-sequence stars can have interior structures that cannot be achieved by single-star evolution. Such merged stars may become long-lived blue supergiants that can explode in SN1987A-like events, interacting and superluminous supernovae, ultra-long gamma-ray bursts or collapse into very massive black holes. These black holes may even populate the pair-instability-supernova black-hole mass gap. (iii) Strong magnetic fields are produced in stellar mergers. Merged stars may thus be at the origin of some magnetic OBA stars and their descendants, highly magnetic white dwarfs and neutron stars. (iv) Initially, stellar merger products rotate rapidly, but there are several mechanisms that can quickly spin them down. Hence, merged stars may be rather slow rotators for most of their evolution.</description>

      <title>Southern massive stars at high angular resolution. Physical separations and mass ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. A key property of massive stars is their high degree of multiplicity, which can impact their evolution and end-of-life products. The Southern Massive Stars at High Angular Resolution survey (smash+) use interferometric and high-angular resolution techniques to detect companions at intermediate separations, from about 1 milli-arsec to 8"), a domain that so far has remained largely unexplored. Aims. In this paper, we convert the angular separations and magnitude contrasts into physical units, i.e. projected physical separations and mass ratios. We also derive the sensitivity of the survey for various physical and orbital parameters. Methods. We develop a spectral-type/luminosity class -- H-band luminosity -- mass calibration based on existing grids of physical parameters of OBA stars and we use these to obtain the photometric distance to each system, correcting for all known companions within the 2MASS point-spread function. We also derive the individual masses of the primaries and of each detected companion. Results The probability of detecting companions is very uniform within the sensitivity limits of the \smash\ survey. The projected separations follow a flat power-law distribution in log-separation. The obtained mass ratios are compatible with the power-law distributions derived for spectroscopic binaries. Finally, we find a uniform mass-ratio distribution up to ~100 AU. Beyond ~100 AU, we observe a lack of equal-mass companions, with an upper mass-ratio limit declining towards larger separations.</description>

      <title>Complexity-entropy analysis of solar photospheric turbulence: Hinode images of magnetic and Poynting fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatiotemporal inhomogeneous-homogeneous transition in the dynamics and structures of solar photospheric turbulence is studied by applying the complexity-entropy analysis to Hinode images of a vortical region of supergranular junctions in the quiet Sun. During a period of supergranular vortex expansion of 37.5 min, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the line-of-sight magnetic field and the horizontal electromagnetic energy flux display the characteristics of inverse turbulent cascade, evidenced by the formation of a large magnetic coherent structure via the merger of two small magnetic elements trapped by a long-duration vortex. Both magnetic and Poynting fluxes exhibit an admixture of chaos and stochasticity in the complexity-entropy plane, involving a temporal transition from low to high complexity and a temporal transition from high to low entropy during the period of vortex expansion, consistent with Hinode observations.</description>

      <title>Mass dependence of overshooting beneath convective envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the dependence of convective core overshooting on mass has attracted much attention, no corresponding work exists for overshooting below a convective envelope. We aim to quantify this relationship for pre-main sequence stars of intermediate mass ranging from $1.2 M_{\mathsf{sun}}$ to $6 M_{\mathsf{sun}}$. These stars have a similar thermal and density structure, making this a suitable choice to isolate the effect of changing mass. We produce a series of two-dimensional global simulations of stars using MUSIC, a fully compressible, time-implicit hydrodynamics code. The stars that we select for this study are near the end of the pre-main sequence and are convectively unstable above 80% of their stellar radius; they thus have a convective envelope that is shallower than the current sun. For this series of stellar models, a simple scaling with luminosity, with a scaling exponent of 1/4, accounts for the increasing overshooting with stellar mass. This result has interesting similarities with the scaling found by Baraffe et al. [2023] for a range of intermediate mass and massive stars at the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) that have convective cores.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Stellar Activity and Habitable zone: I. Ultraviolet Emission of Dwarfs in Open Clusters and Field Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-ultraviolet (NUV) radiation from dwarf stars plays a critical role in shaping the habitability of planetary systems, yet its long-term evolution across different spectral types remains poorly investigated. Based on GALEX NUV observations, we study the evolution of stellar NUV emission for a sample of 386,500 A- to M-type dwarfs spanning ages from 3 Myr to 10 Gyr, drawn from both open clusters and the field. The normalized NUV emission ($f_{\rm NUV}/f_{\rm J}$) is used to trace the evolutionary trends. Our results reveal distinct evolutionary pathways after considering the distance completeness: A and early-F dwarfs show a weak decline in NUV emission during the main-sequence phase; late-F to G dwarfs exhibit a clear decrease, consistent with continuous spin-down driven by magnetic braking; late-K and M-dwarfs undergo a rapid decline in NUV emission when they evolve from young stellar objects to main-sequence stars. Furthermore, we construct the evolutionary tracks of stellar ultraviolet habitable zone (UHZ). By comparing stellar circumstellar habitable zone (CHZ) and UHZ, we find that G- and K-type stars offer the most stable overlap between thermal and UV habitability over long-term evolution.</description>

      <title>Properties of Chromospheric Fibrils Around a Quiescent Filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fibrils are dynamic plasma structures in the solar chromosphere. Studying these structures is critical for understanding solar atmospheric heating and mass transportation. The purpose of this study is to obtain the characteristics of fibrils surrounding the filament. By employing high-resolution H-alpha data obtained from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST), we undertake a detailed analysis of the properties of 63 fibrils situated in the vicinity of the filament. Comparing the fibrils on both sides of the filament demonstrates that these fibrils have similar physical properties except for their orientation. The properties of fibrils are statistically measured, including lifetimes of 150-650 s, widths of 320-850 km, maximum lengths of 3-8.5 Mm, projection velocities of 7-29 km/s, and decelerations of 45-474 m/s2. The dominant oscillation period of fibrils is predominantly concentrated in the range of 4.8-6.6 minutes (2.5-3.5 mHz). Transverse oscillations are identified in a subset of fibrils, with periodicities of 269-289 s and phase speeds of 13.7-25.8 km/s, indicating the presence of kink-mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves.</description>

      <title>The Origins of Neutron-capture Elements In Globular Cluster M22</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical abundances of metal-poor stars in globular clusters provide important constraints on their evolutionary scenarios. Using both main r-process and weak r-process patterns, we fit the abundances of s-poor stars in the globular cluster M22. The coefficients of the main and weak r-process components are nearly constant for the sample stars, including s-rich stars. By accounting for the contribution of the s-process from low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars, the abundances of s-rich stars in M22 can also be fitted effectively. In addition, the increasing trend in the s-process component coefficients with rising [Fe/H] indicates a gradual increase in the contribution from low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars.</description>

      <title>Characterization and formation of the Mg i 12.32 {\mu}m line in the quiet Sun and sunspot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mg I 12.32 {\mu}m line is highly sensitive to magnetic fields due to its long wavelength, making it a promising tool for precise solar-magnetic-field measurements. The formation of this line is significantly influenced by nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects. Previous studies have shown that the Mg I 12.32 {\mu}m line exhibits different behaviors in various regions of the Sun. This study focuses on the peak intensity of the Mg I 12.32 {\mu}m line to analyze its relationship with the physical parameters of the solar atmosphere and its formation mechanism. We employed the Rybicki-Hummer (RH) 1.5D radiative transfer code to synthesize the Stokes profiles of the Mg I 12.32 {\mu}m line based on a three-dimensional solar atmospheric model of a sunspot and its surrounding quiet Sun. By computing Rxi{\Delta}xi, where Rxi is the average response function and {\Delta}xi is the difference in physical parameters between the two models being compared, we identified the atmospheric height and physical parameters that most significantly influence the normalized peak intensity in the quiet Sun and the active region, respectively. In analyzing the synthesized Stokes profiles, we found two key features: (1) in the quiet Sun, the normalized peak intensity is strong at the centers of the granules and weakens in the intergranular lanes; (2) in the sunspot umbra, the normalized peak intensity is generally weak, with only a few areas showing evident emission. Through the analysis of the response functions, we identified the causes of these differences. In addition, we discussed the mechanisms through which these physical parameters influence the normalized peak intensity.</description>

Abstract: We conducted a systematic spectral study for single F-type main-sequence (MS) stars without significant X-ray outbursts to investigate X-ray spectral properties such as temperature, emission measure (EM), and luminosity (Lx). To this end, 33 single stars with relatively rich X-ray photon statistics were selected by cross-matching large astronomical catalogs of the XMM-Newton source catalog and the Tycho-2 spectral type catalog. A positive correlation was found in the observed EM--EM-weighted temperature relationship as seen in late-type stars and it is also found in the relationship that our single F-type MS star samples have a plasma with an EM-weighted temperature of $\lesssim$1 keV and an EM of $\lesssim$10$^{53}$ cm$^{-3}$ corresponding to Lx of $\lesssim$10$^{30}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. These observational features for the single F-type MS stars are consistent with those of the single G dwarf stars, suggesting that there are no significant differences in their X-ray coronal properties. Additionally, the obtained relationship between the X-ray activity and the Rossby number reinforces this suggestion in the literature. Moreover, the upper bounds in EM and Lx were found to be unique signatures for single stars and not valid for binary stars. Our results suggest that the planetary evolution in terms of the X-ray properties around F-type MS stars can be understood by extending the frameworks developed for G-type stars.</description>

      <title>Impacts of small-scale dynamo on rotating columnar convection in stellar convection zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the complex interactions between convection, magnetic fields, and rotation is key to modeling the internal dynamics of the Sun and stars. Under rotational influence, compressible convection forms prograde-propagating convective columns near the equator. The interaction between such rotating columnar convection and the small-scale dynamo (SSD) remains largely unexplored. We investigate the influence of the SSD on the properties of rotating convection in the equatorial regions of solar and stellar convection zones. A series of rotating compressible magnetoconvection simulations is performed using a local f-plane box model at the equator. The flux-based Coriolis number Co is varied systematically. To isolate the effects of the SSD, we compare results from hydrodynamic (HD) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. The SSD affects both convective heat and angular momentum transport. In MHD cases, convective velocity decreases more rapidly with increasing Co than in HD cases. This reduction is compensated by enhanced entropy fluctuations, maintaining overall heat transport efficiency. Furthermore, a weakly subadiabatic layer is maintained near the base of the convection zone even under strong rotational influence when the SSD is present. These behaviors reflect a change in the dominant force balance: the SSD introduces a magnetostrophic balance at small scales, while geostrophic balance persists at larger scales. The inclusion of the SSD also reduces the dominant horizontal scale of columnar convective modes by enhancing the effective rotational influence. Regarding angular momentum transport, the SSD generates Maxwell stresses that counteract the Reynolds stresses, thereby quenching the generation of mean shear flows. These SSD effects should be accounted for in models of solar and stellar convection.</description>

      <title>Linking Young Stellar Object Morphology to Evolutionary Stages with Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies in the past few decades have investigated young stellar object evolution based on their spectral energy distribution (SED). The SED is heavily influenced not only by evolutionary stage, but also the morphology of the young star. This work is part of the NEMESIS project which is aiming to revisit star formation with the aid of machine learning techniques and provides the framework for this work. In a first effort towards a novel spectro-morphological classification we analyzed young stellar object morphologies and linked them to the currently used observational classes. Thereby we aim to lay the foundation for a spectro-morphological classification, and apply the insights learned in this study in a future, revisited classification scheme. We obtained archival high-resolution survey images from VISTA for approximately 10,000 literature young stellar object candidates towards the Orion star formation complex (OSFC). Utilizing a Self-Organizing map (SOM) algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning method, we created a grid of morphological prototypes from near- and mid-infrared images. Furthermore, we determined which prototypes are most representative of the different observational classes, derived from the infrared spectral index, via Bayesian inference. We present our grids of morphological prototypes of young stellar objects in the near-infrared, which were created purely from observational data. They are thus non-dependent on theoretical models. In addition, we show maps that indicate the probability for a prototype belonging to any of the observational classes. We find that SOMs created from near-infrared images are a useful tool, with limitations, to identify characteristic morphologies of young stellar objects in different evolutionary stages. This first step lays the foundation for a spectro-morphological classification of young stellar objects to be developed in the future.</description>

      <title>Internal dynamics and structure of Cepheus OB4. The asymmetric expansion of Berkeley 59</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate measurements of young stellar cluster internal dynamics provide crucial insights into their formation. With Gaia, we are now able to trace stellar motions and study the dynamics of star clusters with unprecedented precision, but this requires a reliable list of probable members. We examine a 2 deg-radius region in Cepheus OB4, centered on the young cluster Berkeley 59, to build a reliable candidate member list, enabling the study of the cluster's structure, kinematics, and stellar population. We compiled a catalog of optical and near-infrared photometry, along with precise positions and proper motions from Gaia DR3, for sources in the Cepheus OB4 field. Membership probabilities were determined using a probabilistic random forest algorithm and further refined by requiring HR diagram positions consistent with a young age. From a list of 1030 probable members, we estimate a distance of 1009+-12 pc to Berkeley 59. Masses, extinction, and ages were derived by fitting the spectral energy distributions to atmospheric and evolutionary models, while internal dynamics was analyzed using proper motions relative to the cluster's mean motion. Berkeley 59 exhibits an asymmetric expansion pattern with velocity increasing outward and a preferred motion toward the north. The IMF between 0.4 and 7 MSun follows a single power law (dN/dM \propto M**-alpha), with the slope alpha=2.3+-0.3, consistent with Salpeter's slope and previous studies in the region. The region's median age, estimated from the HR diagram, is 2.9 Myr. The velocity dispersion of Berkeley 59 exceeds the virial velocity dispersion derived from its total mass (650+-30 MSun) and half-mass radius (1.71+-0.13 pc). The 2D motions of a stellar group located about 1 deg north of Berkeley 59 provide further support for the previously proposed triggered star formation scenario. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Low-Latitude Sunspot Group Tilt Angles in 15-24 Activity Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analysis of the tilt angles of the active regions in 15-24 activity cycles was performed. We used data from measurements of magnetic fields in the sunspot umbra in the period 1918 -2019 at the Mount Wilson Observatory, as well as the tilt angles of active regions in 'white' light at the Kodaikanal and Mount Wilson observatories in activity cycles 15-21. The mean tilt angles of active regions $\overline{\gamma}$ and the slope $\mu$ from latitude $\theta$ in the activity cycles are considered. Low-latitude bipoles are the most important in predicting the strength of solar cycles. In this work, we selected the cutoff latitude $\theta_{cut}$ at which the highest correlation is observed with the strength of the next activity cycle for active regions with latitude $\theta&lt;\theta_{cut}$. It was found that for magnetic field measurement data, the highest correlation of the parameters $\overline{\gamma}$ and $\mu$ with the strength of the next solar activity cycle is characteristic of bipoles in the equatorial zone with $\theta&lt;\theta_{cut}\approx 14.2^o$. For white light observation data, $\theta_{cut}\approx 8.5^o$ for Mount Wilson observatory and $\theta_{cut}\approx 9.4^o$ for Kodaikanal observatory.</description>

      <title>3D Macro Physics and Light Odd-Z Element Production in O-C Shell Mergers: Implications for $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ production and radiogenic heating inventories of rocky exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The light odd-Z elements P, Cl, K, and Sc are underproduced in galactic chemical evolution models compared to spectroscopic observations of stars in the Milky Way. The most promising solution to this puzzle is that some massive stars experience O-C shell mergers boosting their yields through dynamic, convective-reactive nucleosynthesis. We report how convective macro physics based on 3D $4\pi$ hydrodynamic simulations impacts production in the O shell by post-processing the $\mathrm{M_{ZAMS}}=15~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ $Z=0.02$ model from the NuGrid dataset. We explore a mixing downturn, boosted velocities, reduced ingestion rate, and convective quenching. Across 24 mixing cases, the pre-explosive yields for [P/Fe], [Cl/Fe], [K/Fe], and [Sc/Fe] are modified by $[-0.33,0.23]~\mathrm{dex}$, $[-0.84,0.64]~\mathrm{dex}$, $[-0.78,1.48]~\mathrm{dex}$, and $[-0.36,1.29]~\mathrm{dex}$, respectively. Cases with a convective downturn with the fastest ingestion rate have the largest enhancement, and production is non-monotonic with boosted velocities. Which reactions are most important for the convective-reactive element production pathways depends on the mixing. We parameterize production of $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ ($t_{1/2} = 1.248~\mathrm{Gyr}$), an important radiogenic heat source for younger ($2{-}3~\mathrm{Gyr}$) rocky planets and find a yield variation exceeding three orders of magnitude. This range of initial abundances for $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ implies the early geodynamic behaviour of silicate mantles in rocky planets can differ greatly from that of Earth. These results underscore the importance of investigating the 3D macro physics of shell merger convection through hydrodynamic simulations to develop a predictive understanding of the origin and variability of the light odd-Z elements and the $^{40}\mathrm{K}/\mathrm{K}$ ratio in planet host stars.</description>

      <title>Variability of the DG Tau Forbidden Emission Line Low Velocity Component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Forbidden Emission Lines (FELs) come from transitions with long radiative decay times needing low density gas where collisions between atoms are rare. They are produced in the outflows driven by young stellar objects. These lines trace distinct velocity components, including a Low Velocity Component (LVC), which may be tracing a magneto hydrodynamic (MHD) or photoevaporative (PE) wind. We study the jet and LVC of the star DG Tau, whose jet velocity has decreased since 2006. We aim to investigate a link between the high velocity jet and the LVC and clarify the LVC origin as an MHD or PE wind by studying spectral \&amp; spatial changes over time. Using kinematic fitting \&amp; spectro-astrometry, we analyse three epochs of spectra spanning ~18 years. A ~100 km/s decrease in velocity from 2003 to 2021 aligns with known slowing of the jet. Fitting of the [O I] {\lambda}6300, [O I] {\lambda}5577, and [S II] {\lambda}6731 lines reveal complex FEL profiles, with up to six blue-shifted components and a redshifted wing, in agreement with Chou et al. (2025). We see three LVC sub-components (LVC-H, LVC-M, and LVC-L) that are consistent with entrained jet material, disk wind, and dense upper disk atmosphere respectively. While jet components vary in time, the LVC remains quite stable, with changes in the relative brightness of each sub-component. The results cannot distinguish between a MHD or PE wind origin for the LVC. A limit of less than 2 au is put on the de projected height of the LVC-M in [O I] {\lambda}5577, where there is no jet contribution. This supports a disk wind and may favor an MHD wind origin. The near constant peak velocity of LVC-M needs further study in context of a shared origin for jets and MHD winds. Future work needs observations with higher spectral resolution and time cadence to resolve blended components and examine a possible time lag between changes in the jet and LVC.</description>

      <title>A search for Be stars in multiple systems within the solar neighborhood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Be stars are widely considered to be the product of binary interaction. However, whether all Be stars are formed via binary interaction is unclear, and detailed estimates of the multiplicity of Be stars and characterization of their components are required. In this study, we present speckle observations of 76 Be stars taken using the Gemini North and South speckle imagers spanning angular separations of 20 mas-1.2", reaching contrasts ${\Delta}$m~5-6 mag at separations around 0.1". We identify 11 (6 previously unreported) binaries having separations in the 10-1000 au range, and ${\Delta}$m between 0.8-5 mag in our sample. Using archival data to search for components outside our visibility range, we add further multiples (16), which include three triples, leading to a total of 24 multiple systems. Our findings rule out a multiplicity fraction &gt;27% at the 3${\sigma}$ level within the speckle observations separation range and detection limits. Future homogeneous spectroscopic/interferometric observations are essential to probe the inner separations, and along with analysis of available astrometry can cover the entire separation range to characterize the multiplicity fraction, and evolutionary scenario of Be stars.</description>

      <title>Deep chemical tagging - Identifying open clusters and moving groups in chemical space with graph attention networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the formation history of the Milky Way is hindered by stellar migration, which erases kinematic birth signatures. In contrast, stellar chemical abundances remain stable and can be used to trace stars back to their birth environments through chemical tagging. This study aims to improve chemical tagging by developing a method that leverages kinematic and age information to enhance clustering in chemical space, while remaining grounded in chemistry. We implement a graph attention auto-encoder that encodes stars as nodes with chemical features and connects them via edges based on orbital similarity and age. The network learns an ``informed'' chemical space that accentuates coherent groupings.Applied to $\sim$47,000 APOGEE thin disk stars, the method identifies 282 stellar groups. Among them, five out of six open clusters are successfully recovered. Other groups align with the known moving groups Arch/Hat, Sirius, Hyades, and Hercules. Our approach enables chemically grounded yet kinematically and age informed chemical tagging. It significantly improves the identification of coherent stellar populations, offering a framework for future large-scale stellar archaeology efforts.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analysis of Three Microlensing Planet Candidates with the Planet/Binary Degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present observations and analyses of three high-magnification microlensing events: KMT-2022-BLG-0954, KMT-2024-BLG-0697, and MOA-2024-BLG-018. All three exhibit the "Planet/Binary" degeneracy, with planetary solutions corresponding to mass ratios in the range $-3.7 &lt; \log q &lt; -2.2$, while the binary solutions yield $\log q &gt; -2.0$. For KMT-2022-BLG-0954, we identify a previously unrecognized degeneracy among planetary solutions, involving different mass ratios and normalized source radii. In all three cases, single-lens binary-source models are excluded. Bayesian analyses suggest that the planetary solutions correspond to gas giants orbiting M/K dwarfs beyond the snow line, while KMT-2022-BLG-0954 also admits an alternative interpretation as a super-Earth orbiting a late-type M dwarf. The binary solutions imply a diverse set of systems, including M-dwarf pairs and M-dwarf--brown-dwarf binaries. A review of known events subject to the "Planet/Binary" degeneracy shows that in most cases the degeneracy cannot be resolved through follow-up high-resolution imaging, particularly in the presence of the newly identified degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Tidally-Controlled Fragmentation around Black Holes, Massive Clumps, Protostars, and the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravity plays important roles at multiple scales in the universe. An important, yet often neglected, role of gravity is its ability in driving anisotropic fragmentation through tides. When tides dominate, fragmentation becomes anisotropic, and the Jeans length along the short axis, $l_{\rm tidal, Jeans}$, is approximately $\sigma_{\rm v}/\sqrt{G \rho_{\rm mean}}$, determined by the external tides through the mean density $\rho_{\rm mean}$. We compare predictions of $l_{\rm tidal, Jeans}$ against observational results in massive star-forming clumps, the Circumnuclear Disk (CND) around the supermassive black hole Sgr A* at the center of the Galaxy, the Central Molecular Zone in the Galactic Center, a hub-filament system, and a streamer around a young star. We find that the observed widths of these filamentary structures match theoretical predictions from tidally-controlled Jeans fragmentation. The formation of filaments can potentially shield cold gas against radiation pressure and photoevaporation, as well as hydrodynamical interaction with the ambient medium, potentially enabling the cold gas to survive. Thus, tidal forces are major players regulating gas transport around massive objects.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of the interstellar medium using Gaia: A catalogue of 102 YSO-MC associations within 3.5 kpc from the Sun with 3D velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinematic information is crucial for understanding the evolution of complex systems, such as interstellar gas. Obtaining full 3D kinematic information is a crucial final step for modeling and interpretation. Molecular clouds are nurseries where stars are born. Stars at a very early stage, like young stellar objects (YSOs), inherit the spatial and kinematic structure of the gas patches they originate from. In this paper, we combine measurements of radial velocities towards the gas and the kinematic information of YSOs from Gaia DR3 to derive 3D velocities of a sample of YSO (Young Stellar Object)-MC (Molecular Cloud) complexes at d$\lesssim$3.5kpc from the Sun. We find that the molecular interstellar medium traced by the YSO-MC complexes generally follows Galactic rotation, with an additional peculiar velocity of 8.6 km s$^{-1}$. The random motion of these complexes in the Galactic XY plane is more energetic than motion along the Z direction. A catalogue containing the 3D velocities of the YSO-MC complexes at different reference frames is available, and the distances and 3D velocities of well-known molecular clouds are presented. Our results set the foundation for exploring the interplay between the Galaxy, the molecular ISM, and star formation. Data available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16364877.</description>

      <title>TOI-2155b: a high-mass brown dwarf near the hydrogen burning mass limit from the TESS mission</title>

Abstract: We present TOI-2155 b, a high-mass transiting brown dwarf discovered using data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission and confirmed with ground-based radial velocity measurements from the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES). We also analyze ground-based follow-up photometric data from the Wendelstein Observatory (WST), Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT), and Wild Boar Remote Observatory (WBR). TOI-2155 b is a short-period brown dwarf with a period of 3.7246950 +0.0000029/-0.0000028 days. The radius and mass of TOI-2155 b are found to be 0.975 +/- 0.008 Jupiter radii and 81.1 +/- 1.1 Jupiter masses, respectively, corresponding to a density of 110 +/- 3 g/cm3. The effective temperature of the subgiant host star is estimated at 6085 +/- 78 K, which identifies it as an F-type star with a radius of 1.705 +0.066/-0.064 solar radii and a mass of 1.33 +/- 0.008 solar masses. With a mass close to the hydrogen-burning limit, TOI-2155 b occupies a high-mass regime in the brown dwarf mass-radius diagram, making it a valuable benchmark system for testing models of substellar structure and evolution.</description>

      <title>Silicate Precursor Silane detected in Cold Low-Metallicity Brown Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within 20 pc of the Sun there are currently 29 known cold brown dwarfs, sources with measured distances and an estimated effective temperature between that of Jupiter (170K) and ~500K. These sources are almost all isolated and are the closest laboratories we have for detailed atmospheric studies of giant planets formed outside the solar system. Here we report JWST observations of one such source, WISEA J153429.75-104303.3 (W1534), which we confirm is a substellar mass member of the Galactic halo with a metallicity &lt;0.01xsolar. Its spectrum reveals methane (CH4), water (H2O), and silane (SiH4) gas. Although SiH4 is expected to serve as a key reservoir for the cloud-forming element Si in gas giant worlds, it eluded detection until now because it is removed from observable atmospheres by the formation of silicate clouds at depth. These condensates are favored with increasing metallicity, explaining why SiH4 remains undetected on well studied, metal-rich solar system worlds like Jupiter and Saturn. On the metal-poor world W1534, we detect a clear signature of SiH4 centered at ~4.55 microns with an abundance of 19+/-2 parts per billion (ppb). Our chemical modelling suggests that this SiH4 abundance may be quenched at ~kilobar levels just above the silicate cloud layers, whereupon vertical atmospheric mixing can transport SiH4 to the observable photosphere. The formation and detection of SiH4 demonstrates key coupled relationships between composition, cloud formation, and atmospheric mixing in cold brown dwarf and planetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Wideband Polarimetry of the April 2021 Profile Change Event in PSR J1713+0747</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The millisecond pulsar PSR J1713+0747 is a high-priority target for pulsar timing array experiments due to its long-term timing stability, and bright, narrow pulse profile. In April 2021, PSR~J1713$+$0747 underwent a significant profile change event, observed by several telescopes worldwide. Using the broad-bandwidth and polarimetric fidelity of the Ultra-Wideband Low-frequency receiver on Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope, we investigated the long-term spectro-polarimetric behaviour of this profile change in detail. We highlight the broad-bandwidth nature of the event, which exhibits frequency dependence that is inconsistent with cold-plasma propagation effects. We also find that spectral and temporal variations are stronger in one of the orthogonal polarisation modes than the other, and observe mild variations ($\sim 3$ - $5\,\sigma$ significance) in circular polarisation above 1400 MHz following the event. However, the linear polarisation position angle remained remarkably stable in the profile leading edge throughout the event. With over three years of data post-event, we find that the profile has not yet recovered back to its original state, indicating a long-term asymptotic recovery, or a potential reconfiguration of the pulsar's magnetic field. These findings favour a magnetospheric origin of the profile change event over a line-of-sight propagation effect in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). XX: Constraining the Chemical Tracers of Young Protostellar Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies indicate that the formation of planets in protoplanetary disks begins early in the embedded Class 0/I phases of protostellar evolution. The physical and chemical makeup of the embedded phase can provide valuable insights into the process of star and planet formation. This study aims to provide a thorough overview of the various morphologies for molecular emissions observed on disk scales toward nearby embedded sources. We present high angular resolution (0.1", 15 au) molecular line emissions for $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, SO, SiO, DCN, CH$_3$OH, H$_2$CO, and c-C$_3$H$_2$ towards 19 nearby protostellar sources in the context of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Large Program "Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk)". Emissions in $^{12}$CO are seen towards all sources and primarily trace outflowing materials. A few sources also show high-velocity jets in SiO emission and high-velocity channel maps of $^{12}$CO. The $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O emissions are well-known tracers of high-density regions and trace the inner envelope and disk regions with clear signs of rotation seen at continuum scales. The large-scale emissions of $^{13}$CO also delineate the outflow cavity walls where the outflowing and infalling materials interact with each other, and exposure to UV radiation leads to the formation of hydrocarbons such as c-C$_3$H$_2$. Both DCN and CH$_3$OH, when detected, show compact emissions from the inner envelope and disk regions that peak at the position of the protostar. The CH$_3$OH emissions are contained within the region of DCN emissions, which suggests that CH$_3$OH traces the hot core regions. Likewise, a few sources also display emissions in CH$_3$OH towards the outflow. Both SO and H$_2$CO show complex morphology among the sources, suggesting that they are formed through multiple processes in protostellar systems.</description>

      <title>Recalibration of the H$\alpha$ surface brightness-radius relation for planetary nebulae using Gaia DR3: new distances and the Milky Way oxygen radial gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial distribution of chemical elements in the Galactic disk provides key constraints on models of galaxy evolution. However, studies using planetary nebulae (PNe) as tracers have been historically limited by large uncertainties in their distances. To overcome the long-standing distance uncertainties, we recalibrated the H$\alpha$ surface brightness-radius relation (Frew et al. 2016) with Gaia DR3 parallaxes, deriving statistical distances for 1,200 PNe and Bayesian distances for 419 objects with reliable parallaxes. Adopting Bayesian values preferentially, we determined the O/H radial gradient for 230 disk PNe. We tested three models: a single linear gradient, a segmented fit with one break, and a segmented fit with two breaks. Although model selection is statistically inconclusive, segmented fits indicate a change in slope near the solar radius ($R \sim 8$ kpc), with a flatter or slightly positive gradient inward and a steeper negative gradient outward. This feature may reflect changes in star formation efficiency driven by the Galactic bar or the corotation resonance of the spiral arms. Comparison with other tracers - Cepheids, red giants, and open clusters - shows qualitative consistency. The two-dimensional O/H distribution in the Galactic plane supports the adopted distances and reveals modest azimuthal asymmetry, with enhanced abundances near the bar at positive longitudes, and a bimodal abundance structure between the inner and outer solar regions. Our results provide new constraints on the chemical evolution of the Milky Way, the impact of non-axisymmetric structures, and the possible existence of distinct radial abundance regimes across the Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>Systematic non-thermal velocity increase preceding soft X-ray flare onset: A large-scale Hinode/EIS study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-thermal velocities, derived from spectral line broadening, can provide crucial insights into plasma dynamics before and during solar flares. To systematically study the pre-flare phase, we constructed a Hinode/Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) flare catalog of 1,449 flares from 2011--2024. This enabled a large-scale analysis of flare loop footpoint non-thermal velocity evolution across different flare magnitudes (C, M, X-classes). Analyzing Fe VIII--Fe XXIV emission lines formed at $\log(T/K) \sim 5.7-7.3$ with piecewise linear fits in the pre-flare period, we find that non-thermal velocities consistently increase 4--25 minutes before GOES soft X-ray start in C and M-class flares. Onset timing patterns vary with flare magnitude: smaller flares show temperature-dependent progression, while larger flares exhibit more compressed, near-simultaneous onsets across temperatures. While our limited X-class sample ($N=18$) also show onset before GOES, larger statistics are needed to confirm its behavior. M-class flares show a systematic precursor non-thermal velocity onset $\sim$30--60 minutes before GOES peak. In a subset of M-class flares (2011--2018), CME-associated events show earlier and more uniform precursor onsets (45--74 minutes before peak) than non-CME events, of which only some lines display a precursor, suggesting a strong link between extended pre-flare non-thermal broadening and successful eruptions. This large scale study establishes pre-flare non-thermal velocity increase at footpoints as a common precursor observable before any X-ray signature.</description>

      <title>Three-component Phase Separation for Ultramassive White Dwarf Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate phase separation in oxygen-neon (O/Ne) ultramassive white dwarfs (UMWDs). Current stellar evolution codes, such as MESA, only account for $\mathrm{^{16}O/^{20}Ne}$ separation and do not include other minor species. To improve this, we implement ternary phase diagrams into MESA. We construct UMWD models with O/Ne/sodium (Na) and O/Ne/magnesium (Mg) cores to test our implementation. We also assess the effect of including $\mathrm{^{22}Ne}$ in the current two-species framework. Our results show that incorporating additional components into the phase separation significantly alters the chemical evolution of UMWDs. Heavier elements preferentially enrich the solid core, enhancing mixing in the overlying liquid. We compute the buoyancy flux driven by compositional instabilities during crystallization. As in previous studies, we find two convective regimes: an early, fast overturning convection, lasting less than a million years, followed by inefficient (thermohaline) convection. The fast convective regime lasts up to 100 times longer with three-species separation compared to the standard $\mathrm{^{16}O/^{20}Ne}$ case. We find that neutron-rich species can have a significant contribution to the buoyancy flux despite their small mass fraction (&lt;10\%). We compute the amount of cooling delay induced by phase separation in UMWDs, and find that the three-species phase separation produces a delay up to $\sim10$ times larger than the simplest case of fractionation, although still less than 1 Gyr. We predict that the change in the composition profile in the liquid region when three components are included should change the frequency of gravity modes that can propagate in the interior of pulsating UMWDs.</description>

      <title>Magnetic activity and differential rotation of HIP12653</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic and photometric study of HIP12653 to investigate its magnetic cycle and differential rotation. Using HARPS archival spectra matched with MARCS-AMBER theoretical templates, we derive the stellar parameters (Teff, logg, FeH, and vsini) of the target. The S-index, an activity indicator based on the emission of the CaII H&amp;K lines, is fitted to determine the magnetic cycle and rotation periods. We refine the magnetic cycle period to 5799.20 \pm 0.88 d and suggest the existence of a secondary, shorter cycle of 674.6922 \pm 0.0098 d, making HIP12653 the youngest star known to exhibit such a short activity cycle. During the minimum activity phase, a rotation period of 4.8 d is estimated. This is notably different from the 7-day period obtained when measurements during minimum activity are excluded, suggesting that these two periods are rotation periods at different latitudes. To explore this hypothesis, we introduce a novel light curve fitting method that incorporates multiple harmonics to model different spot configurations. Applied to synthetic light curves, the method recovers at least two rotation periods close to the true input values in 92.1% of cases. The inferred rotation shear shows a median deviation of 0.0011 \pm 0.0003 and a standard deviation of 0.0177 \pm 0.0002 from the true value. Applying this approach to TESS photometric data from 2018 to 2023, we detect three distinct rotation periods, 4.8 d, 5.7 d, and 7.7 d, (along with a signal at 3.75 d interpreted as its first harmonic), consistent with spots located at different latitudes. Assuming a solar-like differential rotation, we estimate an inclination of 34.0 \pm 1.8^\circ and a rotational shear of \alpha = 0.38 \pm 0.01. These results confirm the 4.8-d period and demonstrate that differential rotation can be constrained by tracking rotation period changes across different phases of the magnetic cycle.</description>

      <title>VVV-WIT-13: an eruptive young star with cool molecular features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we investigate an infrared eruptive source, identified from the decade-long VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea survey (VVV). We named this target after a group of variable sources discovered by VVV, as VVV-WIT-13, with WIT standing for "What Is This?", due to its unique photometric variation behaviour and the mysterious origin of the outburst. This target exhibited an outburst with a 5.7 mag amplitude in the Ks-band, remained on its brightness plateau for 3.5 years, and then rapidly faded to its pre-eruptive brightness afterwards. We aim to reveal the variable nature and outburst origin of VVV-WIT-13 by presenting our follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations along with theoretical models. We gathered photometric time series in both near- and mid-infrared wavelengths. We obtained near-infrared spectra during the outburst and decaying stages on XSHOOTER/VLT and FIRE/Magellan, and then fitted the detected molecular absorption features using models from ExoMol. We applied 2D numerical simulations to re-create the observables of the eruptive phenomenon. We observe deep AlO absorption bands in the infrared spectra of VVV-WIT-13, during the outburst stage, along with other more common absorption bands (e.g. CO). Our best-fit model suggests a 600 K temperature of the AlO absorption band. In the decaying stage, the AlO bands disappeared, whilst broad blue-shifted H2 lines arose, a common indicator of stellar wind and outflow. The observational evidence suggests that the CO and TiO features originate from an outflow or a wind environment. We find that VVV-WIT-13 is an eruptive young star with instability occurring in the accretion disk. One favoured theoretical explanation of this event is a disrupted gas clump at a distance of 3 au from the source. If confirmed, this would be the first such event observed in real time.</description>

      <title>Microphysical Regulation of Non-Ideal MHD in Weakly-Ionized Systems: Does the Hall Effect Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations plus 'non-ideal' (Ohmic, Hall, ambipolar) resistivities are widely used to model weakly-ionized astrophysical systems. We show that if gradients in the magnetic field become too steep, the implied charge drift speeds become much faster than microphysical signal speeds, invalidating the assumptions used to derive both the resistivities and MHD equations themselves. Generically this situation will excite microscale instabilities that suppress the drift and current. We show this could be relevant at low ionization fractions especially if Hall terms appear significant, external forces induce supersonic motions, or dust grains become a dominant charge carrier. Considering well-established treatments of super-thermal drifts in laboratory, terrestrial, and Solar plasmas as well as conduction and viscosity models, we generalize a simple prescription to rectify these issues, where the resistivities are multiplied by a correction factor that depends only on already-known macroscopic quantities. This is generalized for multi-species and weakly-ionized systems, and leaves the equations unchanged in the drift limits for which they are derived, but restores physical behavior (driving the system back towards slow drift by diffusing away small-scale gradients in the magnetic field) if the limits are violated. This has important consequences: restoring intuitive behaviors such as the system becoming hydrodynamic in the limit of zero ionization; suppressing magnetic structure on scales below a critical length which can comparable to circumstellar disk sizes; limiting the maximum magnetic amplification; and suppressing the effects of the Hall term in particular. This likely implies that the Hall term does not become dynamically important under most conditions of interest in these systems.</description>

      <title>MauveSim: the instrument simulator software for the Blue Skies Space Mauve satellite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MauveSim, the instrument simulator software for Mauve, the latest mission from Blue Skies Space dedicated to time-domain stellar astronomy. MauveSim functions as an end-to-end simulator, employing the most up-to-date knowledge of the instrument's performance and characteristics that will be reviewed and updated after commissioning. The software accepts a stellar spectrum - either observed or synthetic - as input and produces a simulated observation. The tool thus enables the assessment of various scientific objectives, as well as determining limiting magnitudes and conducting signal-to-noise (S/N) analyses. The results of MauveSim have been validated against instrument performance data from extensive ground testing campaigns, ensuring that the software reflects the most up-to-date understanding of the payload performance. Accessible to all scientists involved in the mission, MauveSim serves as a crucial tool for target selection and observation planning.</description>

      <title>Unified Solar Modulation Potential for Same-Charge Cosmic Rays and Implications for Local Interstellar Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10742</link>

Abstract: The energy spectra of cosmic rays (CRs) below tens of GeV are significantly modulated by solar activity within the heliosphere. To investigate the properties of Galactic CRs, it is important to determine the unmodulated local interstellar spectrum (LIS). Recent high-precision temporal measurements of CR energy spectra, released by the AMS-02 collaboration, provide a crucial observational foundation for this endeavor. In this study, we employ the widely used force-field approximation (FFA) model to analyze the AMS-02 data, and attempt to derive the LIS for CR protons and positrons. By applying a non-LIS method, we derive temporal variations of the relative solar modulation potential, $\Delta\phi$, for individual particle species. Our analysis demonstrates that the FFA provides sufficient accuracy in explaining the AMS-02 spectral measurements of all particles during the low solar activity period. Notably, the derived $\Delta\phi(t)$ for protons and positrons, as well as for electrons and antiprotons, exhibit excellent consistency, indicating that particles with the same charge sign can be effectively described within a unified FFA framework during the low solar activity period. Having established a well-constrained proton LIS and its associated modulation potential, we apply the common modulation behavior between positrons and protons to demodulate the AMS-02 positron measurements, and derive the positron LIS without necessitating prior knowledge of its characteristics. This LIS is useful for quantitative investigations into potential exotic origins of CR positrons.</description>

      <title>Fractality of open clusters in singles, pairs, and groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the global structural properties and fractality of 1,876 open clusters (OCs) in different environments, including 1,145 singles, 392 pairs, and 339 groups. We analyze cluster mass, age, size, concentration, and fractal structure using the Q parameter and the fractal dimension fdim, and examine their correlations with key physical parameters. Our results reveal systematic environmental trends: clusters in groups are generally younger, less massive, slightly larger, and less centrally concentrated than those in pairs or singles. Fractality is more pronounced in clusters within pairs and groups, with 44% of group clusters exhibiting fractal substructure compared to 38.5% for pairs and 33.2% for singles. Similarly, median fdim values increase from singles (1.13) to pairs (1.16) to groups (1.25), reflecting greater substructure in denser environments. These findings indicate that both intrinsic cluster properties and environmental context significantly influence cluster evolution. More massive clusters tend to evolve toward centrally concentrated, radially symmetric configurations, while less massive clusters retain fractal features for longer periods. Overall, our study demonstrates that open clusters do not evolve in isolation: interactions with the environment play a critical role in shaping their structural evolution and dynamical state.</description>
