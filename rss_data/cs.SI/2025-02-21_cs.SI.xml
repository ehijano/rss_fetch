      <title>DAG: Deep Adaptive and Generative $K$-Free Community Detection on Attributed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection on attributed graphs with rich semantic and topological information offers great potential for real-world network analysis, especially user matching in online games. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently enabled Deep Graph Clustering (DGC) methods to learn cluster assignments from semantic and topological information. However, their success depends on the prior knowledge related to the number of communities $K$, which is unrealistic due to the high costs and privacy issues of acquisition.In this paper, we investigate the community detection problem without prior $K$, referred to as $K$-Free Community Detection problem. To address this problem, we propose a novel Deep Adaptive and Generative model~(DAG) for community detection without specifying the prior $K$. DAG consists of three key components, \textit{i.e.,} a node representation learning module with masked attribute reconstruction, a community affiliation readout module, and a community number search module with group sparsity. These components enable DAG to convert the process of non-differentiable grid search for the community number, \textit{i.e.,} a discrete hyperparameter in existing DGC methods, into a differentiable learning process. In such a way, DAG can simultaneously perform community detection and community number search end-to-end. To alleviate the cost of acquiring community labels in real-world applications, we design a new metric, EDGE, to evaluate community detection methods even when the labels are not feasible. Extensive offline experiments on five public datasets and a real-world online mobile game dataset demonstrate the superiority of our DAG over the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. DAG has a relative increase of 7.35\% in teams in a Tencent online game compared with the best competitor.</description>

      <title>A Macro- and Micro-Hierarchical Transfer Learning Framework for Cross-Domain Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain fake news detection aims to mitigate domain shift and improve detection performance by transferring knowledge across domains. Existing approaches transfer knowledge based on news content and user engagements from a source domain to a target domain. However, these approaches face two main limitations, hindering effective knowledge transfer and optimal fake news detection performance. Firstly, from a micro perspective, they neglect the negative impact of veracity-irrelevant features in news content when transferring domain-shared features across domains. Secondly, from a macro perspective, existing approaches ignore the relationship between user engagement and news content, which reveals shared behaviors of common users across domains and can facilitate more effective knowledge transfer. To address these limitations, we propose a novel macro- and micro- hierarchical transfer learning framework (MMHT) for cross-domain fake news detection. Firstly, we propose a micro-hierarchical disentangling module to disentangle veracity-relevant and veracity-irrelevant features from news content in the source domain for improving fake news detection performance in the target domain. Secondly, we propose a macro-hierarchical transfer learning module to generate engagement features based on common users' shared behaviors in different domains for improving effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>The illusion of households as entities in social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data recording connections between people in communities and villages are collected and analyzed in various ways, most often as either networks of individuals or as networks of households. These two networks can differ in substantial ways. The methodological choice of which network to study, therefore, is an important aspect in both study design and data analysis. In this work, we consider various key differences between household and individual social network structure, and ways in which the networks cannot be used interchangeably. In addition to formalizing the choices for representing each network, we explore the consequences of how the results of social network analysis change depending on the choice between studying the individual and household network -- from determining whether networks are assortative or disassortative to the ranking of influence-maximizing nodes. As our main contribution, we draw upon related work to propose a set of systematic recommendations for determining the relevant network representation to study. Our recommendations include assessing a series of entitativity criteria and relating these criteria to theories and observations about patterns and norms in social dynamics at the household level: notably, how information spreads within households and how power structures and gender roles affect this spread. We draw upon the definition of an illusion of entitativity to identify cases wherein grouping people into households does not satisfy these criteria or adequately represent given cultural or experimental contexts. Given the widespread use of social network data for studying communities, there is broad impact in understanding which network to study and the consequences of that decision. We hope that this work gives guidance to practitioners and researchers collecting and studying social network data.</description>

      <title>Dual-level Mixup for Graph Few-shot Learning with Fewer Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks have been demonstrated as a powerful paradigm for effectively learning graph-structured data on the web and mining content from it.Current leading graph models require a large number of labeled samples for training, which unavoidably leads to overfitting in few-shot scenarios. Recent research has sought to alleviate this issue by simultaneously leveraging graph learning and meta-learning paradigms. However, these graph meta-learning models assume the availability of numerous meta-training tasks to learn transferable meta-knowledge. Such assumption may not be feasible in the real world due to the difficulty of constructing tasks and the substantial costs involved. Therefore, we propose a SiMple yet effectIve approach for graph few-shot Learning with fEwer tasks, named SMILE. We introduce a dual-level mixup strategy, encompassing both within-task and across-task mixup, to simultaneously enrich the available nodes and tasks in meta-learning. Moreover, we explicitly leverage the prior information provided by the node degrees in the graph to encode expressive node representations. Theoretically, we demonstrate that SMILE can enhance the model generalization ability. Empirically, SMILE consistently outperforms other competitive models by a large margin across all evaluated datasets with in-domain and cross-domain settings. Our anonymous code can be found here.</description>

      <title>Graph Anomaly Detection via Adaptive Test-time Representation Learning across Out-of-Distribution Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) has demonstrated great effectiveness in identifying unusual patterns within graph-structured data. However, while labeled anomalies are often scarce in emerging applications, existing supervised GAD approaches are either ineffective or not applicable when moved across graph domains due to distribution shifts and heterogeneous feature spaces. To address these challenges, we present AdaGraph-T3, a novel test-time training framework for cross-domain GAD. AdaGraph-T3 combines supervised and self-supervised learning during training while adapting to a new domain during test time using only self-supervised learning by leveraging a homophily-based affinity score that captures domain-invariant properties of anomalies. Our framework introduces four key innovations to cross-domain GAD: an effective self-supervision scheme, an attention-based mechanism that dynamically learns edge importance weights during message passing, domain-specific encoders for handling heterogeneous features, and class-aware regularization to address imbalance. Experiments across multiple cross-domain settings demonstrate that AdaGraph-T3 significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving average improvements of over 6.6% in AUROC and 7.9% in AUPRC compared to the best competing model.</description>

      <title>Eliminating Majority Illusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An opinion illusion refers to a phenomenon in social networks where agents may witness distributions of opinions among their neighbours that do not accurately reflect the true distribution of opinions in the population as a whole. A specific case of this occurs when there are only two possible choices, such as whether to receive the COVID-19 vaccine or vote on EU membership, which is commonly referred to as a majority illusion. In this work, we study the topological properties of social networks that lead to opinion illusions and focus on minimizing the number of agents that need to be influenced to eliminate these illusions. To do so, we propose an initial, but systematic study of the algorithmic behaviour of this problem.
  We show that the problem is NP-hard even for underlying topologies that are rather restrictive, being planar and of bounded diameter. We then look for exact algorithms that scale well as the input grows (FPT). We argue the in-existence of such algorithms even when the number of vertices that must be influenced is bounded, or when the social network is arranged in a ``path-like'' fashion (has bounded pathwidth). On the positive side, we present an FPT algorithm for networks with ``star-like'' structure (bounded vertex cover number). Finally, we construct an FPT algorithm for ``tree-like'' networks (bounded treewidth) when the number of vertices that must be influenced is bounded. This algorithm is then used to provide a PTAS for planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Smart Environments with Context-Aware Chatbots using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel architecture for context-aware interactions within smart environments, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance user experiences. Our system integrates user location data obtained through UWB tags and sensor-equipped smart homes with real-time human activity recognition (HAR) to provide a comprehensive understanding of user context. This contextual information is then fed to an LLM-powered chatbot, enabling it to generate personalised interactions and recommendations based on the user's current activity and environment. This approach moves beyond traditional static chatbot interactions by dynamically adapting to the user's real-time situation. A case study conducted from a real-world dataset demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed architecture, showcasing its potential to create more intuitive and helpful interactions within smart homes. The results highlight the significant benefits of integrating LLM with real-time activity and location data to deliver personalised and contextually relevant user experiences.</description>

      <title>QuanTaxo: A Quantum Approach to Self-Supervised Taxonomy Expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A taxonomy is a hierarchical graph containing knowledge to provide valuable insights for various web applications. Online retail organizations like Microsoft and Amazon utilize taxonomies to improve product recommendations and optimize advertisement by enhancing query interpretation. However, the manual construction of taxonomies requires significant human effort. As web content continues to expand at an unprecedented pace, existing taxonomies risk becoming outdated, struggling to incorporate new and emerging information effectively. As a consequence, there is a growing need for dynamic taxonomy expansion to keep them relevant and up-to-date. Existing taxonomy expansion methods often rely on classical word embeddings to represent entities. However, these embeddings fall short in capturing hierarchical polysemy, where an entity's meaning can vary based on its position in the hierarchy and its surrounding context. To address this challenge, we introduce QuanTaxo, an innovative quantum-inspired framework for taxonomy expansion. QuanTaxo encodes entity representations in quantum space, effectively modeling hierarchical polysemy by leveraging the principles of Hilbert space to capture interference effects between entities, yielding richer and more nuanced representations. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets show that QuanTaxo significantly outperforms classical embedding models, achieving substantial improvements of 18.45% in accuracy, 20.5% in Mean Reciprocal Rank, and 17.87% in Wu &amp; Palmer metrics across eight classical embedding-based baselines. We further highlight the superiority of QuanTaxo through extensive ablation and case studies.</description>

      <title>Social inequality and cultural factors impact the awareness and reaction during the cryptic transmission period of pandemic</title>

Abstract: The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 31, 2020. However, rumors of a "mysterious virus" had already been circulating in China in December 2019, possibly preceding the first confirmed COVID-19 case. Understanding how awareness about an emerging pandemic spreads through society is vital not only for enhancing disease surveillance, but also for mitigating demand shocks and social inequities, such as shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and essential supplies. Here we leverage a massive e-commerce dataset comprising 150 billion online queries and purchase records from 94 million people to detect the traces of early awareness and public response during the cryptic transmission period of COVID-19. Our analysis focuses on identifying information gaps across different demographic cohorts, revealing significant social inequities and the role of cultural factors in shaping awareness diffusion and response behaviors. By modeling awareness diffusion in heterogeneous social networks and analyzing online shopping behavior, we uncover the evolving characteristics of vulnerable populations. Our findings expand the theoretical understanding of awareness spread and social inequality in the early stages of a pandemic, highlighting the critical importance of e-commerce data and social network data in effectively and timely addressing future pandemic challenges. We also provide actionable recommendations to better manage and mitigate dynamic social inequalities in public health crises.</description>

      <title>Joint Time-Vertex Fractional Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.07655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph signal processing (GSP) facilitates the analysis of high-dimensional data on non-Euclidean domains by utilizing graph signals defined on graph vertices. In addition to static data, each vertex can provide continuous time-series signals, transforming graph signals into time-series signals on each vertex. The joint time-vertex Fourier transform (JFT) framework offers spectral analysis capabilities to analyze these joint time-vertex signals. Analogous to the fractional Fourier transform (FRT) extending the ordinary Fourier transform (FT), we introduce the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform (JFRT) as a generalization of JFT. The JFRT enables fractional analysis for joint time-vertex processing by extending Fourier analysis to fractional orders in both temporal and vertex domains. We theoretically demonstrate that JFRT generalizes JFT and maintains properties such as index additivity, reversibility, reduction to identity, and unitarity for specific graph topologies. Additionally, we derive Tikhonov regularization-based denoising in the JFRT domain, ensuring robust and well-behaved solutions. Comprehensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets highlight the effectiveness of JFRT in denoising and clustering tasks that outperform state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Auditing the Compliance and Enforcement of Twitter's Advertising Policy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online platforms have enacted various policies to maintain a safe and trustworthy advertising environment. However, the extent to which these policies are adhered to and enforced remains a subject of interest and concern. In this work, we present a large-scale audit of adult advertising on Twitter (now X), specifically focusing on compliance with its adult (sexual) content advertising policy. Twitter is an interesting case study in that it -- uniquely from other social media platforms -- allows posting of adult content but prohibits adult content in advertising. We analyze approximately 35 thousand ads on Twitter with respect to their compliance to the adult content ad policy through Perspective API and manual annotations. Among other things, we find that nearly 38% of ads violate Twitter's adult content advertising policy, although the platform eventually removed only about 63% of these non-compliant adult ads. We also find inconsistencies in the moderation of such ads across languages, highlighting the need for more reliable and consistent moderation practices across various languages. Overall, our findings highlight blind spots in Twitter's adult ad policy enforcement for certain languages and countries. Our work underscores the importance of external audits to monitor compliance and improve transparency in online advertising.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Gradient Influencing for Viral Marketing Using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of maximizing the adoption of a product through viral marketing in social networks has been studied heavily through postulated network models. We present a novel data-driven formulation of the problem. We use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the adoption of products by utilizing both topological and attribute information. The resulting Dynamic Viral Marketing (DVM) problem seeks to find the minimum budget and minimal set of dynamic topological and attribute changes in order to attain a specified adoption goal. We show that DVM is NP-Hard and is related to the existing influence maximization problem. Motivated by this connection, we develop the idea of Dynamic Gradient Influencing (DGI) that uses gradient ranking to find optimal perturbations and targets low-budget and high influence non-adopters in discrete steps. We use an efficient strategy for computing node budgets and develop the ''Meta-Influence'' heuristic for assessing a node's downstream influence. We evaluate DGI against multiple baselines and demonstrate gains on average of 24% on budget and 37% on AUC on real-world attributed networks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/saurabhsharma1993/dynamic_viral_marketing.</description>

      <title>Delving into ChatGPT usage in academic writing through excess vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07016v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can generate and revise text with human-level performance. These models come with clear limitations: they can produce inaccurate information, reinforce existing biases, and be easily misused. Yet, many scientists use them for their scholarly writing. But how wide-spread is such LLM usage in the academic literature? To answer this question, we present an unbiased, large-scale approach: we study vocabulary changes in 14 million PubMed abstracts from 2010--2024, and show how the appearance of LLMs led to an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain style words. This excess word analysis suggests that at least 10% of 2024 abstracts were processed with LLMs. This lower bound differed across disciplines, countries, and journals, reaching 30% for some sub-corpora. We show that LLMs have had an unprecedented impact on the scientific literature, surpassing the effect of major world events such as the Covid pandemic.</description>
