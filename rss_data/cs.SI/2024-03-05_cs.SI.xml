      <title>The Effectiveness of a Training Program Based on Health Education to Improve Health Empowerment Level among Refugees in Jordan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a health education-based training program in enhancing the level of health empowerment among refugees in Jordan. Health empowerment is a key component to promote health as it enables individuals to control and manage their health outcomes and improve them. Refugees are a vulnerable population group with limited access to healthcare.
  Methodology: The study sample consisted of 38 refugees in Irbid governorate, Jordan, who were conveniently selected in coordination with some organizations working in the field of asylum in the governorate. They were randomly divided into two groups: an experimental group (n = 19) that received the health education training program, and a control group (n = 19) that did not receive any health education training. The Health Empowerment Scale (HES), a validated tool, was used to collect data from both groups in the pre and post-tests, and a follow-up test was conducted for members of the experimental group only. Results: The results showed a statistically significant increase in the health empowerment scores for the experimental group that received the training program compared to the control group. The mean of the pre-test for the experimental group was (1.97 - 0.27), and for the control group, it was (1.84 - 0.21). The post-test mean for the experimental group became (3.88 - 0.13), while for the control group, it was (1.85 - 0.20). The follow-up test also demonstrated that the enhanced health empowerment levels were maintained in the experimental group, with no significant difference between the post-test and follow-up scores, indicating the effectiveness of the health education training program in enhancing health empowerment for refugees in Jordan.</description>

      <title>The Repercussions of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Higher Education and its implications for Syrian Refugees Students (An Analytical Descriptive Study)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to reveal the most important challenges and difficulties that refugee students faced in Jordanian universities (e.g., Yarmouk University, AL Al-Bayt, and the Private Zarqa University) due to the COVID-19 pandemic through measuring a different of indicators that are related, in addition, to identify some of the independent variables on e-educational challenges. In the study, the analytical description approach was used. The data collection tool is a questionnaire, which was distributed to a random sample of students electronically. Results show that the necessity to implement educational and psychological counseling programs and economic support programs to support the e-Learning costs. The study confirmed that refugees are the most affected students with the pandemic compared to the host community.

      <title>TweetInfo: An Interactive System to Mitigate Online Harm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increase in active users on social networking sites (SNSs) has also observed an increase in harmful content on social media sites. Harmful content is described as an inappropriate activity to harm or deceive an individual or a group of users. Alongside existing methods to detect misinformation and hate speech, users still need to be well-informed about the harmfulness of the content on SNSs. This study proposes a user-interactive system TweetInfo for mitigating the consumption of harmful content by providing metainformation about the posts. It focuses on two types of harmful content: hate speech and misinformation. TweetInfo provides insights into tweets by doing content analysis. Based on previous research, we have selected a list of metainformation. We offer the option to filter content based on metainformation Bot, Hate Speech, Misinformation, Verified Account, Sentiment, Tweet Category, Language. The proposed user interface allows customising the user's timeline to mitigate harmful content. This study present the demo version of the propose user interface of TweetInfo.</description>

      <title>RCoCo: Contrastive Collective Link Prediction across Multiplex Network in Riemannian Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link prediction typically studies the probability of future interconnection among nodes with the observation in a single social network. More often than not, real scenario is presented as a multiplex network with common (anchor) users active in multiple social networks. In the literature, most existing works study either the intra-link prediction in a single network or inter-link prediction among networks (a.k.a. network alignment), and consider two learning tasks are independent from each other, which is still away from the fact. On the representation space, the vast majority of existing methods are built upon the traditional Euclidean space, unaware of the inherent geometry of social networks. The third issue is on the scarce anchor users. Annotating anchor users is laborious and expensive, and thus it is impractical to work with quantities of anchor users. Herein, in light of the issues above, we propose to study a challenging yet practical problem of Geometry-aware Collective Link Prediction across Multiplex Network. To address this problem, we present a novel contrastive model, RCoCo, which collaborates intra- and inter-network behaviors in Riemannian spaces. In RCoCo, we design a curvature-aware graph attention network ($\kappa-$GAT), conducting attention mechanism in Riemannian manifold whose curvature is estimated by the Ricci curvatures over the network. Thereafter, we formulate intra- and inter-contrastive loss in the manifolds, in which we augment graphs by exploring the high-order structure of community and information transfer on anchor users. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments with 14 strong baselines on 8 real-world datasets, and show the effectiveness of RCoCo.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition of a Non-Linear Opinion Dynamics with Noisy Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.07423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In several real \emph{Multi-Agent Systems} (MAS), it has been observed that only weaker forms of\emph{metastable consensus} are achieved, in which a large majority of agents agree on some  opinion  while other opinions continue to be supported  by  a (small) minority of agents. In this work, we take a step towards the investigation of metastable consensus for complex (non-linear) \emph{opinion dynamics} by considering the famous \undecided dynamics in the binary setting, which is known to reach consensus exponentially faster than the \voter dynamics.   We propose a simple form of uniform noise in which each message can change to another one with probability $p$ and we prove that the persistence of a \emph{metastable consensus} undergoes a \emph{phase transition} for $p=\frac 16$. In detail, below this threshold, we prove the system  reaches with high probability a metastable regime where  a large majority of agents keeps supporting the same opinion  for polynomial time. Moreover, this opinion turns out to be the initial majority opinion, whenever the initial bias is slightly larger than its standard deviation.On the contrary, above the threshold, we show that the information about the initial majority opinion is  "lost" within  logarithmic time even when the initial bias is maximum.Interestingly, using a simple coupling argument, we show the equivalence between our noisy model above and the model where a subset of agents behave in a \emph{stubborn} way.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition of the 3-Majority Dynamics with Uniform Communication Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.03543v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Communication noise is a common feature in several real-world scenarios where systems of agents need to communicate in order to pursue some collective task. In particular, many biologically inspired systems that try to achieve agreements on some opinion must implement resilient dynamics that are not strongly affected by noisy communications. In this work, we study the popular 3-Majority dynamics, an opinion dynamics which has been proved to be an efficient protocol for the majority consensus problem, in which we introduce a simple feature of uniform communication noise, following (d'Amore et al. 2020). We prove that in the fully connected communication network of n agents and in the binary opinion case, the process induced by the 3-Majority dynamics exhibits a phase transition. For a noise probability $p &lt; 1/3$, the dynamics reaches in logarithmic time an almost-consensus metastable phase which lasts for a polynomial number of rounds with high probability. Furthermore, departing from previous analyses, we further characterize this phase by showing that there exists an attractive equilibrium value $s_{\text{eq}} \in [n]$ for the bias of the system, i.e. the difference between the majority community size and the minority one. Moreover, the agreement opinion turns out to be the initial majority one if the bias towards it is of magnitude $\Omega(\sqrt{n\log n})$ in the initial configuration. If, instead, $p &gt; 1/3$, no form of consensus is possible, and any information regarding the initial majority opinion is lost in logarithmic time with high probability. Despite more communications per-round are allowed, the 3-Majority dynamics surprisingly turns out to be less resilient to noise than the Undecided-State dynamics (d'Amore et al. 2020), whose noise threshold value is $p = 1/2$.</description>

      <title>Do Weibo platform experts perform better at predicting stock market?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sentiment analysis can be used for stock market prediction. However, existing research has not studied the impact of a user's financial background on sentiment-based forecasting of the stock market using artificial neural networks. In this work, a novel combination of neural networks is used for the assessment of sentiment-based stock market prediction, based on the financial background of the population that generated the sentiment. The state-of-the-art language processing model Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is used to classify the sentiment and a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is used for time-series based stock market prediction. For evaluation, the Weibo social networking platform is used as a sentiment data collection source. Weibo users (and their comments respectively) are divided into Authorized Financial Advisor (AFA) and Unauthorized Financial Advisor (UFA) groups according to their background information, as collected by Weibo. The Hong Kong Hang Seng index is used to extract historical stock market change data. The results indicate that stock market prediction learned from the AFA group users is 39.67% more precise than that learned from the UFA group users and shows the highest accuracy (87%) when compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Regional inflation analysis using social network data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflation is one of the most important macroeconomic indicators that have a great impact on the population of any country and region. Inflation is influenced by range of factors, one of which is inflation expectations. Many central banks take this factor into consideration while implementing monetary policy within the inflation targeting regime. Nowadays, a lot of people are active users of the Internet, especially social networks. There is a hypothesis that people search, read, and discuss mainly only those issues that are of particular interest to them. It is logical to assume that the dynamics of prices may also be in the focus of user discussions. So, such discussions could be regarded as an alternative source of more rapid information about inflation expectations. This study is based on unstructured data from Vkontakte social network to analyze upward and downward inflationary trends (on the example of the Omsk region). The sample of more than 8.5 million posts was collected between January 2010 and May 2022. The authors used BERT neural networks to solve the problem. These models demonstrated better results than the benchmarks (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree classifier, etc.). It makes possible to define pro-inflationary and disinflationary types of keywords in different contexts and get their visualization with SHAP method. This analysis provides additional operational information about inflationary processes at the regional level The proposed approach can be scaled for other regions. At the same time the limitation of the work is the time and power costs for the initial training of similar models for all regions of Russia.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Contrastive Learning for Few-shot Geolocation of Social Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social geolocation is an important problem of predicting the originating locations of social media posts. However, this task is challenging due to the need for a substantial volume of training data, alongside well-annotated labels. These issues are further exacerbated by new or less popular locations with insufficient labels, further leading to an imbalanced dataset. In this paper, we propose \textbf{ContrastGeo}, a \textbf{Contrast}ive learning enhanced framework for few-shot social \textbf{Geo}location. Specifically, a Tweet-Location Contrastive learning objective is introduced to align representations of tweets and locations within tweet-location pairs. To capture the correlations between tweets and locations, a Tweet-Location Matching objective is further adopted into the framework and refined via an online hard negative mining approach. We also develop three fusion strategies with various fusion encoders to better generate joint representations of tweets and locations. Comprehensive experiments on three social media datasets highlight ContrastGeo's superior performance over several state-of-the-art baselines in few-shot social geolocation.</description>

      <title>Social Media as a Sensor: Analyzing Twitter Data for Breast Cancer Medication Effects Using Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breast cancer is a significant public health concern and is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Despite advances in breast cancer treatments, medication non-adherence remains a major problem. As electronic health records do not typically capture patient-reported outcomes that may reveal information about medication-related experiences, social media presents an attractive resource for enhancing our understanding of the patients' treatment experiences. In this paper, we developed natural language processing (NLP) based methodologies to study information posted by an automatically curated breast cancer cohort from social media. We employed a transformer-based classifier to identify breast cancer patients/survivors on X (Twitter) based on their self-reported information, and we collected longitudinal data from their profiles. We then designed a multi-layer rule-based model to develop a breast cancer therapy-associated side effect lexicon and detect patterns of medication usage and associated side effects among breast cancer patients. 1,454,637 posts were available from 583,962 unique users, of which 62,042 were detected as breast cancer members using our transformer-based model. 198 cohort members mentioned breast cancer medications with tamoxifen as the most common. Our side effect lexicon identified well-known side effects of hormone and chemotherapy. Furthermore, it discovered a subject feeling towards cancer and medications, which may suggest a pre-clinical phase of side effects or emotional distress. This analysis highlighted not only the utility of NLP techniques in unstructured social media data to identify self-reported breast cancer posts, medication usage patterns, and treatment side effects but also the richness of social data on such clinical questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we formulate the problem of team formation amidst conflicts. The goal is to assign individuals to tasks, with given capacities, taking into account individuals' task preferences and the conflicts between them. Using dependent rounding schemes as our main toolbox, we provide efficient approximation algorithms. Our framework is extremely versatile and can model many different real-world scenarios as they arise in educational settings and human-resource management. We test and deploy our algorithms on real-world datasets and we show that our algorithms find assignments that are better than those found by natural baselines. In the educational setting we also show how our assignments are far better than those done manually by human experts. In the human resource management application we show how our assignments increase the diversity of teams. Finally, using a synthetic dataset we demonstrate that our algorithms scale very well in practice.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Prompt-Based Large Language Models: Predicting Pandemic Health Decisions and Outcomes Through Social Media Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a multi-step reasoning framework using prompt-based LLMs to examine the relationship between social media language patterns and trends in national health outcomes. Grounded in fuzzy-trace theory, which emphasizes the importance of gists of causal coherence in effective health communication, we introduce Role-Based Incremental Coaching (RBIC), a prompt-based LLM framework, to identify gists at-scale. Using RBIC, we systematically extract gists from subreddit discussions opposing COVID-19 health measures (Study 1). We then track how these gists evolve across key events (Study 2) and assess their influence on online engagement (Study 3). Finally, we investigate how the volume of gists is associated with national health trends like vaccine uptake and hospitalizations (Study 4). Our work is the first to empirically link social media linguistic patterns to real-world public health trends, highlighting the potential of prompt-based LLMs in identifying critical online discussion patterns that can form the basis of public health communication strategies.</description>

      <title>An "Opinion Reproduction Number" for Infodemics in a Bounded-Confidence Content-Spreading Process on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spreading dynamics of content on networks. To do this, we use a model in which content spreads through a bounded-confidence mechanism. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, the agents of a network have continuous-valued opinions, which they adjust when they interact with agents whose opinions are sufficiently close to theirs. The employed content-spread model introduces a twist into BCMs by using bounded confidence for the content spread itself. To study the spread of content, we define an analogue of the basic reproduction number from disease dynamics that we call an \emph{opinion reproduction number}. A critical value of the opinion reproduction number indicates whether or not there is an ``infodemic'' (i.e., a large content-spreading cascade) of content that reflects a particular opinion. By determining this critical value, one can determine whether or not an opinion will die off or propagate widely as a cascade in a population of agents. Using configuration-model networks, we quantify the size and shape of content dissemination using a variety of summary statistics, and we illustrate how network structure and spreading model parameters affect these statistics. We find that content spreads most widely when the agents have large expected mean degree or large receptiveness to content. When the amount of content spread only slightly exceeds the critical opinion reproduction number (i.e., the infodemic threshold), there can be longer dissemination trees than when the expected mean degree or receptiveness is larger, even though the total number of content shares is smaller.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates traffic forecasting, which attempts to forecast the future state of traffic based on historical situations. This problem has received ever-increasing attention in various scenarios and facilitated the development of numerous downstream applications such as urban planning and transportation management. However, the efficacy of existing methods remains sub-optimal due to their tendency to model temporal and spatial relationships independently, thereby inadequately accounting for complex high-order interactions of both worlds. Moreover, the diversity of transitional patterns in traffic forecasting makes them challenging to capture for existing approaches, warranting a deeper exploration of their diversity. Toward this end, this paper proposes Conjoint Spatio-Temporal graph neural network (abbreviated as COOL), which models heterogeneous graphs from prior and posterior information to conjointly capture high-order spatio-temporal relationships. On the one hand, heterogeneous graphs connecting sequential observation are constructed to extract composite spatio-temporal relationships via prior message passing. On the other hand, we model dynamic relationships using constructed affinity and penalty graphs, which guide posterior message passing to incorporate complementary semantic information into node representations. Moreover, to capture diverse transitional properties to enhance traffic forecasting, we propose a conjoint self-attention decoder that models diverse temporal patterns from both multi-rank and multi-scale views. Experimental results on four popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed COOL provides state-of-the-art performance compared with the competitive baselines.</description>

Abstract: Graph learning has become indispensable for interpreting and harnessing relational data in diverse fields, ranging from recommendation systems to social network analysis. In this context, a variety of GNNs have emerged as promising methodologies for encoding the structural information of graphs. By effectively capturing the graph's underlying structure, these GNNs have shown great potential in enhancing performance in graph learning tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. However, despite their successes, a significant challenge persists: these advanced methods often face difficulties in generalizing to unseen graph data that significantly differs from the training instances. In this work, our aim is to advance the graph learning paradigm by developing a general graph foundation model. This model is designed to understand the complex topological patterns present in diverse graph data, enabling it to excel in zero-shot graph learning tasks across different downstream datasets. To achieve this goal, we address several key technical challenges in our OpenGraph model. Firstly, we propose a unified graph tokenizer to adapt our graph model to generalize well on unseen graph data, even when the underlying graph properties differ significantly from those encountered during training. Secondly, we develop a scalable graph transformer as the foundational encoder, which effectively captures node-wise dependencies within the global topological context. Thirdly, we introduce a data augmentation mechanism enhanced by a LLM to alleviate the limitations of data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. By adapting our OpenGraph to new graph characteristics and comprehending the nuances of diverse graphs, our approach achieves remarkable zero-shot graph learning performance across various settings and domains.</description>

      <title>GSL-LPA: Fast Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) for Community Detection with no Internally-Disconnected Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection is the problem of identifying tightly connected clusters of nodes within a network. Efficient parallel algorithms for this play a crucial role in various applications, especially as datasets expand to significant sizes. The Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) is commonly employed for this purpose due to its ease of parallelization, rapid execution, and scalability. However, it may yield internally disconnected communities. This technical report introduces GSL-LPA, derived from our parallelization of LPA, namely GVE-LPA. Our experiments on a system with two 16-core Intel Xeon Gold 6226R processors show that GSL-LPA not only mitigates this issue but also surpasses FLPA, igraph LPA, and NetworKit LPA by 55x, 10,300x, and 5.8x, respectively, achieving a processing rate of 844 M edges/s on a 3.8 B edge graph. Additionally, GSL-LPA scales at a rate of 1.6x for every doubling of threads.</description>

      <title>Network analysis using Krylov subspace trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a set of network analysis methods based on the rows of the Krylov subspace matrix computed from a network adjacency matrix via power iteration using a non-random initial vector. We refer to these node-specific row vectors as Krylov subspace trajectories. While power iteration using a random initial starting vector is commonly applied to the network adjacency matrix to compute eigenvector centrality values, this application only uses the final vector generated after numerical convergence. Importantly, use of a random initial vector means that the intermediate results of power iteration are also random and lack a clear interpretation. To the best of our knowledge, use of intermediate power iteration results for network analysis has been limited to techniques that leverage just a single pre-convergence solution, e.g., Power Iteration Clustering. In this paper, we explore methods that apply power iteration with a non-random inital vector to the network adjacency matrix to generate Krylov subspace trajectories for each node. These non-random trajectories provide important information regarding network structure, node importance, and response to perturbations. We have created this short preprint in part to generate feedback from others in the network analysis community who might be aware of similar existing work.</description>

      <title>Representation Learning on Heterophilic Graph with Directional Neighborhood Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Attention Network (GAT) is one of the most popular Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture, which employs the attention mechanism to learn edge weights and has demonstrated promising performance in various applications. However, since it only incorporates information from immediate neighborhood, it lacks the ability to capture long-range and global graph information, leading to unsatisfactory performance on some datasets, particularly on heterophilic graphs. To address this limitation, we propose the Directional Graph Attention Network (DGAT) in this paper. DGAT is able to combine the feature-based attention with the global directional information extracted from the graph topology. To this end, a new class of Laplacian matrices is proposed which can provably reduce the diffusion distance between nodes. Based on the new Laplacian, topology-guided neighbour pruning and edge adding mechanisms are proposed to remove the noisy and capture the helpful long-range neighborhood information. Besides, a global directional attention is designed to enable a topological-aware information propagation. The superiority of the proposed DGAT over the baseline GAT has also been verified through experiments on real-world benchmarks and synthetic data sets. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on 6 out of 7 real-world benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Neural Graph Generator: Feature-Conditioned Graph Generation using Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph generation has emerged as a crucial task in machine learning, with significant challenges in generating graphs that accurately reflect specific properties. Existing methods often fall short in efficiently addressing this need as they struggle with the high-dimensional complexity and varied nature of graph properties. In this paper, we introduce the Neural Graph Generator (NGG), a novel approach which utilizes conditioned latent diffusion models for graph generation. NGG demonstrates a remarkable capacity to model complex graph patterns, offering control over the graph generation process. NGG employs a variational graph autoencoder for graph compression and a diffusion process in the latent vector space, guided by vectors summarizing graph statistics. We demonstrate NGG's versatility across various graph generation tasks, showing its capability to capture desired graph properties and generalize to unseen graphs. This work signifies a significant shift in graph generation methodologies, offering a more practical and efficient solution for generating diverse types of graphs with specific characteristics.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Graph Variational Auto-Encoder with Fair Latent Representation to Account for Sampling Bias in Ecological Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to represent bipartite networks using graph embeddings tailored to tackle the challenges of studying ecological networks, such as the ones linking plants and pollinators, where many covariates need to be accounted for, in particular to control for sampling bias. We adapt the variational graph auto-encoder approach to the bipartite case, which enables us to generate embeddings in a latent space where the two sets of nodes are positioned based on their probability of connection. We translate the fairness framework commonly considered in sociology in order to address sampling bias in ecology. By incorporating the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) as an additional penalty term in the loss we optimize, we ensure that the structure of the latent space is independent of continuous variables, which are related to the sampling process. Finally, we show how our approach can change our understanding of ecological networks when applied to the Spipoll data set, a citizen science monitoring program of plant-pollinator interactions to which many observers contribute, making it prone to sampling bias.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Multivariate Extremes in Multilayer Inhomogeneous Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multilayer inhomogeneous random graph model (MIRG), whose layers may consist of both single-edge and multi-edge graphs. In the single layer case, it has been shown that the regular variation of the weight distribution underlying the inhomogeneous random graph implies the regular variation of the typical degree distribution. We extend this correspondence to the multilayer case by showing that the multivariate regular variation of the weight distribution implies the multivariate regular variation of the asymptotic degree distribution. Furthermore, in certain circumstances, the extremal dependence structure present in the weight distribution will be adopted by the asymptotic degree distribution. By considering the asymptotic degree distribution, a wider class of Chung-Lu and Norros-Reittu graphs may be incorporated into the MIRG layers. Additionally, we prove consistency of the Hill estimator when applied to degrees of the MIRG that have a tail index greater than 1. Simulation results indicate that, in practice, hidden regular variation may be consistently detected from an observed MIRG.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Graph Datasets for Node Classification: Homophily-Heterophily Dichotomy and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06177v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homophily is a graph property describing the tendency of edges to connect similar nodes; the opposite is called heterophily. It is often believed that heterophilous graphs are challenging for standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs), and much effort has been put into developing efficient methods for this setting. However, there is no universally agreed-upon measure of homophily in the literature. In this work, we show that commonly used homophily measures have critical drawbacks preventing the comparison of homophily levels across different datasets. For this, we formalize desirable properties for a proper homophily measure and verify which measures satisfy which properties. In particular, we show that a measure that we call adjusted homophily satisfies more desirable properties than other popular homophily measures while being rarely used in graph machine learning literature. Then, we go beyond the homophily-heterophily dichotomy and propose a new characteristic that allows one to further distinguish different sorts of heterophily. The proposed label informativeness (LI) characterizes how much information a neighbor's label provides about a node's label. We prove that this measure satisfies important desirable properties. We also observe empirically that LI better agrees with GNN performance compared to homophily measures, which confirms that it is a useful characteristic of the graph structure.</description>

      <title>Political Context of the European Vaccine Debate on Twitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, fears grew that making vaccination a political (instead of public health) issue may impact the efficacy of this life-saving intervention, spurring the spread of vaccine-hesitant content. In this study, we examine whether there is a relationship between the political interest of social media users and their exposure to vaccine-hesitant content on Twitter. We focus on 17 European countries using a multilingual, longitudinal dataset of tweets spanning the period before COVID, up to the vaccine roll-out. We find that, in most countries, users' endorsement of vaccine-hesitant content is the highest in the early months of the pandemic, around the time of greatest scientific uncertainty. Further, users who follow politicians from right-wing parties, and those associated with authoritarian or anti-EU stances are more likely to endorse vaccine-hesitant content, whereas those following left-wing politicians, more pro-EU or liberal parties, are less likely. Somewhat surprisingly, politicians did not play an outsized role in the vaccine debates of their countries, receiving a similar number of retweets as other similarly popular users. This systematic, multi-country, longitudinal investigation of the connection of politics with vaccine hesitancy has important implications for public health policy and communication.</description>

      <title>HMN: Generalization of Heterogeneous and Multi-layered Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A network may have different types of entities and their relations. Further, there could be additional layers of ties. The former is referred to as Heterogeneous networks, while the latter is known as Multi-layer networks. The present paper provides a generalized network model, namely, a Heterogeneous Multi-layered Network (HMN), which can simultaneously be multi-layered and heterogeneous. The model can represent homogeneous networks as well. We define different structural measures in an HMN. We proved that the sets of all homogeneous, heterogeneous and multi-layered networks are subsets of the set of all HMNs. Accordingly, we established the equivalency of the proposed structural measures of HMNs with that of homogeneous, heterogeneous, and multi-layered networks. Following that, we show how our proposed HMN is more efficient in tasks such as link prediction. In addition, we present a novel parameterized algorithm (with complexity analysis) for generating synthetic HMNs. The networks generated from our proposed algorithm are more consistent in modelling the layer-wise degree distribution of a real-world Twitter network (represented as HMN) than those generated by existing models. Moreover, we also show that our algorithm is more effective in modelling an air-transportation multiplex network when compared to an algorithm designed specifically for the task.</description>

      <title>FCS-HGNN: Flexible Multi-type Community Search in Heterogeneous Information Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community search is a personalized community discovery problem designed to identify densely connected subgraphs containing the query node. Recently, community search in heterogeneous information networks (HINs) has received considerable attention. Existing methods typically focus on modeling relationships in HINs through predefined meta-paths or user-specified relational constraints. However, metapath-based methods are primarily designed to identify single-type communities with nodes of the same type rather than multi-type communities involving nodes of different types. Constraint-based methods require users to have a good understanding of community patterns to define a suitable set of relational constraints, which increases the burden on users. In this paper, we propose FCS-HGNN, a novel method for flexibly identifying both single-type and multi-type communities in HINs. Specifically, FCS-HGNN extracts complementary information from different views and dynamically considers the contribution of each relation instead of treating them equally, thereby capturing more fine-grained heterogeneous information. Furthermore, to improve efficiency on large-scale graphs, we further propose LS-FCS-HGNN, which incorporates i) the neighbor sampling strategy to improve training efficiency, and ii) the depth-based heuristic search strategy to improve query efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods over state-of-the-art methods, achieving average improvements of 14.3% and 11.1% on single-type and multi-type communities, respectively.</description>

      <title>Comparison of modularity-based approaches for nodes clustering in hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical analysis and node clustering in hypergraphs constitute an emerging topic suffering from a lack of standardization. In contrast to the case of graphs, the concept of nodes' community in hypergraphs is not unique and encompasses various distinct situations. In this work, we conducted a comparative analysis of the performance of modularity-based methods for clustering nodes in binary hypergraphs. To address this, we begin by presenting, within a unified framework, the various hypergraph modularity criteria proposed in the literature, emphasizing their differences and respective focuses. Subsequently, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art codes available to maximize hypergraph modularities for detecting node communities in binary hypergraphs. Through exploration of various simulation settings with controlled ground truth clustering, we offer a comparison of these methods using different quality measures, including true clustering recovery, running time, (local) maximization of the objective, and the number of clusters detected. Our contribution marks the first attempt to clarify the advantages and drawbacks of these newly available methods. This effort lays the foundation for a better understanding of the primary objectives of modularity-based node clustering methods for binary hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Local Graph Clustering with Noisy Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing interest in machine learning problems over graphs with additional node information such as texts, images, or labels has popularized methods that require the costly operation of processing the entire graph. Yet, little effort has been made to the development of fast local methods (i.e. without accessing the entire graph) that extract useful information from such data. To that end, we propose a study of local graph clustering using noisy node labels as a proxy for additional node information. In this setting, nodes receive initial binary labels based on cluster affiliation: 1 if they belong to the target cluster and 0 otherwise. Subsequently, a fraction of these labels is flipped. We investigate the benefits of incorporating noisy labels for local graph clustering. By constructing a weighted graph with such labels, we study the performance of graph diffusion-based local clustering method on both the original and the weighted graphs. From a theoretical perspective, we consider recovering an unknown target cluster with a single seed node in a random graph with independent noisy node labels. We provide sufficient conditions on the label noise under which, with high probability, using diffusion in the weighted graph yields a more accurate recovery of the target cluster. This approach proves more effective than using the given labels alone or using diffusion in the label-free original graph. Empirically, we show that reliable node labels can be obtained with just a few samples from an attributed graph. Moreover, utilizing these labels via diffusion in the weighted graph leads to significantly better local clustering performance across several real-world datasets, improving F1 scores by up to 13%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the number of accepted papers at AI and ML conferences reaches into the thousands, it has become unclear how researchers access and read research publications. In this paper, we investigate the role of social media influencers in enhancing the visibility of machine learning research, particularly the citation counts of papers they share. We have compiled a comprehensive dataset of over 8,000 papers, spanning tweets from December 2018 to October 2023, alongside controls precisely matched by 9 key covariates. Our statistical and causal inference analysis reveals a significant increase in citations for papers endorsed by these influencers, with median citation counts 2-3 times higher than those of the control group. Additionally, the study delves into the geographic, gender, and institutional diversity of highlighted authors. Given these findings, we advocate for a responsible approach to curation, encouraging influencers to uphold the journalistic standard that includes showcasing diverse research topics, authors, and institutions.</description>

Abstract: Graph representation learning, a critical step in graph-centric tasks, has seen significant advancements. Earlier techniques often operate in an end-to-end setting, where performance heavily relies on the availability of ample labeled data. This constraint has spurred the emergence of few-shot learning on graphs, where only a few task-specific labels are available for each task. Given the extensive literature in this field, this survey endeavors to synthesize recent developments, provide comparative insights, and identify future directions. We systematically categorize existing studies into three major families: meta-learning approaches, pre-training approaches, and hybrid approaches, with a finer-grained classification in each family to aid readers in their method selection process. Within each category, we analyze the relationships among these methods and compare their strengths and limitations. Finally, we outline prospective future directions for few-shot learning on graphs to catalyze continued innovation in this field.</description>
