      <title>Nonequilibrium heat relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium work relation, or Jarzynski equality, establishes a statistical relationship between a series of nonequilibrium experiments on a system subjected to thermal fluctuations and a hypothetical experiment at thermodynamic equilibrium. In these experiments, the fluctuating quantity is the work exchanged between the system and its environment, while in the equilibrium scenario, the Helmholtz free energy difference between the system's initial and final states is determined. We inquire about the corresponding associated heat, the contribution of which, when added to the work, yields the change in internal energy. A new equality is presented for the random heat exchanged between the system and its thermal bath during the same protocol as the Jarzynski equality. Guidelines are provided for the experimental conditions required to measure such random heat.</description>

      <title>Inter-Event Time Power Laws in Heterogeneous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic behavior of spin reversal events in the dilute Ising model, focusing on the influence of static disorder introduced by pinned spins. Our Monte Carlo simulations reveal that in a homogeneous, defect-free system, the inter-event time (IET) between local spin flips follows an exponential distribution, characteristic of Poissonian processes. However, in heterogeneous systems where defects are present, we observe a significant departure from this behavior. At high temperatures, the IET exhibits a power-law distribution resulting from the interplay of spins located in varying potential environments, where defect density influences reversal probabilities. At low temperatures, all site classes converge to a unique power-law distribution, regardless of their potential, leading to distinct critical exponents for the high- and low-temperature regimes. This transition from exponential to power-law behavior underscores the critical response features of magnetic systems with defects, suggesting analogies to glassy dynamics. Our findings highlight the complex mechanisms governing spin dynamics in disordered systems, with implications for understanding the universal aspects of relaxation in glassy materials.</description>

      <title>Boson Clustering and Low-Density Properties at High Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In statistical and quantum many-body physics, the correlation function is a fundamental quantity, especially for lattice models described by local Hamiltonians. Away from the phase-transition point, correlation function typically satisfies the clustering property, meaning that the correlation concentrates at short ranges while decays rapidly (exponentially) at long distances. Though the clustering property has been extensively studied for spin and fermion systems, whether a similar result holds for boson systems remains a long-standing open problem. The essential difficulty lies in the infinite Hilbert-space dimension of a boson, in stark contrast to the finite dimension of a spin or fermion. This work is devoted to establishing the boson counterpart of the clustering of correlations at high temperatures, focusing primarily on the canonical Bose-Hubbard model. As a byproduct, we rigorously justify the low-boson-density assumption for the Gibbs state of the Bose-Hubbard model. This assumption is often invoked as a preliminary requirement for proving various rigorous results, including the boson Lieb-Robinson bound. Building on the results above, we show the specific heat density can be bounded above by a constant at high temperatures. Our achievement is based on the imaginary-time interaction picture, which is expected to have much broader applications to other open problems concerning bosons in statistical and quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Pseudotransitions in a dilute Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the ground state and thermodynamic properties of a spin-pseudospin chain representing a model of a one-dimensional dilute magnet with two types of nonmagnetic charged impurities. For this purpose, a method utilizing the transfer-matrix properties is employed. Despite the wide variety of intriguing frustrated phase states, we show that the model showcases pseudotransitions solely between simple charge and magnetic quasiorders. These pseudotransitions are characterized by distinct features in the thermodynamic and magnetic quantities, resembling first- and second-order phase transitions. In addition to pseudotransitions for the ``pure'' system, similar to those observed in other one-dimensional spin models, this study also reveals the presence of ``second-order'' pseudotransitions for the dilute case. We show that the nature of these discovered pseudotransitions is associated with the phase separation in the chain into regions of (anti)ferromagnetic and charge-ordered phases. The ability to compare the results of an exact transfer-matrix calculation with a simple phenomenological description within the framework of Maxwell construction contributes to a deeper understanding of both the physical mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and the analytical methods used.</description>

      <title>Markov chains for the analysis of states of one-dimensional spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze frustrated states of the one-dimensional dilute Ising chain with charged interacting impurities of two types with mapping of the system to some Markov chain. We perform classification and reveal two types of Markov chains: periodic with period 2 and aperiodic. Frustrated phases with various types of chains have different properties. In phases with periodic Markov chains, long-range order is observed in the sublattice while another sublattice remains disordered. This results in a conjunction of the non-zero residual entropy and the infinite correlation length. In frustrated phases with aperiodic chains, there is no long-range order, and the correlation length remains finite. It is shown that under the magnetic field the most significant change in the spin chain structure corresponds to the change of the Markov chain type.</description>

      <title>Optimal reduction of an epidemic outbreak size via temporary quarantine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of an epidemic spread is crucial for effective control measures. During the COVID-19 pandemic, quarantines were implemented to minimize infections while mitigating social and economic impacts, raising the question of how to maximize quarantine efficiency. Previous research on periodic quarantines using the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and similar models identified optimal duration for periodic quarantines. However, the question of the optimal initiation time for a single quarantine remains unanswered. Here, we use the SIR model in order to determine the optimal quarantine initiation time, by computing the optimal susceptible fraction at the onset of the quarantine, which minimizes the total outbreak size. Our analysis extends from a well-mixed scenario to strongly-heterogeneous social networks. We show that the optimal quarantine initiation time is closely related to the so-called "herd immunity" threshold, occurring at the onset of epidemic decline. Importantly, providing a methodology for identifying the optimal quarantine initiation time across different network structures, entails significant implications for epidemic control.</description>

      <title>Anomalous charge transport in the sine-Gordon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive study of anomalous charge transport in the quantum sine--Gordon model. Employing the framework of Generalized Hydrodynamics, we compute Drude weights and Onsager matrices across a wide range of coupling strengths to quantify ballistic and diffusive transport, respectively. We find that charge transport is predominantly diffusive at accessible timescales, indicated by the corresponding Onsager matrix significantly exceeding the Drude weight -- contrary to most integrable models where transport is primarily ballistic. Reducing the Onsager matrix to a few key two-particle scattering processes enables us to efficiently examine transport in both low- and high-temperature limits. The charge transport is dictated by non-diagonal scattering of the internal charge degree of freedom: At particular values of the coupling strength with diagonal, diffusive effects amount to merely subleading corrections. However, at couplings approaching these points, the charge Onsager matrix and corresponding diffusive time-scale diverge. Our findings relate to similar transport anomalies in XXZ spin chains, offering insights through their shared Bethe Ansatz structures.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics of Heteropolymers from Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice models are valuable tools to gain insight into the statistical physics of heteropolymers. We rigorously map the partition function of these models into a vacuum expectation value of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT), with both fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom. Since the associated path integral expression is not affected by a sign problem, it is amenable to Monte Carlo (MC) sampling in both sequence and structure space, unlike conventional polymer field theory. At the same time, since this LGT quantum encoding relies on interacting two-level states (qubits), it sets the stage for capitalizing on the development of quantum computing hardware. As a first illustrative application, we use this formalism to characterize the thermodynamically stable sequences and structures of small heteropolymers consisting of two types of residues.</description>

      <title>Mean first-passage time at the origin of a run-and-tumble particle with periodic forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a run-and-tumble particle on a half-line with an absorbing target at the origin. The particle has an internal velocity state that switches between two fixed values at Poisson-distributed times. The particles evolves according to an overdamped Langevin dynamics, with a periodic force field, such that every in a given period interval are accessible to the particle. The Laplace transform of the backward Fokker--Planck equation satisfied by the survival probability of the particle yields systems of equation satisfied by the moments of the first-passage time of the particle at the origin. The mean first passage time has already been calculated assuming the particle reaches the origin in finite time almost surely. We calculate the probability that the particle reaches the origin at finite time, given its initial position and velocity. We obtain an integral condition on the force, under which the exit probability is less than one. If the force field is a constant drift, the condition is satisfied by positive values of the drift. The mean first-passage time of the particle (averaged over trajectories that reach the origin) is obtained in closed form as a consequence in both regimes.</description>

      <title>Geometric percolation of spins and spin-dipoles in Ashkin-Teller model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ashkin-Teller model is a two-layer lattice model where spins in each layer interact ferromagnetically with strength $J$, and the spin-dipoles (product of spins) interact with neighbors with strength $\lambda.$ The model exhibits simultaneous magnetic and electric transitions along a self-dual line on the $\lambda$-$J$ plane with continuously varying critical exponents. In this article, we investigate the percolation of geometric clusters of spins and spin-dipoles denoted respectively as magnetic and electric clusters. We find that the largest cluster in both cases becomes macroscopic in size and spans the lattice when interaction exceeds a critical threshold given by the same self-dual line where magnetic and electric transitions occur. The fractal dimension of the critical spanning clusters is related to order parameter exponent $\beta_{m,e}$ as $D_{m,e}=d-\frac{5}{12}\frac{\beta_{m,e}}\nu,$ where $d=2$ is the spatial dimension and $\nu$ is the correlation length exponent. This relation determines all other percolation exponents and their variation wrt $\lambda.$ We show that for magnetic Percolation, the Binder cumulant, as a function of $\xi_2/L$ with $\xi_2$ being the second-moment correlation length, remains invariant all along the critical line and matches with that of the spin-percolation in the usual Ising model. The function also remains invariant for the electric percolation, forming a new superuniversality class of percolation transition.</description>

      <title>Tricriticality and finite-size scaling in the triangular Blume-Capel ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on numerical simulations of the two-dimensional spin-$1$ Blume-Capel ferromagnet embedded in a triangular lattice. Utilizing a range of Monte Carlo and finite-size scaling techniques, we explore several critical aspects along the crystal field--temperature ($\Delta, T$) transition line. Wang-Landau simulations measuring the joint density of states in combination with the method of field mixing allow us to probe the phase coexistence curve in high resolution, determining the tricritical point $(\Delta_{\rm t}, T_{\rm t})$ with improved accuracy and verifying the tricritical exponents. Extensive multicanonical simulations identifying transition points across the phase diagram characterize the Ising universality class for $\Delta &lt; \Delta_{\rm t}$ with precise determination of thermal and magnetic critical exponents expected in the second-order regime. On the other hand, for $\Delta &gt; \Delta_{\rm t}$, a finite-size scaling analysis is dedicated to revealing the first-order signature in the surface tension that linearly increases upon lowering the temperature deeper into the first-order transition regime. Finally, a comprehensive picture of the phase diagram for the model is presented, collecting transition points obtained from the combined numerical approach in this study and previous estimates in the literature.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and event-chain Monte Carlo (ECMC) for the one-dimensional chain of particles with harmonic interactions and benchmark them against local reversible Metropolis algorithms. While HMC achieves considerable speedup with respect to local reversible Monte Carlo algorithms, its autocorrelation functions of global observables such as the structure factor have slower scaling with system size than for ECMC, a lifted non-reversible Markov chain. This can be traced to the dependence of ECMC on a parameter of the harmonic energy, the equilibrium distance, which drops out when energy differences or gradients are evaluated. We review the recent literature and provide pseudocodes and Python programs. We finally discuss related models and generalizations beyond one-dimensional particle systems.</description>

      <title>Multiscale nonlinear integration drives accurate encoding of input information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological and artificial systems encode information through several complex nonlinear operations, making their exact study a formidable challenge. These internal mechanisms often take place across multiple timescales and process external signals to enable functional output responses. In this work, we focus on two widely implemented paradigms: nonlinear summation, where signals are first processed independently and then combined; and nonlinear integration, where they are combined first and then processed. We study a general model where the input signal is propagated to an output unit through a processing layer via nonlinear activation functions. Further, we distinguish between the two cases of fast and slow processing timescales. We demonstrate that integration and fast-processing capabilities systematically enhance input-output mutual information over a wide range of parameters and system sizes, while simultaneously enabling tunable input discrimination. Moreover, we reveal that high-dimensional embeddings and low-dimensional projections emerge naturally as optimal competing strategies. Our results uncover the foundational features of nonlinear information processing with profound implications for both biological and artificial systems.</description>

      <title>A Rigorous Theory of Quantum-Classical Systems at Finite Temperature, Part I: Exact Functional Formulation in the Canonical Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining classical density functional theory (cDFT) with quantum mechanics (QM) methods offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional QM/molecular mechanics (MM) approaches for modeling mixed quantum-classical systems at finite temperatures. However, both QM/MM and QM/cDFT rely on approximations that introduce ambiguities. This series of papers aims to establish a rigorous theoretical framework to guide the development of a QM/cDFT formulation that clarifies the approximations involved. In this first paper, we establish a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) framework for mixed quantum (QM)-classical (MM) systems within the canonical ensemble. We derive the equilibrium density matrix for a system comprising N qm QM and N mm MM particles and, based on this derivation, propose a variational formulation of the Helmholtz free energy in terms of the full QM-MM density matrix. By leveraging permutational symmetry and thanks to constrained-search methods, we reformulate the variational problem using functionals of objects having reduced dimensionalities. Three different formulations are presented, each using quantities with progressively lower dimensionalities. This ultimately enables computation of the Helmholtz free energy using only the QM and MM one-body densities, generalizing both cDFT and electronic DFT (eDFT) for QM-MM systems. In a subsequent paper, this formalism will be extended to the grand canonical ensemble, allowing classical particle number fluctuations. This extension, in which cDFT is most naturally formulated, provides a framework for studying solvation problems.</description>

      <title>Steady inhomogeneous shear flows as mechanical phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous flows and shear banding are of interest for a range of applications but have been eluding a comprehensive theoretical understanding, mostly due to the lack of a framework comparable to equilibrium statistical mechanics. Here we revisit models of fluids that reach a stationary state obeying mechanical equilibrium. Starting from a non-local constitutive relation, we apply the idea of a "mechanical phase transition" and map the constitutive relation onto a dynamical system through an integrating factor. We illustrate this framework for two applications: shear banding in strongly thinning complex fluids and the coexistence of a solid with its sheared melt. Our results contribute to the growing body of work following a mechanical route to describe inhomogeneous systems away from thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Absorbing state dynamics of stochastic gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a fundamental tool for training deep neural networks across a variety of tasks. In self-supervised learning, different input categories map to distinct manifolds in the embedded neural state space. Accurate classification is achieved by separating these manifolds during learning, akin to a packing problem. We investigate the dynamics of "neural manifold packing" by employing a minimal model in which SGD is applied to spherical particles in physical space. In this model, SGD minimizes the system's energy (classification loss) by stochastically reducing overlaps between particles (manifolds). We observe that this process undergoes an absorbing phase transition, prompting us to use the framework of biased random organization (BRO), a nonequilibrium absorbing state model, to describe SGD behavior. We show that BRO dynamics can be approximated by those of particles with linear repulsive interactions under multiplicative anisotropic noise. Thus, for a linear repulsive potential and small kick sizes (learning rates), BRO and SGD become equivalent, converging to the same critical packing fraction $\phi_c \approx 0.64$, despite the fundamentally different origins of their noise. This equivalence is further supported by the observation that, like BRO, near the critical point, SGD exhibits behavior consistent with the Manna universality class. Above the critical point, SGD exhibits a bias towards flatter minima of the energy landscape, reinforcing the analogy with loss minimization in neural networks.</description>

      <title>Depletion interaction between cylindrical inclusions in polymer brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cylindrical inclusions in mobile brushes experience apparent attraction, which arises from a tendency to minimize the depletion zone around the inclusions, thereby maximizing the overall entropy. We find that correlation blobs act as the basic units of the attraction. In tall brushes, however, the depletion zone formed above the inclusions can generate repulsion, partially offsetting the depletion attraction. Our study offers physical insights into the brush-induced depletion interaction and suggests it as a mechanism for protein cluster formation on cell surfaces.</description>

      <title>Compatibility of Quantum Measurements and the Emergence of Classical Objectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of measurements in quantum mechanics exposes many of the ways in which the quantum world is different. For example, one of the hallmarks of quantum mechanics is that observables may be incompatible, implying among other things that it is not always possible to find joint probability distributions which fully capture the joint statistics of multiple measurements. Instead, one must employ more general tools such as the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution, which may exhibit negative or non-real values heralding non-classicality. In this Letter, we consider the KDQ distributions describing arbitrary collections of measurements on disjoint components of some generic multipartite system. We show that the system dynamics ensures that these distributions are classical if and only if the Hamiltonian supports Quantum Darwinism. Thus, we demonstrate a fundamental relationship between these two notions of classicality and their emergence in the quantum world.</description>

      <title>First-principles calculation of the entropy of liquids with a case study on sodium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite increasing demands for the thermodynamic data of liquids in a wide range of science and engineering fields, there is a still a considerable lack of reliable data over a wide range of temperature ($T$) and pressure conditions. The most significant obstacle is that there is no practical method to calculate the entropy ($S$) of liquids. This problem can be solved using the thermodynamic definition of entropy, i.e., $S = \int C d\ln T$, where $C$ is specific heat. The specific heat is calculated by the derivative of the internal energy $U$ with respect to $T$. Both quantities, i.e., $U$ and $T$, are well defined in the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on density functional theory. The reliability of the present method is entirely dependent on the accuracy of the specific heat of liquid, for which there is no standard model. The problem with liquids is that there are no eigenstates, based on which the standard procedures are constructed. The relationship between $U$ and $T$ is affected by the energy relaxation processes, the effect of which appears in the $T$ dependence on the specific heat of liquids. This motivates us to conduct MD simulations by isolating the system from an external heat bath. In this paper, by applying this method to the liquid sodium, it is demonstrated that the experimental $T$ dependence of the isochoric specific heat is reproduced well without any empirical parameter. On this basis, the entropy of the liquid Na is obtained with a good agreement with experimental values.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic properties of bridging transitions in sinusoidally-shaped slits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study bridging transitions that emerge between two sinusoidally-shaped walls of amplitude $A$, wavenumber $k$, and mean separation $L$. The focus is on weakly corrugated walls to examine the properties of bridging transitions in the limit when the walls become flat. The reduction of walls roughness can be achieved in two ways which we show differ qualitatively: a) By decreasing $k$, (i.e., by increasing the system wavelength), which induces a continuous phenomenon associated with the growth of bridging films concentrated near the system necks, the thickness of with the thickness of these films diverging as $\sim k^{-2/3}$ in the limit of $k\to0$. Simultaneously, the location of the transition approaches that of capillary condensation in an infinite planar slit of an appropriate width as $\sim k^{2/3}$; b) in contrast, the limit of vanishing walls roughness by reducing $A$ cannot be considered in this context, as there exists a minimal value $A_{\rm min}(k,L)$ of the amplitude below which bridging transition does not occur. On the other hand, for amplitudes $A&gt;A_{\rm min}(k,L)$, the bridging transition always precedes global condensation in the system. These predictions, including the scaling property $A_{\rm min}\propto kL^2$, are verified numerically using density functional theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-Dirac fermions are massless in one direction and massive in the perpendicular directions. Such quasiparticles have been proposed in various contexts in condensed matter. Using first principles calculations, we identify a pair of semi-Dirac bands in the electronic structure of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) cadmium, which keep their linear out-of-plane and quadratic inplane dispersions up to the Fermi level. We demonstrate that the dichotomy between the linear and quadratic dispersions is driven by an orientation-sensitive hybridization between the $s$ and $p_z$ orbitals. The upper semi-Dirac band produces a lens-shaped nonellipsoidal Fermi sheet whose cross-section area has a $k$-dependence that is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured period of Sondheimer oscillations.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Sondheimer oscillations of conductivity in thin cadmium crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decades ago, Sondheimer discovered that the electric conductivity of metallic crystals hosting ballistic electrons oscillates with magnetic field. These oscillations, periodic in magnetic field and the period proportional to the sample thickness, have been understood in a semi-classical framework. Here, we present a study of longitudinal and transverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thickness varying between 12.6 to 475 $\mu$m. When the magnetic field is sufficiently large or the sample sufficiently thick, the amplitude of oscillation falls off as $B^{-4}$ as previously reported. In contrast, the ten first oscillations follow a $B^{-2.5}e^{-B/B_0}$ field dependence and their amplitude is set by the quantum of conductance, the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface geometry. We demonstrate that they are beyond the semi-classical picture, as the exponential prefactor indicates quantum tunneling between distinct quantum states. We draw a picture of these quantum oscillations, in which the linear dispersion of the semi-Dirac band in the cadmium plays a crucial role. The oscillations arise by the intersection between the lowest Landau tube and flat toroids on the Fermi surface induced by confinement. Positive and negative corrections to semi-classical magneto-conductance can occur by alternation between destructive and constructive interference in phase-coherent helical states. The quantum limit of Sondheimer oscillations emerges as another manifestation of Aharanov-Bohm flux quantization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of a continuously monitored qubit in the limit of strong measurement rate where the quantum trajectory is described by a stochastic master equation with Poisson noise. Such limits are expected to give rise to quantum jumps between the pointer states associated with the non-demolition measurement. A surprising discovery in earlier work [Tilloy et al., Phys. Rev. A 92, 052111 (2015)] on quantum trajectories with Brownian noise was the phenomena of spikes observed in between the quantum jumps. Here, we show that spikes are observed also for Poisson noise. We consider three cases where the non-demolition is broken by adding, to the basic strong measurement dynamics, either unitary evolution or thermal noise or additional measurements. We present a complete analysis of the spike and jump statistics for all three cases using the fact that the dynamics effectively corresponds to that of stochastic resetting. We provide numerical results to support our analytic results.</description>

Abstract: The mechanical movement driven by chemical gradients provides the primordial energy for biological functions. Its thermodynamic properties remains inclusive, especially for a dynamical change of energy demand in biological systems. In this article, we obtain a constraint relation between the changing output power and the conversion efficiency for a chemically fuelled rotary motor analogous to the $\mathrm{F}_{0}$-motor of ATPase. We find the efficiency at maximum power is half of the maximum quasi-static efficiency. These findings shall aid in the understanding of natural chemical engines and inspire the manual design and control of chemically fuelled microscale engines.</description>

      <title>Finite-size Nagle-Kardar model: Casimir force</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive exact results for the critical Casimir force (CCF) within the
  Nagle-Kardar model with periodic boundary conditions (PBC's). The model represents one-dimensional Ising chain with long-range equivalent-neighbor ferromagnetic interactions of strength $J_{l}/N&gt;0$ superimposed on the nearest-neighbor interactions of strength $J_{s}$ which could be either ferromagnetic ($J_{s}&gt;0$) or antiferromagnetic ($J_{s}&lt;0$). In the infinite system limit the model exhibits in the plane $(K_s=\beta J_s,K_l=\beta J_l)$ a critical line $2 K_l=\exp{\left(-2 K_s\right)}, K_s&gt;-\ln3/4$, which ends at a tricritical point $(K_l=-\sqrt{3}/2, K_s=-\ln3/4)$. The critical Casimir amplitudes are: $\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (cr)}=1/4$ at the critical line, and $\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (tr)}=1/3$ at the tricritical point. Quite unexpectedly, with the imposed PBC's the CCF exhibits very unusual behavior as a function of temperature and magnetic field. It is \textit{repulsive} near the critical line and tricritical point, decaying rapidly with separation from those two singular regimes fast away from them and becoming \textit{attractive}, displaying in which the maximum amplitude of the attraction exceeds the maximum amplitude of repulsion.
  This represents a violation of the widely-accepted ``boundary condition rule,'' which holds that the CCF is attractive for equivalent BC's and repulsive for conflicting BC's \textit{independently} of the actual bulk universality class of the phase transition under investigation.</description>

      <title>Fast Sampling of Protein Conformational Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein function does not solely depend on structure but often relies on dynamical transitions between distinct conformations. Despite this fact, our ability to characterize or predict protein dynamics is substantially less developed compared to state-of-the-art protein structure prediction. Molecular simulations provide unique opportunities to study protein dynamics, but the timescales associated with conformational changes generate substantial challenges. Enhanced sampling algorithms with collective variables can greatly reduce the computational cost of sampling slow processes. However, defining collective variables suitable to enhance sampling of protein conformational transitions is non-trivial. Low-frequency vibrations have long been considered as promising candidates for collective variable but their identification so far relied on assumptions inherently invalid at low frequencies. We recently introduced an analysis of molecular vibrations that does not rely on such approximations and remains accurate at low frequencies. Here, we modified this approach to efficiently isolate low-frequency vibrations in proteins and applied it to a set of five proteins of varying complexity. We demonstrate that our approach is not only highly reproducible but results in collective variables that consistently enhance sampling of protein conformational transitions and associated free energy surfaces on timescales compatible with high throughput applications. This enables the efficient generation of protein conformational ensembles, which will be key for future prediction algorithms aiming beyond static protein structures.</description>

      <title>Self-trapping phenomenon, multistability and chaos in open anisotropic Dicke dimer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate semiclassical dynamics of a coupled atom-photon interacting system described by a dimer of anisotropic Dicke model in the presence of photon loss, exhibiting a rich variety of non-linear dynamics. Based on symmetries and dynamical classification, we characterize and chart out various dynamical phases in a phase diagram. A key feature of this system is the multistability of different dynamical states, particularly the coexistence of various superradiant phases as well as limit cycles. Remarkably, this dimer system manifests self-trapping phenomena, resulting in a photon population imbalance between the cavities. Such a self-trapped state arises from a saddle-node bifurcation, which can be understood from an equivalent Landau-Ginzburg description. Additionally, we identify a unique class of oscillatory dynamics self-trapped limit cycle, hosting self-trapping of photons. The absence of stable dynamical phases leads to the onset of chaos, which is diagnosed using the saturation value of the decorrelator dynamics. Moreover, the self-trapped states can coexist with chaotic attractor, which may have intriguing consequences in quantum dynamics. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Scalings of Quantum Entropies in Long-Range Heisenberg Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, building on state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we perform systematic finite-size scaling of both entanglement and participation entropies for long-range Heisenberg chain with unfrustrated power-law decaying interactions. We find distinctive scaling behaviors for both quantum entropies in the various regimes explored by tuning the decay exponent $\alpha$, thus capturing non-trivial features through logarithmic terms, beyond the case of linear Nambu-Goldstone modes. Our systematic analysis reveals that the quantum entanglement information, hidden in the scaling of the two studied entropies, can be obtained to the same level of order parameters and other usual finite-size observables of quantum many-body lattice models. The analysis and results obtained here can readily apply to more quantum criticalities in 1D and 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Human Expertise in Weighted Ensemble Simulations through Deep Learning based Information Bottleneck</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weighted ensemble (WE) method stands out as a widely used segment-based sampling technique renowned for its rigorous treatment of kinetics. The WE framework typically involves initially mapping the configuration space onto a low-dimensional collective variable (CV) space and then partitioning it into bins. The efficacy of WE simulations heavily depends on the selection of CVs and binning schemes. The recently proposed State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) method has emerged as a promising tool for automatically constructing CVs from data and guiding enhanced sampling through an iterative manner. In this work, we advance this data-driven pipeline by incorporating prior expert knowledge. Our hybrid approach combines SPIB-learned CVs to enhance sampling in explored regions with expert-based CVs to guide exploration in regions of interest, synergizing the strengths of both methods. Through benchmarking on alanine dipeptide and chignoin systems, we demonstrate that our hybrid approach effectively guides WE simulations to sample states of interest, and reduces run-to-run variances. Moreover, our integration of the SPIB model also enhances the analysis and interpretation of WE simulation data by effectively identifying metastable states and pathways, and offering direct visualization of dynamics.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we develop a panoramic schematic of a quantum thermoelectric circuit theory in the steady state regime. We establish the foundations of the said premise by defining the analogs of Kirchhoff's laws for heat currents and temperature gradients. We further show that our approach encompasses various circuits like thermal diode, transistor, and Wheatstone bridge. Additionally, we have been able to develop a model of a quantum thermal step transformer. We also construct a novel model of a thermal adder circuit, paving the way to develop thermal integrated circuits. This sheds new light on the present architecture of quantum device engineering.</description>
