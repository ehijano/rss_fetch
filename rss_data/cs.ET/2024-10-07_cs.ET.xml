      <title>Toward Adaptive Tracking and Communication via an Airborne Maneuverable Bi-Static ISAC System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose an airborne maneuverable bi-static integrated sensing and communication system where both the transmitter and receiver are unmanned aerial vehicles. By timely forming a dynamic bi-static range based on the motion information of the target, such a system can provide an adaptive two dimensional tracking and communication services. Towards this end, a trajectory optimization problem for both transmits and receive UAV is formulated to achieve high-accurate motion state estimation by minimizing the time-variant Cramer Rao bound, subject to the sufficient communication signal-to-noise ratio to maintain communication channel prediction error. Then we develop an efficient approach based on the successive convex approximation technique and the S-procedure to address the problem. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed airborne maneuverable bi-static ISAC system is able to obtain higher tracking accuracy compared with the static or semi-dynamic ISAC system.</description>

      <title>MQT Qudits: A Software Framework for Mixed-Dimensional Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds great promise for surpassing the limits of classical devices in many fields. Despite impressive developments, however, current research is primarily focused on qubits. At the same time, quantum hardware based on multi-level, qudit, systems offers a range of advantages, including expanded gate sets, higher information density, and improved computational efficiency, which might play a key role in overcoming not only the limitations of classical machines but also of current qubit-based quantum devices. However, working with qudits faces challenges not only in experimental control but particularly in algorithm development and quantum software. In this work, we introduce MQT Qudits, an open-source tool, which, as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT), is built to assist in designing and implementing applications for mixed-dimensional qudit devices. We specify a standardized language for mixed-dimension systems and discuss circuit specification, compilation to hardware gate sets, efficient circuit simulation, and open challenges. MQT Qudits is available at github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qudits and on pypi at pypi.org/project/mqt.qudits.</description>

      <title>GTQCP: Greedy Topology-Aware Quantum Circuit Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Greedy Topology-Aware Quantum Circuit Partitioning (GTQCP), a novel quantum gate circuit partitioning method which partitions circuits by applying a greedy heuristic to the qubit dependency graph of the circuit. GTQCP is compared against three other gate partitioning methods, two of which (QuickPartitioner and ScanPartitioner) are part of the Berkley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit. GTQCP is shown to have 18% run time improvement ratio over the fastest approach (QuickPartitioner), and a 96% improvement over the highest quality approach (ScanPartitioner). The algorithm also demonstrates nearly identical result quality (number of partitions) compared with ScanPartitioner, and a 38% quality improvement over QuickPartitioner.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In future wireless systems of beyond 5G and 6G, addressing diverse applications with varying quality requirements is essential. Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architectures offer the potential for dynamic resource adaptation based on traffic demands. However, achieving real-time resource orchestration remains a challenge. Simultaneously, Digital Twin (DT) technology holds promise for testing and analysing complex systems, offering a unique platform for addressing dynamic operation and automation in O-RAN architectures. Yet, developing DTs for complex 5G/6G networks poses challenges, including data exchanges, ML model training data availability, network dynamics, processing power limitations, interdisciplinary collaboration needs, and a lack of standardized methodologies. This paper provides an overview of Open RAN architecture, trend and challenges, proposing the DT concepts for O-RAN with solution examples showcasing its integration into the framework.</description>

      <title>AiBAT: Artificial Intelligence/Instructions for Build, Assembly, and Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instructions for Build, Assembly, and Test (IBAT) refers to the process used whenever any operation is conducted on hardware, including tests, assembly, and maintenance. Currently, the generation of IBAT documents is time-intensive, as users must manually reference and transfer information from engineering diagrams and parts lists into IBAT instructions. With advances in machine learning and computer vision, however, it is possible to have an artificial intelligence (AI) model perform the partial filling of the IBAT template, freeing up engineer time for more highly skilled tasks. AiBAT is a novel system for assisting users in authoring IBATs. It works by first analyzing assembly drawing documents, extracting information and parsing it, and then filling in IBAT templates with the extracted information. Such assisted authoring has potential to save time and reduce cost. This paper presents an overview of the AiBAT system, including promising preliminary results and discussion on future work.</description>

      <title>Q-SCALE: Quantum computing-based Sensor Calibration for Advanced Learning and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a world burdened by air pollution, the integration of state-of-the-art sensor calibration techniques utilizing Quantum Computing (QC) and Machine Learning (ML) holds promise for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of air quality monitoring systems in smart cities. This article investigates the process of calibrating inexpensive optical fine-dust sensors through advanced methodologies such as Deep Learning (DL) and Quantum Machine Learning (QML). The objective of the project is to compare four sophisticated algorithms from both the classical and quantum realms to discern their disparities and explore possible alternative approaches to improve the precision and dependability of particulate matter measurements in urban air quality surveillance. Classical Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are evaluated against their quantum counterparts: Variational Quantum Regressors (VQR) and Quantum LSTM (QLSTM) circuits. Through meticulous testing, including hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation, the study assesses the potential of quantum models to refine calibration performance. Our analysis shows that: the FFNN model achieved superior calibration accuracy on the test set compared to the VQR model in terms of lower L1 loss function (2.92 vs 4.81); the QLSTM slightly outperformed the LSTM model (loss on the test set: 2.70 vs 2.77), despite using fewer trainable weights (66 vs 482).</description>

      <title>Research Directions for Verifiable Crypto-Physically Secure TEEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A niche corner of the Web3 world is increasingly making use of hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to build decentralized infrastructure. One of the motivations to use TEEs is to go beyond the current performance limitations of cryptography-based alternatives such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), and multi-party computation (MPC). Despite their appealing advantages, current TEEs suffer from serious limitations as they are not secure against physical attacks, and their attestation mechanism is rooted in the chip manufacturer's trust. As a result, Web3 applications have to rely on cloud infrastruture to act as trusted guardians of hardware-based TEEs and have to accept to trust chip manufacturers. This work aims at exploring how we could potentially architect and implement chips that would be secure against physical attacks and would not require putting trust in chip manufacturers. One goal of this work is to motivate the Web3 movement to acknowledge and leverage the substantial amount of relevant hardware research that already exists. In brief, a combination of: (1) physical unclonable functions (PUFs) to secure the root-of-trust; (2) masking and redundancy techniques to secure computations; (3) open source hardware and imaging techniques to verify that a chip matches its expected design; can help move towards attesting that a given TEE can be trusted without the need to trust a cloud provider and a chip manufacturer.</description>

      <title>A 9T4R RRAM-Based ACAM for Analogue Template Matching at the Edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous shift of computational bottlenecks to the memory access and data transfer, especially for AI applications, poses the urgent needs of re-engineering the computer architecture fundamentals. Many edge computing applications, like wearable and implantable medical devices, introduce increasingly more challenges to conventional computing systems due to the strict requirements of area and power at the edge. Emerging technologies, like Resistive RAM (RRAM), have shown a promising momentum in developing neuro-inspired analogue computing paradigms capable of achieving high classification capabilities alongside high energy efficiency. In this work, we present a novel RRAM-based Analogue Content Addressable Memory (ACAM) for on-line analogue template matching applications. This ACAM-based template matching architecture aims to achieve energy-efficient classification where low energy is of utmost importance. We are showcasing a highly tuneable novel RRAM-based ACAM pixel implemented using a commercial 180nm CMOS technology and in-house RRAM technology and exhibiting low energy dissipation of approximately 0.036pJ and 0.16pJ for mismatch and match, respectively, at 66MHz with 3V voltage supply. A proof-of-concept system-level implementation based on this novel pixel design is also implemented in 180nm.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Hyperdimensional Computing Using Photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past few years, silicon photonics-based computing has emerged as a promising alternative to CMOS-based computing for Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Unfortunately, the non-linear operations and the high-precision requirements of DNNs make it extremely challenging to design efficient silicon photonics-based systems for DNN inference and training. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is an emerging, brain-inspired machine learning technique that enjoys several advantages over existing DNNs, including being lightweight, requiring low-precision operands, and being robust to noise introduced by the nonidealities in the hardware. For HDC, computing in-memory (CiM) approaches have been widely used, as CiM reduces the data transfer cost if the operands can fit into the memory. However, inefficient multi-bit operations, high write latency, and low endurance make CiM ill-suited for HDC. On the other hand, the existing electro-photonic DNN accelerators are inefficient for HDC because they are specifically optimized for matrix multiplication in DNNs and consume a lot of power with high-precision data converters.
  In this paper, we argue that photonic computing and HDC complement each other better than photonic computing and DNNs, or CiM and HDC. We propose PhotoHDC, the first-ever electro-photonic accelerator for HDC training and inference, supporting the basic, record-based, and graph encoding schemes. Evaluating with popular datasets, we show that our accelerator can achieve two to five orders of magnitude lower EDP than the state-of-the-art electro-photonic DNN accelerators for implementing HDC training and inference. PhotoHDC also achieves four orders of magnitude lower energy-delay product than CiM-based accelerators for both HDC training and inference.</description>

      <title>Do Not Trust Power Management: A Survey on Internal Energy-based Attacks Circumventing Trusted Execution Environments Security Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past few years, several research groups have introduced innovative hardware designs for Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), aiming to secure applications against potentially compromised privileged software, including the kernel. Since 2015, a new class of software-enabled hardware attacks leveraging energy management mechanisms has emerged. These internal energy-based attacks comprise fault, side-channel and covert channel attacks. Their aim is to bypass TEE security guarantees and expose sensitive information such as cryptographic keys. They have increased in prevalence in the past few years. Popular TEE implementations, such as ARM TrustZone and Intel SGX, incorporate countermeasures against these attacks. However, these countermeasures either hinder the capabilities of the power management mechanisms or have been shown to provide insufficient system protection. This article presents the first comprehensive knowledge survey of these attacks, along with an evaluation of literature countermeasures. We believe that this study will spur further community efforts towards this increasingly important type of attacks.</description>

      <title>Digital-analog quantum genetic algorithm using Rydberg-atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) combines digital gates with analog operations, offering an alternative paradigm for universal quantum computation. This approach leverages the higher fidelities of analog operations and the flexibility of local single-qubit gates. In this paper, we propose a quantum genetic algorithm within the DAQC framework using a Rydberg-atom emulator. The algorithm employs single-qubit operations in the digital domain and a global driving interaction based on the Rydberg Hamiltonian in the analog domain. We evaluate the algorithm performance by estimating the ground-state energy of Hamiltonians, with a focus on molecules such as $\rm H_2$, $\rm LiH$, and $\rm BeH_2$. Our results show energy estimations with less than 1% error and state overlaps nearing 1, with computation times ranging from a few minutes for $\rm H_2$ (2-qubit circuits) to one to two days for $\rm LiH$ and $\rm BeH_2$ (6-qubit circuits). The gate fidelities of global analog operations further underscore DAQC as a promising quantum computing strategy in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Challenges in Network Intrusion Detection Systems: Research Insights and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has brought significant advances in cybersecurity, particularly in the development of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). These improvements are mainly attributed to the ability of machine learning algorithms to identify complex relationships between features and effectively generalize to unseen data. Deep neural networks, in particular, contributed to this progress by enabling the analysis of large amounts of training data, significantly enhancing detection performance. However, machine learning models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where carefully crafted input data can mislead the model into making incorrect predictions. While adversarial threats in unstructured data, such as images and text, have been extensively studied, their impact on structured data like network traffic is less explored. This survey aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive review of machine learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) and thoroughly analyzing their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. We critically examine existing research in NIDS, highlighting key trends, strengths, and limitations, while identifying areas that require further exploration. Additionally, we discuss emerging challenges in the field and offer insights for the development of more robust and resilient NIDS. In summary, this paper enhances the understanding of adversarial attacks and defenses in NIDS and guide future research in improving the robustness of machine learning models in cybersecurity applications.</description>
