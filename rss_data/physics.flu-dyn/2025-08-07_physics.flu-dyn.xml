      <title>Waviness and self-sustained turbulence in plane Couette-Poiseuille flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations of a Couette-Poiseuille flow were performed near the transition to turbulence to investigate the nonlinear relationship between streak waviness and rolls. This relationship is a key step in Waleffe's model for a self-sustaining process (SSP). Simulations were conducted for Reynolds numbers ranging from 500 to 940, and a range of initial perturbation amplitudes were used. In these simulations, the streaks, rolls, and streak waviness initially increase. The optimal time for this growth is close to the linear transient growth period for small perturbations, but much shorter for large, highly nonlinear perturbations. For higher Reynolds numbers and large initial perturbations, the velocity field reaches a turbulent steady state, whereas it relaxes to a laminar state in other cases. The main result is that the waviness of the streaks is a quadratic function of the rolls, provided that its value is sufficiently large.Direct numerical simulations of a Couette-Poiseuille flow were performed near the transition to turbulence to investigate the nonlinear relationship between streak waviness and rolls.

      <title>Particle manipulation by hydrodynamic effects in vortical Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main motivation of this work is the quantitative prediction and description of particle manipulation (displacement across streamlines) in microfluidic flow. Much attention has been paid recently to placing particles in fast oscillatory flow fields, usually driven by microbubbles actuated by low-frequency ultrasound, where particle inertia leads to deterministic displacements. However, such devices invariably set up simultaneous streaming flows that are interpretable as driven Stokes flows. The potential role of these flows in not just passively transporting but likewise manipulating the particles has not been appreciated. Therefore, we investigate whether a Stokes flow by itself can meaningfully affect the displacement of a single particle or a rigid dumbbell, given the properties and symmetries of the flow. To manipulate a single particle, its hydrodynamic interaction with a nearby boundary is crucial for obtaining non-trivial results. To irreversibly displace a particle using this effect, we find that the flow symmetry must be broken in specified ways. Controlling the flow geometry, one can drive particles to fixed points, cycles, or towards boundaries, with the possibility of controlling eventual attachment (sticking) of the particle. For rigid dumbbell particles, we show that such controlled displacement in Stokes flow is possible even without the presence of nearby boundaries, but again with requirements on the broken symmetry of the chosen flow. In practical microfluidic devices, these effects could be set up in manifold ways, by themselves or in combination with inertial forces for more versatile particle manipulation.</description>

      <title>Spatial marching with subgrid-scale local exact coherent structures in non-uniformly curved channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel multiple-scale spatial marching method for flows with slow streamwise variation. The key idea is to couple the boundary region equations, which govern large-scale flow evolution, with local exact coherent structures that capture small-scale dynamics. This framework is consistent with high-Reynolds-number asymptotic theory and offers a promising approach to construct time periodic finite amplitude solutions in a broad class of spatially developing shear flows. As a first application, we consider a non-uniformly curved channel flow, assuming that a finite-amplitude travelling wave solution of plane Poiseuille flow is sustained at the inlet. The method allows for the estimation of momentum transport and highlights the impact of the inlet condition on both the transport properties and the overall flow structure. We then consider a case with gradually decreasing curvature, starting with Dean vortices at the inlet. In this setting, small external oscillatory disturbances can give rise to subcritical self-sustained states that persist even after the curvature vanishes.</description>

      <title>Simulating The Urban Canopy's Impact on Wind-Driven Natural Ventilation and Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The urban canopy affects wind in complex ways, making it challenging to predict wind-driven natural ventilation and cooling in buildings. Using large eddy simulations of coupled outdoor and indoor airflow, we study how the surrounding urban canopy and wind angle influence ventilation rates through four ventilation configurations: cross, corner, dual-room, and single-sided. Flow visualizations demonstrate how both large-scale flow patterns and local interference effects can influence ventilation rates by 50-85%. In general, lower density canopies give higher ventilation rates and wind angles that align with a direct path between two openings also lead to higher ventilation rates. However, interference effects from surrounding buildings can significantly change the local wind speed and direction, thus also changing ventilation rates. The magnitude of these interference effects depends on both the wind angle and surrounding building geometries. The effect of wind angle is less pronounced in a higher density canopy, where the urban canopy geometry more strongly guides the flow. The results demonstrate that the canopy's effect on ventilation rates is much more complex than those suggested by existing natural ventilation parameterizations.</description>

      <title>Variational mode decomposition analysis of the relationship between low-frequency shock-wave oscillations and buffet cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between low-frequency shock-wave oscillations and buffet cells on the main wing of the NASA common research model. The flow conditions were set at a Mach number of 0.85, Reynolds number of 2.27 $\times$ 10$^6$, and angle of attack of 4.82$^{\circ}$. Buffet cells are cellular patterns with spanwise periodicity that propagate toward the wing tip, with nondimensional frequencies (Strouhal numbers) of 0.2--0.6, higher than those of shock oscillations associated with transonic buffet. However, the physical mechanisms driving buffet cells and their interaction with low-frequency shock motion are not fully understood. This study employs variational mode decomposition-based nonstationary coherent structure (VMD-NCS) analysis applied to unsteady pressure-sensitive paint measurement data. The results reveal that the amplitude of buffet cells is not directly coupled to the low-frequency shock-wave oscillations but instead shows correlation with the boundary layer separation state. Strong buffet cell fluctuations persist in regions of sustained separation (midspan), while their amplitude varies with local separation/reattachment dynamics in regions of intermittent separation (outboard). These observations suggest that shock-waves are important to generate the adverse pressure gradient necessary for boundary layer separation, but their influence on buffet cells depends on the resulting separation behavior. This insight from experimental observations in this study is consistent with previous computational studies suggesting that buffet cell behavior depends on boundary layer separation characteristics. Moreover, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of VMD-NCS analysis for investigating nonstationary fluid phenomena with multiple spatial and temporal patterns.</description>

      <title>Sparse Narrow-Band Topology Optimization for Large-Scale Thermal-Fluid Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fluid-based topology-optimization methodology for convective heat-transfer problems that can manage an extensive number of design variables, enabling the fine geometric features required for the next generation of heat-exchanger designs. Building on the classical Borrvall--Petersson formulation for Stokes flow, we develop a narrow-band optimization algorithm that concentrates computational effort on the fluid--solid interface, where it is most needed. To address the high cost of repeated forward and adjoint analyses, we utilize a flow solver specifically optimized for high-resolution voxel grids. The solver reduces memory usage and computational time by removing solid voxels from the analyses and directly imposing the no-slip boundary condition at the fluid--solid interface. It also employs an efficient preconditioner built on the Algebraic Multigrid method that ensures fast and reliable convergence for intricate flow configurations. The discretization uses a staggered-grid finite-difference scheme (marker-and-cell) for the Stokes--Brinkman model and an upwind finite-difference scheme for the heat convection--diffusion equation, ensuring stability at high Peclet numbers. We demonstrate the method on several examples, including the optimization of a two-fluid heat exchanger at $Pe = 10^{4}$ on a $370^{3}$ grid comprising $5 \times 10^{7}$ design variables using only a single desktop workstation. The framework shows considerable promise for advancing large-scale thermal-fluid applications and constitutes an important step toward a full conjugate-heat-transfer design methodology for high-Reynolds-number Navier--Stokes flows.</description>

      <title>Mathematical formulation of mode-to-mode energy transfers and energy fluxes in compressible turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding compressible turbulence is critical for modeling atmospheric, astrophysical, and engineering flows. However, compressible turbulence poses a more significant challenge than incompressible turbulence. We present a novel mathematical framework to compute \textit{mode-to-mode energy transfer rates} and energy fluxes for compressible flows. The formalism captures detailed energy conservation within triads and allows decomposition of transfers into rotational, compressive, and mixed components, providing a clear picture of energy exchange among velocity and internal energy modes. We also establish analogies with incompressible hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic flows, highlighting the framework's universality in studying energy transfers.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Injection assisted by Diffusion Models for Scale Resolving Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present research proposes a new memory-efficient method using diffusion models to inject turbulent inflow conditions into Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) for various flow problems. A guided diffusion model was trained on Decaying Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence (DHIT) samples, characterized by different turbulent kinetic energy levels and integral length scales. Samples generated by the diffusion model accurately reproduce turbulence statistics, such as the energy spectrum and the two-point autocorrelation functions, while preserving the ability to generate instantaneous three-dimensional velocity fields with detailed fluctuations. Physical representativeness is also evaluated by injecting the \textit{synthetic} samples into a free domain (i.e., without any wall boundary) through an inlet boundary condition. The method demonstrates promising results regarding energy spectrum, spatial correlation, turbulent kinetic energy level, and integral length scales without increasing the development distance as compared to a library-based method. The following article has been submitted to/accepted by Physics of Fluid (AIP Publishing LLC). After publication, it will be available https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0278541.</description>

      <title>Impact of porous media heterogeneity on convective mixing in a Rayleigh-B\'enard instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the effect of the heterogeneity of a porous medium on convective mixing. We consider a system where a Rayleigh-B\'enard instability is triggered by a temperature difference between the top and bottom boundaries. Heterogeneity is represented by multi-Gaussian log-normally distributed permeability fields. We explore the effect of the Rayleigh number, the variance and correlation length of the log-permeability field on the fingering patterns, heat flux, mixing state and flow structure. Heat flux increases for all heterogeneous cases compared to the homogeneous ones. When heterogeneity is weak and the horizontal correlation length small, flux exhibits minimal sensitivity to the variance of the log-permeability. When the correlation length increases, flux increases proportionally to the log-permeability variance. The mixing state is evaluated through the temperature variance and the intensity of segregation. Both take higher values, compared to their homogeneous analogues, when the correlation length and the variance of the permeability are increased. This indicates that even if heat flux increases, the system is less well mixed. The flow structure shows that in homogeneous and weakly heterogeneous cases there is a relation between the location of high strain rate and stagnation point, while for strongly heterogeneous cases, high strain rate zones are linked to high permeability areas near the boundaries, where temperature plume originate. The interface width tends to decrease as the variance and the correlation length of the permeability field are augmented, suggesting that the interface undergoes a higher stretching in heterogeneous porous media.</description>

      <title>On the interaction of fish and marine hydrokinetic turbines: Insights gained through experimental and computational observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal and riverine hydrokinetic turbines offer promising solutions for renewable energy generation in aquatic environments. However, their ecological impact, especially on fish behavior, warrants a thorough investigation. This study presents an integrated experimental and computational analysis of fish turbine interactions, combining laboratory observations with high fidelity large eddy simulations. The simulations capture essential flow features, including wake asymmetry, vortex shedding, and spatial variations in turbulence intensity, under varying flow and rotational regimes of a geometry resolved vertical axis turbine. Behavioral experiments with rainbow trout reveal a consistent tendency to avoid high turbulence and high shear regions, favoring low turbulence zones such as downstream sidewalls. Hydrodynamic stressors and energetic demands were characterized using turbulence metrics, including turbulence kinetic energy, Reynolds stress, and integral length scale, along with estimations of fish generated thrust force. Our results demonstrate that turbine induced turbulence significantly influences fish movement and habitat selection, highlighting the need to consider behavioral responses in conventional fish injury assessment frameworks. These findings provide critical insights for designing and operating hydrokinetic turbines in ecologically sensitive waters, ensuring a balance between renewable energy extraction and aquatic ecosystem protection.</description>

      <title>Steady periodic hydroelastic waves on the water surface of finite depth with constant vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study analyzes steady periodic hydroelastic waves propagating on the water surface of finite depth beneath nonlinear elastic membranes. Unlike previous work \cite{BaldiT,BaldiT1,Toland,Toland1}, our formulation accommodates rotational flows in finite-depth water. We employ a conformal mapping technique to transform the free-boundary problem into a quasilinear pseudodifferential equation, resulting in a periodic function of a single variable. This reduction allows the existence question for such waves to be addressed within the framework of bifurcation theory. With the wavelength normalized to 2$\pi$, the problem features two free parameters: the wave speed and the constant vorticity. Under the assumption of the local convexity of undeformed membrane's stored energy, it is observed that the problem, when linearized about uniform horizontal flow, has at most two independent solutions for any values of the parameters. Fixing the vorticity and treating the wave speed as the bifurcation parameter, the linearized problem possesses a single solution. We demonstrate that the full nonlinear problem exhibits a sheet of solutions comprising a family of curves bifurcating from simple eigenvalues. Taking both the wave speed and vorticity as parameters, when the constant vorticity approaches critical values, the linearized problem exhibits a two-dimensional kernel. Near these critical points, a secondary bifurcation curve emerges from the primary solution branch. This secondary branch consists of ripple solutions on the surface.</description>

      <title>Convolutional autoencoders for the reconstruction of three-dimensional interfacial multiphase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a comprehensive investigation of autoencoders for reduced-order modeling of three-dimensional multiphase flows. Focusing on the accuracy of reconstructing multiphase flow volume/mass fractions with a standard convolutional architecture, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of different interface representation choices (diffuse, sharp, level set). We use a combination of synthetic data with non-trivial interface topologies and high-resolution simulation data of multiphase homogeneous isotropic turbulence for training and validation. This study clarifies the best practices for reducing the dimensionality of multiphase flows via autoencoders. Consequently, this paves the path for uncoupling the training of autoencoders for accurate reconstruction and the training of temporal or input/output models such as neural operators (e.g., FNOs, DeepONets) and neural ODEs on the lower-dimensional latent space given by the autoencoders. As such, the implications of this study are significant and of interest to the multiphase flow community and beyond.</description>

      <title>Buoyancy-driven flow regimes for a melting vertical ice cylinder in saline water</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of salt in seawater significantly affects the melt rate and morphological evolution of ice. This study investigates the melting process of a vertical cylinder in saline water using a combination of laboratory experiments and direct numerical simulations. The two-dimensional (2D) direct numerical simulations and 3D experiments achieve thermal Rayleigh numbers up to $\text{Ra}_{T}= \mathcal{O}\left(10^{9}\right)$ and saline Rayleigh numbers up to $\text{Ra}_{S}=\mathcal{O}\left(10^{12}\right)$. Some 3D simulations of the vertical ice cylinder are conducted at $\text{Ra}_{T}= \mathcal{O}\left(10^{5}\right)$ to confirm that the results in 2D simulations are qualitatively similar to those in 3D simulations. The mean melt rate exhibits a non-monotonic relationship with ambient salinity. With increasing salinity, the mean melt rate initially decreases towards the point where thermal and saline effects balance, after which it increases again. Based on the ambient salinity, the flow can be categorized into three regimes: temperature-driven flow, salinity-driven flow, and thermal-saline competing flow. In the temperature-driven and competing flow regimes, we find that the mean melt rate follows a $\text{Ra}_{T_d}^{1/4}$ scaling. In contrast, in the salinity-driven flow regime, we see a transition from a $\text{Ra}_{T_d}^{1/4}$ to a $\text{Ra}_{T_d}^{1/3}$ scaling. Additionally, the mean melt rate follows a $\text{Ra}_{S_d}^{1/3}$ scaling in this regime. The ice cylinder develops distinct morphologies in different flow regimes. In the thermal-saline competing flow regime, distinctive scallop (dimpled) patterns emerge along the ice cylinder due to the competition between thermal buoyancy and saline buoyancy. We observe these scallop patterns to migrate downwards over time, due to local differences in the melt rate, for which we provide a qualitative explanation.</description>

The bending confines the ceiling height of the plume, delaying its smoke dispersion and increasing fire spotting risks. This study aims to investigate the onset of plume bending in a sheared crossflow and stratified atmospheric conditions, providing insights into smoke dispersion and fire behavior. Large Eddy Simulations (LES) using the Cloud Model 1 (CM1) are conducted to simulate the observed development of plume structure and its associated dynamical fields, with particular focus on the plume head and its evolution from initial plume development under different fire intensities and atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) conditions. A scaling analysis of plume ceiling height is proposed based on a modified Byram's convective number that accounts for sheared crossflow. The proposed scaling agrees well with the LES results, highlighting the critical roles of shear and stratification in controlling plume dynamics.</description>

      <title>A pencil-distributed finite-difference solver for extreme-scale calculations of turbulent wall flows at high Reynolds number</title>

Abstract: We present a computational method for extreme-scale simulations of incompressible turbulent wall flows at high Reynolds numbers. The numerical algorithm extends a popular method for solving second-order finite differences Poisson/Helmholtz equations using a pencil-distributed parallel tridiagonal solver to improve computational performance at scale. The benefits of this approach were investigated for high-Reynolds-number turbulent channel flow simulations, with up to about 80 billion grid points and 1024 GPUs on the European flagship supercomputers Leonardo and LUMI. An additional GPU porting effort of the entire solver had to be undertaken for the latter. Our results confirm that, while 1D domain decompositions are favorable for smaller systems, they become inefficient or even impossible at large scales. This restriction is relaxed by adopting a pencil-distributed approach. The results show that, at scale, the revised Poisson solver is about twice as fast as the baseline approach with the full-transpose algorithm for 2D domain decompositions. Strong and weak scalability tests show that the performance gains are due to the lower communication footprint. Additionally, to secure high performance when solving for wall-normal implicit diffusion, we propose a reworked flavor of parallel cyclic reduction (PCR) that is split into pre-processing and runtime steps. During pre-processing, small sub-arrays with independent 1D coefficients are computed by parallel GPU threads, without any global GPU communication. Then, at runtime, the reworked PCR enables a fast solution of implicit 1D diffusion without computational overhead. Our results show that the entire numerical solver, coupled with the PCR algorithm, enables extreme-scale simulations with 2D pencil decompositions, which do not suffer performance losses even when compared to the best 1D slab configurations available for smaller systems.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport characteristics of impinging ferrofluid droplets in the presence of a magnetic field</title>

Abstract: Droplet interactions with solid surfaces are fundamental to natural phenomena and hold significant commercial relevance across diverse applications. While the impingement dynamics of conventional aqueous droplets on solid substrates are well-characterized, the behavior of non-aqueous droplets, particularly those influenced by external force fields like electric or magnetic fields, remains a less explored domain. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of a magnetic field on the impingement dynamics of ferrofluid droplets on a heated solid surface. Ferrofluids are unique colloidal suspensions of magnetic nanoparticles within a non-magnetic carrier fluid, enabling external manipulation of their dynamic properties through magnetic forces. The application of a magnetic field introduces an attractive force within the ferrofluid, fundamentally altering the droplet's spreading behavior and, consequently, its transport characteristics upon impact. Our findings reveal a substantial increase in both the maximum spreading diameter and the contact time between the droplet and the substrate, directly leading to enhanced thermal transport efficiency. Furthermore, the magnetic force effectively suppresses droplet bounce-off from hydrophobic surfaces. These critical parameters can be precisely controlled by adjusting the strength of the induced magnetic force. Such interactions can be used in the design of thermal switches and thermal management systems. The multi-physics interactions of magnetic fields, fluid flow, interface tracking, and heat transfer within the multiphase system are computationally modelled to examine the effect of Weber number and contact angle on maximum spreading and associated heat transfer characteristics.</description>

      <title>New comprehensive description of the scaling evolution of the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamic system</title>

Abstract: We study the evolution of primordial magnetic fields until the recombination epoch, which is constrained by the conservation of magnetic helicity density if they are maximally helical and by the Hosking integral if they are non-helical. We combine these constraints with conditions obtained by estimating time scales of energy dissipation processes to describe the evolution of magnetic field strength and magnetic coherence length analytically. The dissipation processes depend on whether magnetic or kinetic energy is dominant, whether the decay dynamics is linear or not, and whether the dominant dissipation term is shear viscosity or drag force. We apply the description to compare constraints on primordial magnetic fields at different epochs in the early universe and argue that magnetogenesis before the electroweak symmetry breaking is not feasible.</description>

      <title>DBSCAN in domains with periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many scientific problems involve data that is embedded in a space with periodic boundary conditions. This can for instance be related to an inherent cyclic or rotational symmetry in the data or a spatially extended periodicity. When analyzing such data, well-tailored methods are needed to obtain efficient approaches that obey the periodic boundary conditions of the problem. In this work, we present a method for applying a clustering algorithm to data embedded in a periodic domain based on the DBSCAN algorithm, a widely used unsupervised machine learning method that identifies clusters in data. The proposed method internally leverages the conventional DBSCAN algorithm for domains with open boundaries, such that it remains compatible with all optimized implementations for neighborhood searches in open domains. In this way, it retains the same optimized runtime complexity of $O(N\log N)$. We demonstrate the workings of the proposed method using synthetic data in one, two and three dimensions and also apply it to a real-world example involving the clustering of bubbles in a turbulent flow. The proposed approach is implemented in a ready-to-use Python package that we make publicly available.</description>

      <title>Diffusive behavior of transport noise on $\mathbb{S}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically and numerically transport noise-induced diffusion in flows on the sphere. Previous analysis on the torus demonstrated that suitably chosen transport noise in the Euler equations leads to diffusive behavior resembling the Navier--Stokes equations. Here, we analyze dynamics on the sphere with noise-induced differential elliptic operator dissipation and characterize their energy and enstrophy decay properties. Through structure-preserving numerical simulations with the Zeitlin discretization, we demonstrate that appropriately scaled transport noise induces energy dissipation while preserving enstrophy and coadjoint orbits. The presented analysis lays a groundwork for further theoretical investigation of transport noise and supports the calibration of transport noise models as a parametrization for unresolved processes in geophysical fluid simulations.</description>
