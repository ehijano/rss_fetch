      <title>Relativistic particles in super-periodic potentials: exploring graphene and fractal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we employ the transfer matrix method to investigate relativistic particles in super-periodic potentials (SPPs) of arbitrary order $n \in I^{+}$. We calculate the reflection and transmission probabilities for spinless Klein particles encountering rectangular potential barriers with super-periodic repetition. It is found that spinless relativistic particles exhibit Klein tunneling and a significantly higher degree of reflection compared to their non-relativistic counterparts. Additionally, we analytically explore the behavior of experimentally realizable massless Dirac electrons as they encounter rectangular potential barriers with a super-periodic pattern in a monolayer of graphene. In this system, the transmission probability, conductance, and Fano factor are evaluated as functions of the number of barriers, the order of super-periodicity, and the angle of incidence. Our findings reveal that the transmission probability shows a series of resonances that depend on the number of barriers and the order of super-periodicity. We extend our analysis to specific cases within the Unified Cantor Potentials (UCPs)-$\gamma$ system ($\gamma$ is a scaling parameter greater than $1$), focusing on the General Cantor fractal system and the General Smith-Volterra-Cantor (GSVC) system. For the General Cantor fractal system, we calculate the tunneling probability, which reveals sharp transmission peaks and progressively thinner unit cell potentials as $G$ increases. In the GSVC system, we analyze the potential segment length and tunneling probability, observing nearly unity tunneling coefficients when $\gamma \approx 1$, as well as saturation behavior in transmission coefficients at higher stages $G$.</description>

      <title>The Toroidal Moments in Confined Nanomagnets and its Impact on Magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonreciprocity created by dipolar coupling, electric currents, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions is discussed in cases where the magnon propagation direction has a component parallel to the toroidal moment of the magnetization. A criterion for calculating the toroidal moments is established, addressing the issue of correct origin selection based on compensated and uncompensated magnetizations. This criterion is then applied to various nonreciprocal magnetic systems, with the calculations consistent with those reported in the literature and predicting the existence of nonreciprocity in a more general manner. These results broaden the physical significance of the toroidal moment and facilitate the identification and estimation of nonreciprocity in magnonic systems. This work also clarifies the interrelations between different definitions of the toroidal moment for confined structures, where a surface term arising from surface-bound currents connects these definitions without the need for time-averaging. Comparing these definitions of the toroidal moment applied to different magnetic textures demonstrates that they are always parallel but may differ in magnitude and sign. The discrepancy in the different definitions is deemed irrelevant since its direction, rather than its magnitude, primarily predicts the existence of magnon nonreciprocity.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic evanescent field associated with surface acoustic wave: Response of metallic thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface acoustic waves (SAWs), coherent vibrational modes localized at solid surfaces, have been employed to manipulate and detect electronic and magnetic states in condensed-matter systems via strain. SAWs are commonly excited in a piezoelectric material, often the substrate. In such systems, SAWs not only generate strain but also electric field at the surface. Conventional analysis of the electric field accompanying the SAW invokes the electrostatic approximation, which may fall short in fully capturing its essential characteristics by neglecting the effect of the magnetic field. Here we study the electric and magnetic fields associated with SAWs without introducing the electrostatic approximation. The plane wave solution takes the form of an evanescent field that decays along the surface normal with a phase velocity equal to the speed of sound. If a metallic film is placed on the piezoelectric substrate, a time- and space-varying electric field permeates into the film with a decay length along the film normal defined by the skin depth and the SAW wavelength. For films with high conductivity, the phase of the electric field varies along the film normal. The emergence of the evanescent field is a direct consequence of dropping the electrostatic approximation, providing a simple but critical physical interpretation of the SAW-induced electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Inducing Berry Curvature Dipole in Multilayer Graphene through Inhomogeneous Interlayer Sliding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breaking lattice symmetry is crucial for generating a nonzero Berry curvature. While manipulating twisting angles between adjacent layers has successfully broken lattice symmetry through strain field and generated nonzero Berry curvature, interlayer sliding in principle offers a promising alternative route. However, realizing uniform interlayer sliding faces experimental challenges due to its energetic instability. In this work, we introduce an experimentally feasible method, using a corrugated substrate to induce an inhomogeneous but energetically more stable interlayer sliding in multilayer graphene. Our simulations demonstrate that inhomogeneous interlayer sliding produces a sizable Berry curvature dipole, which can be further tuned by varying the interlayer sliding distances and potential differences. The resulting Berry curvature dipole magnitude is remarkably up to 100 times greater than the maximum displacement involved in the inhomogeneous sliding. Our results highlight inhomogeneous interlayer sliding as a viable and effective method to induce a significant Berry curvature dipole in graphene systems and propose the experimentally feasible way to realize it.</description>

      <title>Photoelectron superlubricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superlubricity, a state where friction between two contact surfaces is nearly zero, has a great potential to revolutionize various mechanical systems by significantly reducing energy dissipation and enhancing efficiency. It can be realized either by structural incommensurate contact between crystalline surfaces or by creating highly passive interfaces to cancel out the adhesive forces. However, fabricating and maintaining such superlubric surfaces still present challenges, often disabled by surface structural defects or susceptibility to humid atmospheres, which renders superlubricity fragile. Here, we propose a novel strategy of photoelectron superlubricity (PESL), where robust superlubricity can be achieved in humid atmospheres by in-situ laser-irradiating the contact interface of an amorphous carbon film sliding against sapphire ball. We demonstrate that PESL not only exhibits a high resistance to environmental disturbances but also features rapid response. The formation of PESL originates from the laser-irradiating induced formation of nanographene-layered interface and enrichment of photoelectrons at the interface, resulting in a repulsive electric field between the nanographene layers. The discovery of PESL opens a new avenue for achieving superlubricity, and also provides novel insights for smart friction, mechanical motion control and light manipulation.</description>

      <title>A parameter-free statistical model for two-dimensional carbon nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy degeneracy in physical systems may be induced by symmetries of the Hamiltonian, and the resonance of degeneracy states in carbon nanostructures can effectively enhance the stability of the system. Combining the octet rule, we introduce a parameter-free statistical model to determine the physical properties by lifting the energy degeneracy in carbon nanostructures. This model offers a direct path to accurately ascertain electron density distributions in quantum systems, akin to how charge density is used in density functional theory to deduce system properties. Our methodology diverges from traditional quantum mechanics, focusing instead on this unique statistical model by minimizing bonding free energy to determine the fundamental properties of materials. Applied to carbon nanoclusters and graphynes, our model not only precisely predicts bonding energies and electron density without relying on external parameters, but also enhances the prediction of electronic structures through bond occupancy numbers, which act as effective hopping integrals. This innovation offers insights into the structural properties and quantum behavior of electrons across various dimensions.</description>

      <title>A spinless spin qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-electrical baseband control of qubits facilitates scaling up quantum processors by removing issues of crosstalk and heat generation. In semiconductor quantum dots, this is enabled by multi-spin qubit encodings, such as the exchange-only qubit, where high-fidelity readout and both single- and two-qubit operations have been demonstrated. However, their performance is limited by unavoidable leakage states that are energetically close to the computational subspace. In this work, we introduce an alternative, scalable spin qubit architecture that leverages strong spin-orbit interactions of hole nanostructures for baseband qubit operations while completely eliminating leakage channels and reducing the overall gate overhead. This encoding is intrinsically robust to local variability in hole spin properties and operates with two degenerate states, removing the need for precise calibration and mitigating heat generation from fast signal sources. Finally, our architecture is fully compatible with current technology, utilizing the same initialization, readout, and multi-qubit protocols of state-of-the-art spin-1/2 systems. By addressing critical scalability challenges, our design offers a robust and scalable pathway for semiconductor spin qubit technologies.</description>

      <title>Underscreened Kondo Compensation in a Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A magnetic impurity with a larger $S=1$ spin remains partially screened by the Kondo effect when embedded in a metal. However, when placed within an $s$-wave superconductor, the interplay between the superconducting energy gap $\Delta$ and the Kondo temperature $T_K$ induces a quantum phase transition from an underscreened doublet Kondo to an unscreened triplet phase, typically occurring when $\Delta/T_K\approx 1$. We investigate the Kondo compensation of the impurity spin resulting from this partial screening across the quantum phase transition, which together with the spin-spin correlation function serves as a measure of the Kondo cloud's integrity. Deep within the unscreened triplet phase, $\Delta/T_K\gg 1$, the compensation vanishes, signifying complete decoupling of the impurity spin from the environment, while in the partially screened doublet phase, $\Delta/T_K\ll 1$, it asymptotically approaches $1/2$, indicating that half of the spin is screened. Notably, there is a universal jump in the compensation precisely at the phase transition, which we accurately calculate. The spin-spin correlation function exhibits an oscillatory pattern with an envelope function decaying as $\sim 1/x$ at short distances. At larger distances, the superconducting gap induces an exponentially decaying behavior $\sim \exp(-x/\xi_\Delta)$ governed by the superconducting correlation length $\xi_\Delta$, irrespective of the phase, without any distinctive features across the transition. Furthermore, the spectral functions of some relevant operators are evaluated and discussed. In terms of the methods used, a consistent description is provided through the application of multiplicative, numerical and density matrix renormalization group techniques.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Coulomb blockade in an atomic-scale quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling electron dynamics at optical clock rates is a fundamental challenge in lightwave-driven nanoelectronics. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast charge-state manipulation of individual selenium vacancies in monolayer and bilayer tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) using picosecond terahertz (THz) source pulses, focused onto the picocavity of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Using THz pump--THz probe time-domain sampling of the defect charge population, we capture atomic-scale snapshots of the transient Coulomb blockade, a signature of charge transport via quantized defect states. We identify back tunneling of localized charges to the tip electrode as a key challenge for lightwave-driven STM when probing electronic states with charge-state lifetimes exceeding the pulse duration. However, we show that back tunneling can be mitigated by the Franck-Condon blockade, which limits accessible vibronic transitions and promotes unidirectional charge transport. Our rate equation model accurately reproduces the time-dependent tunneling process across the different coupling regimes. This work builds on recent progress in imaging coherent lattice and quasiparticle dynamics with lightwave-driven STM and opens new avenues for exploring ultrafast charge dynamics in low-dimensional materials, advancing the development of lightwave-driven nanoscale electronics.</description>

      <title>Transport theory and spin-transfer physics in d-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a mesoscale transport theory for the charge and spin degrees of freedom of itinerant carriers in a $d$-wave altermagnet. Our effective Lagrangian description is built upon the slave-boson formulation of the microscopic $t-J$ model. We obtain a spin-polarized diffusive contribution to the effective Hamiltonian, with no counterpart in conventional antiferromagnetism and parametrized by the spin splitting, that is responsible for the so-called spin-splitter effect in $d$-wave altermagnets. We also elucidate the spin-transfer response of the itinerant fluid as well as the spin pumping into the altermagnet, which show previously unidentified combinations of the charge current and spatial partial derivatives (namely, {$j_{x}^{e}$,$\partial_{y}$} and {$j_{y}^{e}$,$\partial_{x}$}). The emergent spin-transfer physics in $d$-wave altermagnets opens up new possibilities for the dynamics of spin textures, such as the domain-wall motion driven by transverse charge currents. We also consider the effect of elastic distortions in the aforementioned transport properties.</description>

      <title>Spin-wave frequency multiplication by magnetic vortex cores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency multiplication involves generating harmonics from an input frequency, a technique particularly useful for integrating spin-wave devices operating at different frequencies. While topological magnetic textures offer distinct advantages in spin-wave applications, frequency multiplication has not yet been observed in these structures. Here, we study the magnetization dynamics of magnetic vortices formed in micron-sized disks and squares via wide-field magnetic imaging. We found the occurrence of coherent spin-wave harmonics arising from the gyration of vortex cores driven by microwave fields. This phenomenon reveals a universal mechanism where the periodical motion of delta function-like objects such as vortex cores gives rise to a frequency comb. Our results pave the way for creating nanoscale, tunable spin-based frequency multipliers and open new possibilities for frequency comb generation in a variety of systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) offers a promising avenue to surpass the efficiency limitations of current solar cell technology. However, disentangling intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to photocurrent remains a significant challenge. Here, we fabricate high-quality, lateral devices based on atomically thin ReS2 with minimal contact resistance, providing an optimal platform for distinguishing intrinsic bulk photovoltaic signals from other extrinsic photocurrent contributions originating from interfacial effects. Our devices exhibit large bulk photovoltaic performance with intrinsic responsivities of 1 mA/W in the visible range, without the need for external tuning knobs such as strain engineering. Our experimental findings are supported by theoretical calculations. Furthermore, our approach can be extrapolated to investigate the intrinsic BPVE in other non-centrosymmetric van der Waals materials, paving the way for a new generation of efficient light-harvesting devices.</description>

      <title>Separating terahertz spin and charge contributions from ultrathin antiferromagnetic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtosecond laser excitation of nanometer thin heterostructures comprising a heavy metal and a magnetically ordered material is known to result in the emission of terahertz radiation. However, the nature of the emitted radiation from heavy metal~/~antiferromagnet heterostructures has sparked debates and controversies in the literature. Here, we unambiguously separate spin and charge contributions from Pt~/~NiO heterostructures by introducing an unprecedented methodology combining high external magnetic fields with a symmetry analysis of the emitted terahertz polarization. We observe two distinct mechanisms of terahertz emission which we identify as optical difference frequency generation and ultrafast laser-induced quenching of the magnetization. We emphasize the absence of spin transport effects and signatures of coherent magnons. Overall, our work provides a general experimental methodology to separate spin and charge contributions to the laser-induced terahertz emission from heterostructures comprising a magnetically ordered material thus holding great potential for advancing terahertz spintronics and establishing terahertz orbitronics.</description>

      <title>Coulomb Drag in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnet is a newly discovered antiferromagnet, characterized by unique anisotropic spin-split energy bands. It has attracted tremendous interest, because of its promising potential in information storage and processing. However, measuring the distinctive spin-split energy bands arising from altermagnetism remains a challenge. Here, we propose to employ the Coulomb drag to probe altermagnetism. In the Coulomb drag, an electric current in an active layer of electron gases can induce currents in a close but well-isolated passive layer, due to interlayer Coulomb interactions. We find that the Coulomb drag effects in altermagnets are highly sensitive to the orientation of the spin-split Fermi surfaces. As a result, transverse currents can be dragged in the passive layer, leading to Hall drag effects even in absence of spin-orbit coupling, a feature quite different from all previous systems. More importantly, all the drag effects of altermagnets have unique angle dependence, which can be measured in a multi-terminal setup to serve as signatures for altermagnetism. This proposal will inspire increasing explorations on emergent magnetism.</description>

      <title>Linear response of tilted anisotropic two-dimensional Dirac cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of the linear-response coefficients, when in-plane electric field ($\mathbf E$) or/and temperature gradient ($\nabla_{\mathbf r} T$) is/are applied on a two-dimensional semimetal harbouring anisotropic Dirac cones. The anisotropy is caused by (1) differing Fermi velocities along the two mutually perpendicular momentum axes, and (2) tilting parameters. Using the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, we derive the forms of the response coefficients, in the absence and presence of a nonquantizing magnetic field $\mathbf B$. The magnetic field affects the response only when it is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the material, with the resulting expressions computed with the help of the so-called Lorentz-force operator, appearing in the linearized Boltzmann equation. The solution has to be found in a recursive manner, which produces terms in powers of $|\mathbf B|$.</description>

      <title>Fractional Skyrmion Tubes in Chiral-Interfaced Three-Dimensional Magnetic Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are chiral spin textures with rich physics and great potential for unconventional computing. Typically, skyrmions form in bulk crystals with reduced symmetry or ultrathin film multilayers involving heavy metals. Here, we demonstrate the formation of fractional Bloch skyrmion tubes at room temperature by 3D printing ferromagnetic double-helix nanowires with two regions of opposite chirality. Using X-ray microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we show that the coexistence of vortex and anti-parallel spin states induces the formation of fractional skyrmion tubes at zero magnetic fields, minimising the energy cost of breaking the coupling between geometric and magnetic chirality. We also demonstrate control over zero-field states, including pure vortex, or mixed skyrmion-vortex states, highlighting the magnetic reconfigurability of these 3D nanowires. This work shows how interfacing chiral geometries at the nanoscale can enable advanced forms of topological spintronics.</description>

      <title>N\'eel-vector Control of Magnetization Dynamics in $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$/NiFe Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin dynamics in $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$/Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) heterostructures, uncovering a robust mechanism for in-situ modulation of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) through precise control of temperature, applied magnetic field and crystal orientation. Employing cryogenic ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the interfacial coupling between the N\'eel vector of $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and the magnetization of the Py layer is highly tunable across the Morin transition temperature $(T_M)$. Our experiments reveal distinct resonance behavior for different crystal orientations, highlighting the pivotal role of exchange coupling strength in dictating FMR frequencies. Theoretical modeling corroborates the experimental findings, elucidating the dependence of coupling on the relative alignment of the N\'eel vector and ferromagnetic magnetization. Notably, we achieve significant modulation of FMR frequencies by manipulating the N\'eel vector configuration, facilitated by temperature variations, applied magnetic fields and crystal orientation adjustments. These advancements demonstrate the potential for dynamic control of spin interactions in AFM/FM heterostructures, paving the way for the development of advanced spintronic devices with tunable magnetic properties. Our work provides critical insights into the fundamental interactions governing hybrid spin systems and opens new avenues for the design of versatile, temperature-responsive magnetoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Monolayer Capping Provides Close to Optimal Resistance to Laser Dewetting of Au Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) relies on fast, localized heating of the magnetic medium during the write process. Au plasmonic near-field transducers are an attractive solution to this challenge, but increased thermal stability of Au films is required to improve long-term reliability. This work compares the effect of nanoscale Al, AlOx, and Ta capping films on Au thin films with Ti or Ta adhesion layers for use in HAMR and other high-temperature plasmonic applications. Thermal stability is investigated using a bespoke laser dewetting system, and SEM and AFM are extensively used to interrogate the resulting dewet areas. The most effective capping layers are found to be 0.5-1 nm of Al or AlOx, which can eliminate dewetting under certain conditions. Even one monolayer of AlOx is shown to be highly effective in reducing dewetting. In the case of thicker capping layers of Ta and AlOx, the Au film can easily dewet underneath, leaving an intact capping layer. It is concluded that thinner capping layers are most effective against dewetting as the Au cannot dewet without breaking them and pulling them apart during the dewetting process. A simple model based on energetics considerations is developed, which explains how thinner capping layers can more effectively protect the metal from pore or fissure creation. The model provides some convenient guidelines for choosing both the substrate and capping layer, for a given metal, to maximize the resistance to laser-induced damage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable sensitivity of non-Hermitian systems has been extensively studied and stimulated ideas about developing new types of sensors. In this paper, we examine a chain of parametrically driven coupled resonators governed by the squeezed Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We emphasize the qualitative difference in sensor performance between configurations depending on bulk topology and boundary modes, specifically for detecting both on-site and non-Hermitian skin effect perturbations. Our analysis goes beyond the scenario of infinitesimal perturbations, extending to arbitrary perturbation strengths beyond the linear response regime. We stress the importance of optimizing the system's parameters to achieve quantum enhancement while avoiding fine-tuned regimes that could limit the practical applicability of this system for real-world quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Harmonic-Induced Plasmonic Resonant Energy Transfer between Metal and Semiconductor Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures combining two or more metal and/or semiconductor nanoparticles exhibit enhanced upconversion arising from localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs). However, coupled plasmon-exciton systems are slowed by excitonic relaxation and metallic multi-plasmon systems are not broadly tunable. Here, we describe a heterostructure in which insulating alumina layers vary separation between CuS and Au nanoparticles, allowing experimental confirmation of the d^(-6) dependence typical of surface-dipole mediated interactions between Au and CuS plasmons, as demonstrated in Lumerical simulations. Transient-absorption spectroscopy shows faster plasmon relaxation in heterostructured Au/CuS (690 fs) than CuS nanoparticles (929 fs), signifying direct energy transfer. Moreover, coupling between the second-harmonic LSPRs of CuS and the fundamental LSPR in Au is evident in nonlinear absorption measurement. This defines a novel harmonic-induced plasmonic resonant energy transfer (HIPRET) dynamic linking the metallic Au plasmon and the broad semiconductor plasmon in CuS. This prototype for tunable, ultrafast plasmonic upconversion exemplifies a strategy for high-efficiency nonlinear nanodevices that have promising applications in photocatalysis, parametric down-conversion and biomedical imaging.</description>

      <title>The spin-switch scanning tunneling microscopy: an architecture to probe electron-phonon interactions in the atomic scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the spin-valve-like ferromagnet/spin glass/ferromagnet (FM/SG/FM) structure, the tunneling current is dominated by resistance switch (RS) instead of the local density of states according to the conventional tunneling theory. Here we show lattice-site dependent RS behaviors in one-quintuple-layer Bi2Te3 deposited on single MnBi2Te4 septuple layer, which comes from the difference in the efficiency of tunneling electrons to induce focused current or phonons at different sites, switching remotely the spin valve by spin-transfer torque or spin-phonon interactions. These lead to the observation of the dynamic 2-state lattice when the tip scans across the surface as well as the ability of scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to reveal atomic-scale features of electron-phonon (EP) interactions. Our work demonstrates the possibility of the spin-switch STM to image lattice-site dependent EP interactions of any materials deposited on the FM/SG/FM structure.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Maximum Chirality in Dielectric Nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximum structural chirality refers to the highest selectivity for circularly polarized light (CPL) in nanostructures, often manifested as maximum circular dichroism (CD), optical rotation (OR), and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, the underlying physical mechanisms that lead to maximum chirality remain unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that maximum chirality in dielectric nanostructures arises from the constructive and destructive interference of multipole moments with different CPL. By employing generalized multipole decomposition, we introduce a generalized chiral multipole mechanism that allows for direct numerical calculation of CD and establishes the conditions required to achieve maximum chirality. This approach provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing chirality and serves as a foundation for future investigations of chiral nanostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An anisotropic flat band fermion system with a novel dispersion that is linear along one direction and cubic along another is proposed in Phys. Rev. X. 13, 021012 (2023). We study the effects of Coulomb interaction in this fermion system by renormalization group theory and Dyson-Schwinger gap equation. We perform renormalizaton group analysis and find that fermion velocity is always restored along the direction that the fermions take cubic dispersion originally. Accordingly, the system takes the similar behaviors to the two-dimensional Dirac fermion system with Coulomb interaction in the low energy regime. Based on Dyson-Schwinger gap equation method, we find that an excitonic gap is generated if the Coulomb strength is large enough, and the system becomes a novel excitonic Chern insulator with quantized anomalous Hall conductivity. Observable quantities of this system in free case, under weak and strong enough Coulomb interaction are all analyzed.</description>

Abstract: Achieving strong coherent interaction between qubits separated by large distances holds the key to many important developments in quantum technology, including new designs of quantum computers, new platforms for quantum simulations and implementation of large scale quantum optical networks. However, the inherent mismatch between the spatial dimensions of a quantum emitter and the photon wavelength fundamentally limits the transmission of quantum entanglement over long distances. Here we demonstrate, that long-range qubit entanglement can be readily achieved when qubit interactions are mediated by optical polariton waves in a hyperbolic material, due to the phenomenon of the Hyperbolic Super-Resonance. We show that in this regime the resulting quantum gate fidelity that exceeds 99%, can be achieved with the use of qubits based on well known deep donors in silicon when their interactions are mediated by polariton fields in the substrate formed by a hyperbolic material (such as e.g. hexagonal boron nitride. At the physical level the proposed system is essentially a silicon-based optoelectronic chip, and it's readily accessible to the existing methods of semiconductor nanofabrication, leading to the integration densities of well over 10^8. qubits/cm^2, and therefore opening the way to scalable and fault-tolerant error correction in quantum computation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, due to the optical time scales that define the duration of the gate operation in the proposed system, and sub-nanosecond time of the decoherence in deep donors in silicon at the liquid nitrogen temperatures, the proposed Hyperbolic Quantum Processor does not require dilution refrigeration and therefore offers a pathway to bring quantum computation to the realm of conventional engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an optimal field-free protocol for current-induced switching of a perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnetic insulator nanoelement on the surface of a topological insulator. The time dependence of in-plane components of the surface current, which drives the magnetization reversal via the Dirac spin-orbit torque with minimal Joule heating, is derived analytically as a function of the switching time and material properties. Our analysis identifies that energy-efficient switching is achieved for vanishing damping-like torque. The optimal reversal time that balances switching speed and energy efficiency is determined. When we compare topological insulators to heavy-metal systems, we find similar switching costs for the optimal ratio between the spin-orbit torque coefficients. However, topological insulators offer the advantage of tunable material properties. Finally, we propose a robust and efficient simplified switching protocol using a down-chirped rotating current pulse, tailored to realistic ferromagnetic/topological insulator systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in exploring higher-order topology and their semi-metallic counterparts, particularly in the context of Dirac and Weyl semimetals, termed as higher-order Dirac semimetal (HODSM) and higher-order Weyl semimetal (HOWSM). The HODSM phase exhibits hinge Fermi arcs (FAs) with a quantized higher-order topological invariant. Conversely, the HOWSM phase is a hybrid-order topological phase manifesting both surface and hinge FAs as a signature of first- and second-order topology and also possesses both first- and second-order topological invariants. In this work, we investigate a tight binding model for multi-HODSM (mHODSM) hosting multiple hinge FAs having a quantized quadrupolar winding number (QWN) greater than one. Furthermore, we obtain a multi-HOWSM (mHOWSM) phase from the mHODSM by applying an external magnetic field. The mHOWSM phase possesses both the dipolar winding number being the representative invariant for first-order topology, and the QWN, featuring both surface and multiple hinge FAs. We study the spectral properties of the mHODSM and mHOWSM in different geometries. We also investigate the hinge FA-mediated transport in mHOWSM employing a two-terminal setup.</description>

      <title>Pole and zero edge state invariant for 1D non-Hermitian sublattice symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There have been several criteria for the existence of topological edge states in 1D non-Hermitian two-band sublattice-symmetric tight-binding Hamiltonians. The generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) approach uses the integration of the Berry connection over the GBZ contour in the complex wavevector space. An alternate `pole-zero' approach uses algebraic properties of the off-diagonal matrix elements of the sublattice-symmetric Hamiltonian in off-diagonal form. Both correctly predict the presence or absence of edge states, but there has not been an explicit proof of their equivalence. Here we provide such an explicit proof and moreover we extend the pole-zero approach so that it also applies for sublattice-symmetric models when the Hamiltonian is not in off-diagonal form. We give numerical examples for these invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-varying media break the temporal translation symmetry of wave propagation in materials, enabling advanced wave manipulations. However, this novel phenomenon has been rarely explored in magnonic systems due to the significant challenge of achieving a sudden and prominent change in magnon dispersion within materials. Here, we construct a time-varying strong coupling between two magnon modes, and observe a change in the beats of Rabi-like oscillations near the pulse edges. Using a frequency-comb spectroscopy technique developed in this work, we characterize the frequency conversion of magnon modes induced by the time-varying strong-coupling effect. Moreover, we construct time slits with adjacent time interfaces and demonstrate, for the first time, the double-slit time diffraction of magnon modes, analogous to the well-known Young's double-slit experiment. These findings rely solely on the time-varying strong magnon coupling, independent of device reconfiguration. Our results open avenues for applications such as all-magnetic mixers or on-chip GHz sources.</description>

Recently, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have attracted attention as sensors capable of quantitatively measuring the amplitude and phase of coherent spin waves. However, the conventional sensing protocol has been limited to detecting spin waves whose frequencies match the resonance frequency of the NV spins. We demonstrate that by utilizing the AC Zeeman effect, it is possible to image spin waves propagating in a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film over a wide frequency range up to a maximum detuning of 567 MHz without changing the external magnetic field. Our results expand the applicability of NV centers for spin-wave sensing and pave the way for quantitative investigations of the dynamics in various magnetic materials, such as metallic ferromagnets and van der Waals magnets.</description>

      <title>Essential implications of similarities in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that three different generalized similarities enclose all unitary and anti-unitary symmetries that induce exceptional points in lower-dimensional non-Hermitian systems. We prove that the generalized similarity conditions result in a larger class of systems than any class defined by a unitary or anti-unitary symmetry. Further we highlight that the similarities enforce spectral symmetry on the Hamiltonian resulting in a reduction of the codimension of exceptional points. As a consequence we show that the similarities drive the emergence of exceptional points in lower dimensions without the more restrictive need for a unitary and/or anti-unitary symmetry.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast pseudomagnetic fields from electron-nuclear quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrate precise control over coherently excited circular phonon modes using high-intensity terahertz lasers, opening new pathways towards dynamical, ultrafast design of magnetism in functional materials. While the phonon Zeeman effect enables a theoretical description of phonon-induced magnetism, it lacks efficient angular momentum transfer from the phonon to the electron sector. In this work, we put forward a coupling mechanism based on electron-nuclear quantum geometry, with the inverse Faraday effect as a limiting case. This effect is rooted in the phase accumulation of the electronic wavefunction under a circular evolution of nuclear coordinates. An excitation pulse then induces a transient level splitting between electronic orbitals that carry angular momentum. First-principle simulations on SrTiO$_3$ demonstrate that in parts of the Brillouin zone, this splitting between orbitals carrying angular momentum can easily reach 50 meV.</description>

      <title>Magnetic proximity effect in superconductor/ferromagnet van der Waals heterostructures: dependence on the number of superconducting monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic proximity effect in superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) heterostructures with a large number of atomic layers leads to a suppression of the superconducting order parameter and appearance of Zeeman-like spin splitting of the local density of states (LDOS). Here we study the magnetic proximity effects in van der Waals S/F heterostructures with a few atomic layers and demonstrate that the corresponding physics is very different from the classical results. We find that the dependence of the superconducting order parameter exhibits dips as a function of the ferromagnetic exchange field and gating. The number of dips is determined by the number of monolayers in the heterostructure and, in general, the superconductivity is not suppressed by large values of the exchange field. The spin splitting of the LDOS cannot be described by an effective Zeeman field and manifests a multiple peak structure, where each peak is connected to a unique spin splitting of one of the superconducting bands, which also can be tuned by gating.</description>

      <title>Fisher zeroes and dynamical quantum phase transitions for two- and three-dimensional models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions are non-analyticities in a dynamical free energy (or return rate) which occur at critical times. Although extensively studied in one dimension, the exact nature of the non-analyticity in two and three dimensions has not yet been fully investigated. In two dimensions, results so far are known only for relatively simple two-band models. Here we study the general two- and three-dimensional cases. We establish the relation between the non-analyticities in different dimensions, and the functional form of the densities of Fisher zeroes. We show, in particular, that entering a critical region where the density of Fisher zeroes is non-zero at the boundary always leads to a cusp in the derivative of the return rate while the return rate itself is smooth. We illustrate our results by obtaining analytical results for exemplary two- and three-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Rapid optimal work extraction from a quantum-dot information engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conversion of thermal energy into work is usually more efficient in the slow-driving regime, where the power output is vanishingly small. Efficient work extraction for fast driving protocols remains an outstanding challenge at the nanoscale, where fluctuations play a significant role. In this Letter, we use a quantum-dot Szilard engine to extract work from thermal fluctuations with maximum efficiency over two decades of driving speed. We design and implement a family of optimised protocols ranging from the slow- to the fast-driving regime, and measure the engine's efficiency as well as the mean and variance of its power output in each case. These optimised protocols exhibit significant improvements in power and efficiency compared to the naive approach. Our results also show that, when optimising for efficiency, boosting the power output of a Szilard engine inevitably comes at the cost of increased power fluctuations.</description>
