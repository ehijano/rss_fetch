      <title>Revisiting Graph Projections for Effective Complementary Product Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complementary product recommendation is a powerful strategy to improve customer experience and retail sales. However, recommending the right product is not a simple task because of the noisy and sparse nature of user-item interactions. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to predict a list of complementary products given a query item, based on the structure of a directed weighted graph projected from the user-item bipartite graph. We revisit bipartite graph projections for recommender systems and propose a novel approach for inferring complementarity relationships from historical user-item interactions. We compare our model with recent methods from the literature and show, despite the simplicity of our approach, an average improvement of +43% and +38% over sequential and graph-based recommenders, respectively, over different benchmarks.</description>

      <title>In Crowd Veritas: Leveraging Human Intelligence To Fight Misinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spread of online misinformation poses serious threats to democratic societies. Traditionally, expert fact-checkers verify the truthfulness of information through investigative processes. However, the volume and immediacy of online content present major scalability challenges. Crowdsourcing offers a promising alternative by leveraging non-expert judgments, but it introduces concerns about bias, accuracy, and interpretability. This thesis investigates how human intelligence can be harnessed to assess the truthfulness of online information, focusing on three areas: misinformation assessment, cognitive biases, and automated fact-checking systems. Through large-scale crowdsourcing experiments and statistical modeling, it identifies key factors influencing human judgments and introduces a model for the joint prediction and explanation of truthfulness. The findings show that non-expert judgments often align with expert assessments, particularly when factors such as timing and experience are considered. By deepening our understanding of human judgment and bias in truthfulness assessment, this thesis contributes to the development of more transparent, trustworthy, and interpretable systems for combating misinformation.</description>

      <title>ThinkQE: Query Expansion via an Evolving Thinking Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective query expansion for web search benefits from promoting both exploration and result diversity to capture multiple interpretations and facets of a query. While recent LLM-based methods have improved retrieval performance and demonstrate strong domain generalization without additional training, they often generate narrowly focused expansions that overlook these desiderata. We propose ThinkQE, a test-time query expansion framework addressing this limitation through two key components: a thinking-based expansion process that encourages deeper and comprehensive semantic exploration, and a corpus-interaction strategy that iteratively refines expansions using retrieval feedback from the corpus. Experiments on diverse web search benchmarks (DL19, DL20, and BRIGHT) show ThinkQE consistently outperforms prior approaches, including training-intensive dense retrievers and rerankers.</description>

      <title>MAGMaR Shared Task System Description: Video Retrieval with OmniEmbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective video retrieval remains challenging due to the complexity of integrating visual, auditory, and textual modalities. In this paper, we explore unified retrieval methods using OmniEmbed, a powerful multimodal embedding model from the Tevatron 2.0 toolkit, in the context of the MAGMaR shared task. Evaluated on the comprehensive MultiVENT 2.0 dataset, OmniEmbed generates unified embeddings for text, images, audio, and video, enabling robust multimodal retrieval. By finetuning OmniEmbed with the combined multimodal data--visual frames, audio tracks, and textual descriptions provided in MultiVENT 2.0, we achieve substantial improvements in complex, multilingual video retrieval tasks. Our submission achieved the highest score on the MAGMaR shared task leaderboard among public submissions as of May 20th, 2025, highlighting the practical effectiveness of our unified multimodal retrieval approach. Model checkpoint in this work is opensourced.</description>

      <title>Discrete Scale-invariant Metric Learning for Efficient Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metric learning has attracted extensive interest for its ability to provide personalized recommendations based on the importance of observed user-item interactions. Current metric learning methods aim to push negative items away from the corresponding users and positive items by an absolute geometrical distance margin. However, items may come from imbalanced categories with different intra-class variations. Thus, the absolute distance margin may not be ideal for estimating the difference between user preferences over imbalanced items. To this end, we propose a new method, named discrete scale-invariant metric learning (DSIML), by adding binary constraints to users and items, which maps users and items into binary codes of a shared Hamming subspace to speed up the online recommendation. Specifically, we firstly propose a scale-invariant margin based on angles at the negative item points in the shared Hamming subspace. Then, we derive a scale-invariant triple hinge loss based on the margin. To capture more preference difference information, we integrate a pairwise ranking loss into the scale-invariant loss in the proposed model. Due to the difficulty of directly optimizing the mixed integer optimization problem formulated with \textit{log-sum-exp} functions, we seek to optimize its variational quadratic upper bound and learn hash codes with an alternating optimization strategy. Experiments on benchmark datasets clearly show that our proposed method is superior to competitive metric learning and hashing-based baselines for recommender systems. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/AnonyFeb/dsml.</description>

      <title>A Topic Modeling Analysis of Stigma Dimensions, Social, and Related Behavioral Circumstances in Clinical Notes Among Patients with HIV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: To characterize stigma dimensions, social, and related behavioral circumstances in people living with HIV (PLWHs) seeking care, using natural language processing methods applied to a large collection of electronic health record (EHR) clinical notes from a large integrated health system in the southeast United States. Methods: We identified 9,140 cohort of PLWHs from the UF Health IDR and performed topic modeling analysis using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover stigma dimensions, social, and related behavioral circumstances. Domain experts created a seed list of HIV-related stigma keywords, then applied a snowball strategy to iteratively review notes for additional terms until saturation was reached. To identify more target topics, we tested three keyword-based filtering strategies. Domain experts manually reviewed the detected topics using the prevalent terms and key discussion topics. Word frequency analysis was used to highlight the prevalent terms associated with each topic. In addition, we conducted topic variation analysis among subgroups to examine differences across age and sex-specific demographics. Results and Conclusion: Topic modeling on sentences containing at least one keyword uncovered a wide range of topic themes associated with HIV-related stigma, social, and related behaviors circumstances, including "Mental Health Concern and Stigma", "Social Support and Engagement", "Limited Healthcare Access and Severe Illness", "Treatment Refusal and Isolation" and so on. Topic variation analysis across age subgroups revealed differences. Extracting and understanding the HIV-related stigma dimensions, social, and related behavioral circumstances from EHR clinical notes enables scalable, time-efficient assessment, overcoming the limitations of traditional questionnaires and improving patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>PGDA-KGQA: A Prompt-Guided Generative Framework with Multiple Data Augmentation Strategies for Knowledge Graph Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) is a crucial task in natural language processing that requires reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs) to answer natural language questions. Recent methods utilizing large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable semantic parsing capabilities but are limited by the scarcity of diverse annotated data and multi-hop reasoning samples. Traditional data augmentation approaches are focus mainly on single-hop questions and prone to semantic distortion, while LLM-based methods primarily address semantic distortion but usually neglect multi-hop reasoning, thus limiting data diversity. The scarcity of multi-hop samples further weakens models' generalization. To address these issues, we propose PGDA-KGQA, a prompt-guided generative framework with multiple data augmentation strategies for KGQA. At its core, PGDA-KGQA employs a unified prompt-design paradigm: by crafting meticulously engineered prompts that integrate the provided textual content, it leverages LLMs to generate large-scale (question, logical form) pairs for model training. Specifically, PGDA-KGQA enriches its training set by: (1) generating single-hop pseudo questions to improve the alignment of question semantics with KG relations; (2) applying semantic-preserving question rewriting to improve robustness against linguistic variations; (3) employing answer-guided reverse path exploration to create realistic multi-hop questions. By adopting an augment-generate-retrieve semantic parsing pipeline, PGDA-KGQA utilizes the augmented data to enhance the accuracy of logical form generation and thus improve answer retrieval performance. Experiments demonstrate that outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard KGQA datasets, achieving improvements on WebQSP by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 3.1% and on ComplexWebQuestions by 1.8%, 1.1%, and 2.4% in F1, Hits@1, and Accuracy, respectively.</description>

      <title>Learning Efficient and Generalizable Graph Retriever for Knowledge-Graph Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong inductive reasoning ability across various domains, but their reliability is hindered by the outdated knowledge and hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation mitigates these issues by grounding LLMs with external knowledge; however, most existing RAG pipelines rely on unstructured text, limiting interpretability and structured reasoning. Knowledge graphs, which represent facts as relational triples, offer a more structured and compact alternative. Recent studies have explored integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs for knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), with a significant proportion adopting the retrieve-then-reasoning paradigm. In this framework, graph-based retrievers have demonstrated strong empirical performance, yet they still face challenges in generalization ability. In this work, we propose RAPL, a novel framework for efficient and effective graph retrieval in KGQA. RAPL addresses these limitations through three aspects: (1) a two-stage labeling strategy that combines heuristic signals with parametric models to provide causally grounded supervision; (2) a model-agnostic graph transformation approach to capture both intra- and inter-triple interactions, thereby enhancing representational capacity; and (3) a path-based reasoning strategy that facilitates learning from the injected rational knowledge, and supports downstream reasoner through structured inputs. Empirically, RAPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by $2.66\%-20.34\%$, and significantly reduces the performance gap between smaller and more powerful LLM-based reasoners, as well as the gap under cross-dataset settings, highlighting its superior retrieval capability and generalizability.

      <title>Causality-Inspired Fair Representation Learning for Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, multimodal recommendations (MMR) have gained increasing attention for alleviating the data sparsity problem of traditional recommender systems by incorporating modality-based representations. Although MMR exhibits notable improvement in recommendation accuracy, we empirically validate that an increase in the quantity or variety of modalities leads to a higher degree of users' sensitive information leakage due to entangled causal relationships, risking fair representation learning. On the other hand, existing fair representation learning approaches are mostly based on the assumption that sensitive information is solely leaked from users' interaction data and do not explicitly model the causal relationships introduced by multimodal data, which limits their applicability in multimodal scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel fair multimodal recommendation approach (dubbed FMMRec) through causality-inspired fairness-oriented modal disentanglement and relation-aware fairness learning. Particularly, we disentangle biased and filtered modal embeddings inspired by causal inference techniques, enabling the mining of modality-based unfair and fair user-user relations, thereby enhancing the fairness and informativeness of user representations. By addressing the causal effects of sensitive attributes on user preferences, our approach aims to achieve counterfactual fairness in multimodal recommendations. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our FMMRec relative to the state-of-the-art baselines.

      <title>Lost in Sequence: Do Large Language Models Understand Sequential Recommendation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13909v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for recommendation thanks to their advanced textual understanding ability and context-awareness. Despite the current practice of training and evaluating LLM-based recommendation (LLM4Rec) models under a sequential recommendation scenario, we found that whether these models understand the sequential information inherent in users' item interaction sequences has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we first demonstrate through a series of experiments that existing LLM4Rec models do not fully capture sequential information both during training and inference. Then, we propose a simple yet effective LLM-based sequential recommender, called LLM-SRec, a method that enhances the integration of sequential information into LLMs by distilling the user representations extracted from a pre-trained CF-SRec model into LLMs. Our extensive experiments show that LLM-SRec enhances LLMs' ability to understand users' item interaction sequences, ultimately leading to improved recommendation performance. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM4Rec models that require fine-tuning of LLMs, LLM-SRec achieves state-of-the-art performance by training only a few lightweight MLPs, highlighting its practicality in real-world applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/Sein-Kim/LLM-SRec.</description>

      <title>Spatial-RAG: Spatial Retrieval Augmented Generation for Real-World Geospatial Reasoning Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18470v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Answering real-world geospatial questions--such as finding restaurants along a travel route or amenities near a landmark--requires reasoning over both geographic relationships and semantic user intent. However, existing large language models (LLMs) lack spatial computing capabilities and access to up-to-date, ubiquitous real-world geospatial data, while traditional geospatial systems fall short in interpreting natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce Spatial-RAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed for geospatial question answering. Spatial-RAG integrates structured spatial databases with LLMs via a hybrid spatial retriever that combines sparse spatial filtering and dense semantic matching. It formulates the answering process as a multi-objective optimization over spatial and semantic relevance, identifying Pareto-optimal candidates and dynamically selecting the best response based on user intent. Experiments across multiple tourism and map-based QA datasets show that Spatial-RAG significantly improves accuracy, precision, and ranking performance over strong baselines.</description>

      <title>CiteFix: Enhancing RAG Accuracy Through Post-Processing Citation Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful application of Large Language Models (LLMs), revolutionizing information search and consumption. RAG systems combine traditional search capabilities with LLMs to generate comprehensive answers to user queries, ideally with accurate citations. However, in our experience of developing a RAG product, LLMs often struggle with source attribution, aligning with other industry studies reporting citation accuracy rates of only about 74% for popular generative search engines. To address this, we present efficient post-processing algorithms to improve citation accuracy in LLM-generated responses, with minimal impact on latency and cost. Our approaches cross-check generated citations against retrieved articles using methods including keyword + semantic matching, fine tuned model with BERTScore, and a lightweight LLM-based technique. Our experimental results demonstrate a relative improvement of 15.46% in the overall accuracy metrics of our RAG system. This significant enhancement potentially enables a shift from our current larger language model to a relatively smaller model that is approximately 12x more cost-effective and 3x faster in inference time, while maintaining comparable performance. This research contributes to enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content in information retrieval and summarization tasks which is critical to gain customer trust especially in commercial products.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Hidden: Movie Genre and User Bias in Spoiler Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spoilers in movie reviews are important on platforms like IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, offering benefits and drawbacks. They can guide some viewers' choices but also affect those who prefer no plot details in advance, making effective spoiler detection essential. Existing spoiler detection methods mainly analyze review text, often overlooking the impact of movie genres and user bias, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we analyze movie review data, finding genre-specific variations in spoiler rates and identifying that certain users are more likely to post spoilers. Based on these findings, we introduce a new spoiler detection framework called GUSD (The code is available at https://github.com/AI-explorer-123/GUSD) (Genre-aware and User-specific Spoiler Detection), which incorporates genre-specific data and user behavior bias. User bias is calculated through dynamic graph modeling of review history. Additionally, the R2GFormer module combines RetGAT (Retentive Graph Attention Network) for graph information and GenreFormer for genre-specific aggregation. The GMoE (Genre-Aware Mixture of Experts) model further assigns reviews to specialized experts based on genre. Extensive testing on benchmark datasets shows that GUSD achieves state-of-the-art results. This approach advances spoiler detection by addressing genre and user-specific patterns, enhancing user experience on movie review platforms.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Multi-player Bandits for Explainable Recommendation Diversification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing recommender systems tend to prioritize items closely aligned with users' historical interactions, inevitably trapping users in the dilemma of ``filter bubble''. Recent efforts are dedicated to improving the diversity of recommendations. However, they mainly suffer from two major issues: 1) a lack of explainability, making it difficult for the system designers to understand how diverse recommendations are generated, and 2) limitations to specific metrics, with difficulty in enhancing non-differentiable diversity metrics. To this end, we propose a \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{M}ulti-player \textbf{B}andits (CMB) method to deliver explainable recommendation diversification across a wide range of diversity metrics. Leveraging a counterfactual framework, our method identifies the factors influencing diversity outcomes. Meanwhile, we adopt the multi-player bandits to optimize the counterfactual optimization objective, making it adaptable to both differentiable and non-differentiable diversity metrics. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the applicability, effectiveness, and explainability of the proposed CMB.</description>

      <title>MoE-MLoRA for Multi-Domain CTR Prediction: Efficient Adaptation with Expert Specialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalized recommendation systems must adapt to user interactions across different domains. Traditional approaches like MLoRA apply a single adaptation per domain but lack flexibility in handling diverse user behaviors. To address this, we propose MoE-MLoRA, a mixture-of-experts framework where each expert is first trained independently to specialize in its domain before a gating network is trained to weight their contributions dynamically. We evaluate MoE-MLoRA across eight CTR models on Movielens and Taobao, showing that it improves performance in large-scale, dynamic datasets (+1.45 Weighed-AUC in Taobao-20) but offers limited benefits in structured datasets with low domain diversity and sparsity. Further analysis of the number of experts per domain reveals that larger ensembles do not always improve performance, indicating the need for model-aware tuning. Our findings highlight the potential of expert-based architectures for multi-domain recommendation systems, demonstrating that task-aware specialization and adaptive gating can enhance predictive accuracy in complex environments. The implementation and code are available in our GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMs to Evaluate Usefulness of Document</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conventional Cranfield paradigm struggles to effectively capture user satisfaction due to its weak correlation between relevance and satisfaction, alongside the high costs of relevance annotation in building test collections. To tackle these issues, our research explores the potential of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate multilevel usefulness labels for evaluation. We introduce a new user-centric evaluation framework that integrates users' search context and behavioral data into LLMs. This framework uses a cascading judgment structure designed for multilevel usefulness assessments, drawing inspiration from ordinal regression techniques. Our study demonstrates that when well-guided with context and behavioral information, LLMs can accurately evaluate usefulness, allowing our approach to surpass third-party labeling methods. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies to investigate the influence of key components within the framework. We also apply the labels produced by our method to predict user satisfaction, with real-world experiments indicating that these labels substantially improve the performance of satisfaction prediction models.</description>

      <title>Milgram's experiment in the knowledge space: Individual navigation strategies</title>

Abstract: Data deluge characteristic for our times has led to information overload, posing a significant challenge to effectively finding our way through the digital landscape. Addressing this issue requires an in-depth understanding of how we navigate through the abundance of information. Previous research has discovered multiple patterns in how individuals navigate in the geographic, social, and information spaces, yet individual differences in strategies for navigation in the knowledge space has remained largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, we conducted an online experiment where participants played a navigation game on Wikipedia and completed questionnaires about their personal information. Utilizing the hierarchical structure of the English Wikipedia and a graph embedding trained on it, we identified two navigation strategies and found that there are significant individual differences in the choices of them. Older, white and female participants tend to adopt a proximity-driven strategy, while younger participants prefer a hub-driven strategy. Our study connects social navigation to knowledge navigation: individuals' differing tendencies to use geographical and occupational information about the target person to navigate in the social space can be understood as different choices between the hub-driven and proximity-driven strategies in the knowledge space.</description>

      <title>MMREC: LLM Based Multi-Modal Recommender System</title>

Abstract: The importance of recommender systems is growing rapidly due to the exponential increase in the volume of content generated daily. This surge in content presents unique challenges for designing effective recommender systems. Key among these challenges is the need to effectively leverage the vast amounts of natural language data and images that represent user preferences. This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing recommender systems by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and deep learning techniques. The proposed framework aims to improve the accuracy and relevance of recommendations by incorporating multi-modal information processing and by the use of unified latent space representation. The study explores the potential of LLMs to better understand and utilize natural language data in recommendation contexts, addressing the limitations of previous methods. The framework efficiently extracts and integrates text and image information through LLMs, unifying diverse modalities in a latent space to simplify the learning process for the ranking model. Experimental results demonstrate the enhanced discriminative power of the model when utilizing multi-modal information. This research contributes to the evolving field of recommender systems by showcasing the potential of LLMs and multi-modal data integration to create more personalized and contextually relevant recommendations.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Knowledge Organization Systems of Research Fields: Resources and Challenges</title>

Abstract: Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs), such as term lists, thesauri, taxonomies, and ontologies, play a fundamental role in categorising, managing, and retrieving information. In the academic domain, KOSs are often adopted for representing research areas and their relationships, primarily aiming to classify research articles, academic courses, patents, books, scientific venues, domain experts, grants, software, experiment materials, and several other relevant products and agents. These structured representations of research areas, widely embraced by many academic fields, have proven effective in empowering AI-based systems to i) enhance retrievability of relevant documents, ii) enable advanced analytic solutions to quantify the impact of academic research, and iii) analyse and forecast research dynamics. This paper aims to present a comprehensive survey of the current KOS for academic disciplines. We analysed and compared 45 KOSs according to five main dimensions: scope, structure, curation, usage, and links to other KOSs. Our results reveal a very heterogeneous scenario in terms of scope, scale, quality, and usage, highlighting the need for more integrated solutions for representing research knowledge across academic fields. We conclude by discussing the main challenges and the most promising future directions.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Scholarly Ontology Generation: An Extensive Analysis in the Engineering Field</title>

Abstract: Ontologies of research topics are crucial for structuring scientific knowledge, enabling scientists to navigate vast amounts of research, and forming the backbone of intelligent systems such as search engines and recommendation systems. However, manual creation of these ontologies is expensive, slow, and often results in outdated and overly general representations. As a solution, researchers have been investigating ways to automate or semi-automate the process of generating these ontologies. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the ability of large language models (LLMs) to identify semantic relationships between different research topics, which is a critical step in the development of such ontologies. To this end, we developed a gold standard based on the IEEE Thesaurus to evaluate the task of identifying four types of relationships between pairs of topics: broader, narrower, same-as, and other. Our study evaluates the performance of seventeen LLMs, which differ in scale, accessibility (open vs. proprietary), and model type (full vs. quantised), while also assessing four zero-shot reasoning strategies. Several models have achieved outstanding results, including Mixtral-8x7B, Dolphin-Mistral-7B, and Claude 3 Sonnet, with F1-scores of 0.847, 0.920, and 0.967, respectively. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that smaller, quantised models, when optimised through prompt engineering, can deliver performance comparable to much larger proprietary models, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources.</description>

      <title>One Pic is All it Takes: Poisoning Visual Document Retrieval Augmented Generation with a Single Image</title>

Abstract: Multi-modal retrieval augmented generation (M-RAG) is instrumental for inhibiting hallucinations in large multi-modal models (LMMs) through the use of a factual knowledge base (KB). However, M-RAG introduces new attack vectors for adversaries that aim to disrupt the system by injecting malicious entries into the KB. In this paper, we present the first poisoning attack against M-RAG targeting visual document retrieval applications where the KB contains images of document pages. We propose two attacks, each of which require injecting only a single adversarial image into the KB. Firstly, we propose a universal attack that, for any potential user query, influences the response to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) in the M-RAG system. Secondly, we present a targeted attack against one or a group of user queries, with the goal of spreading targeted misinformation. For both attacks, we use a multi-objective gradient-based adversarial approach to craft the injected image while optimizing for both retrieval and generation. We evaluate our attacks against several visual document retrieval datasets, a diverse set of state-of-the-art retrievers (embedding models) and generators (LMMs), demonstrating the attack effectiveness in both the universal and targeted settings. We additionally present results including commonly used defenses, various attack hyper-parameter settings, ablations, and attack transferability.</description>

      <title>Context Is Not Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04907v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dominant way of judging Large Language Models (LLMs) has been to ask how well they can recall explicit facts from very long inputs. While today's best models achieve near perfect recall, this masks a harder skill: performing multi-step reasoning and tracking intermediate state that never appears verbatim. We introduce Verbose ListOps (VLO), a benchmark that embeds deterministic ListOps computations inside narrative camouflage and, crucially, allows step-level evaluation of every intermediate result. Experiments show that models which solve raw ListOps with approximately 100% accuracy collapse on VLO after only 10,000 tokens. By exposing where a model's reasoning chain first diverges, VLO moves assessment beyond sheer context length and toward genuine comprehension. VLO's generation pipeline is task-agnostic: it can weave any deterministically verifiable reasoning schema -- arithmetic, symbolic, abductive, inductive or defeasible -- into narrative form. This makes VLO a reusable test-bed for the next wave of reasoning-centric model designs, not merely those with step-explicit scaffolds.</description>
