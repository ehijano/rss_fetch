      <title>A Curated Rotamer Library for Common Post-Translational Modifications of Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sidechain rotamer libraries of the common amino acids of a protein are useful for folded protein structure determination and for generating ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). However much of protein function is modulated beyond the translated sequence through thFiguree introduction of post-translational modifications (PTMs). In this work we have provided a curated set of side chain rotamers for the most common PTMs derived from the RCSB PDB database, including phosphorylated, methylated, and acetylated sidechains. Our rotamer libraries improve upon existing methods such as SIDEpro and Rosetta in predicting the experimental structures for PTMs in folded proteins. In addition, we showcase our PTM libraries in full use by generating ensembles with the Monte Carlo Side Chain Entropy (MCSCE) for folded proteins, and combining MCSCE with the Local Disordered Region Sampling algorithms within IDPConformerGenerator for proteins with intrinsically disordered regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of olfactory search is ubiquitous in nature and in technology, from animals in the quest of food or of a mating partner, to robots searching for the source of hazardous fumes in a chemical plant. Here, we focus on the algorithmic approach to this task: we systematically review the different olfactory search strategies. Special emphasis is given to the formal description as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes, which allows the computation of optimal actions and helps clarifying the relationships between several effective heuristic search strategies.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Driven Morphological Patterning: A Novel Approach to Morphogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental investigations into Hydra regeneration revealed a remarkable phenomenon: the morphological transformation of a tissue fragment from the incipient spherical configuration to a tube-like structure - the hallmark of a mature Hydra - has the dynamical characteristics of a first-order phase-transition, with calcium field fluctuations within the tissue playing an essential role. This morphological transition was shown to be generated by activation over an energy barrier within an effective potential that underlies morphogenesis. Inspired by this intriguing insight, we propose a novel mechanism where stochastic fluctuations drive the emergence of morphological patterns. Thus, the inherent fluctuations determine the nature of the dynamics and are not incidental noise in the background of the otherwise deterministic dynamics. Instead, they play an important role as a driving force that defines the attributes of the pattern formation dynamics and the nature of the transition itself. Here, we present a simple model that captures the essence of this novel mechanism for morphological pattern formation. Specifically, we consider a one-dimensional tissue arranged as a closed contour embedded in a two-dimensional space, where the local curvature of the contour is coupled to a non-negative scalar field. An effective temperature parameter regulates the strength of the fluctuations in the system. The tissue exhibits fluctuations near a circular shape at sufficiently low coupling strengths, but as the coupling strength exceeds some critical value, the circular state becomes unstable. The nature of the transition, namely whether it is a first or a second-order-like transition, depends on the temperature and the effective cutoff on the wavelength of the spatial variations in the system. It is also found that entropic barriers separate the various metastable states of the system.</description>

      <title>Ambush strategy enhances organisms' performance in rock-paper-scissors games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a five-species cyclic system wherein individuals of one species strategically adapt their movements to enhance their performance in the spatial rock-paper-scissors game. Environmental cues enable the awareness of the presence of organisms targeted for elimination in the cyclic game. If the local density of target organisms is sufficiently high, individuals move towards concentrated areas for direct attack; otherwise, they employ an ambush tactic, maximising the chances of success by targeting regions likely to be dominated by opponents. Running stochastic simulations, we discover that the ambush strategy enhances the likelihood of individual success compared to direct attacks alone, leading to uneven spatial patterns characterised by spiral waves. We compute the autocorrelation function and measure how the ambush tactic unbalances the organisms' spatial organisation by calculating the characteristic length scale of typical spatial domains of each species. We demonstrate that the threshold for local species density influences the ambush strategy's effectiveness, while the neighbourhood perception range significantly impacts decision-making accuracy. The outcomes show that long-range perception improves performance by over 60\%, although there is potential interference in decision-making under high attack triggers. Understanding how organisms' adaptation to their environment enhances their performance may be helpful not only for ecologists but also for data scientists aiming to improve artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>One nose but two nostrils: Learn to align with sparse connections between two olfactory cortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of neural representations in the two hemispheres is an important problem in neuroscience. Recent experiments revealed that odor responses in cortical neurons driven by separate stimulation of the two nostrils are highly correlated. This bilateral alignment points to structured inter-hemispheric connections, but detailed mechanism remains unclear. Here, we hypothesized that continuous exposure to environmental odors shapes these projections and modeled it as online learning with local Hebbian rule. We found that Hebbian learning with sparse connections achieves bilateral alignment, exhibiting a linear trade-off between speed and accuracy. We identified an inverse scaling relationship between the number of cortical neurons and the inter-hemispheric projection density required for desired alignment accuracy, i.e., more cortical neurons allow sparser inter-hemispheric projections. We next compared the alignment performance of local Hebbian rule and the global stochastic-gradient-descent (SGD) learning for artificial neural networks. We found that although SGD leads to the same alignment accuracy with modestly sparser connectivity, the same inverse scaling relation holds. We showed that their similar performance originates from the fact that the update vectors of the two learning rules align significantly throughout the learning process. This insight may inspire efficient sparse local learning algorithms for more complex problems.</description>

      <title>A theoretical basis for cell deaths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02169v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding deaths and life-death boundaries of cells is a fundamental challenge in biological sciences. In this study, we present a theoretical framework for investigating cell death. We conceptualize cell death as a controllability problem within dynamical systems, and compute the life-death boundary through the development of ``stoichiometric rays''. This method utilizes enzyme activity as control parameters, exploiting the inherent property of enzymes to enhance reaction rates without shifting equilibrium states. This approach facilitates the efficient evaluation of the global controllability of models. We demonstrate the utility of our framework using its application to a toy metabolic model, where we delineate the life-death boundary. The formulation of cell death through mathematical principles provides a foundation for the theoretical study of cellular mortality.</description>

      <title>Computational Microscopy beyond Perfect Lenses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in situ coherent diffractive imaging (CDI), which harnesses the coherent interference between a strong and a weak beam illuminating a static and dynamic structure, can be a very dose-efficient imaging method. At low doses, in situ CDI can achieve higher resolution than perfect lenses with the point spread function as a delta function. Both our numerical simulation and experimental results show that the combination of in situ CDI and ptychography can reduce the dose by two orders of magnitude over ptychography. We expect that computational microscopy based on in situ CDI can be implemented in different imaging modalities with photons and electrons for low-dose imaging of radiation-sensitive materials and biological samples.</description>

      <title>Catalytic Coagulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an autocatalytic aggregation model in which the rate at which two clusters merge to form a cluster is controlled by the presence of a third "catalytic" cluster whose mass must equal to the mass of one of the reaction partners. The catalyst is unaffected by the joining event and is available to either participate in or catalyze subsequent reactions. This model is meant to mimic the self-replicating reactions that occur in models for the origin of life. We solve the kinetics of this catalytic coagulation model for the case of mass-independent rates and show that the total cluster density decays as $t^{-1/3}$, while the density of clusters of any fixed mass decays as $t^{-2/3}$. These behaviors contrast with the corresponding $t^{-1}$ and $t^{-2}$ scalings for classic aggregation. We extend our model to mass-dependent reaction rates, to situations where only "magic" mass clusters can catalyze reactions, and to include steady monomer input.</description>

      <title>Power-Efficiency Constraint for Biological Rotary Motor Driven by Chemical Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological motors, as counterpart of heat engines, are driven by a chemical gradient to output mechanical work and play critical roles in biological functions, such as the ATP synthesis. Its thermodynamic efficiency, along with power, are two vital criteria for evaluating the performance of these motors. In this letter, we investigate a model of a microscopic chemical engine and assess the constraint relation between power and efficiency for the cycle with finite operation time. Our model demonstrates a general constraint relation between power and efficiency, and predicts that the efficiency at maximum power in the large friction regime is half of the maximum quasi-static efficiency, i.e., 1/2. These findings shall provide new direction to optimize the operation of microscopic biological motors.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Poisson effect in affine semiflexible polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stretching an elastic material along one axis typically induces contraction along the transverse axes, a phenomenon known as the Poisson effect. From these strains, one can compute the specific volume, which generally either increases or, in the incompressible limit, remains constant as the material is stretched. However, in networks of semiflexible or stiff polymers, which are typically highly compressible yet stiffen significantly when stretched, one instead sees a significant reduction in specific volume under finite strains. This volume reduction is accompanied by increasing alignment of filaments along the strain axis and a nonlinear elastic response, with stiffening of the apparent Young's modulus. For semiflexible networks, in which entropic bending elasticity governs the linear elastic regime, the nonlinear Poisson effect is caused by the nonlinear force-extension relationship of the constituent filaments, which produces a highly asymmetric response of the constituent polymers to stretching and compression. The details of this relationship depend on the geometric and elastic properties of the underlying filaments, which can vary greatly in experimental systems. Here, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the nonlinear Poisson effect in an affine network model and explore the influence of filament properties on essential features of the macroscopic response, including strain-driven alignment and volume reduction.</description>
