      <title>Alleviating Post-Linearization Challenges for Solving Nonlinear Systems on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linearity inherent in quantum mechanics limits current quantum hardware from directly solving nonlinear systems governed by nonlinear differential equations. One can opt for linearization frameworks such as Carleman linearization, which provides a high dimensional infinite linear system corresponding to a finite nonlinear system, as an indirect way of solving nonlinear systems using current quantum computers. We provide an efficient data access model to load this infinite linear representation of the nonlinear system, upto truncation order $N$, on a quantum computer by decomposing the Hamiltonian into the weighted sum of non-unitary operators, namely the Sigma basis. We have shown that the Sigma basis provides an exponential reduction in the number of decomposition terms compared to the traditional decomposition, which is usually done in a linear combination of Pauli operators. Once the Hamiltonian is decomposed, we then use the concept of unitary completion to construct the circuit for the implementation of each weighted tensor product component $\mathcal{H}_{j}$ of the decomposition.</description>

      <title>Beyond Wigner: Non-Invertible Symmetries Preserve Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the traditional notion of symmetry in quantum theory was expanded to so-called generalised or categorical symmetries, which, unlike ordinary group symmetries, may be non-invertible. This appears to be at odds with Wigner's theorem, which requires quantum symmetries to be implemented by (anti)unitary -- and hence invertible -- operators in order to preserve probabilities. We resolve this puzzle for (higher) fusion category symmetries $\mathcal{C}$ by proposing that, instead of acting by unitary operators on a fixed Hilbert space, symmetry defects in $\mathcal{C}$ act as isometries between distinct Hilbert spaces constructed from twisted sectors. As a result, we find that non-invertible symmetries naturally act as trace-preserving quantum channels. Crucially, our construction relies on the symmetry category $\mathcal{C}$ being unitary. We illustrate our proposal through several examples that include Tambara-Yamagami, Fibonacci, and Yang-Lee as well as higher categorical symmetries.</description>

      <title>Entanglement harvesting in conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study entanglement harvesting in general $d$-dimensional conformal field theories using pointlike Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled to scalar primary operators. This extends standard harvesting protocols beyond free fields to interacting conformal theories and arbitrary spatial dimensions. We find that increasing the operator scaling dimension suppresses both negativity and mutual information, reflecting the faster decay of correlations. For holographic CFTs, we show that bulk effective field theory enables a separation between field-harvested and communication-mediated entanglement. We also derive asymptotic, closed-form approximations that agree well with numerical results.</description>

      <title>Performance limits of a quantum receiver for detecting phase-modulated communication signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensors are an ideal candidate for detecting weak electromagnetic signals because of their exceptional sensitivity and compact form factor. In this work, we analyze the performance of a quantum-sensor-based receive chain for demodulating information encoded in phase-modulated electromagnetic waves. We introduce a generalized cumulant expansion to model a noisy quantum receiver and use it to compare the performance of various quantum demodulation protocols. Employing bit error probability (BEP) and channel capacity as quantitative performance metrics, we compare the capabilities of ensembles of quantum sensors - both unentangled and entangled - using Binary Phase-Shift Keying (BPSK) as a representative example of phase modulation. We identify conditions when the channel capacity of an ensemble of quantum sensors may surpass the limits of a classical electrically small antenna. Additionally, we discuss modifications to the quantum protocol that enables high-fidelity data recovery even in the presence of sensor noise and channel distortions. Finally, we explore practical performance limits of such a quantum receive chain, with a focus on NV-diamond as the quantum sensor platform.</description>

      <title>Putting fermions onto a digital quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers are expected to become a powerful tool for studying physical quantum systems. Consequently, a number of quantum algorithms for studying the physical properties of such systems have been developed. While qubit-based quantum computers are naturally suited to the study of spin-1/2 systems, systems containing other degrees of freedom must first be encoded into qubits. Transformations to and from fermionic degrees of freedom have long been an important tool in physics and, now the simulation of fermionic systems on quantum computers based on qubits provides yet another application. In this perspective, we review methods for encoding fermionic degrees of freedom into qubits and attempt to dispel the persistent notion that fermionic systems beyond one dimension are fundamentally more difficult to deal with.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Based Preparation of Higher-Dimensional AKLT States and Their Quantum Computational Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a constant-time, fusion measurement-based scheme to create AKLT states beyond one dimension. We show that it is possible to prepare such states on a given graph up to random spin-1 `decorations', each corresponding to a probabilistic insertion of a vertex along an edge. In investigating their utility in measurement-based quantum computation, we demonstrate that any such randomly decorated AKLT state possesses at least the same computational power as non-random ones, such as those on trivalent planar lattices. For AKLT states on Bethe lattices and their decorated versions we show that there exists a deterministic, constant-time scheme for their preparation. In addition to randomly decorated AKLT states, we also consider random-bond AKLT states, whose construction involves any of the canonical Bell states in the bond degrees of freedom instead of just the singlet in the original construction. Such states naturally emerge upon measuring all the decorative spin-1 sites in the randomly decorated AKLT states. We show that those random-bond AKLT states on trivalent lattices can be converted to encoded random graph states after acting with the same POVM on all sites. We also argue that these random-bond AKLT states possess similar quantum computational power as the original singlet-bond AKLT states via the percolation perspective.</description>

      <title>The continuous spectrum of bound states in expulsive potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the contrary to the common intuition that a steep expulsive potential makes quantum states widely delocalized, we demonstrate that one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) Schr\"{o}dinger equations, which include expulsive potentials that are \emph{steeper than the quadratic} (anti-harmonic-oscillator) ones, give rise to \emph{normalizable} (effectively localized) eigenstates. These states constitute full continuous spectra in the 1D and 2D cases alike. In 1D, these are spatially even and odd eigenstates. The 2D states may carry any value of the vorticity (alias magnetic quantum number). Asymptotic approximations for wave functions of the 1D and 2D eigenstates, valid far from the center, are derived analytically, demonstrating excellent agreement with numerically found counterparts. Special exact solutions for vortex states are obtained in the 2D case. These findings suggest an extension of the concept of bound states in the continuum, in quantum mechanics and paraxial photonics. Gross-Pitaevskii equations are considered as the nonlinear extension of the 1D and 2D settings. In 1D, the cubic nonlinearity slightly deforms the eigenstates, maintaining their stability. On the other hand, the quintic self-focusing term, which occurs in the photonic version of the 1D model, initiates the dynamical collapse of states whose norm exceeds a critical value.</description>

      <title>Encoding Matters: Benchmarking Binary and D-ary Representations for Quantum Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are typically formulated using Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), where constraints are enforced through penalty terms that introduce auxiliary variables and rapidly increase Hamiltonian complexity, limiting scalability on near term quantum devices. In this work, we systematically study Quadratic Unconstrained D-ary Optimization (QUDO) as an alternative formulation in which decision variables are encoded directly in higher dimensional Hilbert spaces. We demonstrate that QUDO naturally captures structural constraints across a range of problem classes, including the Traveling Salesman Problem, two variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem, graph coloring, job scheduling, and Max-K-Cut, without the need for extensive penalty constructions. Using a qudit-level implementation of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (qudit QAOA), we benchmark these formulations against their binary QUBO counterparts and exact classical solutions. Our study show consistently improved approximation ratios and substantially reduced computational overhead at comparable circuit depths, highlighting QUDO as a scalable and expressive representation for quantum combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>The ABL Rule and the Perils of Post-Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1964, Aharonov, Bergmann, and Lebowitz introduced their well-known ABL rule with the intention of providing a time-symmetric formalism for computing novel kinds of conditional probabilities in quantum theory. Later papers attached additional significance to the ABL rule, including assertions that it supported violations of the uncertainty principle. The present work challenges these claims, as well as subsequent attempts to salvage the original interpretation of the ABL rule. Taking a broader view, this paper identifies a subtle category error at the heart of the ABL rule that consists of confusing observables that belong to a single system with emergent observables that arise only for physical ensembles. Along the way, this paper points out other problems and fallacious reasoning in the research literature surrounding the ABL rule, including the misuse of post-selection, a reliance on pattern matching to classical formulas, and a posture of measurementism that takes experimental data as providing answers to interpretational questions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Principles of Localized-State Ensemble Luminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localized electron states induced by various disorders,including defects and impurities,usually exist in solids.Their optical properties,especially their luminescence properties,are of both scientific and technological significance.But a microscopic theory has not yet been established for such localized-state ensemble (LSE) luminescence.In this Letter,we attempt to fill this void via developing a quantum many-body (MB) luminescence theory taking into account both electron-phonon (e-p) and electron-electron (e-e) interactions.By using the developed MB-LSE theory,abnormal thermal behaviors such as redshift and subsequent blueshift of peak position,narrowing and succeeding broadening of linewidth,decline in intensity,and variation in lifetime can be quantitatively interpreted.The roles of electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions in the variable-temperature LSE luminescence are thus elucidated. Within the framework of the MB-LSE theory, moreover, Varshni's empirical formula for bandgap temperature dependence and Huang-Rhys factor for e-p coupling are further derived and discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovianity in a dressed qubit with local dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a dressed qubit implemented by a spinless fermion hopping between two lattice sites with each site strongly coupled to a bath of phonons. We employ Lang-Firsov transformation to make the problem tractable perturbatively. Applying time-convolutionless master equation within the polaron frame, we investigate decoherence dynamics of the dressed qubit within the singlet-triplet basis of the system for a wide range of bath spectral densities. It is shown that the coherence persists for longer time scales for large coupling values and shows non-monotonic behaviour reflecting the presence of non-Markovianity in the dynamics. Non-Markovianity, characterized by coherence revivals and non-monotonic decay patterns, emerges distinctly depending on the bath spectrum and coupling strengths. Systems coupled to sub-Ohmic baths, whether both or in combination with another type, display pronounced memory effects at relatively small values of couplings. In contrast, combinations involving Ohmic and super-Ohmic baths exhibit noticeable non-Markovianity only at higher couplings.</description>

      <title>Sensing weak anharmonicities with a passive-active anti-PT symmetric system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for enhanced sensing of weak anharmonicities based on a three-mode anti-parity-time (anti-PT) symmetric cavity-magnon-waveguide system. By tuning the optical gain to the active cavity mode, the linewidth suppression point for the anti-PT symmetric Hamiltonian can be flexibly controlled even when the two dissipative magnonic modes experience strong intrinsic decay. This essential characteristic is utilized for detecting weak nonlinearities in both the cavity and magnonic modes, with both demonstrating similar high levels of sensitivity. Moreover, the sensitivity can be greatly improved with a detuned laser drive. Based on the integrated passive-active three-mode anti-PT symmetric system, the sensing scheme can be generalized to various physical systems with anharmonicities.</description>

      <title>Recursive QAOA for Interference-Aware Resource Allocation in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete radio resource management problems in dense wireless networks are naturally cast as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) programs but are difficult to solve at scale. We investigate a quantum-classical approach based on the Recursive Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (RQAOA), which interleaves shallow QAOA layers with variable elimination guided by measured single- and two-qubit correlators. For interference-aware channel assignment, we give a compact QUBO/Ising formulation in which pairwise interference induces same-channel couplings and one-hot constraints are enforced via quadratic penalties (or, optionally, constraint-preserving mixers). Within RQAOA, fixing high-confidence variables or relations reduces the problem dimension, stabilizes training, and concentrates measurement effort on a shrinking instance that is solved exactly once below a cutoff. On simulated instances of modest size, including a four-user, four-channel example, the method consistently returns feasible assignments and, for the demonstrated case, attains the global optimum. These results indicate that recursion can mitigate parameter growth and feasibility issues that affect plain QAOA, and suggest a viable pathway for near-term quantum heuristics in wireless resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Systematic Characterization of Transmon Qubit Stability with Thermal Cycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temporal stability and reproducibility of qubit parameters are critical for the long-term operation and maintenance of superconducting quantum processors. In this work, we present a comprehensive longitudinal characterization of 27 frequency-tunable transmon qubits spanning over one year across four thermal cycles. Our results establish a distinct hierarchy of stability for superconducting hardware. We find that the intrinsic device parameters determining the qubit frequency and the baseline energy relaxation times ($T_1$) exhibit high robustness against thermal stress, characterized by frequency deviations typically confined within 0.5\% and non-degraded coherence baselines. In stark contrast, the environmental variables, specifically the background magnetic flux offsets and the microscopic landscape of two-level system (TLS) defects, undergo a significant stochastic reconfiguration after each cycle. By employing frequency-dependent relaxation spectroscopy and a quantitative metric, the $T_1$ Spectral Topography Fidelity, we demonstrate that thermal cycling acts as a ``hard reset'' for the local defect environment. This process introduces a level of spectral randomization equivalent to thousands of hours of continuous low-temperature evolution. These findings confirm that while the fabrication quality is preserved, the specific noise realization is statistically distinct for each thermal cycle, necessitating automated recalibration strategies for large-scale quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Squeezing-enhanced dual-channel interference for ground-state cooling of a levitated micromagnet with low quality factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooling the center-of-mass (CM) motion of a macroscopic oscillator to its quantum ground state is a fundamental prerequisite for testing quantum mechanics at macroscopic scales. However, achieving this goal is currently hindered by the stringent requirement for an ultrahigh mechanical quality factor ($Q_c$). Here, we propose a dual-channel cooling scheme based on squeezing-enhanced quantum interference within a hybrid levitated cavity-magnomechanical system to overcome this limitation.
  By synergizing squeezing effects with quantum interference between the magnon-CM and cavity-CM channels, our scheme simultaneously suppresses Stokes (heating) scattering while enhancing anti-Stokes (cooling) scattering.~We demonstrate that this cooling mechanism reduces the critical $Q_c$ required for ground-state cooling by three orders of magnitude, making it achievable in the experimentally accessible regime of $Q_c \sim 10^4$. Furthermore, the net cooling rate is enhanced by nearly 180-fold compared to that of conventional single-channel cooling. This improvement is accompanied by a two orders of magnitude reduction in both the steady-state CM occupancy and the cooling time. Importantly, this enhanced performance remains robust even deep within the unresolved-sideband regime. Our results provide a feasible path toward preparing macroscopic quantum states by actively controlling the cooling dynamics, thereby relaxing the constraints on intrinsic material properties.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Autofluorescence in Optical Fibers for NV-based Sensing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical fibers are crucial for guiding light in various sensing applications. Especially for quantum sensors such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, they enable light control and device miniaturization. However, fluorescence and scattering within the fiber, often referred to as fiber background, autofluorescence, or autoluminescence, can overlap spectrally with the NV centers' fluorescence, degrading the signal-to-noise ratio and thus limiting sensor sensitivity. Here, we investigate the optical spectra of standard optical fibers, considering material dependencies, physical influences, and their fluorescence scaling with excitation power and wavelength. Our results identify spectral components and fiber types with minimal unwanted background signals, guiding the selection of optimal fibers for NV-based quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>BiBiEQ: Bivariate Bicycle Codes on Erasure Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erasure qubits reduce overhead in fault-tolerant quantum error correction (QEC) by converting dominant faults into detectable errors known as erasures. They have demonstrated notable improvements in thresholds and scaling in surface and Floquet code memories. In this work, we use erasure qubits on Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes from the quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) regime. Owing to their sparse structure and favorable rate-distance trade-offs, BB codes are practical candidates for QEC. We introduce BiBiEQ, a novel framework that compiles a given BB code into an erasure-aware memory circuit C_E. This erasure circuit C_E comprises erasure checks (ECs), resets, and erasures spread over a user-specified erasure check schedule (2EC, 4EC). BiBiEQ converts this erasure circuit C_E into the stabilizer circuit C for general-purpose decoding. BiBiEQ provides two engines for this conversion, BiBiEQ-Exact and BiBiEQ-Approx. BiBiEQ-Exact preserves the joint-erasure correlations and serves as our accuracy benchmark, while BiBiEQ-Approx uses an independence approximation to accelerate large sweeps and expose accuracy-throughput trade-offs. Using BiBiEQ, we decode the stabilizer circuits to get a per-round logical error rate (LER) for the BB codes and quantify the effect of the EC schedules on the correctable operating region below the pseudo-threshold. The 4EC schedule keeps the accuracy of both engines close to one another, making BiBiEQ-Approx a reliable proxy for BiBiEQ-Exact for faster sweeps. Below the pseudo-threshold, the code distance (d) hop from distance (d) 6 to 10 yields a drop in LER by 10-17x larger than distance (d) 10 to 12, showing that most gains are realized by d=10.</description>

      <title>Hidden Kinematics and Dual Quantum References in Magnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin resonance phenomena are conventionally described using transition probabilities formulated in a rotating frame, whose physical meaning implicitly depends on the choice of quantum reference standard. In this Colloquium, we show that a spin in a rotating magnetic field constitutes a configuration involving two quantum descriptions that share a common quantization operator but differ in their kinematic and dynamical roles. The transition probability therefore emerges as a relational quantity between quantum reference standards rather than an intrinsic property of a single evolving spin state. By incorporating the kinematic motion of the spin vector together with the dynamical evolution, this framework restores consistent energy accounting and reveals the dual-reference structure underlying spin dynamics in rotating magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Two-phase driving of a linear radio-frequency ion trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear radio-frequency Paul trap is traditionally driven with one diagonal pair of electrodes grounded and the other connected to a high-voltage radio-frequency source. This method simplifies impedance matching of the voltage source to the trap. However, for several architectures it leads to increasing the axial micromotion amplitude, for example, when the capacitance between radio-frequency and end-cap electrodes is not negligible. Here, we present a technique to generate two high-voltage radio-frequency signals \SI{180}{\degree} out of phase to drive a linear Paul trap with opposite voltages between neighbouring electrodes. Using this, we have successfully trapped and cooled a chain of Ytterbium ions in a linear radio-frequency Paul trap.</description>

      <title>Quantum Steering and Entanglement in a Tritter: Hierarchy under Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite entangled states of continuous variables are fundamental resources for scalable quantum information processing. We study the correlation hierarchy in a tripartite state engineered by mixing a two-mode squeezed vacuum with a coherent state on a tritter, a key linear optical element for multimode state generation. Using the covariance matrix formalism, we comprehensively analyze the entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering among the output modes. The strength of both correlations is governed solely by the squeezing parameter and is independent of the coherent amplitude. We further examine the impact of inevitable optical losses in various channel configurations. The results show that while losses degrade correlations, EPR steering remains monogamous and exhibits stricter resilience thresholds than entanglement. Our analysis, supported by parameter extension techniques, confirms that the steering condition is more stringent than the inseparability criterion, clearly demonstrating that steering forms a strict subset of entanglement. These results elucidate the correlation structure in a readily generated multimode state and offer practical insights for developing asymmetric quantum protocols, such as one-sided device-independent tasks, where EPR steering serves as a critical resource.</description>

      <title>Geometric criticality in the driven Jaynes-Cummings model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the photonic mode in the Jaynes-Cummings model is driven by an external classical field, the system can undergo the photon-blockade breakdown phase transition at a critical point. Such a phase transition has been detailedly investigated, but the critical properties of the eigenstates remain largely unexplored so far. We here study the geometric criticality associated with these eigenstates. The amplitude and phase of the drive serve as the control parameter of the governing Hamiltonian. We find the quantum metric and Berry curvature tensors for each eigenstate display divergent behaviors in the critical region. More importantly, the divergence associated with bright eigenstates is much more pronounced than that for the unique dark state. Our theoretical results can be experimentally confirmed in circuit quantum electrodynamics systems, where the driven Jaynes-Cummings model has been realized.</description>

      <title>Semi-device-independent certification of high-dimensional quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certifying high-dimensional quantum channels is essential for ensuring the reliability of quantum communication protocols. Existing certification schemes often rely on fully trusted internal devices, which is difficult to achieve in realistic scenarios. Here, we propose a semi-device-independent framework for certifying channel properties directly from observed statistics, assuming only that the system dimension is known. By explicitly incorporating the full set of structural constraints inherent to Choi states, our approach exploits the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism for rigorous certification of quantum channels. The entanglement dimensionality of quantum channels is first certified by introducing a witness and numerically determining its Schmidt-number-dependent bounds. This certification method reproduces known analytical benchmarks and is applied to dephasing and depolarizing noise channels, thereby confirming its validity. To provide a more complete assessment of channel performance, the entanglement fidelity of quantum channels is also certified using a hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations based on localizing matrices. Lower bounds on the entanglement fidelity are obtained that are compatible with either the full set of observed statistics or a single witness value.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Enabled Radiation from Structured Paraxial Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a microscopic calculation of spontaneous photon emission by twisted (paraxial) electrons propagating through inhomogeneous, axisymmetric magnetic fields. We construct exact electron states that incorporate transverse mode structure and wavefront curvature by combining the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation with a geometric framework based on Lewis-Ermakov invariants and metaplectic transformations. We show that the evolution of such structured states corresponds to an open path in the space of quadratic forms, giving rise to a geometric contribution to the emission amplitude that cannot be eliminated by gauge choice or adiabatic arguments. The inverse radius of curvature of the electron wavefront emerges as an effective geometric field that enables radiation even in regions where the external magnetic field vanishes locally. This mechanism generalizes Landau-level radiation to nonasymptotic, structured electron states and establishes a direct connection between noncyclic geometric evolution and photon emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic understanding of integrability breaking in translationally invariant spin chains with genuine three-site interactions remains lacking. In this work, we introduce and classify minimal nonintegrable spin-$1/2$ Hamiltonians, defined as models that saturate injectivity while admitting no nontrivial local conserved charges beyond the Hamiltonian. We first rigorously establish the nonintegrability of the deformed Fredkin spin chain with periodic boundary conditions by mapping it to a nearest-neighbor composite-spin representation and excluding all admissible $3$-local conserved charges. Guided by its structure, we then construct five classes of spin-$1/2$ models with genuine three-site interactions. One class is integrable, while the remaining four contain exactly two interaction terms and constitute the minimal nonintegrable three-site models. Our results delineate a sharp boundary between integrability and nonintegrability beyond the nearest-neighbor paradigm.</description>

      <title>Quantum Evolution of Hopf Algebra Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, growing attention has been devoted to the possibility that theories with deformed symmetries, associated with certain models of non-commutative spacetime, may encode a fundamental form of decoherence. This effect should be described by a Lindblad-like evolution governed by the non-trivial Hopf algebra structure of the time-evolution generators. In this work we provide a detailed analysis of such possibility for similar Hopf algebra deformations of the Hamiltonian of a qubit. Starting from a critical examination of the very definition of time evolution through the generalized adjoint action, we explore whether a coherent and physically viable framework can be established. In particular, our analysis shows that a more general combination of adjoint actions always guarantees a von Neumann dynamics and, also in the case of deformed spacetime symmetries considered in the literature, a physically viable Lindblad evolution cannot be established.</description>

      <title>Doubling the size of quantum selected configuration interaction based on seniority-zero space and its application to QC-QSCI-AFQMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose doubly occupied configuration interaction-quantum selected configuration interaction (DOCI-QSCI), which samples from the seniority-zero space. While the use of this space effectively doubles the qubit budget, equaling the number of spatial orbitals, this sector restriction can compromise quantitative accuracy. To compensate for this, we expand sampled bitstrings via their Cartesian product into a larger space that includes seniority-breaking determinants. The resulting wave function is also proposed using the trial state in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) to recover dynamical correlations across the full orbital space (DOCI-QSCI-AFQMC). We evaluate the proposed methods on the H6 chain, N2 dissociation, and the addition of singlet O2 to a BODIPY dye. For the H6 chain, DOCI-QSCI-AFQMC reproduces the accuracy of the level of the complete-active-space counterpart with the quantum device ibm kobe. For N2 and BODIPY-O2, with (14e, 28o) and up to (20e, 20o) active spaces, it yields reasonable results, whereas single-reference CCSD(T) fails qualitatively. These results demonstrate that the DOCI-QSCI doubles the orbital space accessible to conventional QSCI and subsequent ph-AFQMC post-processing delivers reasonably high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Magnetic Field Sensing based on Microwave Frequency Modulated Photocurrent of Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While photoelectric detection of magnetic resonance (PDMR) can be applied to miniaturize nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center-based quantum sensors, the real demonstration of PDMR-based magnetic field sensing remains as a distinctive challenge. To tackle this challenge, in this article, we fabricate diamond samples with electrodes and microwave antenna on the surface, and realize PDMR by detecting photocurrent in nanoampere range via various lock-in amplifying modes. Importantly, we obtain a theoretical and experimental sensitivity 397 nT/Hz and 921 nT/Hz of magnetic field detection in DC-10 Hz range with a laser intensity and microwave frequency modulated mode, respectively, and demonstrate for the first time, a real-time tracking of alternating magnetic field with a standard deviation of 1.5 uT. Furthermore, we investigate systematically the dependence of the PDMR contrast, linewidth and the sensitivity on the laser and microwave power, and find a perfect agreement with a master equation based theoretical model, which accounts for not only the optically induced charge switch of neutral and negative NV centers, but also the interaction with microwave field.</description>

      <title>Full Schmidt characterization of spatiotemporally entangled states produced from spontaneous parametric down-conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full Schmidt decomposition of spatiotemporally entangled states generated from spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) has not been carried out until now due to the immense computational complexity arising from the large dimensionalities of the states. In this Letter, we utilize the rotational symmetry of the states to reduce the complexity by at least four orders of magnitude and carry out the decomposition to reveal the precise forms of the spatiotemporal Schmidt modes and the Schmidt spectrum spanning over 10^4 modes. We show that the Schmidt modes have a phase profile with a transverse spatial vortex structure that endows them with orbital angular momentum at all frequencies. In the high-gain regime, these Schmidt modes broaden and the Schmidt spectrum narrows with increasing pump strength. Our work can spur novel applications at the intersection of quantum imaging and spectroscopy that utilize entangled states produced from SPDC.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Corrections to Scrambling Dynamics in Brownian Spin SYK Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate operator growth in a Brownian spin Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model with random all-to-all interactions, focusing on the full operator-size distribution. For Hamiltonians containing interactions of order two up to $L$, we derive a closed master equation for the Pauli-string expansion coefficients and recast their dynamics into a generating-function formulation suitable for the large-$N$ limit. This approach allows us to diagonalize the leading-order evolution operator explicitly and obtain exact solutions for arbitrary initial operator distributions, including the effects of decoherence. Going beyond leading order, we develop a systematic $1/N$ expansion that captures higher-order corrections to the operator-size dynamics and the late-time behavior. Our results demonstrate that higher-order effects play a crucial role in operator scrambling and that the full operator-size distribution provides a more refined probe of quantum chaos in Brownian and open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One examines the infinitely deep quantum cavity, also known as the quantum infinite square well, within the framework of the real Hilbert space. The solutions are considered in terms of complex wave functions, and also in terms of quaternionic wave functions. The complex results reproduce the usual achievements established in the complex Hilbert space, but also extend them to non-stationary solutions, as well as to distorted stationary solutions, different energy spectra, and dislocated observed position. The quaternionic cases further admit the incidence of self-interaction, something that cannot be observed in complex solutions. Therefore, both the complex and quaternionic solutions are more general than previous cases, thus opening the way to further one-dimensional solutions to be researched in the non-relativistic theory.</description>

      <title>Improved entanglement-based high-dimensional optical quantum computation with linear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum gates are the essential block for quantum computer. High-dimensional quantum gates exhibit remarkable advantages over their two-dimensional counterparts for some quantum information processing tasks. Here we present a family of entanglement-based optical controlled-SWAP gates on $\mathbb{C}^{2}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}$. With the hybrid encoding, we encode the control qubits and target qudits in photonic polarization and spatial degrees of freedom, respectively. The circuit is constructed using only $(2+3d)$ ($d\geq 2$) linear optics, beating an earlier result of 14 linear optics with $d=2$. The circuit depth 5 is much lower than an earlier result of 11 with $d=2$. Besides, the fidelity of the presented circuit can reach 99.4\%, and it is higher than the previous counterpart with $d=2$. Our scheme are constructed in a deterministic way without any borrowed ancillary photons or measurement-induced nonlinearities. Moreover, our approach allows $d&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>An efficient method for spot-checking quantum properties with sequential trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical situations, the reliability of quantum resources can be compromised due to complex generation processes or adversarial manipulations during transmission. Consequently, the trials generated sequentially in an experiment may exhibit non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) behavior. This non-i.i.d. behavior can introduce security concerns and result in faulty estimates when performing information tasks such as quantum key distribution, self-testing, verifiable quantum computation, and resource allocation in quantum networks. To certify the performance of such tasks, one can make a random decision in each trial, either spot-checking some desired property or utilizing the quantum resource for the given task. However, a general method for certification with a sequence of non-i.i.d. spot-checking trials is still missing. Here, we develop such a method. This method not only works efficiently with a finite number of trials but also yields asymptotically tight certificates of performance. Our analysis shows that even as the total number of trials approaches infinity, only a constant number of trials needs to be spot-checked on average to certify the average performance of the remaining trials at a specified confidence level.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantum Speedups for Repeatedly Nested Expectation Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the estimation of repeatedly nested expectations (RNEs) with a constant horizon (number of nestings) using quantum computing. We propose a quantum algorithm that achieves $\varepsilon$-error with cost $\tilde O(\varepsilon^{-1})$, up to logarithmic factors. Standard lower bounds show this scaling is essentially optimal, yielding an almost quadratic speedup over the best classical algorithm. Our results extend prior quantum speedups for single nested expectations to repeated nesting, and therefore cover a broader range of applications, including optimal stopping. This extension requires a new derandomized variant of the classical randomized Multilevel Monte Carlo (rMLMC) algorithm. Careful de-randomization is key to overcoming a variable-time issue that typically increases quantized versions of classical randomized algorithms.</description>

      <title>Spinor Double-Quantum Excitation in the Solution NMR of Near-Equivalent Spin-1/2 Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of double-quantum excitation schemes is described for the solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of near-equivalent spin-1/2 pairs. These new methods exploit the spinor behaviour of 2-level systems, whose signature is the change of sign of a quantum state upon a $2\pi$ rotation. The spinor behaviour is used to manipulate the phases of single-quantum coherences, in order to prepare a double-quantum precursor state which is rapidly converted into double-quantum coherence by a straightforward $\pi/2$ rotation. One set of spinor-based methods exploits symmetry-based pulse sequences, while the other set exploits SLIC (spin-lock-induced crossing), in which the nutation frequency under a resonant radiofrequency field is matched to the spin-spin coupling. A variant of SLIC is introduced which is well-compensated for deviations in the radiofrequency field amplitude. The methods are demonstrated by performing double-quantum-filtered $^{19}$F NMR on a molecular system containing a pair of diastereotopic $^{19}$F nuclei. The new methods are compared with existing techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a set of electric-field based inequalities capable of detecting multilevel entanglement from a system of N quantum emitters. We determine that the polarization channel as well as the direction of detection can enhance entanglement detection, a feature specific to multilevel systems. We demonstrate the efficiency of the witnesses to detect genuine multipartite entanglement by applying it to families of paradigmatic quantum states, such as Dicke states, singlet states and W-like states. The detection is not only robust to noise, but also applies to mixed entangled states. Our findings open up possibilities for the detection of entanglement without local measurements in systems of multilevel emitters such as superconducting qubits, Rydberg atoms or quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Preparing squeezed, cat and GKP states with parity measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic modes constitute a central resource in a wide range of quantum technologies, providing long-lived degrees of freedom for the storage, processing, and transduction of quantum information. Such modes naturally arise in platforms including circuit quantum electrodynamics, quantum acoustodynamics, and trapped-ion systems. In these architectures, coherent control and high-fidelity readout of the bosonic degrees of freedom are achieved via coupling to an auxiliary qubit. When operated in the strong dispersive regime, this interaction enables parity measurements of the mode which, in combination with phase-space displacements, constitute a standard experimental tool for full Wigner-function tomography. Here, we propose a protocol based on displaced parity measurements that allows for the preparation of a variety of bosonic quantum states. As a first example, we demonstrate the generation of squeezed states, achieving up to ~9 dB of squeezing after only three parity measurements, and show that the protocol is robust against experimental imperfections. Finally, we generalize our approach to the preparation of other paradigmatic bosonic states, including cat and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states.</description>

      <title>The simplified quantum circuits for implementing quantum teleportation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is crucial to design quantum circuits as small as possible and as shallow as possible for quantum information processing tasks. We design quantum circuits with simplified gate-count, cost, and depth for implementing quantum teleportation among various entangled channels. Here the gate-count/cost/depth of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-based quantum teleportation is reduced from 10/6/8 to 9/4/6, the two-qubit-cluster-based quantum teleportation is reduced from 9/4/5 to 6/3/5, the three-qubit-cluster-based quantum teleportation is reduced from 12/6/7 to 8/4/5, the Brown-based quantum teleportation is reduced from 25/15/17 to 18/8/7, the Borras-based quantum teleportation is reduced from 36/25/20 to 15/8/11, and the entanglement-swapping-based quantum teleportation is reduced from 13/8/8 to 10/5/5. Note that, no feed-forward recover operation is required in the simplified schemes. Moreover, the experimentally demonstrations on IBM quantum computer indicate that our simplified and compressed schemes can be realized with good fidelity.</description>

      <title>Quantum-classical framework for many-fermion response and structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Response functions are key observables for probing the structure and dynamics of many-body systems. We introduce and demonstrate a quantum-classical framework for computing response functions of general many-fermion systems that also provides the full bound-state spectrum. The framework employs the Lorentz integral transform and a new Hamiltonian input scheme that enables practical and scalable circuit constructions for general many-fermion Hamiltonians. Within this framework, we develop a hybrid strategy to evaluate the Lorentz integral and propose three protocols to extract response functions and bound-state structural information. As a demonstration, we apply the method to \({}^{19}\mathrm{O}\) with realistic internucleon interactions, computing both the bound-state spectrum and the response function. We envision that our approach will open new avenues for exploring the structure and dynamics of a broad class of many-body systems across diverse fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum Detection of Sequency-Band Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for estimating the amplitude content of user-specified sequency bands in quantum-encoded signals. The method employs a sequency-ordered Quantum Walsh-Hadamard Transform (QWHT), a comparator-based oracle that coherently marks basis states within an arbitrary sequency range, and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) to estimate the total probability mass in the selected band. This enables the detection of structured signal components, including both high- and low-sequency features, as well as the identification of rapid sign-change behavior associated with noise or anomalies. The proposed method can be embedded as a module within a larger quantum algorithm; in this setting, both the input and output remain fully quantum, enabling seamless integration with upstream and downstream quantum operations. We show that the sequency-ordered QWHT can be implemented with circuit depth $O(\log_2 N)$ (equivalently $O(n)$ for $N=2^n$) when acting on an amplitude-encoded quantum state, whereas computing the full Walsh-Hadamard spectrum of an explicit length-$N$ classical signal requires $O(N\log_2 N)$ operations via the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform. This results in an exponential quantum advantage when the QWHT is used as a modular block within a larger quantum algorithm, relative to classical fast Walsh-Hadamard transform-based approaches operating on explicit data. From an application perspective, the proposed sequency band-energy estimation may be interpreted as a structure-based anomaly indicator, enabling the detection of unexpected high-sequency components relative to a nominal low-sequency signal class. The algorithm is applicable to quantum-enhanced signal processing tasks such as zero-crossing analysis, band-limited noise estimation, and feature extraction in the Walsh basis.</description>

      <title>Efficient circuit compression by multi-qudit entangling gates in linear optical quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear optical quantum computation (LOQC) offers a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing, but its scalability is fundamentally constrained by the probabilistic nature of non-local entangling gates. Qudit circuit compression schemes mitigate this issue by encoding multiple qubits onto qudits. However, these schemes become inefficient when only a subset of the encoded qubits is required to participate in the non-local entangling gate, leading to an exponential increase in the number of non-local gates. In this Letter, we address this bottleneck by demonstrating the existence of multi-level control-Z (CZ) gates for qudits encoded in multiple spatial modes in LOQC. Unlike conventional two-level CZ gates, which act only on a single pair of modes, multi-level CZ gates impart a conditional phase shift for an arbitrarily chosen subset of the spatial modes. We present two explicit linear optical schemes that realize such operations, illustrating a fundamental trade-off between prior information about the input quantum state and the physical resources required. The first scheme is realized with a constant success probability of $1/8$ independent of the qudit dimension using a single non-local entangling gate, at the cost of state dependence, which is significantly better than the current success probability of $1/9$. Our second scheme provides a fully state independent realization reducing the number of non-local gates to $\mathcal{O}(2^{r_1}+2^{r_2})$ as compared to the existing bound of $\mathcal{O}(2^{r_1+r_2})$ where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the number of qubits to be removed as control in the qudits. The success probability of the realization is $\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^{2^{r_1}+2^{r_2}}$. When combined with qudit circuit compression schemes, our results improve upon a key scalability limitation and significantly improve the efficiency of LOQC architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a finite geometric framework for studying the pentagon and heptagon codes we show that the concepts of quantum secret sharing and contextuality can be studied in a nice and unified manner. The basic idea is a careful study of the respective $2+3$ and $3+4$ tensorial factorizations of the elements of the stabilizer groups of these codes. It is demonstrated in detail how finite geometric structures entailing a specific three-qubit (resp. four-qubit) embedding of binary symplectic polar spaces of rank two (resp. three), corresponding to these factorizations, govern issues of contextuality and entanglement needed for a geometric understanding of quantum secret sharing. Using these results for the $(3,5)$ and $(4,7)$ threshold schemes explicit secret breaking protocols are derived. Our results hint at a novel geometric way of looking at contextual configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grover's search algorithm is one of the basic building block in the world of quantum algorithms. Successfully applying it to combinatorial optimization problems is a subtle challenge. As a quadratic speedup is not enough to naively search an exponentially large space, the search has to be complemented with a state preparation routine which increases the amplitudes of promising states by exploiting the problem structure. In this paper, we build upon previous work by Baertschi and Eidenbenz to construct heuristic state preparation routines for the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), mimicking the well-known classical Lin-Kernighan heuristic. With our heuristic, we aim to achieve a reasonable approximation ratio with only a polynomial number of Grover iterations. Further, we compare several algorithmic settings relating to termination criteria and the choice of Grover iterations when the number of marked solutions is unknown.</description>

      <title>Plethysm is in #BQP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some representation-theoretic multiplicities, such as the Kostka and the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, admit a combinatorial interpretation that places their computation in the complexity class #P. Whether this holds more generally is considered an important open problem in mathematics and computer science, with relevance for geometric complexity theory and quantum information. Recent work has investigated the quantum complexity of particular multiplicities, such as the Kronecker coefficients and certain special cases of the plethysm coefficients.
  Here, we show that a broad class of representation-theoretic multiplicities is in #BQP. In particular, our result implies that the plethysm coefficients are in #BQP, which was only known in special cases. It also implies all known results on the quantum complexity of previously studied coefficients as special cases, unifying, simplifying, and extending prior work. We obtain our result by multiple applications of the Schur transform. Recent work has improved its dependence on the local dimension, which is crucial for our work. We further describe a general approach for showing that representation-theoretic multiplicities are in #BQP that captures our approach as well as the approaches of prior work. We complement the above by showing that the same multiplicities are also naturally in GapP and obtain polynomial-time classical algorithms when certain parameters are fixed.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovianity induced by Pauli-twirling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise forms a central obstacle to effective quantum information processing. Recent experimental advances have enabled the tailoring of noise properties through Pauli twirling, transforming arbitrary noise channels into Pauli channels. This underpins theoretical descriptions of fault-tolerant quantum computation and forms an essential tool in noise characterization and error mitigation. Pauli-Lindblad channels have been introduced to aptly parameterize quasi-local Pauli errors across a quantum register, excluding negative Pauli-Lindblad parameters relying on the Markovianity of the underlying noise processes. We point out that caution is required when parameterizing channels as Pauli-Lindblad channels with nonnegative parameters. For this, we study the effects of Pauli twirling on Markovianity. We use the notion of Markovianity of a channel (rather than that of an entire semigroup) and prove a general Pauli channel is non-Markovian if and only if at least one of its Pauli-Lindblad parameters is negative. Using this, we show that Markovian quantum channels often become non-Markovian after Pauli twirling. The Pauli-twirling induced non-Markovianity necessitates the use of negative Pauli-Lindblad parameters for a correct noise description in experimentally realistic scenarios. An important example is the implementation of the $\sqrt{X}$-gate under standard Markovian noise. As such, our results have direct implications for quantum error mitigation protocols that rely on accurate noise characterization.</description>

      <title>Classifying the simplest Bell inequalities beyond qubits and their applications towards self-testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell inequalities reveal the fundamentally nonlocal character of quantum mechanics. In this regard, one of the interesting problems is to explore all possible Bell inequalities that demonstrate a gap between local and nonlocal quantum behaviour. This is useful for the geometric characterisation of the set of nonlocal correlations achievable within quantum theory. Moreover, it provides a systematic way to construct Bell inequalities that are tailored to specific quantum information processing tasks. This characterisation is well understood in the simplest $(2,2,2)$ scenario, namely two parties performing two binary outcome measurements. However, beyond this setting, relatively few Bell inequalities are known, and the situation becomes particularly scarce in scenarios involving a greater number of outcomes. Here, we consider the $(2,2,3)$ scenario, or two parties performing two three-outcome measurements, and characterise all Bell inequalities that can arise from the simplest sum-of-squares decomposition and are maximally violated by the maximally entangled state of local dimension three. We then utilise them to self-test this state, along with a class of three-outcome measurements.</description>

Abstract: Quantum networks, integrating quantum communication, quantum metrology, and distributed quantum computing, could provide secure and efficient information transfer, high-resolution sensing, and an exponential speed-up in information processing. Deterministic entanglement distribution over long distances is a prerequisite for scalable quantum networks, enabling the utilization of device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) and quantum teleportation to achieve secure and efficient information transfer. However, the exponential photon loss in optical fibres prohibits efficient and deterministic entanglement distribution. Quantum repeaters, incorporating entanglement swapping and entanglement purification with quantum memories, offer the most promising means to overcome this limitation in fibre-based quantum networks. Despite numerous pioneering efforts toward realizing quantum repeaters, a critical bottleneck remains, as remote memory-memory entanglement suffers from decoherence more rapidly than it can be established and purified over long distances. We overcome this by developing long-lived trapped-ion memories, an efficient telecom interface, and a high-visibility single-photon entanglement protocol. This allows us to establish and maintain memory-memory entanglement over a 10 km fibre within the average entanglement establishment time for the same distance. As a direct application, we demonstrate metropolitan-scale DI-QKD, distilling 1,917 secret keys out of 4.05*10^5 Bell pairs over 10 km. We further report a positive key rate over 101 km in the asymptotic limit, extending the achievable distance by more than two orders of magnitude. Our work provides a critical building block for quantum repeaters and marks an important step toward scalable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Empirical Study of Observable Sets in Multiclass Quantum Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms have gained attention as early applications of quantum computers for learning tasks. In the context of supervised learning, most of the works that tackle classification problems with parameterized quantum circuits constrain their scope to the setting of binary classification or perform multiclass classification via ensembles of binary classifiers (strategies such as one versus rest). Those few works that propose native multiclass models, however, do not justify the choice of observables that perform the classification. This work studies two main classification criteria in multiclass quantum machine learning: maximizing the expected value of an observable representing a class or maximizing the fidelity of the encoded quantum state with a reference state representing a class. To compare both approaches, sets of Pauli strings and sets of projectors into the computational basis are chosen as observables in the quantum machine learning models. Observing the empirical behavior of each model type, the effect of different observable set choices on the performance of quantum machine learning models is analyzed in the context of Barren Plateaus and Neural Collapse. The results provide insights that may guide the design of future multiclass quantum machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Control of Collisional Architectures for Deterministic Multipartite State Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing scalable, noise-tolerant control protocols for multipartite entanglement is a central challenge for quantum technologies, and it naturally calls for \emph{algorithmic} synthesis of interaction parameters rather than handcrafted gate sequences. Here we introduce an intelligent, constraint-aware control framework for deterministic generation of symmetric Dicke states $|D_n^{(m)}\rangle$ in repeated-interaction (collision-model) architectures. The protocol employs excitation-preserving partial-SWAP collisions between two disjoint qubit registers, mediated by $m$ ancillary ``shuttle'' qubits, and poses Dicke-state preparation as a \emph{closed-loop design} problem: given the target $(n,m)$, automatically infer collision strengths that maximize fidelity under practical constraints. Concretely, we formulate a two-parameter, bound-constrained optimization over intra-register and shuttle--register collision angles and solve it using a multi-start strategy with L-BFGS-B, yielding a reproducible controller prescription (optimized $\gamma_{\mathrm{in}}$, $\gamma_{\mathrm{sh}}$, and minimal-round convergence points) for each target. This removes the need for projective measurements and extends collisional entanglement generation beyond the single-excitation (W-state) sector to arbitrary $m$. Crucially, we optimize \emph{within} imperfect collisional dynamics where errors act throughout the sequence, including stochastic interaction dropouts (missing collisions) and standard decoherence channels. Strikingly, across wide error ranges the optimized controller preserves high preparation fidelity; imperfections manifest primarily as a modest increase in the required number of collision rounds. This behavior reflects a tunable competition in which noise suppresses correlations while properly chosen collisions continuously replenish them, allowing the control algorithm to trade time for fidelity.</description>

      <title>Time resolution at the quantum limit of two incoherent sources based on frequency resolved two-photon-interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rayleigh criterion is a widely known limit in the resolution of incoherent sources with classical measurements in the spatial domain. Unsurprisingly the estimation of the time delay between two weak incoherent signals is afflicted by an analogue problem. In this work, we show the emergence of two-photon quantum beats in the frequency domain from the interference at a beam splitter of a photon emitted by a reference source and one from the two incoherent weak signals. We demonstrate, based on this phenomena, that with a relatively low number of measurements of the frequencies of the interfering photons either bunching or antibunching at the beam splitter output one can achieve a precision amounting to half of the quantum limit, independently of both the temporal shape of the photonic wavepacket and the time delay to be estimated. The feasibility of the technique makes it applicable in astronomy, microscopy, remote clocks synchronization and radar ranging</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum battery, as a novel energy storage device, offers the potential for unprecedented efficiency and performance beyond the capabilities of classical systems, with broad implications for future quantum technologies. Here, we experimentally \RefC{demonstrate quantum charging advantage (QCA)} in a scalable solid-state quantum battery. More specifically, we show how double-excitation Hamiltonians for two-level systems promote scalable QCA \RefB{with standard methods.} We effectively implement the collective evolution of quantum systems with 2 up to 12 battery cells in a superconducting quantum processor, and study the performance of quantum charging compared to its uncorrelated classical counterpart. The model considered is a linear chain of superconducting transmon qubits with only \textit{nearest-neighbor} and \textit{pairwise} interactions, which constitute the simplest model of a multi-cell quantum battery. Our results empirically realize substantial QCA without the necessity of adopting long-range and many-body interactions \RefB{ and showcase the quantum features of the QB charging processes with measurements of non-zero coherent ergotropy, incoherent ergotropy and entanglement,} revealing a promising prospect for further developments of efficient and experimentally feasible protocols for QCA.</description>

      <title>Representation theory of inhomogeneous Gaussian unitaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian unitaries, generated by quadratic Hamiltonians, are fundamental in quantum optics and continuous-variable computing. Their structures correspond to symplectic (bosons) and orthogonal (fermions) groups, but physical realizations give rise to their respective double covers, introducing phase and sign ambiguities. The homogeneous (quadratic-only) case has been resolved through a parameterization constructed in a recent work [arXiv:2409.11628]. We extend the previous framework to inhomogeneous Gaussian unitaries parameterized by $(M,z,\Psi)$. The Baker-Campbel-Hausdorff formula allows us then to factor any Gaussian unitary into a squeezing and a displacement transformation, from which we derive the group multiplication law.</description>

      <title>Weak forms offer strong regularisations: how to make physics-informed (quantum) machine learning more robust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed (PI) methodologies have surged to become a pillar route to solve Differential Equations (DEs), sustained by the growth of machine learning methods in scientific contexts. The main proposition of PI is to minimise variationally a loss function, formally ensuring that a neural surrogate of the solution has the DE locally satisfied. The nature of such formulation encouraged the exploration of equivalent quantum algorithms, where the surrogate solution is expressed by variational quantum architectures. The locality of typical loss functions emphasises the DE to hold at an ensemble of points sampled in the domain, but encounters issues when generalising beyond such points, or when propagating boundary conditions. Issues which affect classical and quantum PI algorithms alike. The quest to fill this gap in robustness and accuracy against mainstream DE solvers has led to a plethora of proposals in various directions. In particular, classical DE solvers have long employed the weak form - an integral based approach aiming at imposing a global condition on the solution - prioritising a good average behaviour instead of ``overfitting'' select points. Here, we propose and explore to combine contributions from both local and global loss functions in PI routines, to exploit the advantages and mitigate the weaknesses of both. We showcase this intuition in a variety of problems focusing on differentiable quantum architectures, and demonstrating in particular how orchestrating such hybrid loss formulation with domain decomposition can offer a strong advantage over local-only strategies.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Renormalization Group from a Few-Body Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity plays a fundamental role in open quantum systems and describes a wide variety of effects of interactions with environments, including quantum measurement. However, understanding its consequences in strongly interacting systems is still elusive due to the interplay between non-perturbative strong correlations and non-Hermiticity. While the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) method has been applied to tackle this problem, its foundation, based on the existence of the partition function, is ill-defined. In this paper, we establish a microscopic foundation of the non-Hermitian RG method from a few-body perspective. We show that the invariance of the scattering amplitude under RG transformations enables us to rigorously derive the non-Hermitian RG equation, giving a physically transparent interpretation of RG flows. We discuss a detailed structure of such RG flows in a non-relativistic two-body system with inelastic two-body loss, and show its relation to a non-Hermitian quantum scale anomaly. Our analysis suggests that non-Hermitian complex potentials often used in high-energy physics can be interpreted as being caused by quantum measurement, where the detection of elastically scattered particles updates the observer's knowledge, resulting in a nonunitary state change of the system. We apply our formalism to nuclear physics, find the emergence of a critical semicircle, and show that several nuclei are located near the critical semicircle in the coherent neutron-nucleus scattering. We also propose that the localized dineutron in two-neutron halo nuclei can be interpreted as the quantum measurement effect on the imaginary potential associated with absorption into the core nucleus. Our result bridges different contexts of non-Hermitian systems in high-energy and atomic, molecular, and optical physics, opening an interdisciplinary playground of non-Hermitian few-body physics.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Optically-Detected Spin-Acoustic Resonance in Solid-State Molecular Thin-film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an implementation of spin-acoustic resonance in pentacene thin films integrated on a high-quality-factor (high-Q) surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator on a lithium niobate substrate. Heterogeneous optically detected spin-acoustic resonance (HODSAR) is an optically detected spin-resonance measurement in which the resonant drive is delivered mechanically by a surface acoustic wave (SAW). By leveraging the photo-excited triplet state of pentacene at room temperature, we demonstrate coherent spin manipulation via acoustic driving under zero externally applied magnetic field. The heterogeneously integrated device, referred to as HODSAR, utilizes spin-phonon coupling to achieve mechanically driven, zero-field spin resonance, opening avenues for room-temperature mechanically addressable spin control and device integration. We show that the high-Q multimode response of the SAW resonator enables spectrally selective acoustic addressing of triplet transitions near 105 MHz. Coherent control is evidenced by Rabi oscillations, with a Rabi frequency that increases linearly with the square root of the applied RF input power over the measured drive range, consistent with driven two-level dynamics under acoustic excitation. These results establish spin-acoustic resonance in a heterogeneously integrated molecular thin-film platform and provide a quantitative basis for benchmarking mechanically mediated spin control.</description>

      <title>The equivalence of quantum deletion and insertion errors on permutation-invariant codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum synchronisation errors are a class of quantum errors that change the number of qubits in a quantum system. The classical error correction of synchronisation errors has been well-studied, including an insertion-deletion equivalence more than a half-century ago, but little progress has been made towards the quantum counterpart since the birth of quantum error correction. We address the longstanding problem of a quantum insertion-deletion equivalence on permutation-invariant codes, detailing the conditions under which such codes are $t$-insertion error-correctable. We extend these conditions to quantum insdel errors, formulating a more restrictive set of conditions under which permutation-invariant codes are $(t,s)$-insdel error-correctable. Our work resolves many of the outstanding questions regarding the quantum error correction of synchronisation errors.</description>

      <title>High-Probability Heralded Entanglement via Repeated Spin-Photon Phase Encoding with Moderate Cooperativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a heralded high-probability scheme to generate remote entanglement between moderate-cooperativity spin-cavity registers with high fidelity. In conventional single-shot interfaces, limited cooperativity restricts the spin-conditional optical response and thus strongly suppresses the success probability. Our proposal instead recycles a single incident photon for repeated interactions with the spin-cavity register, such that a small spin-conditional phase shift acquired on each round trip accumulates coherently to enable remote entanglement. Moreover, the repeated scheme enables higher spin-photon encoding efficiency by using a spectral-width-scaling photon pulse with a shorter duration. We show that, for realistic imperfections and losses, this repeated phase-encoding approach produces high-fidelity entangled states with an appreciable success probability even at cooperativity $C\sim1$. Our protocol is particularly well suited to weakly coupled, cavity-based solid-state spin platforms and provides a route toward hybrid, photon-loss-tolerant distributed quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Spin-active chlorine-related centers in 4H-SiC with telecom-band emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A photoluminescence (PL) and magnetic resonance investigation of a defect in chlorine-implanted 4H-SiC is presented. This Cl-related center emits light at telecom wavelengths with zero-phonon lines in the range 1350-1540 nm. Its four configurations exhibit stable PL spectra characterized by narrow zero-phonon lines. For the two configurations that emit light at the C-band, a Debye-Waller factor in the range 22-25% is estimated. Optically detected magnetic resonance confirms that the Cl-related center is spin active and stable at room temperature with the zero-field splitting in the range of 1.0-1.4 GHz. The combined optical and spin properties suggest this center to be a highly promising candidate for scalable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>High-brightness fiber-based Sagnac source of entangled photon pairs for multiplexed quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fully fibered source of entangled photon pairs based on a nonlinear Sagnac interferometer is reported. Operating at telecom wavelengths, the source relies exclusively on standard fiber-optic components and periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguides, resulting in a compact, robust, and field-deployable architecture. The generation stage supports both polarization and energy-time entanglement without modification, enabling versatile operation depending on the targeted application. Broadband spontaneous parametric down-conversion allows dense wavelength-division multiplexing over the telecom C and L bands. High normalized brightness (10.3 kpairs/s/nm/mW$^2$) is achieved on a standard 100 GHz ITU channel pair, together with high entanglement quality. Polarization and energy-time encodings are characterized through state tomography and two-photon interference measurements, yielding fidelities, purities, and visibilities exceeding 96 % over multiple wavelength channels. The stability and reproducibility of the source are further evaluated through long-duration operation in a network environment. These results demonstrate that the proposed Sagnac source constitutes a practical and scalable building block for future plug-and-play quantum communication and quantum networking platforms.</description>

      <title>A cavity-mediated reconfigurable coupling scheme for superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits have achieved remarkable progress in gate fidelity and coherence, yet their typical nearest-neighbor connectivity presents constraints for implementing complex quantum circuits. Here, we introduce a cavity-mediated coupling architecture in which a shared cavity mode, accessed through tunable qubit-cavity couplers, enables dynamically reconfigurable interactions between non-adjacent qubits. By selectively activating the couplers, we demonstrate that high-fidelity iSWAP and CZ gates can be performed within 50 ns with simulated coherent error below $10^{-4}$, while residual $ZZ$ interaction during idling remains below a few kilohertz. Extending to a four-qubit system, we also simulate gates between every qubit pair by selectively enabling the couplers with low qubit crosstalk. This approach provides a practical route toward enhanced interaction flexibility in superconducting quantum processors and may serve as a useful building block for devices that benefit from selective non-local coupling.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Logical Programming for Quantum Circuit Discovery and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing high-fidelity quantum circuits remains challenging, and current paradigms often depend on heuristic, fixed-ansatz structures or rule-based compilers that can be suboptimal or lack generality. We introduce a neuro-symbolic framework that reframes quantum circuit design as a differentiable logic programming problem. Our model represents a scaffold of potential quantum gates and parameterized operations as a set of learnable, continuous ``truth values'' or ``switches,'' $s \in [0, 1]^N$. These switches are optimized via standard gradient descent to satisfy a user-defined set of differentiable, logical axioms (e.g., correctness, simplicity, robustness). We provide a theoretical formulation bridging continuous logic (via T-norms) and unitary evolution (via geodesic interpolation), while addressing the barren plateau problem through biased initialization. We illustrate the approach on tasks including discovery of a 4-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) from a scaffold of 21 candidate gates. We also report a hardware-aware adaptation experiment on the 133-qubit IBM Torino processor, where the method improved fidelity by 59.3 percentage points in a localized routing task while adapting to hardware failures.</description>

      <title>Error compensation without a time penalty: robust spin-lock-induced crossing in solution NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A modification of the widely-used spin-lock-induced crossing (SLIC) procedure is proposed for the solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of strongly coupled nuclear spin systems, including singlet NMR and parahydrogen-enhanced hyperpolarised NMR experiments. The compensated-SLIC (cSLIC) scheme uses a repetitive sequence where the repeated element employs two different radiofrequency field amplitudes. Effective compensation for deviations in the radiofrequency field amplitude is achieved without increasing the overall duration of the SLIC sequence. The advantageous properties of cSLIC are demonstrated by numerical simulations and by representative experiments.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed microwave resonators by frequency comb spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coplanar waveguide resonators are central to the thriving field of circuit quantum electrodynamics. Recently, we have demonstrated the generation of a broadband microwave-frequency comb spectrum using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) driven by a time-dependent magnetic field. Here, the frequency comb is used to spectroscopically probe a bank of coplanar microwave resonators, inductively coupled to a common transmission line, a standard circuit with a variety of applications. We compare the resonator line shape obtained from signals synthesized at room temperature using conventional electronics with the radiation produced in the cryogenic environment by our source, showing substantial equivalence in the estimation of the resonator quality factors. To measure non-uniformly spaced resonant frequencies, we drive the generator with a bi-chromatic tone to generate intermodulation products. Such a dense frequency comb spectrum enables simultaneous addressing of a few resonators via frequency multiplexing. Finally, we discuss the criteria for achieving effective spectroscopic coverage of a given frequency bandwidth.</description>

      <title>GHz-rate polarization-based QKD system for fiber and satellite applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to exchange a secret key between two parties. Despite its promising features, QKD also faces several practical challenges such as transmission loss, noise in quantum channels and finite key size effects. Addressing these issues is crucial for the large-scale deployment of QKD in fiber and satellite networks.
  In this paper, we present a 1550 nm QKD system realizing the efficient-BB84 protocol and based on the iPOGNAC scheme. The system achieved repetition rates up to 1.5~GHz and showed an intrinsic QBER of $\sim 0.4\%$. The system was first tested on a laboratory fiber link and then on an intermodal link in the field, consisting of both deployed fiber and a 620 m free-space channel. The experiment was performed in daylight conditions, exploiting the Qubit4Sync synchronization protocol. With this trial, we achieved a new benchmark for free-space BB84 QKD systems by generating a sustained secret key rate (SKR) above 1~Mb/s for 1 hour. Finally, exploiting a recently discovered finite-size bound, we achieved a secure key rate of about 10 Mb/s at low losses (5 dB), and around 6.5~kb/s in the high-loss (38.5 dB), low block length ($N=10^4$) regime. The latter results demonstrate the system's suitability for highly lossy and time-constrained scenarios such as QKD from low Earth orbit satellites.</description>

      <title>Long distance quantum illumination and ranging using polarization entangled photon pairs in a lossy environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using polarization entangled photon pairs, we demonstrate a robust scheme for quantum illumination and ranging in a lossy environment. Entangled photon pairs are generated in a Sagnac interferometer configuration, yielding high-visibility two-photon polarization entanglement with a measured CHSH parameter of $S =2.802\pm0.002$. One of the photons from the entangled pair is retained as idler and the other one is directed into either of the two paths, namely reference and probe, of which probe is sent toward a distant object through a lossy free-space channel, and the reflected photons are collected after round-trip free-space propagation over distances approaching $1$ km. Remarkably, strong correlations are observed with CHSH values $S &gt;2.6$ even when only a few tens of probe photons are returned, confirming the robustness of polarization entanglement under long-distance free-space propagation. This work reports the robustness of encoding photons in different basis before it is sent towards the object and recovery of polarization entanglement even after a kilometer-scale scattering from the objects, establishing a practical foundation for scalable quantum-assisted object detection and ranging.</description>

      <title>Cascaded Optomechanical Sensing for Small Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a sensing scheme for detecting weak forces that achieves Heisenberg-limited sensitivity without relying on entanglement or other non-classical resources. Our scheme utilizes coherent averaging across a chain of N optomechanical cavities, unidirectionally coupled via a laser beam. As the beam passes through the cavities, it accumulates phase shifts induced by a common external force acting on the mechanical elements. Remarkably, this fully classical approach achieves the sensitivity scaling typically associated with quantum-enhanced protocols, providing a robust and experimentally feasible route to precision sensing. Potential applications range from high-sensitivity gravitational field measurements at the Large Hadron Collider to probing dark matter interactions and detecting gravitational waves. This work opens a new pathway for leveraging coherent light-matter interactions for force sensing.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Method of Efficient Simulation of Physics Applications for a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry and materials science are among the most promising areas for demonstrating algorithmic quantum advantage and quantum utility due to their inherent quantum mechanical nature. Still, large-scale simulations of quantum circuits are essential for determining the problem size at which quantum solutions outperform classical methods. In this work, we present a novel hybrid simulation approach, forming a hybrid of a fullstate and a Clifford simulator, specifically designed to address the computational challenges associated with the time evolution of quantum chemistry Hamiltonians. Our method focuses on the efficient emulation of multi-qubit rotations, a critical component of Trotterized Hamiltonian evolution. By optimizing the representation and execution of multi-qubit operations leveraging the Pauli frame, our approach significantly reduces the computational cost of simulating quantum circuits, enabling more efficient simulations. Beyond its impact on chemistry applications, our emulation strategy has broad implications for any computational workload that relies heavily on multi-qubit rotations. By increasing the efficiency of quantum simulations, our method facilitates more accurate and cost-effective studies of complex quantum systems. We quantify the performance improvements and computational savings for this emulation strategy, and we obtain a speedup of a factor $\approx 18$ ($\approx 22$ with MPI) for our evaluated chemistry Hamiltonians with 24 qubits. Thus, we evaluate our integration of this emulation strategy into the Intel Quantum SDK, further bridging the gap between theoretical algorithm development and practical quantum software implementations.</description>

      <title>DISCOVER: A Physics-Informed, GPU-Accelerated Symbolic Regression Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) enables the discovery of interpretable mathematical relationships from experimental and simulation data. These relationships are often coined descriptors which are defined as a fundamental materials property that is directly correlated to a desired or undesired functional property of the material. Although established approaches such as Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) have successfully identified low-dimensional descriptors within large feature spaces many existing SR tools integrate poorly with modern Python workflows, offer limited control over the symbolic search space, or struggle with the computational demands of large-scale studies. This paper introduces DISCOVER (Data-Informed Symbolic Combination of Operators for Variable Equation Regression), an open-source symbolic regression package developed to address these challenges through a modular, physics-motivated design. DISCOVER allows users to guide the symbolic search using domain knowledge, constrain the feature space explicitly, and take advantage of optional GPU acceleration to improve computational efficiency in data-intensive workflows, enabling reproducible and scalable SR workflows. The software is intended for applications in computational physics, computational chemistry, and materials science, where interpretability, physical consistency, and execution time are especially important, and it complements general-purpose SR frameworks by emphasizing the discovery of physically meaningful models.</description>

      <title>Escape of quantum information across an analogue black hole horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complete evaporation of black holes, as a natural endpoint of Hawking radiation, gives rise to the black hole information paradox, which fundamentally challenges the principles of unitarity and information conservation in quantum mechanics. Although the AdS/CFT correspondence indicates that information is preserved during black hole evaporation, the precise mechanism by which it is recovered from the Hawking radiation remains an open question. To explore a potential resolution, we investigate information transfer in an analog black hole spacetime realized through position-dependent coupling in an XY spin chain. We derive and demonstrate Page curve-like behavior, and analyze the transmission of quantum resources, such as entanglement and coherence, across the effective horizon. Our results show that quantum resources initially localized within an interior subsystem can be transferred to the exterior via particle radiation through the horizon. This study provides a novel perspective from quantum simulation on how information may escape from black holes, thereby contributing to the further understanding of the black hole information paradox.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Have you ever watched superhero movies like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse? Or played games where your choices create different outcomes? What if we told you that in the real world, something even crazier might be happening all the time, right under our noses? Imagine shrinking down to the size of an atom. What you'd see wouldn't be like our everyday world at all! This is the realm of quantum physics, where the rules we know do not apply, where things exist everywhere and nowhere at once. The moment you observe something, it starts behaving differently. In this article, we will explore two of the many possible explanations for such phenomena, namely the Copenhagen interpretation and the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics. We will also try to answer the question of whether there are many copies of you roaming around in different universes, and why you haven't met one.</description>

      <title>Zero-point energy of solids from vacuum fluctuation and quantum geometric force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that quantum fluctuations of electromagnetic fields induce an additional zero-point energy in solids, which scales with the volume. For insulators, the zero-point energy density is proportional to quantum fluctuation of electric polarization in the many-body ground state, a fundamental quantum geometric property of solids known as the quantum weight. Although the zero-point energy does not affect the dynamics of the electromagnetic fields, when the fields are produced by a superconducting LC circuit, the zero-point energy contributes to a repulsive force between the circuit and the material. In addition, since zero-point energy depends on the circuit's capacitor, it yields a measurable static force acting on the capacitor plates, which we call quantum geometric force. The proposed effects provide direct experimental access to the many-body quantum geometry and reveal a new macroscopic quantum effect in solids induced by vacuum fluctuation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the results of two-photon-excited fluorescence (TPEF) measurements of the $5\mathrm{S}_{1/2} \rightarrow 5\mathrm{D}_{1/2}$ transition of $^{85}$Rb and $^{87}$Rb cooled in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). We observe TPEF at excitation powers as low as 1 $\mu$W or fluxes as low as $4.30 \pm 0.22 \times 10^{18}\ \text{photons}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ ($^{85}$Rb) and $5.17 \pm 0.26 \times 10^{18}\ \text{photons}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ ($^{87}$Rb). Our results show that Rb, with additional benefits due to its ability to be optically cooled to the point where Doppler-broadening is negligible, is a promising platform for observing sensitive two-photon spectral signatures at low photon fluxes.</description>

      <title>HALO: A Fine-Grained Resource Sharing Quantum Operating System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum computing enters the cloud era, thousands of users must share access to a small number of quantum processors. Users need to wait minutes to days to start their jobs, which only takes a few seconds for execution. Current quantum cloud platforms employ a fair-share scheduler, as there is no way to multiplex a quantum computer among multiple programs at the same time, leaving many qubits idle and significantly under-utilizing the hardware. This imbalance between high user demand and scarce quantum resources has become a key barrier to scalable and cost-effective quantum computing.
  We present HALO, the first quantum operating system design that supports fine-grained resource-sharing. HALO introduces two complementary mechanisms. First, a hardware-aware qubit-sharing algorithm that places shared helper qubits on regions of the quantum computer that minimize routing overhead and avoid cross-talk noise between different users' processes. Second, a shot-adaptive scheduler that allocates execution windows according to each job's sampling requirements, improving throughput and reducing latency. Together, these mechanisms transform the way quantum hardware is scheduled and achieve more fine-grained parallelism.
  We evaluate HALO on the IBM Torino quantum computer on helper qubit intense benchmarks. Compared to state-of-the-art systems such as HyperQ, HALO improves overall hardware utilization by up to 2.44x, increasing throughput by 4.44x, and maintains fidelity loss within 33%, demonstrating the practicality of resource-sharing in quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Miniaturised multi-plane light converters via laser-written geometric phase holograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-plane light converters (MPLCs) are an emerging 3D beam shaping technology capable of deterministically mapping a basis of input spatial light modes to a new basis of output modes. The ability to perform such spatial reformatting operations has many future applications in both classical and quantum photonics, spanning from optical communications to photonic computing and imaging. MPLCs are intricate optical systems consisting of a cascade of inverse-designed diffractive optical elements, typically separated by free-space. In this work we investigate the fabrication of miniaturised fully-encapsulated transmissive MPLCs within a glass chip using single-step direct laser writing. Our approach relies on the formation of femto-second laser induced birefringent nanogratings with a spatially controllable fast axis orientation. The glass chip is internally patterned with layers of these nanogratings to create multiple geometric phase holograms which imprint controllable phase patterns onto circularly polarised light propagating through them. We experimentally demonstrate two proof-of-concept glass-embedded 700x700x2000 micrometer cubed MPLCs: a 3-mode and a 10-mode Hermite-Gaussian mode sorter. We discuss the fabrication challenges and future improvements of these devices. Our work plots a path towards the rapid prototyping of robust monolithic MPLC technology.</description>

      <title>Split-Post Microwave Displacement Transducer with Quadratic Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a microwave cavity-based displacement readout employing a split-post geometry for measuring the motion of a dielectric membrane. The cavity response to membrane displacement is predominantly quadratic when the membrane is positioned at the centre of the posts. We characterise this behaviour by driving the membrane piezo electrically at both central and off-centre positions and calibrating the displacement using an independent interferometric measurement. The calibration reveals a linear coupling between the membrane displacement and the applied drive voltage, while the microwave response follows the static displacement dependence. When the membrane is driven at the centre, the system exhibits the highest displacement-to-voltage sensitivity and the largest quadratic output. As the membrane is moved away from the centre, the response gradually transitions from quadratic to linear. There is a difference of ~ 97 $\%$ in the quadratic coefficient from the central position and a difference of ~ 92 $\%$ in the linear coefficient from the off-centre position. This controllable crossover between quadratic and linear coupling is a key requirement for sensors capable of resolving energy quantisation. It establishes this platform as a promising candidate for a microwave-mechanical quantum transducer.</description>

      <title>Limitations of SVD-Based Diagnostics for Non-Hermitian Many-Body Localization with Time-Reversal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singular value decomposition (SVD) has been used to construct Hermitian-like diagnostics for non-Hermitian many-body systems, but its reliability for identifying many-body localization (MBL) transitions -- particularly in time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) preserving settings -- remains unclear. Here we benchmark SVD-based diagnostics against exact diagonalization (ED) in TRS-preserving non-Hermitian hard-core-boson chains with nonreciprocal hopping, considering three representative potentials: a quasiperiodic potential, random disorder, and a Stark potential. We compare spectral statistics, half-chain entanglement entropy, inverse participation ratio, and spectral form factors. For the quasiperiodic and random-disorder models, ED yields mutually consistent transition estimates, whereas SVD systematically shifts the inferred critical disorder strength to larger values and can lead to different phase assignments. In contrast, for the clean Stark model ED and SVD locate a consistent critical tilt. Our results show that while SVD-based diagnostics capture qualitative trends, they are not generically reliable for quantitatively locating the MBL transition in TRS-preserving non-Hermitian many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian physics in the many-body system of Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics exhibits unique physical properties beyond those of traditional Hermitian systems, such as symmetry breaking, the emergence of exceptional points, topological phase transitions, and more. These phenomena have been extensively studied across various platforms, including quantum optics, cold atom systems, superconducting circuits, and condensed matter physics. Rydberg atoms, with their long-range interactions and flexible controllability, provide a promising platform for the experimental realization of non-Hermitian physics. This review primarily summarizes the key experimental and theoretical achievements in the field of non-Hermitian physics within Rydberg atomic systems in recent years. It outlines the fundamental construction of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, reveals the effective dissipation mechanisms induced by Rydberg atomic interactions, and discusses their impact on spectral properties and symmetry breaking. These studies not only deepen the understanding of quantum phase transitions in non-Hermitian many-body systems but also highlight the unique value of Rydberg atomic platforms in realizing and controlling topological states.</description>

      <title>Turning non-superconducting elements into superconductors by quantum confinement and proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elemental good metals, including noble metals (Cu, Ag, Au) and several $s$-block elements, do not exhibit superconductivity in bulk at ambient pressure, primarily due to weak electron--phonon coupling that fails to overcome Coulomb repulsion. In this perspective, we examine whether quantum confinement alone, or in combination with proximity effects, can induce an observable superconducting instability in metals that are non-superconducting in bulk form. We review recent theoretical progress and present a unified framework based on a confinement-generalized, isotropic one-band Eliashberg theory, in which the normal density of states becomes energy dependent and key material parameters ($E_F$, $\lambda$, and $\mu^{*}$) acquire an explicit thickness dependence. By numerically solving the resulting Eliashberg equations using ab-initio or experimentally determined electron--phonon spectral functions $\alpha^{2}F(\Omega)$ and Coulomb pseudopotentials $\mu^{*}$, and without introducing adjustable parameters, we compute the critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of film thickness for representative noble, alkali, and alkaline-earth metals. The theory predicts that superconductivity can emerge only in selected cases and within extremely narrow thickness windows, typically centered around sub-nanometer scales ($L \sim 0.4$--$0.6$~nm). We further discuss layered superconductor/normal-metal systems, where quantum confinement and proximity effects coexist. In these heterostructures, a substantial enhancement of the critical temperature is predicted, even when the constituent materials are non-superconducting or poor superconductors in bulk form.</description>

      <title>A Course on the Introduction to Quantum Software Engineering: Experience Report</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is increasingly practiced through programming, yet most educational offerings emphasize algorithmic or framework-level use rather than software engineering concerns such as testing, abstraction, tooling, and lifecycle management.
  This paper reports on the design and first offering of a cross-listed undergraduate--graduate course that frames quantum computing through a software engineering lens, focusing on early-stage competence relevant to software engineering practice. The course integrates foundational quantum concepts with software engineering perspectives, emphasizing executable artifacts, empirical reasoning, and trade-offs arising from probabilistic behaviour, noise, and evolving toolchains. Evidence is drawn from instructor observations, student feedback, surveys, and analysis of student work.
  Despite minimal prior exposure to quantum computing, students were able to engage productively with quantum software engineering topics once a foundational understanding of quantum information and quantum algorithms, expressed through executable artifacts, was established. This experience report contributes a modular course design, a scalable assessment model for mixed academic levels, and transferable lessons for software engineering educators developing quantum computing curricula.</description>

      <title>A gravitationally induced decoherence model for photons in the context of the relational formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a model of gravitationally induced decoherence for photons starting from Maxwell theory coupled to linearised gravity, expressed in terms of Ashtekar-Barbero variables and treated as an open quantum field theoretic system. In contrast to quantum mechanical models, the interaction between the system (Maxwell field) and the environment (gravitational field) is not postulated phenomenologically, but is instead dictated by the underlying action in a post-Minkowskian approximation. This framework extends earlier models for a scalar field and enables a more detailed analysis of the role of dynamical reference fields (clocks) within the relational formalism. We show that, for a suitable choice of geometrical clocks together with a U(1)-Gauss clock, and by employing an appropriate combination of the observable map and its dual, the resulting Dirac observables are given directly by the transverse components of the photon field as well as the symmetric-transverse-traceless degrees of freedom of gravitational waves on the linearised phase space of the coupled system. In addition we also compare different choices of Dirac observables and their dynamics. Upon applying a Fock quantisation to the reduced system, we derive the time convolutionless (TCL) master equation, truncated at second order, and analyse its structural properties. These results provide a foundation for further investigations of the decoherence model, including its renormalisation and a detailed study of its one-particle sector, and are found to be structurally consistent with former master equations for photons derived using ADM variables and a specific gauge fixing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an operational, boundary-first framework that embeds relativistic quantum-information protocols into anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) by coupling an Unruh--DeWitt detector directly to a local scalar primary operator of a holographic CFT. Using the universal CFT Wightman function, we compute the detector's reduced density operator perturbatively, retaining both excitation probabilities and coherences. As a concrete resource-theoretic application, we implement magic resource (mana) harvesting with a qutrit probe. For a CFT dual to global AdS, we show that the harvested mana sharply distinguishes the two admissible scalar quantizations in the Breitenlohner--Freedman window, with the standard quantization yielding systematically larger mana than the alternate one. Our results provide a viable way of testing holography principle through quantum information resource.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Route Planning as a QUBO Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Route Planning considers selecting vehicles, each associated with a single predefined route, such that the spatial coverage of a road network is increased while redundant overlaps are limited. This paper gives a formal problem definition, proves NP-hardness by reduction from the Weighted Set Packing problem, and derives a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation whose coefficients directly encode unique coverage rewards and pairwise overlap penalties. A single penalty parameter controls the coverage-overlap trade-off. We distinguish between a soft regime, which supports multi-objective exploration, and a hard regime, in which the penalty is strong enough to effectively enforce near-disjoint routes. We describe a practical pipeline for generating city instances, constructing candidate routes, building the QUBO matrix, and solving it with an exact mixed-integer solver (Gurobi), simulated annealing, and D-Wave hybrid quantum annealing. Experiments on Barcelona instances with up to 10 000 vehicles reveal a clear coverage-overlap knee and show that Pareto-optimal solutions are mainly obtained under the hard-penalty regime, while D-Wave hybrid solvers and Gurobi achieve essentially identical objective values with only minor differences in runtime as problem size grows.</description>

      <title>A quantum-inspired multi-level tensor-train monolithic space-time method for nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a multilevel tensor-train (TT) framework for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) in a global space-time formulation. While space-time TT solvers have demonstrated significant potential for compressed high-dimensional simulations, the literature contains few systematic comparisons with classical time-stepping methods, limited error convergence analyses, and little quantitative assessment of the impact of TT rounding on numerical accuracy. Likewise, existing studies fail to demonstrate performance across a diverse set of PDEs and parameter ranges. In practice, monolithic Newton iterations may stagnate or fail to converge in strongly nonlinear, stiff, or advection-dominated regimes, where poor initial guesses and severely ill-conditioned space-time Jacobians hinder robust convergence. We overcome this limitation by introducing a coarse-to-fine multilevel strategy fully embedded within the TT format. Each level refines both spatial and temporal resolutions while transferring the TT solution through low-rank prolongation operators, providing robust initializations for successive Newton solves. Residuals, Jacobians, and transfer operators are represented directly in TT and solved with the adaptive-rank DMRG algorithm. Numerical experiments for a selection of nonlinear PDEs including Fisher-KPP, viscous Burgers, sine-Gordon, and KdV cover diffusive, convective, and dispersive dynamics, demonstrating that the multilevel TT approach consistently converges where single-level space-time Newton iterations fail. In dynamic, advection-dominated (nonlinear) scenarios, multilevel TT surpasses single-level TT, achieving high accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost, specifically when high-fidelity numerical simulation is required.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Gaps in Solar and Reactor Neutrino Oscillation Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum estimation theory provides a fundamental framework for analyzing how precisely physical parameters can be estimated from measurements. Neutrino oscillations are characterized by a set of parameters inferred from experiments conducted in different production and detection environments. The two solar oscillation parameters, $\Delta m^2_{21}$ and $\theta_{12}$, can be estimated using both solar neutrino experiments and reactor neutrino experiments. In reactor experiments, neutrinos are detected after coherent vacuum evolution, while solar neutrinos arrive at the detector as incoherent mixtures. In this work, we use Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) to quantify and compare the information content accessible in these two experimental setups. We find that for reactor neutrinos, flavor measurements saturate the QFI bound for both parameters over specific energy ranges, demonstrating their optimality and explaining the high precision achieved by these experiments. In contrast, for solar neutrinos the phase-based contribution to the QFI, originating from the quantum coherence, is absent, rendering the estimation of $\Delta m_{21}^2$ purely population-based and effectively classical, while the QFI for $\theta_{12}$ is dominated by basis rotation at high energies and is nearly saturated by flavor measurements. Consequently, solar neutrino experiments are intrinsically more sensitive to $\theta_{12}$ than to $\Delta m_{21}^2$. This analysis highlights a fundamental distinction between the two estimation problems and accounts for their differing achievable precisions.</description>

      <title>Does fermionic entanglement always outperform bosonic entanglement in dilaton black hole?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has traditionally been believed that fermionic entanglement generally outperforms bosonic entanglement in relativistic frameworks, and that bosonic entanglement experiences sudden death in extreme gravitational environments. In this study, we analyze the genuine N-partite entanglement, measured by negativity, of bosonic and fermionic GHZ states, focusing on scenarios where a subset of $m$ ($m&lt;N$) constituents interacts with Hawking radiation generated by a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. Surprisingly, we find that quantum entanglement between the non-gravitational and gravitational modes for the bosonic field is stronger than that in the same modes for the fermionic field within dilaton spacetime. This study challenges the traditional belief that ``fermionic entanglement always outperforms bosonic entanglement" in the relativistic framework. However, quantum entanglement between the gravitational modes and the combined gravitational and non-gravitational modes is weaker for the bosonic field than for the fermionic field in the presence of a dilaton black hole. Finally, the connection between the global N-partite entanglement in the bosonic field and that in the fermionic field is influenced by the gravitational field's intensity. Our study reveals the intrinsic relationship between quantum entanglement of bosonic and fermionic fields in curved spacetime from a new perspective, and provides theoretical guidance for selecting appropriate field-based quantum resources for relativistic quantum information tasks under extreme gravitational conditions.</description>

      <title>Roadmap to Quantum Aesthetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics occupies a central position in contemporary science while remaining largely inaccessible to direct sensory experience. This paper proposes a roadmap to quantum aesthetics that examines how quantum concepts become aesthetic phenomena through artistic mediation rather than direct representation. Two complementary and orthogonal approaches are articulated. The first, a pioneering top-down approach, employs text-prompt-based generative AI to probe quantum aesthetics as a collective cultural construct embedded in large-scale training data. By systematically modulating the linguistic weight of the term "quantum," generative models are used as experimental environments to reveal how quantum imaginaries circulate within contemporary visual culture. The second, a bottom-up approach, derives aesthetic form directly from quantum-mechanical structures through the visualization of quantum-generated data, exemplified here by hydrogen atomic orbitals calculated from the Schr\"odinger equation. These approaches are framed not as competing methods but as intersecting paths within a navigable field of artistic research. They position quantum aesthetics as an emergent field of artistic research shaped by cultural imagination, computational mediation, and physical law, opening new directions for artistic practice and pedagogy at the intersection of art, data, artificial intelligence and quantum science.</description>

      <title>Coupling between CaWO$_4$ phonons and Er$^{3+}$ dopants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the lattice dynamics of CaWO$_4$, a promising host crystal for erbium-based quantum memories, using inelastic neutron scattering together with density-functional perturbation theory. The measured phonon dispersion along the (100), (001), and (101) reciprocal space direction reveals phonon bands extending up to 130 meV, with a gap between 60 and 80 meV, in good agreement with our calculations. From a symmetry analysis of the phonon eigenmodes, we identify eight Raman-active modes that can couple directly to the Er$^{3+}$ crystal-field operators, including a low-energy $B_g$ mode at 9.1 meV that is expected to play a dominant role in phonon-assisted spin-lattice relaxation. These results provide a microscopic description of the phonon bath in CaWO$_4$ and establish a basis for engineering phononic environments to mitigate the loss of stored quantum states and optimize Er-doped CaWO$_4$ for quantum-memory applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a geometric model predictive control framework for quantum systems subject to smoothness and state constraints. By formulating quantum state evolution intrinsically on the projective Hilbert space, we penalize covariant accelerations to generate smooth trajectories in the form of Riemannian cubics, while incorporating state-dependent constraints through potential functions. A structure-preserving variational discretization enables receding-horizon implementation, and a Lyapunov-type stability result is established for the closed-loop system. The approach is illustrated on the Bloch sphere for a two-level quantum system, providing a viable pathway toward predictive feedback control of constrained quantum dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning has made important headway in helping to improve the treatment of quantum many-body systems. A domain of particular relevance are correlated inhomogeneous systems. What has been missing so far is a general, scalable deep-learning approach that would enable the rapid prediction of spatial densities for strongly correlated systems in arbitrary potentials. In this work, we present a straightforward scheme, where we learn to predict densities using convolutional neural networks trained on random potentials. While we demonstrate this approach in 1D and 2D lattice models using data from numerical techniques like Quantum Monte Carlo, it is directly applicable as well to training data obtained from experimental quantum simulators. We train networks that can predict the densities of multiple observables simultaneously and that can predict for a whole class of many-body lattice models, for arbitrary system sizes. We show that our approach can handle well the interplay of interference and interactions and the behaviour of models with phase transitions in inhomogeneous situations, and we also illustrate the ability to solve inverse problems, finding a potential for a desired density.</description>

      <title>Minimum Hilbert-Schmidt distance for Schmidt rank 2 states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hilbert-Schmidt distance between two states is proven to be non-contractive under CPTP maps, and therefore is not considered as an entanglement measure. However, that alone does not imply that the minimum Hilbert-Schmidt distance from the set of separable states is not contractive as well. To the contrary, not only do we provide a closed-form expression, we also provide analytical and numerical proof that minimum Hilbert-Schmidt distance for a given bipartite quantum state of Schmidt rank 2 is non-increasing under LOCC. The minimisation is taken to be over the set of separable states. We apply the algorithm by Verstraete et al [Journal of Modern Optics, 49(8), 2002] for the derivation of the analytical expression and Nielsen's theorem for the proof of monotonicity of the distance under LOCC.</description>

      <title>Revealing effects of local dimension on variable-range interacting model by connecting Lieb-Robinson bounds and multipartite entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A spin-$s$ variable-range interacting Ising model may display qualitatively different behaviors depending on the fall-off rate of the interactions, as already seen in equilibrium studies of spin-1/2 systems. We propose a dynamical method using weighted graph states, generated through time evolution that confirms the existence of the transition point in the fall-off rate for the spin-$s$ Ising model. Moreover, the dependence of local dimension on information spreading and multipartite entanglement profile in this model remains unclear, which we establish here. In particular, our analysis shows that the maximum of genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) with the fall-off rate serves as a clear indicator of the information spreading, which aligns with changes in the profile of the Lieb-Robinson bound. Further, in the case of an open chain, the spread of information is related to the divergence in the first derivative of GME. Additionally, we validate this signature by performing a scaling analysis of the time-averaged mutual information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In stochastic modeling, the excess entropy -- the mutual information shared between a process's past and future -- represents the fundamental lower bound of the memory needed to simulate its dynamics. However, this bound cannot be saturated by either classical machines or their enhanced quantum counterparts. Simulating a process fundamentally requires us to store more information in the present than is shared between the past and the future. Here, we consider a generalization of hidden Markov models beyond classical and quantum models, referred to as n-machines, that allow for negative quasiprobabilities. We show that under the collision entropy measure of information, the minimal memory of such models can equal the excess entropy. Our results suggest that negativity can be a useful resource for achieving nonclassical memory advantage.</description>

      <title>Direct Estimation of the Density of States for Fermionic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating time evolution is one of the most natural applications of quantum computers and is thus one of the most promising prospects for achieving practical quantum advantage. Here, we develop quantum algorithms to extract thermodynamic properties by estimating the density of states (DOS), a central object in quantum statistical mechanics. We introduce several innovations that significantly improve the practicality and extend the generality of previous techniques. First, our approach allows one to estimate the DOS only for a specific subspace of the full Hilbert space. This is crucial for fermionic systems, since both canonical and grand canonical ensemble thermal equilibrium properties depend on subspaces of fixed number. Second, in our approach, by time evolving very simple, random initial states, such as randomly chosen computational basis states, we can exactly recover the DOS on average. Third, due to circuit-depth limitations, we only reconstruct the DOS up to a convolution with a Gaussian window - thus all imperfections that shift the energy levels by less than the width of the convolution window will not significantly affect the estimated DOS. For these reasons we find the approach is a promising candidate for early quantum advantage as even short-time, noisy dynamics can yield a semi-quantitative reconstruction of the DOS (convolution with a broad Gaussian window), while early fault tolerant devices will likely enable higher resolution DOS reconstruction through longer time evolutions. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach in representative Fermi-Hubbard and spin models and indeed find that our approach is highly robust against algorithmic errors in the time evolution and against gate noise. We further demonstrate that our approach is compatible with NISQ-friendly variational techniques, introducing and leveraging a new technique for variational time evolution.</description>

Abstract: Efficiently simulating quantum circuits on classical computers is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. This paper presents a novel theoretical approach that achieves substantial speedups over existing simulators for a wide class of quantum circuits. The technique leverages advanced group theory and symmetry considerations to map quantum circuits to equivalent forms amenable to efficient classical simulation. Several fundamental theorems are proven that establish the mathematical foundations of this approach, including a generalized Gottesman-Knill theorem. The potential of this method is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and preliminary benchmarks. This work contributes to the understanding of the boundary between classical and quantum computation, provides new tools for quantum circuit analysis and optimization, and opens up avenues for further research at the intersection of group theory and quantum computation. The findings may have implications for quantum algorithm design, error correction, and the development of more efficient quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Rare Events and Griffiths Phases in Topological Quantum Error Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of quantum error correcting (QEC) codes are often studied under the assumption of spatio-temporally uniform error rates. On the other hand, experimental implementations almost always produce heterogeneous error rates, in either space or time, as a result of effects such as imperfect fabrication and/or cosmic rays. It is therefore important to understand if and how their presence can affect the performance of QEC in qualitative ways. In this work, we study effects of non-uniform error rates in the representative examples of the 1D repetition code and the 2D toric code, focusing on when they have extended spatio-temporal correlations; these may arise, for instance, from rare events (such as cosmic rays) that temporarily elevate error rates over the entire code patch. These effects can be described in the corresponding statistical mechanics models for decoding, where long-range correlations in the error rates lead to extended rare regions of weaker coupling. For the 1D repetition code where the rare regions are linear, we find two distinct decodable phases: a conventional ordered phase in which logical failure rates decay exponentially with the code distance, and a rare-region dominated Griffiths phase in which failure rates are parametrically larger and decay as a stretched exponential. In particular, the latter phase is present when the error rates in the rare regions are above the bulk threshold. For the 2D toric code where the rare regions are planar, we find no decodable Griffiths phase: rare events which boost error rates above the bulk threshold lead to an asymptotic loss of threshold and failure to decode. Unpacking the failure mechanism implies that techniques for suppressing extended sequences of repeated rare events (which, without intervention, will be statistically present with high probability) will be crucial for QEC with the toric code.</description>

      <title>Non-Universality from Conserved Superoperators in Unitary Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important result in the theory of quantum control is the "universality" of $2$-local unitary gates, i.e. the fact that any global unitary evolution of a system of $L$ qudits can be implemented by composition of $2$-local unitary gates. Surprisingly, recent results have shown that universality can break down in the presence of symmetries: in general, not all globally symmetric unitaries can be constructed using $k$-local symmetric unitary gates. This also restricts the dynamics that can be implemented by symmetric local Hamiltonians. In this paper, we show that obstructions to universality in such settings can in general be understood in terms of superoperator symmetries associated with unitary evolution by restricted sets of gates. These superoperator symmetries lead to block decompositions of the operator Hilbert space, which dictate the connectivity of operator space, and hence the structure of the dynamical Lie algebra. We demonstrate this explicitly in several examples by systematically deriving the superoperator symmetries from the gate structure using the framework of commutant algebras, which has been used to systematically derive symmetries in other quantum many-body systems. We clearly delineate two different types of non-universality, which stem from different structures of the superoperator symmetries, and discuss its signatures in physical observables. In all, our work establishes a comprehensive framework to explore the universality of unitary circuits and derive physical consequences of its absence.</description>

      <title>Quantum Birthmarks: Ergodicity Breaking Beyond Scarring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hallmark of classical ergodicity is the complete loss of memory of the initial conditions due to eventual uniform covering of {\it a priori} available phase space. In quantum counterparts of such systems, however, this classical ergodic ideal is fundamentally limited: Here, we introduce the concept of a \emph{quantum birthmark}, a permanent signature left by the initial state and its early-time evolution in a general quantum system, which gives rise to non-ergodic behavior persisting even in the infinite-time limit. We present a birthmark framework outlining a ubiquitous memory effect for an arbitrary, non-stationary state composed of two factors conspiring together: the universal and the revival-enhancement. The former sets the minimal amplification carried by the time evolution of a quantum state based on global symmetries, whereas the latter incorporates the further enhancement stemming from the early dynamics, particularly prominent in the presence of recurrences that occur before the Heisenberg time. As a concrete example, we identify quantum birthmarks in the venerable stadium billiard, where they can be significantly enhanced by quantum scars. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of quantum birthmarks, including their role as a natural extension of all types of scarring theories to generic non-stationary quantum systems and prospects for experimental observation. Generally, our work opens an unexplored avenue for understanding the elusive quantum nature of ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional shuttling to avoid valley excitations in Si/SiGe quantum wells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09574v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conveyor-mode shuttling is a key approach for implementing intermediate-range coupling between electron-spin qubits in quantum dots. Initial implementations are encouraging; however, long shuttling trajectories are guaranteed to encounter regions of low conduction-band valley energy splittings, due to the presence of random-alloy disorder in Si/SiGe quantum wells. Here, we theoretically explore two schemes for avoiding valley-state excitations at these valley-splitting minima, by allowing the electrons to detour around them. A multichannel shuttling scheme allows electrons to tunnel between parallel channels, while a two-dimensional (2D) shuttler provides full omnidirectional control. Using simulations, we estimate shuttling fidelities in these two schemes, obtaining a clear preference for the 2D shuttler. Based on such encouraging results, we propose a modular qubit architecture based on 2D shuttling, which enables all-to-all connectivity within qubit plaquettes and high-fidelity communication between different plaquettes.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Generative Modeling by Sampling Expectation Values of Tunable Observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expectation Value Samplers (EVSs) are quantum generative models that can learn high-dimensional continuous distributions by measuring the expectation values of parameterized quantum circuits. However, these models can demand impractical quantum resources for good performance. We investigate how observable choices affect EVS performance and propose an Observable-Tunable Expectation Value Sampler (OT-EVS), which achieves greater expressivity than standard EVS. By restricting the selectable observables, it is possible to use the classical shadows measurement scheme to reduce the sample complexity of our algorithm. In addition, we propose an adversarial training method adapted to the needs of OT-EVS. This training prioritizes classical updates of observables, minimizing the more costly updates of quantum circuit parameters. Numerical experiments, using an original simulation technique for correlated shot noise, confirm our model's expressivity and sample efficiency advantages compared to previous designs. We envision our proposal to encourage the exploration of continuous generative models running with few quantum resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose modifying topological quantum error correcting codes by incorporating space-time defects, termed ``time vortices,'' to reduce the number of physical qubits required to achieve a desired logical error rate. A time vortex is inserted by adding a spatially varying delay to the periodic measurement sequence defining the code such that the delay accumulated on a homologically non-trivial cycle is an integer multiple of the period. We analyze this construction within the framework of the Floquet color code and optimize the embedding of the code on a torus along with the choice of the number of time vortices inserted in each direction. Asymptotically, the vortexed code requires less than half the number of qubits as the vortex-free code to reach a given code distance. We benchmark the performance of the vortexed Floquet color code by Monte Carlo simulations with a circuit-level noise model and demonstrate that the smallest vortexed code (with $30$ qubits) outperforms the vortex-free code with $42$ qubits.</description>

Abstract: Recently, a toolkit of highly symmetric techniques employing matrix inequalities has been developed to detect entanglement in various ways. Here we unifiedly explain in detail these methods, and expand them to a new family of positive maps with further detection capabilities. In the simplest case, we generalize the reduction map to detect more generic states using both multiple copies and local filters. Through the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism, this family of maps leads to a construction of multipartite entanglement witnesses. Discussions and examples are provided regarding the detection of states with local positive partial transposition and the use of multiple copies.</description>

Abstract: We propose a blockchain architecture in which mining requires a quantum computer. The consensus mechanism is based on proof of quantum work, a quantum-enhanced alternative to traditional proof of work that leverages quantum supremacy to make mining intractable for classical computers. We have refined the blockchain framework to incorporate the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, ensuring stability against sampling errors and hardware inaccuracies. To validate our approach, we implemented a prototype blockchain on four D-Wave(TM) quantum annealing processors geographically distributed within North America, demonstrating stable operation across hundreds of thousands of quantum hashing operations. Our experimental protocol follows the same approach used in the recent demonstration of quantum supremacy [King et al. Science 2025], ensuring that classical computers cannot efficiently perform the same computation task. By replacing classical machines with quantum systems for mining, it is possible to significantly reduce the energy consumption and environmental impact traditionally associated with blockchain mining while providing a quantum-safe layer of security. Beyond serving as a proof of concept for a meaningful application of quantum computing, this work highlights the potential for other near-term quantum computing applications using existing technology.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we unify several quantum algorithmic frameworks for boolean functions that are based on the quantum adversary bound. First, we show that the $st$-connectivity framework subsumes the (adaptive/extended) learning graph framework, and the weighted-decision-tree framework. Additionally, we show that every randomized algorithm can be turned into an $st$-connectivity problem as well, with the same complexity up to constants. This situates the $st$-connectivity framework in between randomized and quantum algorithms, indicating that it's an intermediate computational model between classical and quantum. We also introduce a generalization of the $st$-connectivity framework, the \textit{graph composition framework}, and show that it subsumes part of the quantum divide and conquer framework, and it is itself subsumed by the multidimensional quantum walk framework.
  Second, we investigate these frameworks' power by investigating the most efficient algorithms they can produce, in terms of the number of queries to the input. We show that the weighted-decision-tree framework's power is polynomially related to deterministic query complexity, showing that the quantum speed-ups that can be obtained with this framework are at most quadratic.
  Finally, we turn our attention to time-efficient implementations of the algorithms constructed through the $st$-connectivity and graph composition frameworks. To that end, we convert instances to the two-subspace phase estimation framework, and we show how we can implement these as transducers. This has the added benefit of removing the effective spectral gap lemma from the construction, significantly simplifying the analysis. We showcase the techniques developed in this work to give improved algorithms for various string search problems.</description>

      <title>Optically detected and radio wave-controlled spin chemistry in flavoproteins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optically addressable spin systems, such as nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, have been widely studied for quantum sensing applications. In this work, we demonstrate that certain flavoproteins, specifically cryptochrome and iLOV, which generate spin correlated radical pairs upon optical excitation, also exhibit optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). Remarkably, the iLOV protein, commonly used in cellular imaging, displays ODMR contrast approaching 50%. We present initial applications including widefield magnetic field sensing and spatial modulation of photoluminescence using radiofrequency pulses and magnetic field gradients. Our results establish radical pairs in proteins as a novel platform for optically addressable spin systems, offering the key advantages of molecular designability and genetic encodability. Moreover, due to the spin-selective nature of radical pair chemistry, the results lay the groundwork for future radiofrequency-based manipulation of biological systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting genuine multipartite entanglement in multi-qubit devices with restricted measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) is a state-characterization task that benchmarks coherence and experimental control in quantum systems. Existing GME tests often require joint measurements on many qubits, posing challenges for systems like time-bin encoded qubits and microwave photons from superconducting circuits, where qubit connectivity is limited or measurement noise grows with the number of jointly measured qubits. Here we introduce versatile GME and $k$-inseparability criteria applicable to any state, which only require measuring $O(n^2)$ out of $2^n$ (at most) $m$-body stabilizers of $n$-qubit target graph states, with $m$ upper-bounded by twice the graph's maximum degree. For cluster or ring-graph states, only constant-weight stabilizers are needed. Using semidefinite programming (and sometimes graph-local complementations), we can reduce the number or weight of required stabilizers. Analytical and numerical results show that our criteria are noise-robust and may infer state infidelity from certified $k$-inseparability in microwave photonic graph states generated under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>On the non-Markovian quantum stochastic network dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate non-Markovian quantum dynamics from the perspective of quantum noises in a network of atoms mediated by a waveguide. In such networks, quantum coherent feedback control becomes achievable when coherent fields (or quantum noises) in the format of photons with continuous modes propagate through the waveguide. Different from traditional Markovian quantum systems, the non-Markovian quantum network can be regarded as a quantum system interacting with multiple input quantum noise channels with different time delays, and the \rm{It\={o}} relationships among different quantum noise channels can be represented with a non-Markovian integral process with integral kernels determined by the distances among atoms and their coupling strengths to the waveguide. Then the non-Markovian dynamics of the quantum network can be modeled with the quantum stochastic differential equation (QSDE) containing integral kernels determined by the \rm{It\={o}} relationships among quantum noises. Utilizing this stochastic approach related to quantum noises, the filtering of quantum states can be modulated by parameters such as atom-waveguide coupling strengths, quantum control fields, and measurement results collected at the output end of the waveguide.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of logical quantum phase estimation for X-ray absorption spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we employed Fourier-based quantum phase estimation (QPE) to calculate X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) spectra. The primary focus of this study is the calculation of the XAS spectra of transition metal $L_{2,3}$-edges, which are dominated by strong correlation effects. First, the Fe $L_{2,3}$-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure of FePO$_4$ is calculated using a noiseless simulator. The present computation involves a comparison of three types of input states: a uniform superposition state, optimal entangled input state, and Slater function state. Subsequently, we investigated the resolution error of the QPE and statistical error attributed to the measurements. It was revealed that post-processing to introduce Lorentzian broadening reduces the statistical error, which becomes a significant problem for a large number of qubits. Subsequently, we implemented QPE on a trapped-ion quantum computer, encompassing three orbitals within the active space. To this end, we implemented QPE using dynamic circuits to reduce ancilla qubits and [[k+2, k, 2]] quantum error detection code to mitigate the quantum noise inherent in current quantum computers. As a result, it was demonstrated that hardware noise was reduced, and spectra close to the noiseless ones were obtained.</description>

      <title>Efficient benchmarking of logical magic state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity logical magic states are a critical resource for fault-tolerant quantum computation, enabling non-Clifford logical operations through state injection. However, benchmarking these states presents significant challenges: one must estimate the infidelity $\epsilon$ with multiplicative precision, while many quantum error-correcting codes only permit Clifford operations to be implemented fault-tolerantly. Consequently, conventional state tomography requires $\sim1/\epsilon^2$ samples, making benchmarking impractical for high-fidelity states. In this work, we show that any benchmarking scheme measuring one copy of the magic state per round necessarily requires $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ samples for single-qubit magic states. We then propose two approaches to overcome this limitation: (i) Bell measurements on two copies of the twirled state and (ii) single-copy schemes leveraging twirled multi-qubit magic states. Both benchmarking schemes utilize measurements with stabilizer states orthogonal to the ideal magic state and we show that $O(1/\epsilon)$ sample complexity is achieved, which we prove to be optimal. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our protocols through numerical simulations under realistic noise models, confirming that their advantage persists even at moderate error rates currently achievable in state-of-the-art experiments.</description>

      <title>Flowing Through Hilbert Space: Quantum-Enhanced Generative Models for Lattice Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling from high-dimensional and structured probability distributions is a fundamental challenge in computational physics, particularly in the context of lattice field theory (LFT), where generating field configurations efficiently is critical, yet computationally intensive. In this work, we apply a previously developed hybrid quantum-classical normalizing flow model to explore quantum-enhanced sampling in such regimes. Our approach embeds parameterized quantum circuits within a classical normalizing flow architecture, leveraging amplitude encoding and quantum entanglement to enhance expressivity in the generative process. The quantum circuit serves as a trainable transformation within the flow, while classical networks provide adaptive coupling and compensate for quantum hardware imperfections. This design enables efficient density estimation and sample generation, potentially reducing the resources required compared to purely classical methods. While LFT provides a representative and physically meaningful application for benchmarking, our focus is on improving the sampling efficiency of generative models through quantum components. This work contributes toward the development of quantum-enhanced generative modeling frameworks that address the sampling bottlenecks encountered in physics and beyond.</description>

Abstract: The use of quantum computing for machine learning is among the most promising applications of quantum technologies. Quantum models inspired by classical algorithms are developed to explore some possible advantages over classical approaches. A primary challenge in the development and testing of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) algorithms is the scarcity of datasets designed specifically for a quantum approach. Existing datasets, often borrowed from classical machine learning, need modifications to be compatible with current quantum hardware. In this work, we utilize a dataset generated by Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in a format directly compatible with the proposed quantum data process, eliminating the need for feature reduction. Among quantum-inspired machine learning algorithms, the Projected Quantum Kernel (PQK) stands out for its elegant solution of projecting the data encoded in the Hilbert space into a classical space. For a prediction task concerning office room occupancy, we compare PQK with the standard Quantum Kernel (QK) and their classical counterparts to investigate how different feature maps affect the encoding of IoT data. Our findings show that the PQK demonstrates comparable effectiveness to classical methods when the proposed shallow circuit is used for quantum encoding.</description>

Abstract: Solving quantum many-body systems is one of the most significant regimes where quantum computing applies. Currently, as a hardware-friendly computational paradigms, variational algorithms are often used for finding the ground energy of quantum many-body systems. However, running large-scale variational algorithms is challenging, because of the noise as well as the obstacle of barren plateaus. In this work, we propose the quantum version of matrix product state (qMPS), and develop variational quantum algorithms to prepare it in canonical forms, allowing to run the variational MPS method, which is equivalent to the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method, on near term quantum devices. Compared with widely used methods such as variational quantum eigensolver, this method can greatly reduce the number of qubits required, and thus can mitigate the effects of Barren Plateaus while obtain comparable or even better accuracy. Our method holds promise for distributed quantum computing, offering possibilities for fusion of different computing systems.</description>

Abstract: We provide a Hilbert space approach to quantum mechanics where space and time are treated on an equal footing. Our approach replaces the standard dependence on an external classical time parameter with a spacetime-symmetric algebraic structure, thereby unifying the axioms that traditionally distinguish the treatment of spacelike and timelike separations. Standard quantum evolution can be recovered from timelike correlators, defined by means of a quantum action operator, a quantum version of the action of classical mechanics. The corresponding map also provides a novel perspective on the path integral formulation, which, in the case of fermions, yields an alternative to the use of Grassmann variables. In addition, the formalism can be interpreted in terms of generalized quantum states, codifying both the conventional information of a quantum system at a given time and its evolution. We show that these states are solutions to a quantum principle of stationary action grounded in timelike correlations and pseudo-entropies</description>

Abstract: Quantum physics enables parameter estimation with precisions beyond the capability of classical sensors. Quantum criticality is a key resource for this quantum-enhanced sensing, but experimental realization has been challenging due to the complexity of ground-state preparation and the long time required to reach the steady state near criticality. Here, we experimentally demonstrate critical enhancement in a non-Hermitian topological system using a photonic quantum walk setup. Our system supports two distinct phase transitions at which enhanced sensitivity is observed even at transient times for which the Bayesian inference shows excellent estimation and precision. It is a direct demonstration of criticality-enhanced scaling laws with non-unitary dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code, it is sometimes necessary to modify the code by adding an arbitrary number of physical qubits and parity checks. Motivations may include concatenating codes, embedding low-density parity check (LDPC) codes into finite-dimensional Euclidean space, or reducing the weights of parity checks. During this embedding, it is essential that the modified code possesses an isomorphic set of logical qubits as the original code. However, despite numerous explicit constructions, the conditions of when such a property holds true is not known in general. Therefore, using the language of homological algebra, we provide a unified framework that guarantees a natural isomorphism between the output and input codes. In particular, we explicitly show how previous works fit into our framework.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic study of how quantum circuit design, specifically the depth of the variational ansatz and the choice of quantum feature mapping, affects the performance of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks on a causal classification task. The architecture combines a convolutional neural network for classical feature extraction with a parameterized quantum circuit acting as the quantum layer. We evaluate multiple ansatz depths and nine different feature maps. Results show that increasing the number of ansatz repetitions improves generalization and training stability, though benefits tend to plateau beyond a certain depth. The choice of feature mapping is even more critical: only encodings with multi-axis Pauli rotations enable successful learning, while simpler maps lead to underfitting or loss of class separability. Principal Component Analysis and silhouette scores reveal how data distributions evolve across network stages. These findings offer practical guidance for designing quantum circuits in hybrid models. All source codes and evaluation tools are publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collision models provide a simple and versatile setting to capture the dynamics of open quantum systems. The standard approach to thermalisition in this setting involves an environment of independent and identically-prepared thermal qubits, interacting sequentially for a finite duration $\Delta t$ with the system. We compare this to a two-bath scenario in which collisional qubits are prepared in either their ground or excited states and the environment temperature is encoded in system-environment couplings. The system reaches the same thermal steady state for both settings, although even in this limit they describe fundamentally different physical processes, with the two-bath setup yielding a nonequilibrium state with finite heat currents. Non-Markovian dynamics arise when intra-environment interactions in either setting are introduced. Here, the system in the single-bath setup again reaches a steady state at the canonical temperature of the bath, but the nonequilibrium steady state of the two-bath setup tends to a different temperature due to the generation of strong system-environment and intra-environment correlations. The two-bath setting is particularly suited to studying quantum trajectories, which are well-defined also for the non-Markovian case. We showcase this with a trajectory analysis of the heat currents within a two-point measurement scheme. Finally, we consider how our results are impacted when the system-environment interaction leads to strict homogenisation. Our results provide insights into the dynamics and thermodynamics of thermalisation towards nonequilibrium steady states and the role of non-Markovian interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01116v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Computing (VQC) faces fundamental scalability barriers, primarily due to barren plateaus and sensitivity to quantum noise. To address these challenges, we introduce TensorHyper-VQC, a novel tensor-train (TT)-guided hypernetwork framework that significantly improves the robustness and scalability of VQC. Our framework fully delegates the generation of quantum-circuit parameters to a classical TT network, thereby decoupling optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Grounded in Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum simulation tasks demonstrate that TensorHyper-VQC consistently achieves superior performance and robust noise tolerance, including hardware-level validation on a 156-qubit IBM Heron processor. These results position TensorHyper-VQC as a scalable and noise-resilient framework for advancing practical quantum machine learning on near-term devices.</description>

      <title>Maximally non-projective measurements are not always symmetric informationally complete</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard quantum measurements are projective. However, the full scope of quantum measurements is represented by positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) and many of these break the limitations of projective measurements as resources in quantum information. It is therefore natural to consider how accurately an experimenter with access only to projective measurements and classical processing can simulate POVMs. The most well-known class of non-projective measurements is called symmetric informationally complete (SIC). Such measurements are both ubiquitous in the broader scope of quantum information theory and known to be the most strongly non-projective measurements in qubit systems. Here, we show that beyond qubit systems, the SIC property is in general not associated with the most non-projective measurement. For this, we put forward a semidefinite programming criterion for detecting genuinely non-projective measurements. This method allows us to determine quantitative simulability thresholds for generic POVMs and to put forward a conjecture on which qutrit and ququart measurements that are most strongly non-projective.</description>

      <title>Stern-Gerlach Interferometers with Dual Sensing: Probing Recoherence and Lifecycles of Local Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation (BHSI) addresses the quantum measurement problem by preserving unitary quantum evolution without postulating a many-worlds ontology. Its central concept is the Local Hilbert Space (LHS), an operationally isolated island of coherence within which measurement dynamics are confined. This paper develops BHSI across both experimental and conceptual frontiers. Experimentally, we propose a three-stage dual-sensing Stern-Gerlach interferometer (SGI) designed to probe the fuzzy spatiotemporal boundaries associated with LHS transitions. Stage 1 targets uncommitted timing events, manifested as sensor-detector mismatches; Stage 2 investigates conditional recoherence, a signature distinguishing time-extended local branching from instantaneous collapse or global splitting; and Stage 3 employs controlled electromagnetic phase shifts to discriminate between unitary and retrocausal recoherence mechanisms. Conceptually, we introduce the lifecycle of LHSs, describing how coherent domains emerge, persist, and fragment across physical scales. We ground this ontology in established physical precedents, drawing analogies between fuzzy LHS boundaries and phenomenological bag models in quantum field theory, and between the fragmentation of a primordial global Hilbert space in the early Universe and the fragmentation of Hilbert space in many-body systems. Together, these developments show that BHSI provides a unified, testable description of the transition from quantum inseparability to classical separability within a single physical reality.</description>

      <title>Statistics-encoded tensor network approach in disordered quantum many-body spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of quantum many-body systems with disorder is a fundamental challenge. In this work, we propose a general approach -- the statistics-encoded tensor network (SeTN) -- to study such systems. By encoding disorder into an auxiliary layer and averaging separately, SeTN restores translational invariance, enabling a well-defined transfer matrix formulation. We derive a universal criterion, $n \gg \alpha^2 t^2$, linking discretization $n$, disorder strength $\alpha$, and evolution duration $t$. This sets the resolution required for faithful disorder averaging and shows that encoding is most efficient in the weak-disorder, typically chaotic regime. Applied to the disordered transverse-field Ising model, SeTN shows that the spectral form factor is governed by the leading transfer-matrix eigenvalue, in contrast to the kicked Ising model. SeTN thus provides a novel framework for probing the disorder-driven dynamical phenomena in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A method of an on-demand beamsplitter for trapped-ion quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information processing using local modes of trapped ions has been applied to implementing bosonic quantum error correction codes and conducting efficient quantum simulation of bosonic systems. However, control of entanglement among local modes remains difficult because entanglement among resonant local modes is governed by the Coulomb interaction, which is not switchable. We propose a method of a beamsplitter for a trapped-ion architecture, where the secular frequency of each mode is dynamically controllable. The neighboring modes are far detuned except when the beamsplitter needs to be applied to them. We derive the analytical formula of the proposed procedure and numerically confirm its validity.</description>

      <title>Structures in higher-order quantum correlations due to non-spatial symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum nonlinear spectroscopy (QNS) via a quantum sensor can access $2^{n-1}$ types of $n$-th order contour-time-ordered correlations (CTOCs) arising from different orderings of quantum operators, while classical nonlinear spectroscopy can detect only one in each order. QNS and its classical counterpart have similar spatial symmetry properties, but they are expected to have characteristically different non-spatial symmetry properties since different orderings of operators can behave differently under non-spatial transformations (such as exchange of operators). Here, we investigate how higher-order correlations extracted by QNS are constrained by non-spatial symmetries, including particle-hole (C), time-reversal (T), chiral (S) symmetry, and time translation symmetry. We find that the generalized C-symmetry imposes special selection rules on QNS, and the generalized T- and S-symmetry relate CTOCs to out-of-time-order correlations (OTOCs). The time translation symmetry leads to a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the spectra of higher-order CTOCs and OTOCs. This work discloses deep structures in higher-order quantum correlations due to non-spatial symmetries and provides access to certain types of OTOCs that are not directly observable.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Principle from Operator Asymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle is fundamentally rooted in the algebraic asymmetry between observables. We introduce a new class of uncertainty relations grounded in the resource theory of asymmetry, where incompatibility is quantified by an observable's intrinsic, state-independent capacity to break the symmetry associated with another. This ``operator asymmetry,'' formalized as the incompatibility norm, leads to a variance-based uncertainty relation for pure states that can be tighter than the standard Robertson bound. Most significantly, this framework resolves a long-standing open problem in quantum information theory: the formulation of a universally valid, product-form uncertainty relation for the Wigner-Yanase skew information. We demonstrate the practical power of our framework by deriving tighter quantum speed limits for the dynamics of nearly conserved quantities, which are crucial for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena such as prethermalization and many-body localization. This work provides both a new conceptual lens for understanding quantum uncertainty and a powerful, versatile toolkit for its application.</description>

      <title>Statistical Quantum Mechanics of the Random Permutation Sorting System (RPSS): A Self-Stabilizing True Uniform RNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Random Permutation Sorting System (RPSS), a novel framework for true uniform randomness generation grounded in statistical quantum mechanics. RPSS is built on a pair of conjugate observables, the permutation count and the elapsed sorting time, whose heavy-tailed raw distributions synchronously converge to uniformity through modular reduction. This mathematically proven convergence establishes RPSS as a True Uniform Random Number Generator (TURNG). A practical implementation, QPP-RNG, demonstrates how intrinsic system jitter, arising from microarchitectural noise, memory latency, and scheduling dynamics, interacts with combinatorial complexity to yield a compact, self-stabilizing entropy source. Empirical validation under the NIST SP 800-90B framework confirms rapid entropy convergence and statistically uniform outputs. RPSS thus defines a new class of quantum-inspired entropy engines, where randomness is simultaneously harvested from unpredictable system jitter and amplified by combinatorial processes, offering a robust, platform-independent alternative to conventional entropy sources.</description>

      <title>Solving Linear Systems of Equations with the Quantum HHL Algorithm: A Tutorial on the Physical and Mathematical Foundations for Undergraduate Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing enables the efficient resolution of complex problems, often outperforming classical methods across various applications. In 2009, Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd proposed an algorithm for solving linear systems of equations, demonstrating exponential speedup (under ideal conditions) with a complexity of $poly(\log N)$, in contrast to classical approaches, which in the general case exhibit a complexity of $O(N^3)$, although they can achieve $O(N)$ in specific cases involving sparse matrices. This algorithm holds promise for advancements in machine learning, the solution of differential equations, linear regression, and cryptographic analysis. However, its structure is intricate, and there is a notable lack of detailed instructional materials in the literature. In this context, this paper presents a tutorial addressing the physical and mathematical foundations of the HHL algorithm, aimed at undergraduate students, explaining its theoretical construction and its implementation for solving linear equation systems. After discussing the underlying mathematical and physical concepts, we present numerical examples that illustrate the evolution of the quantum circuit. Finally, the algorithm's complexity, limitations, and future prospects are analyzed. The examples are compared with their classical simulations, allowing for an operational assessment of the algorithm's performance.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy and its Transition in the Coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement and quantum magic are two distinct fundamental resources that enable quantum systems to exhibit complex phenomena beyond the capabilities of classical computer simulations. While quantum entanglement has been extensively used to characterize both equilibrium and dynamical phases, the study of quantum magic, typically quantified by the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE), remains largely limited to numerical simulations of moderate system sizes. In this Letter, we establish a general framework for analyzing the SRE in solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models in the large-$N$ limit, which enables the application of the saddle-point approximation. Applying this method to the Maldacena-Qi coupled SYK model, we identify a series of first-order transitions of the SRE as the temperature is tuned. In particular, we uncover an intrinsic transition of the SRE that cannot be detected through thermodynamic quantities. We also discuss the theoretical understanding of the SRE in both the high-temperature and low-temperature limits. Our results pave the way for studying the SRE in strongly correlated fermionic systems in the thermodynamic limit and suggest a new class of transitions for which the SRE serves as an order parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microwave-optical transducers and quantum memories are fundamental components of quantum repeaters, essential for developing a quantum internet in which solid-state quantum computers serve as nodes interconnected by optical fibers for data transmission. Although both technologies have made significant advancements, the integration of microwave-optical conversion and quantum memory functionalities remains a challenge. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a memoryenhanced quantum microwave-optical transduction using a Rydberg ensemble. By utilizing a cascaded electromagnetically induced transparency process, we store microwave photons in a highly excited collective state and subsequently convert them into optical photons during the retrieval process. Taking advantage of the optical depth with order of millions for microwave photons in Rydberg ensemble, combined with a minimal storage dephasing rate at the single-photon level, the transducer achieves an areanormalized storage efficiency greater than 90%, a bandwidth of 2.1 MHz, and a noise equivalent temperature as low as 26 K, even in cavity-free conditions. Our findings pave the way for the practical implementation of quantum repeaters based on atomic ensembles in quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive analytical results for continuous-time quantum walks from a new class of initial states with tunable delocalization. The dynamics are governed by a Hamiltonian with complex hopping amplitudes. We provide closed-form equations for key observables, revealing three notable findings: (1) the emergence of directed quantum transport from completely unbiased initial conditions; (2) a quantum backfire effect, where greater initial delocalization enhances short-time spreading but counterintuitively induces a comparatively smaller long-time spreading after a crossing time $t_{\mathrm{cross}}$; and (3) an exact characterization of survival probability, showing that the transition to an enhanced $t^{-3}$ decay is a fine-tuned effect. Our work establishes a comprehensive framework for controlling quantum transport through the interplay between intermediate initial delocalization and Hamiltonian phase.</description>

Abstract: Recently, bicycle-sharing systems have been implemented in numerous cities, becoming integral to daily life. However, a prevalent issue arises when intensive commuting demand leads to bicycle shortages in specific areas and at particular times. To address this challenge, we employ a novel quantum machine learning model that analyzes time series data by fitting quantum time evolution to observed sequences. This model enables us to capture actual trends in bicycle counts at individual ports and identify correlations between different ports. Utilizing the trained model, we simulate the impact of proactively adding bicycles to high-demand ports on the overall rental number across the system. Given that the core of this method lies in a Monte Carlo simulation, it is anticipated to have a wide range of industrial applications.</description>

Abstract: We offer a fresh perspective on the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics as a way of thinking about the world described by quantum theory based on quantifiable notions of information. This allows us to provide a definition of a relative fact, with no addition to orthodox quantum theory and no fundamentally special role for observers. By associating perspectives with commutative observables rather than entire quantum systems, several previous problems with the interpretation are dissolved. As a side result, we show how a quantum measurement, properly described, is a continuous process.</description>

      <title>Cryo-CMOS Antenna for Wireless Communications within a Quantum Computer Cryostat</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling quantum computers from a few qubits to large numbers remains one of the critical challenges in realizing practical quantum advantage. Multi-core quantum architectures have emerged as a promising solution, enabling scalability through distributed quantum processing units (QPUs) interconnected via classical and quantum links. However, the bottleneck of wired connections persists, as densely packed wired interconnects, both vertically across temperature stages and horizontally within the same layer, introduce spatial constraints, power dissipation, and latency, which could hinder performance as the number of QPUs increases. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a cryo-compatible on-chip differential dipole antenna operating at 28 GHz to enable short-range wireless communication within a quantum computer cryostat. Temperature-dependent material properties are incorporated to accurately capture antenna behavior at 4 K. Moreover, by embedding the antenna in a realistic cryostat structure, we evaluate the feasibility of antenna operation within the cryogenic environment. The proposed antenna achieves a reflection coefficient of -20.8 dB in free space and -18.38 dB within the cryostat, demonstrating efficient impedance matching.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce ParaToric, a C++ package for simulating the toric code in a parallel field (i.e., $X$- and $Z$-fields) at finite temperature. We implement and extend the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithm of Wu, Deng, and Prokof'ev on the square, triangular, honeycomb, and cubic lattices with either open or periodic boundaries. The package is expandable to arbitrary lattice geometries and custom observables diagonal in either the $X$- or $Z$-basis. ParaToric also supports snapshot extraction in both bases, making it ideal for generating training/benchmarking data for other methods, such as lattice gauge theories, cold atom or other quantum simulators, quantum spin liquids, artificial intelligence, and quantum error correction. The software provides bindings to C/C++ and Python, and is thus almost universally integrable into other software projects.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing an Optimal Spin Qubit Shuttling Bus Architecture for the Surface Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum computers scale toward millions of physical qubits, it becomes essential to robustly encode individual logical qubits to ensure fault tolerance under realistic noise. A high-quality foundational encoding allows future compilation techniques and heuristics to build on optimal or near-optimal layouts, improving scalability and error resilience. In this work, we synthesize a one-dimensional shuttling bus architecture for the rotated surface code, leveraging coherent spin-qubit shuttling, following a novel methodology we name Quantum Reverse Mapping. We formulate a mixed-integer optimization model that yields optimal solutions with relatively low execution time for small code distances, and propose a scalable heuristic that matches optimal results while maintaining linear computational complexity. We evaluate the synthesized architecture using architectural metrics, such as shuttling distance and cycle time, and full quantum simulations under realistic noise models, showing that the proposed design can sustain logical error rates as low as $2\times 10^{-10}$ per round at code distance 21, showcasing its feasibility for scalable quantum error correction in spin-based quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Self-Configuring Quantum Networks with Superposition of Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum networks are a backbone of future quantum technologies thanks to their role in communication and scalable quantum computing. However, their performance is challenged by noise and decoherence. We propose a self-configuring approach that integrates superposed quantum paths with variational quantum optimization techniques. This allows networks to dynamically optimize the superposition of noisy paths across multiple nodes to establish high-fidelity connections between different parties. Our framework is in principle capable of adapting to unknown noise without requiring detailed characterization or benchmarking of the corresponding quantum channels. We also discuss the role of vacuum coherence, a quantum effect central to path superposition that impacts protocol performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach remains beneficial even in the presence of imperfections in the generation of path superposition.</description>

      <title>Van Hove singularities in stabilizer entropy densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The probability distribution of a measure of non-stabilizerness, also known as magic, is investigated for Haar-random pure quantum states. Focusing on the stabilizer R\'enyi entropies, the associated probability density functions (PDFs) are found to display distinct non-analytic features analogous to Van Hove singularities in condensed matter systems. For a single qubit, the stabilizer purity exhibits a logarithmic divergence at a critical value corresponding to a saddle point on the Bloch sphere. This divergence occurs at the $|H\rangle$-magic states, which hence can be identified as states for which the density of non-stabilizerness in the Hilbert space is infinite. An exact expression for the PDF is derived for the case $\alpha = 2$, with analytical predictions confirmed by numerical simulations. The logarithmic divergence disappears for dimensions $d \ge 3$, in agreement with the behavior of ordinary Van Hove singularities on flat manifolds. In addition, it is shown that, for one qubit, the linear stabilizer entropy is directly related to the partial incompatibility of quantum measurements, one of the defining properties of quantum mechanics, at the basis of Stern-Gerlach experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian $\mathrm{sl}(3, \mathbb{C})$ three-mode couplers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic systems with exceptional points, where eigenvalues and corresponding eigenstates coalesce, have attracted interest due to their topological features and enhanced sensitivity to external perturbations. Non-Hermitian mode-coupling matrices provide a tractable analytic framework to model gain, loss, and chirality across optical, electronic, and mechanical platforms without the complexity of full open-system dynamics. Exceptional points define their spectral topology, and enable applications in mode control, amplification, and sensing. Yet $N$-mode couplers, the minimal setting for $N$th-order exceptional points, are often studied in specific designs that overlook their algebraic structure. We introduce a general $\mathrm{sl}(N,\mathbb{C})$ framework for arbitrary $N$-mode couplers in classical and quantum regimes, and develop it explicitly for $N=3$. This case admits algebraic diagonalization, where a propagation-dependent gauge aligns local and dynamical spectra and reveals the geometric phase connecting adiabatic and exact propagation. An exact Wei--Norman propagator captures the full dynamics and makes crossing exceptional points explicit. Our framework enables classification of coupler families. We study the family spanning $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and non-Hermitian cyclic couplers, where two exceptional points of order three lie within a continuum of exceptional points of order two, ruling out pure encircling. As an application, we study these exceptional points for a lossy three-leg beam splitter and reveal its propagation dynamics as a function of initial states, such as Fock and NOON states. Our approach provides a systematic route to analyze non-Hermitian mode couplers and guide design in classical and quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Circuit Fidelity in Transmon Qubit Rings via Operation Duration Tuning under Strong Connectivity Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting transmon qubits are a promising platform for quantum computation, yet they face significant fidelity degradation due to connectivity noise, particularly in the intermediate coupling regime where noise levels are substantial. While prior works suggest that high fidelity requires operating in regimes with strongly suppressed noise, maintaining such conditions under practical experimental constraints remains challenging. To address this, we investigate quantum gate operations in fully connected transmon rings, examining both SWAP and general circuits. Our study reveals that fidelity can be significantly enhanced by tuning gate operation durations, with local maxima emerging even under strong noise conditions. These fidelity enhancements occur consistently across different qubit numbers and operation types, and for specific initial states -- particularly those with favorable symmetry or entanglement properties -- the achieved fidelities approach quantum error correction thresholds. Furthermore, we develop a supervised machine learning model that accurately predicts the optimal operation durations for new devices, enabling efficient optimization without extensive experimental simulations. These results provide a pathway toward robust quantum circuit design in noisy experimental environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate an experimental scheme to engineer thermal baths with independently tunable temperatures and dissipation rates for the motional modes of a trapped-ion system. This approach enables robust thermal-state preparation and quantum simulations of open-system dynamics in bosonic and spin-boson models at well-controlled finite temperatures. We benchmark our protocol by experimentally realizing out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a charge-transfer model at different temperatures. We observe that, when the process occurs at a higher temperature, the transfer rate spectrum broadens, with reduced rates at small donor-acceptor energy gaps and enhanced rates at large gaps. We then employ our scheme to study local-temperature effects in a two-mode vibrationally assisted exciton transfer system, where we observe thermally activated interference pathways for excitation transfer.</description>

      <title>Enhanced shortcuts to adiabaticity for coherent atom transport in a family of two-dimensional dynamical optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In view of the compelling need for coherent atom transport as a prerequisite for a variety of emerging quantum technologies, we investigate such transport on the example of an adjustable family of two-dimensional optical lattices [L. Tarruell {\em et al.}, Nature (London) {\bf 483}, 302 (2012)] that includes square, honeycomb, dimerized, and 1D-chains lattices as its special cases; dynamical optical lattices of this type have already been utilized for the demonstration of topological pumping and the realization of two-qubit quantum gates with neutral atoms. At the outset, we propose the appropriate arrangements of acousto-optic modulators that give rise to a frequency imbalance between counterpropagating laser beams, thus leading to the dynamical-lattice effect in an arbitrary direction in the lattice plane. We subsequently obtain the dynamical-lattice trajectories that enable atom transport in the lattices under consideration using two classes of control schemes: (i) shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) in the form of inverse engineering based on a dynamical invariant of Lewis-Riesenfeld type, and (ii) their modification, known as enhanced STA (eSTA), which is well-suited for the treatment of anharmonic trapping potentials. We then quantify the resulting atom dynamics using transport fidelities computed from the numerical solutions of the relevant time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equations. By doing so for various choices of the system parameters and transport directions, we demonstrate that -- except in the special case of the dimerized lattice -- the eSTA method consistently outperforms its STA counterpart, both in terms of the achievable transport times and the robustness of the resulting transport against small variations of optical-lattice depths.</description>

      <title>Exact Factorization of Unitary Transformations with Spin-Adapted Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preserving spin symmetry in variational quantum algorithms is essential for producing physically meaningful electronic wavefunctions. Implementing spin-adapted transformations on quantum hardware, however, is challenging because the corresponding fermionic generators translate into noncommuting Pauli operators. In this work, we introduce an exact and computationally efficient factorization of spin-adapted unitaries derived from fermionic double excitation and deexcitation rotations. These unitaries are expressed as ordered products of exponentials of Pauli operators. Our method exploits the fact that the elementary operators in these generators form small Lie algebras. By working in the adjoint representation of these algebras, we reformulate the factorization problem as a low-dimensional nonlinear optimization over matrix exponentials. This approach enables precise numerical reparametrization of the unitaries without relying on symbolic manipulations. The proposed factorization provides a practical strategy for constructing symmetry-conserving quantum circuits within variational algorithms. It preserves spin symmetry by design, reduces implementation cost, and ensures the accurate representation of electronic states in quantum simulations of molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Phase-Coherence Compensation for Superconducting Qubits Integrated Computational and Hardware Validation of the Aurora Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an emulator-based and hardware feasibility study of Aurora-DD, a phase-coherence compensation method that integrates a sign-based feedback update of a global phase offset (Delta phi) with a fixed-depth XY8 dynamical decoupling (DD) scaffold. The feedback optimization is performed offline on a calibrated emulator and the resulting Delta phi* is deployed as pre-calibrated phase compensation on hardware. This represents an "offline closed-loop, online open-loop" feasibility demonstration. Using an Aer-based emulator calibrated with ibm_fez device parameters, Aurora-DD achieves substantial reductions in mean-squared error of the measured expectation value &lt;Z&gt;, yielding 68-97% improvement across phase settings phi = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 over n=30 randomized trials. These large-n emulator results provide statistically stable evidence that the combined effect of XY8 and Delta phi* suppresses both dephasing and systematic phase bias. On real superconducting hardware (ibm_fez), we perform a small-sample (n=3) multi-phase validation campaign. Aurora-DD yields point estimates corresponding to approximately 99.2-99.6% reduction in absolute error relative to a no-DD baseline across all tested phase points. These hardware numbers are reported transparently as feasibility evidence under tight queue and credit constraints. In contrast, the auxiliary Aurora+ZNE branch exhibits instability: shallow two-point ZNE occasionally amplifies calibration inconsistencies and produces large error outliers. We therefore relegate ZNE analysis to the Appendix and position Aurora-DD (without ZNE) as the primary contribution. Overall, the combined results support pre-calibrated Aurora-DD as a practical, stable, and hardware-compatible phase-coherence compensator for NISQ devices in single-qubit settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Hall's exact uncertainty relation acquires a simple geometric form in the Krylov basis generated by the Liouvillian. In this canonical operator frame, the uncertainty equality implies that the operator amplitude vector evolves on the unit Krylov sphere with constant speed fixed solely by the first Lanczos coefficient. This yields an exact linear bound on geometric operator evolution, independent of higher Lanczos coefficients and valid for arbitrary Hamiltonians, integrable or chaotic. Our results provide the first unified geometric interpretation of exact quantum speed limits and operator growth, identifying the first Lanczos coefficient as the intrinsic speed scale of quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: A Non-Hermitian Pilot-Wave Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03567v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (de Broglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf 1^2[\mathcal C]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. All physical predictions are local scale invariant, even in the presence of mass terms. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schr\"odinger and Pauli equations, and for the Dirac equation in curved spacetime, each coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique. Our results provide a pivotal understanding of local scale invariance in quantum theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the ground-state energy of a quantum system is one of the most promising applications for quantum algorithms. Here we propose a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) \emph{Ansatz} for finding ground state configuration interaction (CI) wavefunctions. We map CI for fermions to a quantum circuit using a subspace superposition, then apply diagonal Walsh operators to encode the wavefunction. The algorithm can be used to solve both full CI and selected CI wavefunctions, resuling in exact and near-exact solutions for electronic ground states. Both the subspace selection and wavefunction \emph{Ansatz} can be applied to any Hamiltonian that can be written in a qubit basis. The algorithm bypasses costly classical matrix diagonalizations, which is advantageous for large-scale applications. We demonstrate results for several molecules using quantum simulators and hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing requires extremely precise knowledge and control of qubit dynamics during the application of a gate. We develop a data-driven learning protocol for characterizing quantum gates that builds off previous work on learning the Nakajima-Mori-Zwanzig (NMZ) formulation of open system dynamics from time series data, which allows detailed reconstruction of quantum evolution, including non-Markovian dynamics. We demonstrate this learning technique on three different systems: a simulation of a qubit whose dynamics are purely Markovian, a simulation of a driven qubit coupled to stochastic noise produced by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and trapped-ion experimental data of a driven qubit whose noise environment is not characterized ahead of time. Our technique is able to learn the generators of time evolution, or the NMZ operators, in all three cases and can learn the timescale in which the qubit dynamics can no longer be accurately described by a purely Markovian model. Our technique complements existing quantum gate characterization methods such as gate set tomography by explicitly capturing non-Markovianity in the gate generator, thus allowing for more thorough diagnosis of noise sources.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate superadditivity of one-shot zero-error classical capacity in an asymmetric communication setting where a noisy classical channel is used in parallel with a perfect quantum channel. Each channel individually supports only a fixed number of perfectly distinguishable messages. Their joint use enables transmission of strictly more messages than permitted by the product of the individual capacities. We present explicit constructions achieving this enhancement and establish that replacing the perfect quantum channel with a perfect classical channel eliminates the effect. Finally, we identify a structural criterion on the noisy channel governing this effect and show that the quantum advantage is rooted in Kochen-Specker contextuality.</description>

Abstract: Quantum annealing is typically regarded as a tool for combinatorial optimization, but its coherent dynamics also offer potential for machine learning. We present a model that encodes classical data into an Ising Hamiltonian, evolves it on a quantum annealer, and uses the resulting probability distributions as feature maps for classification. Experiments on the quantum annealer machine with the Digits dataset, together with simulations on MNIST, demonstrate that short annealing times yield higher classification accuracy, while longer times reduce accuracy but lower sampling costs.

      <title>Disentanglement by deranking and by suppression of correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spontaneous disentanglement hypothesis is motivated by some outstanding issues in standard quantum mechanics, including the problem of quantum measurement. The current study compares between some possible methods that can be used to implement the hypothesis. Disentanglement is formulated using a nonlinear operator, which can be used to modify both the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the quantum state vector, and the master equation for the density operator. Two types of nonlinear disentanglement operators are explored. The first one gives rise to matrix deranking, and the second one to correlation suppression. Both types are demonstrated using a two spin system that is driven close to the Hartmann--Hahn double resonance. It is shown that limit cycle steady state solutions, which are excluded by standard quantum mechanics, become possible in the presence of disentanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce post-selection games, a generalization of nonlocal games where each round can be not only won or lost by the players, but also discarded by the referee. Such games naturally formalize possibilistic proofs of nonlocality, such as Hardy's paradox. We develop algorithms for computing the local and Tsirelson bounds of post-selection games. Furthermore, we show that they have an unbounded advantage in statistical power over traditional nonlocal games, making them ideally suited for analysing Bell tests with low detection efficiency.</description>

      <title>Entangled photon pair excitation and time-frequency filtered multidimensional photon correlation spectroscopy as a probe for dissipative exciton kinetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In molecular aggregates, multiple delocalized exciton states interact with phonons, making the state-resolved spectroscopic monitoring of dynamics challenging. We propose a protocol that combines photon-entanglement-enhanced narrowband excitation of two-exciton states with time-frequency-filtered two-photon coincidence counting. This approach alleviates bottlenecks associated with probing exciton dynamics spread across multiple spectral and temporal windows. We demonstrate that non-classical correlations of entangled photon pairs can be used to prepare narrowband two-exciton population distributions, thereby circumventing transport in mediating one-exciton states. The evolution of these population distributions and cascading transitions can be monitored using time-frequency-filtered photon coincidence counting. Numerical simulations for a light-harvesting aggregate highlight the ability of this protocol to achieve selectivity by suppressing or amplifying specific pathways. Combining entangled photonic sources with multidimensional photon correlation spectroscopy allows promising applications in spectroscopy and sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a network, the vertices with similar characteristics construct communities. The vertices in a community are well-connected. Detecting the communities in a network is a challenging and important problem in the theory of complex networks. One approach to solving this problem uses the classical random walks on graphs. In quantum computing, quantum walks are the quantum mechanical counterparts of classical random walks. In this article, we employ a variant of Szegedy's quantum walk to develop a procedure for discovering the communities in networks. The limiting probability distribution of quantum walks assists us in determining the inclusion of a vertex in a community. We apply our community detection procedure to a variety of graphs and social networks, including the relaxed caveman graph, $l$-partition graph, Karate club graph, and the dolphin's social network, among others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum theory encounters a difficulty when attempting to describe recording devices. If the recording is of events in which quantum uncertainty plays a role, such as an experiment on a quantum system, quantum theory is unable to correctly predict the probabilities of both future and past states of the recording. The nature of this difficulty will be laid out at the outset. A resolution then will be presented, in which the Born rule will be lightly amended so as to correctly predict all probabilities. The resolution will have the further benefit of clarifying how quantum theory applies to an array of situations in which the theory can be ambiguous, such as the descriptions of continuous measurements, and of closed systems containing all observers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Generation via test-time learning with large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate structured artifacts, but using them as dependable optimizers for scientific design requires a mechanism for iterative improvement under black-box evaluation. Here, we cast quantum circuit synthesis as a closed-loop, test-time optimization problem: an LLM proposes edits to a fixed-length gate list, and an external simulator evaluates the resulting state with the Meyer-Wallach (MW) global entanglement measure. We introduce a lightweight test-time learning recipe that can reuse prior high-performing candidates as an explicit memory trace, augments prompts with a score-difference feedback, and applies restart-from-the-best sampling to escape potential plateaus. Across fixed 20-qubit settings, the loop without feedback and restart-from-the-best improves random initial circuits over a range of gate budgets. To lift up this performance and success rate, we use the full learning strategy. For the 25-qubit, it mitigates a pronounced performance plateau when naive querying is used. Beyond raw scores, we analyze the structure of synthesized states and find that high MW solutions can correspond to stabilizer or graph-state-like constructions, but full connectivity is not guaranteed due to the metric property and prompt design. These results illustrate both the promise and the pitfalls of memory evaluator-guided LLM optimization for circuit synthesis, highlighting the critical role of prior human-made theoretical theorems to optimally design a custom tool in support of research.</description>

      <title>Learning fermionic linear optics with Heisenberg scaling and physical operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of learning fermionic linear optics (FLO), also known as fermionic Gaussian unitaries. Given black-box query access to an unknown FLO, previous proposals required $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^5 / \varepsilon^2)$ queries, where $n$ is the system size and $\varepsilon$ is the error in diamond distance. These algorithms also use unphysical operations (i.e., violating fermionic superselection rules) and/or $n$ auxiliary modes to prepare Choi states of the FLO. In this work, we establish efficient and experimentally friendly protocols that obey superselection, use minimal ancilla (at most $1$ extra mode), and exhibit improved dependence on both parameters $n$ and $\varepsilon$. For arbitrary (active) FLOs this algorithm makes at most $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^4 / \varepsilon)$ queries, while for number-conserving (passive) FLOs we show that $\mathcal{O}(n^3 / \varepsilon)$ queries suffice. The complexity of the active case can be further reduced to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^3 / \varepsilon)$ at the cost of using $n$ ancilla. This marks the first FLO learning algorithm that attains Heisenberg scaling in precision. As a side result, we also demonstrate an improved copy complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n \eta^2 / \varepsilon^2)$ for time-efficient state tomography of $\eta$-particle Slater determinants in $\varepsilon$ trace distance, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Matrix multiplication is a fundamental classical computing operation whose efficiency becomes a major challenge at scale, especially for machine learning applications. Quantum computing, with its inherent parallelism and exponential storage capacity, offers a potential solution to these limitations. This work presents a quantum kernel-based matrix multiplication algorithm (QKMM) that achieves an asymptotically optimal computational complexity of $ O(N^2 \log_2 N) $, outperforming the classical optimal complexity of $ O(N^{2.371552}) $, where $N$ denotes the matrix dimension. Through noiseless and noisy quantum simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only exhibits superior theoretical efficiency but also shows practical advantages in runtime performance and stability.</description>

      <title>Integrating AI and Quantum-Inspired Techniques for Efficient Enzyme Fermentation Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new method that combines Artificial Intelligence (AI) and quantum-inspired techniques to improve the efficiency of multi-variable optimization experiments. By using advanced software simulations, this approach significantly reduces the time and cost compared to traditional physical experiments. The research focuses on enzyme fermentation, demonstrating that this method can achieve better results with fewer experiments. The findings highlight the potential of this approach to more effectively identify optimal formulations, leading to advancements in enzyme fermentation and other fields that require complex optimization. Initially, the Active Ingredients (AIN) could not be improved even after 600 experiments. However, by adopting the method outlined in this paper, we were able to identify a better formula in just 405 experiments. This resulted in an increase of AIN from 8481 to 10068, representing an improvement of 18.7%.</description>

      <title>Super-Tonks-Girardeau Quench in the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10910v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a quench from a one-dimensional gas with strong and repulsive local interactions to a strongly attractive one, known as the super-Tonks-Girardeau effect. By incorporating both an optical lattice and non-local interactions (specifically nearest-neighbor), we discover a previously unexplored phenomenon: the disruption of the state during the quench, but within a specific range of interactions. Our study employs the extended Bose-Hubbard model across various system sizes, starting with analytical results for two atoms and progressing to few-body systems using exact diagonalization, DMRG and TDVP methods. Finally, we use a numerical implementation of the local density approximation for a macroscopic number of atoms. Consistently, our findings unveil a region where the initially self-bound structure expands due to the super-Tonks-Girardeau quench. The fast evaporation provides a tool to characterize the phase diagram in state-of-art experiments exploring the physics of the extended Bose-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Curve fitting on a quantum annealer for an advanced navigation method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the applicability of quantum annealing to the approximation task of curve fitting. To this end, we consider a function that shall approximate a given set of data points and is written as a finite linear combination of standardized functions, e.g., orthogonal polynomials. Consequently, the decision variables subject to optimization are the coefficients of that expansion. Although this task can be accomplished classically, it can also be formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem, which is suited to be solved with quantum annealing. Given the size of the problem stays below a certain threshold, we find that quantum annealing yields comparable results to the classical solution. Regarding a real-world use case, we discuss the problem to find an optimized speed profile for a vessel using the framework of dynamic programming and outline how the aforementioned approximation task can be put into play. Similar to the curve fitting task, our findings indicate that quantum annealing is currently only feasible if the routing problem is modeled sufficiently small and sparse.</description>

      <title>Creative and geometric times in physics, mathematics, logic, and philosophy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We distinguish two different concepts of time that play a role in physics: \textit{geometric time} and \textit{creative time}. The former is the time of deterministic physics and merely parametrizes a given evolution. The latter is instead characterized by real change, i.e. novel information that gets created when a non-necessary event becomes determinate in a fundamentally indeterministic physics. This allows one to give a naturalistic characterization of the present as the moment that separates the potential future from the determinate past. We discuss how these two concepts find natural applications in classical and intuitionistic mathematics, respectively, and in classical and intuitionistic logic, as well as how they relate to the well-known A- and B-theories in the philosophy of time. We acknowledge that we do not offer here a unified concept or a new philosophy of time. However, we contend that none of the existing philosophical accounts fully integrate both the geometric and creative concepts of time.</description>

      <title>Does connected wedge imply distillable entanglement?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ryu-Takayanagi formula predicts that two boundary subsystems $A$ and $C$ can exhibit large mutual information $I(A:C)$ even when they are spatially disconnected on the boundary and separated by a buffer subsystem $B$, as long as $A$ and $C$ have connected entanglement wedge in the bulk. However, whether the reduced state $\rho_{AC}$ contains distillable EPR pairs has remained a longstanding open problem. In this work, we resolve this problem by showing that: i) there is no LO-distillable entanglement at leading order in $G_N$, suggesting the absence of bipartite entanglement in a holographic mixed state $\rho_{AC}$, and ii) one-shot, one-way LOCC-distillable entanglement is given at leading order by locally accessible information $J^W(A|C)$, which is related to the entanglement wedge cross section $E^W$ involving the (third) purifying system $B$ via $J^W(A|C) = S_A - E^W(A:B)$. Namely, we demonstrate that a connected entanglement wedge does not necessarily imply nonzero distillable entanglement in one-shot, one-way LOCC. We also show that entanglement of formation $E_{F}(A:C)$ is given by $E^W(A:C)$ at leading order in holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the future and left Rindler wedges of Minkowski spacetime are entangled, leading to the Unruh effect. Similarly, the past and right Rindler wedges are also entangled. We propose a protocol to extract this entanglement using two two-state detectors located in the past and right Rindler wedges. By scaling the detector transition frequencies inversely with Minkowski time, entanglement from the quantum field is transferred to the detectors, suggesting they may support quantum teleportation via the vacuum. Our protocol can be implemented with current quantum systems, such as flux-tunable transmon qubits. This research provides new insights into the entanglement properties of spacetime and hints at practical applications for secure quantum information transfer using the vacuum state of a quantum field.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional extended Hubbard model coupled with an optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model coupled with an optical cavity, which describes an interplay of the effect of vacuum fluctuation of light and the quantum phase transition between the charge- and spin-density-wave phases. The ground state and excitation spectrum of the model are calculated by numerically exact tensor-network methods. We find that the photon number of the ground state is enhanced (suppressed) along the quantum phase transition line when the light-matter coupling is comparable to (much smaller than) the cavity frequency. We also show that the exciton peak in the optical conductivity and photon spectrum that exists without the cavity exhibits the vacuum Rabi splitting at resonance due to the light-matter interaction. This behavior is in contrast to the case without excitons, where the photon spectrum is merely broadened without splitting due to the lack of a sharp resonance.</description>

      <title>Tightening the thermodynamic uncertainty relations with null-entropy events: What we learn when nothing happens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems establish that thermodynamic processes at the microscale can occasionally result in negative entropy production. At the microscale, another distinct possibility becomes more likely: processes where no entropy is produced overall. In this work, we explore the constraints imposed by such null-entropy events on the fluctuations of thermodynamic currents. By incorporating the probability of null-entropy events, we obtain tighter bounds on finite-time thermodynamic uncertainty relations derived from fluctuation theorems. We validate this framework using an example of a qudit SWAP engine.</description>

      <title>Zero Indirect Band Gap in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero indirect gaps in band models are typically viewed as unstable and achievable only through fine-tuning. Recent works, however, have revealed robust semimetallic phases in Hermitian systems where the indirect gap remains pinned at zero over a finite parameter range. Here, we extend this paradigm to non-Hermitian lattice models by studying a one-dimensional diamond-like system with gain and loss. We show that the zero indirect band gap in the real part of the spectrum remains stable in the presence of non-Hermitian perturbations and identify the parameter regime in which this robustness persists. We find that the appearance of the zero indirect gap coincides with the suppression of the non-Hermitian skin effect. Our results reveal new connections between indirect gaps, exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effect, opening avenues for experimental realizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fraunhofer diffraction plays a vital role in experimental physics not only because it accurately describes the behaviour of light in the usual propagation limit, but also because it links the diffracted light with the scattering object through one of the most important mathematical transformations in physics: the Fourier transform. Acting as a probe in material characterisation as well as used as a tool for particle trapping or sensing, the pattern of interference maxima resulting from the Fraunhofer diffraction through periodic scattering is an ubiquitous routine. In this paper we analyse the Fraunhofer diffraction resulting from the much less studied aperiodic scatter of the light. We provide general conditions for the experimental observation of the peaks of interference maxima featured into patterns that display periodic structures on a number of distance scales. Our theoretical analysis is supported by thorough experimental demonstrations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the distribution of single-photon-level pulses from a mode-locked laser source over a phase-stable fiber link, achieving an optical timing jitter of less than 100 as over 10 minutes of data accumulation. This stability enables a fidelity greater than 0.998 between two stabilized 2.1 km long deployed fiber links. Building on time and frequency metrology techniques traditionally used for high-stability optical atomic clock signal distribution, we use time and frequency multiplexing to achieve an isolation of quantum and classical channels of $8 \times 10^{10}$. Our results mark a necessary step towards scalable, high-rate quantum networks with a provable quantum advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor network methods strike a middle ground between fully-fledged quantum computing and classical computing, as they take inspiration from quantum systems to significantly speed up certain classical operations. Their strength lies in their compressive power and the wide variety of efficient algorithms that operate within this compressed space. In this work, we focus on applying these methods to fundamental problems in image compression and processing and classical optics such as wave-front propagation and optical image formation, by using directly or indirectly parallels with quantum mechanics and computation. These quantum-inspired methods are expected to yield faster algorithms with applications ranging from astronomy and earth observation to microscopy and classical imaging more broadly.</description>

      <title>Characterizing entanglement at finite temperature: how does a "classical" paramagnet become a quantum spin liquid?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSL) are phases of matter which are distinguished not by the symmetries they break, but rather by the patterns of entanglement within them. Although these entanglement properties have been widely discussed for ground states, the way in which QSL form at finite temperature remains an open question. Here we introduce a method of characterizing both the depth and spatial structure of entanglement, and use this to explore how patterns of entanglement form as temperature is reduced in two widely studied models of QSL, the Kitaev honeycomb model, and the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a Kagome lattice. These results enable us to evaluate both the temperature at which spins within the high-temperature paramagnet first become entangled, and the temperature at which the system first develops the structured, multipartite entanglement characteristic of its QSL ground state.</description>

      <title>On the microlocal phase-space concentration of Wigner distributions associated with Schr\"odinger evolutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the microlocal properties of the evolutions of Schr\"odinger equations using metaplectic Wigner distributions. So far, only restricted classes of metaplectic Wigner distributions, satisfying particular structural properties, have allowed the analysis of microlocal properties. We first extend the microlocal results to all metaplectic Wigner distributions, including the well-known Kohn-Nirenberg quantization, and examine these findings in the framework of Fourier integral operators with quadratic phase. Finally, we analyze the phase space concentration of the (cross) Wigner distribution arising from the interaction of two states, with particular attention to interactions generated by certain Schr\"odinger evolutions. These contributions enable a more refined study of the so-called ghost frequencies.</description>

      <title>Agent policies from higher-order causal functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a correspondence between equivalence classes of agent-state policies for deterministic POMDPs and one-input process functions (the classical-deterministic limit of higher-order quantum operations). We use this correspondence to build a bridge between the agent-environment interaction in artificial intelligence, causal structure in the foundations of physics, and logic in computer science. We construct a *-autonomous category PF of types which supports an interpretation of one-step evaluation of policies, and multi-agent observation constraints, into cuts and monoidal products. In terms of types, we develop the correspondence further by identifying observation-independent decentralised POMDPs as the natural domain for the multi-input process functions used to model indefinite causality. We then prove a strict separation between general multi-input process function and definite-ordered process function performance on such dec-POMDPs, by finding an instance for which policies utilizing an indefinite causal structure can achieve greater finite-horizon rewards than policies which are restricted to a fixed background causal structure.</description>

      <title>A Concept of Two-Point Propagation Field of a Single Photon: A Way to Picometer X-ray Displacement Sensing and Nanometer Resolution 3D X-ray Micro-Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the two-point propagation field (TPPF), a real-valued, phase-sensitive quantity defined as the functional derivative of the single-photon detection probability with respect to an infinitesimal opaque perturbation placed between source and detection slits. The TPPF is analytically derived and shown to exhibit a stable, high-frequency sinusoidal structure (6.7 nm period) near the detection slit. This structure enables shot-noise-limited displacement sensing at ~15 pm precision using routinely available synchrotron fluxes and practical nanofabricated slit/comb geometries, requiring mechanical stability only over the final 0.5 mm. The same principle provides a foundation for future nanometer-resolution 3D X-ray microtomography of bulk samples, potentially resulting in a reduced radiation dose. Two conceptual strategies, a central blocker and off-axis multi-slit arrays, are estimated to lower the required incident fluence by more than one order of magnitude each, yielding combined reductions of two to three orders of magnitude with near-term detector development. The TPPF concept, originally developed in a perturbative study of single-particle propagation, thus bridges fundamental quantum measurement questions with practical high-resolution X-ray metrology and imaging.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Guided and Constrained Quantum Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data from a learned model without full retraining. While recent work has begun to explore unlearning in quantum machine learning, existing approaches largely rely on fixed, uniform target distributions and do not explicitly control the trade-off between forgetting and retained model behaviour. In this work, we propose a distribution-guided framework for class-level quantum machine unlearning that treats unlearning as a constrained optimization problem. Our method introduces a tunable target distribution derived from model similarity statistics, decoupling the suppression of forgotten-class confidence from assumptions about redistribution among retained classes. We further incorporate an anchor-based preservation constraint that explicitly maintains predictive behaviour on selected retained data, yielding a controlled optimization trajectory that limits deviation from the original model. We evaluate the approach on variational quantum classifiers trained on the Iris and Covertype datasets. Results demonstrate sharp suppression of forgotten-class confidence, minimal degradation of retained-class performance, and closer alignment with the gold retrained model baselines compared to uniform-target unlearning. These findings highlight the importance of target design and constraint-based formulations for reliable and interpretable quantum machine unlearning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantities computed by minimal cuts, such as entanglement entropies achievable by the Ryu-Takayanagi proposal in the AdS/CFT correspondence, are constrained by linear inequalities. We prove a previously conjectured property of all such constraints: Any $k$ systems on the "greater-than" side of the inequality whose overlap is nonempty are subsumed in some $k$ systems on its "less-than" side (accounting for multiplicity). This finding adds evidence that the same inequalities also constrain the entropies under time-dependent conditions because it preempts a large class of potential counterexamples. We prove several other properties of holographic entropy inequalities and comment on their relation to quantum erasure correction and the Renormalization Group.</description>

      <title>A modified Lindblad equation for a Rabi driven electron-spin qubit with tunneling to a Markovian lead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a modified Lindblad equation for the state of quantum dot tunnel coupled to a Markovian lead when the spin state of the dot is driven by an oscillating magnetic field. We show that the equation is a completely positive, trace-preserving map and find the jump operators. This is a driven-dissipative regime in which coherent driving is relevant to the tunneling and cannot be treated as simply a rotation modifying the system with a bath derived under a static magnetic field. This work was motivated by an experimental desire to determine the Zeeman splitting of an electron spin on a quantum dot (a spin qubit), and in a related work we show that this splitting energy can be found by measuring the charge occupancy of the dot while sweeping the frequency of the driving field \ arXiv:2503.17481. Here we cover the full derivation of the equation and give the jump operators. These jump operators are potentially useful for describing the stochastic behavior of more complex systems with coherent driving of a spin capable of tunneling on or off of a device, such as in electron spin resonance scanning tunneling microscopy. The jump operators have the interesting feature of combining jumps of electrons onto and off of the device.</description>

      <title>Graph-Theoretic Analysis of Phase Optimization Complexity in Variational Wave Functions for Heisenberg Antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive study, the phase structure of the wavefunctions in frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets (HAF) is not yet systematically characterized. In this work, we represent the Hilbert space of an HAF as a weighted graph, which we term the Hilbert graph (HG), whose vertices are spin configurations and whose edges are generated by off-diagonal spin-flip terms of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, with weights set by products of wavefunction amplitudes. Holding the amplitudes fixed and restricting phases to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ values, the phase-dependent variational energy can be recast as a classical Ising antiferromagnet on the HG, so that phase reconstruction of the ground state reduces to a weighted Max-Cut instance. This shows that phase reconstruction HAF is worst-case NP-hard and provides a direct link between wavefunction sign structure and combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>"It from Bit": The Hartle-Hawking state and quantum mechanics for de Sitter observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The one-state statement for closed universes has sparked considerable discussion. In this paper, we examine its physical meaning in the context of the Hartle-Hawking state and de Sitter space. We argue that the one-state property of closed universes is fully compatible with the finite-dimensional quantum mechanics experienced by observers inside de Sitter space, and that this compatibility requires neither mixing of $\alpha$-sectors nor any modification of the rules of the gravitational path integral. The apparent tension is resolved by sharply distinguishing the baby-universe Hilbert space, namely the space of closed universes viewed from the outside, from the bulk Hilbert space that governs quantum mechanics for an observer inside a single de Sitter universe.
  The baby-universe Hilbert space, together with its commutative operator algebra, is not a quantum-mechanical Hilbert space: it is merely a mathematical repackaging of classical probability theory and carries no quantum-mechanical structure at all, a direct consequence of the one-state property of closed universes. Accordingly, attempting to formulate quantum mechanics directly on the baby-universe Hilbert space conflates two logically distinct structures and leads to physically incorrect conclusions. By contrast, the quantum mechanics experienced by an observer inside de Sitter space emerges from the classical statistics encoded in the baby-universe Hilbert space, providing a concrete realization of Wheeler's idea of "It from Bit." We demonstrate these features by completely solving a topological toy model of one-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. Along the way, we clarify the physical meaning of de Sitter entropy, showing that it corresponds to the coarse-grained entropy of the underlying state.</description>

An effective four-quark Hamiltonian is mapped onto a 16-qubit register, encoding color, spin, and spatial degrees of freedom, and incorporating both meson-meson and diquark-antidiquark configurations with complete color bases. Using a variational quantum eigensolver, we identify bound and resonance states in the low-lying $S$-wave sector. Deeply bound states are found exclusively in the isoscalar $I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})$ channel, dominated by color-singlet meson-meson components with non-negligible hidden-color contributions. The resulting masses and binding energies are consistent with classical chiral quark model predictions, establishing quantum simulation as a viable framework for studying exotic multiquark states beyond the reach of conventional methods.</description>
