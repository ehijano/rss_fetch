      <title>RIS, Active RIS or RDARS: A Comparative Insight Through the Lens of Energy Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplicative fading is a major limitation of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), restricting their effective coverage in both existing sub-6GHz systems and future mmWave networks. Although active RIS architectures mitigate this issue, they require high power consumption and introduce practical challenges due to the need for integrated amplifiers. Recently, reconfigurable distributed antenna and reflecting surfaces (RDARS) have been proposed to alleviate multiplicative fading through connected modes. In this work, we compare RIS, active RIS, and RDARS in terms of coverage and energy efficiency (EE) in both sub-6GHz and mmWave bands, and we investigate the impact of placement and the number of elements of reconfigurable surface (RS) on EE and coverage. The simulation results show that RDARS offers a highly energy-efficient alternative of enhancing coverage in sub-6GHz systems, while active RIS is significantly more energy-efficient in mmWave systems. Additionally, for a lower number of RS elements and for near UEs, RIS remains considerably more energy-efficient than both active RIS and RDARS.</description>

      <title>Optimal Beamforming Design for Multi-user MIMO Near-Field ISAC Systems with Movable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been recognized as one of the key technologies capable of simultaneously improving communication and sensing services in future wireless networks. Moreover, the introduction of recently developed movable antennas (MAs) has the potential to further increase the performance gains of ISAC systems. Although the gains of MA-enabled ISAC systems are relatively well studied in the far field, they remain almost unexplored in near-field scenarios. Motivated by this, in this paper we maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) for communication users while maintaining a minimum sensing requirement in an MA-enabled near-field ISAC system. To achieve this goal, we propose algorithms that optimize the communication precoding matrices, the sensing transmit beamformer, the sensing receive combiner, the positions of the users' MAs and the positions of the base station (BS) transmit MAs in an alternating manner for the considered ISAC system, for the cases where linear procoding and zero-forcing (ZF) precoding are employed at the BS. Simulation results show that using MAs in near-field ISAC systems provides a substantial performance advantage compared to near-field ISAC systems equipped with fixed antennas only. We show that the scheme with linear precoding achieves larger WSR for unequal users' weight rates, while the scheme with ZF precoding maintains an approximately constant WSR for all users' weight rates. Additionally, we demonstrate that the WSRs of the proposed schemes are highly dependent on the inter-antenna interference between different user's MAs, and that the sensing performance is significantly more affected by the minimum sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold compared to the communication performance.</description>

      <title>An Improved Lower Bound on Cardinality of Support of the Amplitude-Constrained AWGN Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the amplitude-constrained additive white Gaussian noise channel. It is well known that the capacity-achieving input distribution for this channel is discrete and supported on finitely many points. The best known bounds show that the support size of the capacity-achieving distribution is lower-bounded by a term of order $A$ and upper-bounded by a term of order $A^2$, where $A$ denotes the amplitude constraint. It was conjectured in [1] that the linear scaling is optimal. In this work, we establish a new lower bound of order $A\sqrt{\log A}$, improving the known bound and ruling out the conjectured linear scaling.
  To obtain this result, we quantify the fact that the capacity-achieving output distribution is close to the uniform distribution in the interior of the amplitude constraint. Next, we introduce a wrapping operation that maps the problem to a compact domain and develop a theory of best approximation of the uniform distribution by finite Gaussian mixtures. These approximation bounds are then combined with stability properties of capacity-achieving distributions to yield the final support-size lower bound.</description>

      <title>Iterative Channel Estimation, Detection and Decoding for Multi-Antenna Systems with RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes an iterative channel estimation, detection and decoding (ICEDD) scheme for the uplink of multi-user multi-antenna systems assisted by multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)}. A novel iterative code-aided channel estimation (ICCE) technique is developed that uses low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and iterative processing to enhance estimation accuracy while reducing pilot overhead. The core idea is to exploit encoded pilots (EP), enabling the use of both pilot and parity bits to iteratively refine channel estimates. To further improve performance, an iterative channel tracking (ICT) method is proposed that takes advantage of the temporal correlation of the channel. An analytical evaluation of the proposed estimator is provided in terms of normalized mean-squared error (NMSE), along with a study of its computational complexity and the impact of the code rate. Numerical results validate the performance of the proposed scheme in a sub-6 GHz multi-RIS scenario with non-sparse propagation, under both LOS and NLOS conditions, and different RIS architectures.</description>

      <title>Beyond Beam Sweeping: One-Shot Satellite Acquisition with Doppler-Aware Rainbow Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-gain beamforming (BF) is essential for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications to overcome severe path loss, but this requires acquiring precise satellite positions. Conventional satellite acquisition typically relies on time-domain beam sweeping, which incurs substantial overhead and latency. In this correspondence, we propose an efficient one-shot satellite acquisition framework that capitalizes on two phenomena traditionally regarded as impairments: i) Doppler effects and ii) beam-squint effects. Specifically, we derive a closed-form \emph{rainbow beamformer} that leverages beam-squint effects to align frequency-dependent beam directions with satellite positions inferred from their Doppler shifts. This approach enables reception from multiple satellites at once without requiring beam sweeping. To extract satellite position information, we develop three Doppler-aware angle estimation algorithms based on received signals. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional beam sweeping approaches in both acquisition accuracy and required time slots. These gains stem from the ability of the proposed rainbow BF to exploit the \emph{angle-dependent nature of Doppler shifts}, enabling full angular-domain coverage with a single pilot transmission and reception.</description>

      <title>Covering in Hamming and Grassmann Spaces: New Bounds and Reed--Solomon-Based Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study covering problems in Hamming and Grassmann spaces through a unified coding-theoretic and information-theoretic framework. Viewing covering as a form of quantization in general metric spaces, we introduce the notion of the average covering radius as a natural measure of average distortion, complementing the classical worst-case covering radius. By leveraging tools from one-shot rate-distortion theory, we derive explicit non-asymptotic random-coding bounds on the average covering radius in both spaces, which serve as fundamental performance benchmarks.
  On the construction side, we develop efficient puncturing-based covering algorithms for generalized Reed--Solomon (GRS) codes in the Hamming space and extend them to a new family of subspace codes, termed character-Reed--Solomon (CRS) codes, for Grassmannian quantization under the chordal distance. Our results reveal that, despite poor worst-case covering guarantees, these structured codes exhibit strong average covering performance. In particular, numerical results in the Hamming space demonstrate that RS-based constructions often outperform random codebooks in terms of average covering radius. In the one-dimensional Grassmann space, we numerically show that CRS codes over prime fields asymptotically achieve average covering radii within a constant factor of the random-coding bound in the high-rate regime. Together, these results provide new insights into the role of algebraic structure in covering problems and high-dimensional quantization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces Generalized Hyperderivative Reed-Solomon codes (GHRS codes), which generalize NRT Reed-Solomon codes. Its main results are as follows: 1) every GHRS code is MDS, 2) the dual of a GHRS code is also an GHRS code, 3) determine subfamilies of GHRS codes whose members are low-density parity-check codes (LDPCs), and 4) determine a family of GHRS codes whose members are quasi-cyclic. We point out that there are GHRS codes having all of these properties.</description>

      <title>User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO Enhanced by Fluid-Antenna Access Points: Uplink Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems in which access points (APs) are equipped with fluid antennas (FAs) and develop a comprehensive framework for channel estimation, antenna port selection, and uplink spectral efficiency (SE) optimization. We propose a generalized LMMSE-based uplink channel estimation scheme that dynamically activates FA ports during pilot transmission, efficiently exploiting antenna reconfigurability under practical training constraints. Building on this, we design a distributed port selection strategy that minimizes per-AP channel estimation error by exploiting spatial correlation among FA ports. We systematically analyze the impact of antenna geometry and spatial correlation using the Jakes' channel model for different AP array configurations, including uniform linear and planar arrays. We then derive SINR expressions for centralized and distributed uplink processing and obtain a closed-form uplink SE expression for centralized maximum-ratio combining using the use-and-then-forget bound. Finally, we propose an alternating-optimization framework to select FA port configurations that maximize the uplink sum SE. Numerical results show that the proposed FA-aware channel estimation and port optimization strategies greatly reduce channel estimation error and significantly improve sum-SE over fixed-antenna and non-optimized FA baselines, confirming FAs as a key enabler for scalable, adaptive CF-mMIMO networks.</description>

      <title>A New Family of Binary Sequences via Elliptic Function Fields over Finite Fields of Odd Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the constructions of binary sequences by utilizing the cyclic elliptic function fields over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{2^{n}}$ by Jin \textit{et al.} in [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 71(8), 2025], we extend the construction to the cyclic elliptic function fields with odd characteristic by using the quadratic residue map $\eta$ instead of the trace map used therein. For any cyclic elliptic function field with $q+1+t$ rational points and any positive integer $d$ with $\gcd(d, q+1+t)=1$, we construct a new family of binary sequences of length $q+1+t$, size $q^{d-1}-1$, balance upper bounded by $(d+1)\cdot\lfloor2\sqrt{q}\rfloor+|t|+d,$ the correlation upper bounded by $(2d+1)\cdot\lfloor2\sqrt{q}\rfloor+|t|+2d$ and the linear complexity lower bounded by $\frac{q+1+2t-d-(d+1)\cdot\lfloor2\sqrt{q}\rfloor}{d+d\cdot\lfloor2\sqrt{q}\rfloor}$ where $\lfloor x\rfloor$ stands for the integer part of $x\in\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>Sum Rate optimization for RIS-Aided RSMA system with Movable Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) is regarded as a key enabling technique for sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems for its powerful interference management substantially enhancing link throughput. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can effectively shape the wireless propagation to match the environment and improve communication performance. However, in conventional RSMA-RIS architectures, the antenna elements are fixed, which underutilizes spatial degrees of freedom and hence constrains system performance. To address this limitation, we propose a movable-antenna (MA) assisted RSMA-RIS framework and formulate a sum-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes the transmit beamforming matrix, the RIS reflection matrix, the common-rate partition, and the MA positions. The original problem is equivalently transformed by employing the fractional programming (FP) method, and a closed-form solution for the common rate splitting is derived. Leveraging the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, we obtain iterative updates for the Lagrange multipliers together with a closed-form expression for the beamforming matrix. We then develop an update rule for the RIS reflection matrix via the dual problem, and finally determine the optimal antenna locations using a gradient-ascent procedure. Numerical results indicate that, even in the presence of RIS assistance, incorporating MAs yields additional performance improvements for RSMA. Moreover, relative to space-division multiple access (SDMA), the assistance of MA yields a greater performance gain for RSMA.</description>

      <title>Information Inequalities for Five Random Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entropic region is formed by the collection of the Shannon entropies of all subvectors of finitely many jointly distributed discrete random variables. For four or more variables the structure of the entropic region is mostly unknown. We utilize a variant of the Maximum Entropy Method to delimit the five-variable entropy region. This method adds copies of some of the random variables in generations. A significant reduction in computational complexity, achieved through theoretical considerations and by harnessing the inherent symmetries, allowed us to calculate all five-variable non-Shannon inequalities provided by the first nine generations. Based on the results, we define two infinite collections of such inequalities, and prove them to be entropy inequalities. We investigate downward closed subsets of non-negative lattice points that parameterize these collections, based on which we develop an algorithm to enumerate all extremal inequalities. The discovered set of entropy inequalities is conjectured to characterize the applied method completely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless networks are expected to deliver ultra-high throughput for supporting emerging applications. In such scenarios, conventional Nyquist signaling may falter. As a remedy, faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling facilitates the transmission of more symbols than Nyquist signaling without expanding the time-frequency resources. We provide an accessible and structured introduction to FTN signaling, covering its core principles, theoretical foundations, unique advantages, open facets, and its road map. Specifically, we present promising coded FTN results and highlight its compelling advantages in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), an increasingly critical function in future networks. We conclude with a discussion of open research challenges and promising directions.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Channel Knowledge Map Construction in MIMO-OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) is a promising paradigm for environment-aware communications by establishing a deterministic mapping between physical locations and channel parameters. Existing CKM construction methods focus on quasi-static propagation environment. This paper develops a dynamic CKM construction method for multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. We establish a dynamic channel model that captures the coexistence of quasi-static and dynamic scatterers, as well as the impacts of antenna rotation and synchronization errors. Based on this model, we formulate the problem of dynamic CKM construction within a Bayesian inference framework and design a two-stage approximate Bayesian inference algorithm. In stage I, a high-performance algorithm is developed to jointly infer quasi-static channel parameters and calibrate synchronization errors from historical measurements. In stage II, by leveraging the quasi-static parameters as informative priors, a low-complexity algorithm is designed to estimate dynamic parameters from limited real-time measurements. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed method and demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling low-overhead, high-performance channel estimation in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Affine-Projection Recovery of Continuous Angular Power Spectrum: Geometry and Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers recovering a continuous angular power spectrum (APS) from the channel covariance. Building on the projection-onto-linear-variety (PLV) algorithm, an affine-projection approach introduced by Miretti \emph{et. al.}, we analyze PLV in a well-defined \emph{weighted} Fourier-domain to emphasize its geometric interpretability. This yields an explicit fixed-dimensional trigonometric-polynomial representation and a closed-form solution via a positive-definite matrix, which directly implies uniqueness. We further establish an exact energy identity that yields the APS reconstruction error and leads to a sharp identifiability/resolution characterization: PLV achieves perfect recovery if and only if the ground-truth APS lies in the identified trigonometric-polynomial subspace; otherwise it returns the minimum-energy APS among all covariance-consistent spectra.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of active nonparametric sequential two-sample testing over multiple heterogeneous data sources. In each time slot, a decision-maker adaptively selects one of $K$ data sources and receives a paired sample generated from that source for testing. The goal is to decide as quickly as possible whether the pairs are generated from the same distribution or not. The gain achieved by such adaptive sampling (in terms of smaller expected stopping time or larger error exponents) has been well-characterized for parametric models via Chernoff's adaptive MLE selection rule [1]. However, analogous results are not known for the case of nonparametric problems, such as two-sample testing, where we place no restrictions on the distributions.
  Our main contribution is a general active nonparametric testing procedure that combines an adaptive source-selecting strategy within the testing-by-betting framework of [2] that works under minimal distributional assumptions. In each time slot, our scheme proceeds by selecting a source according to a probability that mixes exploitation, favoring sources with the largest empirical distinguishability, and exploration via a vanishing greedy strategy. The (paired) observations so collected are then used to update the "betting-wealth process", which is a stochastic process guaranteed to be a nonnegative martingale under the null. The procedure stops and rejects the null when the wealth process exceeds an appropriate threshold; an event that is unlikely under the null. We show that our test controls the type-I error at a prespecified level-$\alpha$ under the null, and establish its power-one property and a bound on its expected sample size under the alternative. Our results provide a precise characterization of the improvements achievable by a principled adaptive sampling strategy over its passive analog.</description>

      <title>Flexible Intelligent Metasurface for Downlink Communications under Statistical CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM) is a recently developed, groundbreaking hardware technology with promising potential for 6G wireless systems. Unlike conventional rigid antenna array (RAA)-based transmitters, FIM-assisted transmitters can dynamically alter their physical surface through morphing, offering new degrees of freedom to enhance system performance. In this letter, we depart from prior works that rely on instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and instead address the problem of average sum spectral efficiency maximization under statistical CSI in a FIM-assisted downlink multiuser multiple-input single-output setting. To this end, we first derive the spatial correlation matrix for the FIM-aided transmitter and then propose an iterative FIM optimization algorithm based on the gradient projection method. Simulation results show that with statistical CSI, the FIM-aided system provides a significant performance gain over its RAA-based counterpart in scenarios with strong spatial channel correlation, whereas the gain diminishes when the channels are weakly correlated.</description>

      <title>Trust Region Masking for Long-Horizon LLM Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy gradient methods for large language models optimize a surrogate objective computed from samples of a rollout policy $\pi_{\text{roll}}$. When $\pi_{\text{roll}} \ne \pi_{\theta}$, there is approximation error between the surrogate and the true objective. Prior work has shown that this off-policy mismatch is unavoidable in modern LLM-RL due to implementation divergence, mixture-of-experts routing discontinuities, and distributed training staleness. Classical trust region bounds on the resulting error scale as $O(T^2)$ with sequence length $T$, rendering them vacuous for long-horizon tasks. We derive two tighter bounds: a Pinsker-Marginal bound scaling as $O(T^{3/2})$ and a Mixed bound scaling as $O(T)$. Crucially, both bounds depend on $D_{kl}^{tok,max}$ -- the maximum token-level KL divergence across all positions in a sequence. This is inherently a sequence-level quantity: it requires examining the entire trajectory to compute, and therefore cannot be controlled by token-independent methods like PPO clipping. We propose Trust Region Masking (TRM), which excludes entire sequences from gradient computation if any token violates the trust region, providing the first non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees for long-horizon LLM-RL.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study axiomatic foundations of Bayesian persuasion, where a principal (i.e., sender) delegates the task of choice making after informing a biased agent (i.e., receiver) about the payoff relevant uncertain state (see, e.g., Kamenica and Gentzkow (2011)). Our characterizations involve novel models of Bayesian persuasion, where the principal can steer the agent's bias after acquiring costly information. Importantly, we provide an elicitation method using only observable menu-choice data of the principal, which shows how to construct the principal's subjective costs of acquiring information even when he anticipates managing the agent's bias.</description>

      <title>Identifying faulty edges in resistive electrical networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a resistive electrical network, we would like to determine whether all the resistances (edges) in the network are working, and if not, identify which edge (or edges) are faulty. To make this determination, we are allowed to measure the effective resistance between certain pairs of nodes (which can be done by measuring the amount of current when one unit of voltage difference is applied at the chosen pair of nodes). The goal is to determine which edge, if any, is not working in the network using the smallest number of measurements. We prove rigorous upper and lower bounds on this optimal number of measurements for different classes of graphs. These bounds are tight for several of these classes showing that our measurement strategies are optimal.</description>

      <title>Dependence Balance and Capacity Bounds for Multiterminal Communication and Wiretap Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.14814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An information measure based on fractional partitions of a set is used to develop a general dependence balance inequality for communication. This inequality is used to obtain new upper bounds on reliable and secret rates for multiterminal channels. For example, we obtain a new upper bound on the rate of shared randomness generated among terminals, a counterpart of the cut-set bound for reliable communication. The bounds for reliable communication utilize the concept of auxiliary receivers, and we show the bounds are optimized by Gaussian distributions for Gaussian channels. The bounds are applied to multiaccess channels with generalized feedback and relay channels, and improve the cut-set bound for scalar Gaussian channels. The improvement for Gaussian relay channels complements results obtained with other methods.</description>

      <title>Exponential Lower Bounds for Locally Decodable and Correctable Codes for Insertions and Deletions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.01060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locally Decodable Codes (LDCs) are error-correcting codes for which individual message symbols can be quickly recovered despite errors in the codeword. LDCs for Hamming errors have been studied extensively in the past few decades, where a major goal is to understand the amount of redundancy that is necessary and sufficient to decode from large amounts of error, with small query complexity.
  In this work, we study LDCs for insertion and deletion errors, called Insdel LDCs. Their study was initiated by Ostrovsky and Paskin-Cherniavsky (Information Theoretic Security, 2015), who gave a reduction from Hamming LDCs to Insdel LDCs with a small blowup in the code parameters. On the other hand, the only known lower bounds for Insdel LDCs come from those for Hamming LDCs, thus there is no separation between them. Here we prove new, strong lower bounds for the existence of Insdel LDCs. In particular, we show that $2$-query linear Insdel LDCs do not exist, and give an exponential lower bound for the length of all $q$-query Insdel LDCs with constant $q$. For $q \ge 3$ our bounds are exponential in the existing lower bounds for Hamming LDCs. Furthermore, our exponential lower bounds continue to hold for adaptive decoders, and even in private-key settings where the encoder and decoder share secret randomness. This exhibits a strict separation between Hamming LDCs and Insdel LDCs.
  Our strong lower bounds also hold for the related notion of Insdel LCCs (except in the private-key setting), due to an analogue to the Insdel notions of a reduction from Hamming LCCs to LDCs.
  Our techniques are based on a delicate design and analysis of hard distributions of insertion and deletion errors, which depart significantly from typical techniques used in analyzing Hamming LDCs.</description>

      <title>Two Birds With One Stone: Beamforming Design for Target Sensing and Proactive Eavesdropping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06521v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the beamforming design in the joint proactive eavesdropping (PE) and target sensing (TS) systems. The base station (BS) wiretaps the information transmitted by the illegal transmitter and sends the waveform for TS. The shared waveform also serves as artificial noise to interfere with the illegal receiver, thereby achieving successful PE.We firstly optimize the transmitting beampattern of the BS only to maximize the eavesdropping rate or only to minimize the Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao bound, respectively. Then, the joint design of PE and TS is investigated by formulating the PE-centric, the TS-centric, and the normalized weighted optimization problems. The formulated problems are solved by the semi-definite relaxation technique and the sequential rank-one constraint relaxation method to address the complexity of the original problem. Furthermore, the scenario in which the quality of the eavesdropping channel is stronger than that of the illegal channel is considered. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively realize PE and TS simultaneously.</description>

      <title>On the cross-correlation properties of large-size families of Costas arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Costas arrays have been an interesting combinatorial object for decades because of their optimal aperiodic auto-correlation properties. Meanwhile, it is interesting to find families of Costas arrays or extended arrays with small maximal cross-correlation values, since for applications in multi-user systems, the cross-interferences between different signals should also be small. The objective of this paper is to study several large-size families of Costas arrays or extended arrays, and their values of maximal crosscorrelation are partially bounded for some cases of horizontal shifts $u$ and vertical shifts $v$. Given a prime $p \geq 5$, a large-size family of Costas arrays over $\{1, \ldots, p-1\}$ is investigated, including both the exponential and logarithmic Welch Costas arrays. An upper bound on the maximal cross-correlation of this family for arbitrary $u$ and $v$ is given. We also show that the maximal cross-correlation of the family of power permutations over $\{1, \ldots, p-1\}$ for $u=0$ and $v \neq 0$ is bounded by $\frac{1}{2}+\sqrt{p-1}$. Furthermore, we give the first nontrivial upper bound on the maximal cross-correlation of the larger family including both exponential Welch Costas arrays and power permutations over $\{1, \ldots, p-1\}$ for arbitrary $u$ and $v=0$ that it equals $(p-1) / t$ where $t$ is the smallest prime divisor of $(p-1) / 2$ if p is not a safe prime and is at most $(p-1)^{\frac{1}{2}}+(p-1)^{\frac{1}{4}}+\frac{1}{2}$ otherwise.</description>

Abstract: Quasi-cyclic codes have been recently employed in the constructions of quantum error-correcting codes. In this paper, we propose a construction of infinite families of quasi-cyclic codes which are self-orthogonal with respect to the Euclidean and Hermitian inner products. In particular, their dimension and a lower bound for their minimum distance are computed using their constituent codes defined over field extensions of $\mathbb{F}_q$. We also show that the lower bound for the minimum distance satisfies the square-root-like lower bound and also show how self-dual quasi-cyclic codes can arise from our construction. Using the CSS construction, we show the existence of quantum error-correcting codes with good parameters.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Empowered Near-Field Sensing via Antenna Position Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology exhibits great promise for enhancing the sensing capabilities of future sixth-generation (6G) networks due to its capability to alter antenna array geometry. With the growing prevalence of near-field propagation at ultra-high frequencies, this paper focuses on the application of one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) MA arrays for near-field sensing to jointly estimate the angle and distance information about a target. First, for the 1D MA array scenario, to gain insights into MA-enhanced near-field sensing, we investigate two simplified cases with only angle-of-arrival (AoA) or distance estimation, respectively, assuming that the other information is already known. The worst-case Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) on the mean square errors (MSEs) of the AoA estimation and the distance estimation are derived in these two cases. Then, we jointly optimize the positions of the MAs within the 1D array to minimize these CRBs and derive their closed-form solutions, which yield an identical array geometry to MA-enhanced far-field sensing. For the more challenging joint AoA and distance estimation, since the associated worst-case CRB is a highly complex and non-convex function with respect to the MA positions, a discrete sampling-based approach is proposed to sequentially update the MA positions and obtain an efficient suboptimal solution. Furthermore, we investigate the worst-case CRB minimization problems for a 2D MA array under various conditions and extend our proposed algorithms to solve them efficiently. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-enhanced near-field sensing scheme dramatically outperforms conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs). Moreover, the joint angle and distance estimation results in a different array geometry from that in the individual estimation of angle/distance or far-field sensing.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the hull codes of free linear codes over a non-unital ring $ E= \langle \kappa,\tau \mid 2 \kappa =2 \tau=0,~ \kappa^2=\kappa,~ \tau^2=\tau,~ \kappa \tau=\kappa,~ \tau \kappa=\tau \rangle$. Initially, we examine the residue and torsion codes of various hulls of $E$-linear codes and obtain an explicit form of the generator matrix of the hull of a free $E$-linear code. Then, we propose four build-up construction methods to construct codes with a larger length and hull-rank from codes with a smaller length and hull-rank. Some illustrative examples are also given to support our build-up construction methods. Subsequently, we study the permutation equivalence of two free $E$-linear codes and discuss the hull-variation problem. As an application, we classify optimal free $E$-linear codes for lengths up to $8$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05684v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we effectively remove or ''unlearn'' undesirable information, such as specific features or the influence of individual data points, from a learning outcome while minimizing utility loss and ensuring rigorous guarantees? We introduce a unified mathematical framework based on information-theoretic regularization to address both data point unlearning and feature unlearning. For data point unlearning, we introduce the $\textit{Marginal Unlearning Principle}$, an auditable and provable framework inspired by memory suppression studies in neuroscience. Moreover, we provide formal information-theoretic unlearning definition based on the proposed principle, named marginal unlearning, and provable guarantees on sufficiency and necessity of marginal unlearning to the existing approximate unlearning definitions. We then show the proposed framework provide natural solution to the marginal unlearning problems. For feature unlearning, the framework applies to deep learning with arbitrary training objectives. By combining flexibility in learning objectives with simplicity in regularization design, our approach is highly adaptable and practical for a wide range of machine learning and AI applications. From a mathematical perspective, we provide an unified analytic solution to the optimal feature unlearning problem with a variety of information-theoretic training objectives. Our theoretical analysis reveals intriguing connections between machine unlearning, information theory, optimal transport, and extremal sigma algebras. Numerical simulations support our theoretical finding.</description>

Beginning with the derivation of $\alpha$-divergence between two tempered stable processes, we obtain the corresponding Fisher information matrices and the $\alpha$-connections on their statistical manifolds. Furthermore, we explore statistical applications of this geometric framework. Various tempered stable processes such as generalized tempered stable processes, classical tempered stable processes, and rapidly-decreasing tempered stable processes are presented as illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Learning to erase quantum states: thermodynamic implications of quantum learning theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy cost of erasing quantum states depends on our knowledge of the states. We show that learning algorithms can acquire such knowledge to erase many copies of an unknown state at the optimal energy cost. This is proved by showing that learning can be made fully reversible and has no fundamental energy cost itself. With simple counting arguments, we relate the energy cost of erasing quantum states to their complexity, entanglement, and magic. We further show that the constructed erasure protocol is computationally efficient when learning is efficient. Conversely, under standard cryptographic assumptions, we prove that the optimal energy cost cannot be achieved efficiently in general. These results also enable efficient work extraction based on learning. Together, our results establish a concrete connection between quantum learning theory and thermodynamics, highlighting the physical significance of learning processes and enabling provably-efficient learning-based protocols for thermodynamic tasks.</description>

      <title>Structure-Fair Quantum Circuit Complexity: An Auditable Information-Theoretic Lower Bound</title>

Abstract: Quantifying the complexity of quantum states that possess intrinsic structure, such as symmetry or encoding, in a fair manner constitutes a core challenge in the benchmarking of quantum technologies. This paper introduces the Reference-Contingent Complexity (RCC), an information-theoretic measure calibrated by the available quantum operations. The core idea is to leverage the quantum relative entropy to quantify the deviation of a quantum state from its "structured vacuum"-namely, the maximum entropy state within its constrained subspace-thereby only pricing the process of creating non-trivial information. Our central result is a key theorem that rigorously proves the RCC serves as a lower bound for the complexity of any universal quantum circuit. This lower bound is comprised of a linear dominant term, a universal logarithmic correction, and a precise physical correction term that accounts for non-uniformity in the spectral distribution. Crucially, we establish a set of operational protocols, grounded in tasks like quantum hypothesis testing, which make this theoretical lower bound experimentally "auditable." This work provides a "ruler" for quantum technology that is structure-fair and enables cross-platform comparison, thereby establishing a strictly verifiable constraint between the computational cost of the process and the structured information of the final state.</description>
