      <title>Embrittling bulk metals into hydride in acid solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydride induced embrittlement (HIE), in which the hydrogen infiltrates metal lattices to form hydrides, typically causes catastrophic failure. Inspired by HIE effect, we propose an "HIE-mediated synthesis" approach, where bulk metal foils serve as precursors and oleic/sulfuric acid act as hydrogen donors under solvo/hydrothermal conditions, enabling the synthesis of 18 high-purity metal hydrides (MgH$_2$, ScH$_2$, YH$_2$, LaH$_2$, LaH$_{2.3}$, SmH$_2$, LuH$_2$, TiH$_2$, $\delta$-ZrH$_{1.6}$, $\epsilon$-ZrH$_2$, HfH$_{1.7}$, HfH$_2$, VH$_{0.8}$, VH$_2$, NbH, NbH$_2$, Ta$_2$H, and TaH). Integrated high-pressure experiments and first-principles calculations, the concept of equivalent chemical pressure ($\Delta$Pc) was introduced to elucidate the mechanism of synthesizing and stabilizing metal hydrides in an acidic environment. This mechanism predicts the synthesis of challenging hydrides such as LiH. Our approach successfully converts HIE from a primary culprit of material failure to an effective contributor in hydride synthesis.</description>

      <title>Phonon dephasing times determined with time-delayed, broadband CARS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent Raman scattering techniques as coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), offer significant advantages in terms of pixel dwell times and speed as compared to spontaneous Raman scattering for investigations of crystalline materials. However, the spectral information in CARS is often hampered by the presence of a non-resonant contribution to the scattering process that shifts and distorts the Raman peaks. In this work, we apply a method to obtain non-resonant background-free spectra based on time-delayed, broadband CARS (TD-BCARS) using an intra-pulse excitation scheme. In particular, this method can measure the phononic dephasing times across the full phonon spectrum at once. We test the methodology on amorphous SiO2 (glass), which is used to characterize the setup-specific and material-independent response times, and then apply TD-BCARS to the analysis of single crystals of diamond and ferroelectrics of potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) and potassium titanyl arsenate (KTA). For diamond, we determine a dephasing time of t = 7.81 ps for the single sp3 peak.</description>

      <title>BO-graphane and BO-diamane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adsorption of boron and oxygen atoms onto mono- and multi-layer graphene leads to the formation of a buckled graphene layer (BO-graphane) and a 2D diamond-like structure (BO-diamane) sandwiched between boron monoxide layers per DFT calculations. BO-graphane has a calculated Young's modulus ($\it{E}$) of 750 GPA and BO-diamane 771 GPa, higher than the calculated $\it{E}$ of -F,-OH, and -H diamanes; this is due to the presence of B-O bonds in the functionalizing layers. Electronic band structure calculations show BO-graphane and BO-diamane are wide band gap semiconductors with an indirect band gap up to a thickness of three layers (3L). Phonon dispersion and $ab-initio$ molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations confirm dynamic and thermal stability, maintaining structural integrity at 1000 K. The room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity of BO-graphane and BO-diamane is found to be 879 W/m.K and 1260 W/m.K, respectively, surpassing BeO (385 W/m.K), MgO (64 W/m.K), and Al$_2$O$_3$ (36 W/m.K); and F-diamane (377 W/m.K), and comparable to H-diamane (1145-1960 W/m.K), suggesting them as candidates for thermal management in applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Moir\'e Systems: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review synthesizes recent advancements in the study of moir\'e magnetism. This emerging field, at the intersection of twistronics, topology, and strongly correlated systems, explores novel phenomena that arise when moir\'e potentials influence magnetic two-dimensional systems. The manuscript presents recent advances highlighting the interfacial incongruity as a novel mechanism for regulating the magnetism of two-dimensional materials and for the manifestation of various phenomena in twisted and mismatched magnetic two-dimensional interfaces. The manuscript addresses seminal and recent experimental and theoretical advances associated with both small- and large-period magnetic moir\'e lattices, including novel magnetic phases, low-energy and topological magnetic excitations, magnetic and electronic transport, optical properties, phase transitions, and prospective applications of these materials. Moir\'e magnetism signifies a promising frontier for manipulating complex quantum states in quantum matter. The ongoing advances in this field are poised to impact condensed matter physics, materials science, and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Coherent phonon motions and ordered vacancy compound mediated quantum path interference in Cu-poor CuIn$_{x}$Ga$_{(1-x)}$Se$_2$ (CIGS) with attosecond transient absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, coherent phonon motion is observed in bandgap excited CuIn$_{x}$Ga$_{(1-x)}$Se$_2$ (CIGS) utilizing extreme ultraviolet (XUV) attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy across the Se M$_{4,5}$ absorption edge. Two frequencies of coherent phonon motion are resolved, a low frequency mode attributed through Raman measurements to the $A_{1g}$ phonon motion of a Cu-deficient ordered vacancy compound (OVC), while the high frequency mode originates from the $A_{1g}$ phonon motion in the chalcopyrite phase. The two oscillations lead to modulations in the XUV differential absorption $\Delta A(\epsilon,\tau)$ due to energy shifts of the Se M$_{4,5}$ edge, with a minima occuring approximately 1 ps after the band gap excitation. The hot carrier cooling time of holes and electrons are disentangled and the observed slower cooling of holes is attributed to the higher density of hole states in the valence band. We also observe fast oscillations (18.6(3) fs period) across the Se absorption edge, which are interpreted to originate from quantum path interference between the electronic conduction bands of the chalcopyrite CIGS and OVC phases, opening the possibility towards quantum coherent metrology in photovoltaics on the femtosecond timescale. The complex interplay between the chalcopyrite and OVC phases are revealed in this investigation through both coherent vibrational and electronic motions.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics of $cis$-polybutadiene across glass transition revealed by muonated-radical spin relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local molecular motion of $cis$-polybutadiene, a typical polymeric material exhibiting a glass transition ($T_{\rm g}=168$ K), has been investigated by the spin relaxation of muonated radicals, where the relaxation is induced by the fluctuation of hyperfine (HF) fields exerted from unpaired electron to nearby muon and surrounding protons. The relaxation rate ($1/T_\mu$) measured under various longitudinal magnetic fields was analyzed by the recently developed theory of spin relaxation to consider the coexistence of quasistatic and fluctuating HF fields, where the fluctuation frequency for the latter ($\nu$) was evaluated over a temperature ($T$) range of 5--320 K. The obtained $\nu(T)$ is found to be well reproduced by the Arrhenius relation, and the activation energy and pre-exponential factor are in good agreement with those for the ``E-process'' revealed by quasielastic neutron scattering and attributed to a fluctuation across three CC bonds. This result demonstrates that muonated-radical spin relaxation is a promising approach for direct access to local molecular motions in the sub-nanosecond range and for their detailed modeling in the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Nature of nonanalytic chemical short-range order in metallic alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonanalytic chemical short-range order (SRO) has long been observed in diffuse scattering experiments for metallic alloys. However, considerable debate surrounds the validity of these observations due to the unresolved nature of the nonanalyticity. Using prototypical face-centered cubic alloys as an example, here we demonstrate that SRO in metallic alloys is mostly nonanalytic at {\Gamma}. The nonanalyticity stems from the elastic anisotropy and long-range atomic interactions of the \emph{host} lattice. The physical insights substantially improve our understanding of chemical order in alloys and resolves the long-standing debate in the field. Nonanalytic SRO is expected to be general in alloys and the nonanalyticity may serve as a unique feature to verify the intensely debated existence of SRO in compositionally complex alloys.</description>

      <title>Phonon angular momentum induced by Terahertz electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the growing interest in phonon angular momentum (AM) in recent years, current studies remain limited to a few materials due to the constraints imposed by time reversal symmetry on macroscopic phonon AM. In this work, we theoretically investigate the generation of total phonon AM through alternating terahertz electric fields in polarized materials. In contrast to previous studies on phonon AM, here the off-diagonal elements of the phonon AM operator play an essential role. According to our formula, the large AM is generated when the energy of incident electric fields matches the frequency of optical phonons at {\Gamma} point. Furthermore, a specific resonance on the imaginary part of the response coefficient, as well as periodic regulation of the phonon AM by the phase difference of the driving field, is observed. In polar material GaN, the oscillation maximum is observed as \hbar per unit cell which can be experimentally measured through orbital magnetization induced by phonon AM. Our work offers a promising approach to generate observable phonon AM in a wider range of materials, advancing both the understanding of phonon fundamental physics and potential applications in phononic devices.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Phonon Characteristics of Gallium Oxide Single Crystals Investigated with Brillouin-Mandelstam Light Scattering Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an investigation of the bulk and surface acoustic phonons in gallium oxide ultra-wide bandgap single crystals along various crystallographic directions using Brillouin-Mandelstam spectroscopy. Pronounced anisotropy in the acoustic phonon dispersion and velocities was observed across different crystal orientations. The measured average acoustic phonon velocities for the crystallographic directions of interest are 5,250 m/s and 4,990 m/s. The surface acoustic phonons propagate approximately twice as slowly as the bulk acoustic phonons. Our results suggest that the anisotropy of heat conduction in gallium oxide results from the difference in phonon velocities rather than the phonon lifetime. The obtained information for bulk and surface acoustic phonons can be used for developing accurate theoretical models of phonon scattering and optimization of thermal and electrical transport in this technologically important ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor.</description>

      <title>Efficient dataset generation for machine learning perovskite alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-based perovskite solar cells have reached high efficiencies, but toxicity and lack of stability hinder their wide-scale adoption. These issues have been partially addressed through compositional engineering of perovskite materials, but the vast complexity of the perovskite materials space poses a significant obstacle to exploration. We previously demonstrated how machine learning (ML) can accelerate property predictions for the CsPb(Cl/Br)$_3$ perovskite alloy. However, the substantial computational demand of density functional theory (DFT) calculations required for model training prevents applications to more complex materials. Here, we introduce a data-efficient scheme to facilitate model training, validated initially on CsPb(Cl/Br)$_3$ data and extended to the ternary alloy CsSn(Cl/Br/I)$_3$. Our approach employs clustering to construct a compact yet diverse initial dataset of atomic structures. We then apply a two-stage active learning approach to first improve the reliability of the ML-based structure relaxations and then refine accuracy near equilibrium structures. Tests for CsPb(Cl/Br)$_3$ demonstrate that our scheme reduces the number of required DFT calculations during the different parts of our proposed model training method by up to 20% and 50%. The fitted model for CsSn(Cl/Br/I)$_3$ is robust and highly accurate, evidenced by the convergence of all ML-based structure relaxations in our tests and an average relaxation error of only 0.5 meV/atom.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of Afterglow and Thermally Stimulated Luminescence in UV-irradiated InP/ZnS Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium phosphide-based quantum dots (QDs) are a potential material for designing optoelectronic devices, owing their adjustable spectral parameters over the entire visible range, as well as their high biocompatibility and environmental safety. Concurrently, they exhibit structural defects, the rectification of which is crucial for enhancing their optical properties. The present work explores, for the first time, the low-temperature afterglow (AG) and spectrally resolved thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) of UV-irradiated colloidal core/shell InP/ZnS QDs in the range of 7-340 K. It is shown that, when localized during irradiation and released after additional stimulation, charge carriers recombine involving defect centers based on indium and phosphorus dangling bonds. The mechanisms of the observed luminescent phenomena can be caused by both thermal activation and tunneling processes. By means of the initial rise method, the formalism of general-order kinetics, and the analytical description using the Lambert W function, we have analyzed the kinetic features of possible thermally stimulated mechanisms. We have also estimated the energy characteristics of appropriate trapping centers. A low rate of charge carriers recapture is revealed for InP/ZnS QDs. Active traps in nanocrystals of different sizes are characterized by close values of activation energy in the 26-31 meV range. The current paper discloses new horizons for exploiting TSL approaches to study the properties of local defective states in the energy structure of colloidal QDs, which can contribute to the development of targeted synthesis of nanocrystals with tunable temperature sensitivity for optoelectronic and sensor applications.</description>

      <title>Unusual Electron-Phonon Interactions in Highly Anisotropic Two-Dimensional $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) represent a fundamental cornerstone of condensed matter physics, commanding persistent attention due to their pivotal role in driving novel quantum phenomena within low-dimensional materials. Here, we unveil unusual anisotropic electron-phonon coupling behaviors in quasi-one-dimensional $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ nano-flakes through a powerful combination of angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy directly visualize the pronounced quasi-one-dimensional atomic chains within the crystal structure, establishing a structural foundation for the observed anisotropic interactions. Our Raman investigations reveal remarkable polarization-dependent responses in $A_g$ phonon modes that deviate significantly from conventional behavior, which our theoretical analyses attribute to complex anisotropic electron-photon and electron-phonon interactions. Temperature-dependent Raman measurements further uncover an intriguing phonon decay mechanism involving both three- and four-phonon processes, with the latter showing significant contributions in some modes - a possible manifestation of strong anisotropic electron-phonon interactions. Beyond revealing $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ as an exceptional platform for exploring anisotropic EPIs, this work demonstrates that integrating angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy with DFPT calculations offers a powerful methodology for investigating electron-phonon interactions in emerging low-dimensional quantum materials.</description>

      <title>A Combined DFT and MD Study on Interface Stability in Ferrite-Cementite Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the atomic structure and energetic stability of ferrite-cementite interfaces is essential for optimizing the mechanical performance of steels, especially under extreme conditions such as those encountered in nuclear fusion environments. In this work, we combine Classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) to systematically investigate the stability of ferrite-cementite interfaces within the Bagaryatskii Orientation Relationship. Three interface orientations and several cementite terminations are considered to identify the most stable configurations.
  MD simulations reveal that the (010)||(11-2) and (001)||(1-10) orientations are energetically favourable for selected terminations, and these predictions are validated and refined by subsequent DFT calculations. A key result of our study is the destabilizing effect of interfacial carbon atoms, which increase the interface energy and decrease the Griffith energy, indicating a reduced resistance to fracture. This finding contrasts with earlier reports suggesting a stabilizing role for carbon.
  Our analysis of the electronic structure shows that Fe-C bonding at the interface perturbs the metallic environment of interfacial Fe atoms. This bonding response explains the observed variations in magnetic moment and helps rationalize the trends in interface energy. We also establish correlations between interface energy, magnetic perturbation, and a bond-based descriptor quantifying new and broken bonds. These insights provide a physically grounded, predictive framework for the design and optimization of ferrite-cementite interfaces in advanced steels.</description>

      <title>Microstructural Studies Using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN): a Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generative adversarial network (GAN) is one of the most widely used deep generative models for synthesizing high-quality images with the same statistics as the training set. Finite element method (FEM) based property prediction often relies on synthetically generated microstructures. The phase-field model is a computational method of generating realistic microstructures considering the underlying thermodynamics and kinetics of the material. Due to the expensive nature of the simulations, it is not always feasible to use phase-field for synthetic microstructure generation. In this work, we train a GAN with microstructures generated from the phase-field simulations. Mechanical properties calculated using the finite element method on synthetic and actual phase field microstructures show excellent agreement. Since the GAN model generates thousands of images within seconds, it has the potential to improve the quality of synthetic microstructures needed for FEM calculations or any other applications requiring a large number of realistic synthetic images at minimal computational cost.</description>

      <title>Magnetic aftereffect and Barkhausen effect in thin films of the altermagnetic candidate Mn5Si3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism as a third distinct type of collinear magnetic ordering lately attracts vivid attention. We here study the Hall effect response of micron-scale Hall bars patterned into Mn5Si3 thin films, an altermagnet candidate material. Recording transport data as a function of time, at fixed magnetic field magnitude, we observe a time-dependent relaxation of the Hall voltage qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the magnetic viscosity response well established in ferromagnetic films. In addition, the Hall voltage time traces feature clear unilateral steps, which we interpret as Barkhausen steps, i.e., as experimental evidence for abrupt reorientations of magnetic (Hall vector) domains in the altermagnetic candidate material. A quantitative analysis yields a Barkhausen length of around 18nm in the Hall bar devices with the smallest width of 100 nm.</description>

      <title>Curvature induced modifications of chirality and magnetic configuration in perpendicular magnetized films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing curvature in three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nanostructures enables controlled manipulation of local energy landscapes and subsequent modifications of noncollinear spin textures with unconventional magnetic properties that could be relevant for next-generation spintronic devices. Here, we experimentally investigate 3D spin textures in a Co/Pd multilayer film with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), deposited onto curved Cu nanowire meshes with diameters as small as 50 nm and lengths of several microns. Utilizing magnetic soft X-ray nanotomography at the MISTRAL beamline (ALBA, Spain), we achieve reconstructions of 3D magnetic domain patterns at approximately 30 nm spatial resolution by exploiting XMCD contrast at the Co L3 edge. This approach provides detailed information on both the orientation and magnitude of magnetization within the film. Our results reveal that interfacial anisotropy in the Co/Pd multilayers drives the magnetization to align with the local surface normal. In contrast to typical labyrinthine domains observed in planar films, the presence of curved nanowires significantly alters the domain structure, with domains preferentially aligning along the nanowire axis in close proximity, while adopting random orientations farther away. We report direct experimental observation of curvature induced DMI, which is quantified to be approximately one-third of the intrinsic DMI in Co/Pd stacks. The curvature induced DMI enhances the stability of N\'eel-type domain walls. Micromagnetic simulations support the experimental observations. Our findings demonstrate that introducing curvature into magnetic nanostructures provides a powerful strategy for tailoring complex magnetic behaviors, paving the way for the design of advanced 3D racetrack memory and neuromorphic computing devices.</description>

      <title>Exciton-polariton condensates in van der Waals magnetic microwires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiparticle condensates are among the most spectacular solid-state manifestations of quantum physics. Coupling macroscopic real-space wave functions to other degrees of freedom, such as the electron spin, could add valuable control knobs for quantum applications. While creating spin-carrying superconducting condensates has attracted enormous attention, man-made condensates of light-matter hybrids known as exciton-polaritons have lacked a comparable spin-related perspective. Here we open a new door by demonstrating exciton-polariton condensation in the antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr, a van der Waals material with strongly intertwined optical and magnetic properties. Under photoexcitation, CrSBr microwires embedded in an optical cavity show the hallmarks of polariton condensation: a dramatic increase of the emission intensity from an excited laterally confined polariton state by multiple orders of magnitude, spectral narrowing of the emission line, and an intriguing continuous shift of the peak energy. Interferometry evidences an increase of spatial and temporal coherence. The conditions for efficient optical pumping suggest a crucial role of surface excitons and ultrafast polariton-magnon scattering. Our results highlight CrSBr microwires as a promising platform for exploring magnetically tunable polariton condensates, their directional propagation and their potential for spin-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Squeezing and quantum control of antiferromagnetic magnon pseudospin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets have been shown to harbor strong magnon squeezing in equilibrium, making them a potential resource for quantum correlations and entanglement. Recent experiments have also found them to host coherently coupled magnonic excitations forming a magnon pseudospin, in analogy to electronic spin. Here, we delineate the quantum properties of antiferromagnetic magnon pseudospin by accounting for spin non-conserving interactions and going beyond the rotating wave approximation. Employing concrete examples of nickel oxide and hematite, we find strong squeezing of the magnon pseudospin highlighting its important role in determining the eigenmode quantum properties. Via ground state quantum fluctuations engineering, this pseudospin squeezing enables an enhancement and control of coupling between the magnonic modes and other excitations. Finally, we evaluate the quantum superpositions that comprise a squeezed pseudospin ground state and delineate a qubit spectroscopy protocol to detect them. Our results are applicable to any system of coupled bosons and thus introduce quantum fluctuations engineering of a general bosonic pseudospin.</description>

      <title>Theory and computation of thermal-field emission from semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconducting field emitters present some interesting features (e.g.; self-limited electron emission) for both scientific interest and industrial applications. The analysis of experimental results and device design has been restrained by the lack of accurate 3D models for the simulation of thermal-field emission from semiconductors. Here we review and correct the equations of field emission from semiconductors and include them to expand GETELEC (General Tool for Electron Emission Calculations). Our method covers all electron emission regime (field, thermal, and intermediate), aiming to maximise the calculation accuracy while minimising the computational cost. GETELEC-2.0 is able to reproduce the characteristic non-linear I-V curves in Fowler-Nordheim coordinates obtained from semiconductors, giving insights about their nature. As well as providing an explanation to the lack of experimental observation of valence band electrons from semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Thickness Dependence of Coercive Field in Ferroelectric Doped-Hafnium Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric hafnium oxide (${HfO_2}$) exhibits a thickness-dependent coercive field $(E_c)$ behavior that deviates from the trends observed in perovskites and the predictions of Janovec-Kay-Dunn (JKD) theory. Experiments reveal that, in thinner $HfO_2$ films ($&lt;100\,nm$), $E_c$ increases with decreasing thickness but at a slower rate than predicted by the JKD theory. In thicker films, $E_c$ saturates and is independent of thickness. Prior studies attributed the thick film saturation to the thickness-independent grain size, which limits the domain growth. However, the reduced dependence in thinner films is poorly understood. In this work, we expound the reduced thickness dependence of $E_c$, attributing it to the anisotropic crystal structure of the polar orthorhombic (o) phase of $HfO_2$. This phase consists of continuous polar layers (CPL) along one in-plane direction and alternating polar and spacer layers (APSL) along the orthogonal direction. The spacer layers decouple adjacent polar layers along APSL, increasing the energy barrier for domain growth compared to CPL direction. As a result, the growth of nucleated domains is confined to a single polar plane in $HfO_2$, forming half-prolate elliptical cylindrical geometry rather than half-prolate spheroid geometry observed in perovskites. By modeling the nucleation and growth energetics of these confined domains, we derive a modified scaling law of $E_c \propto d^{-1/2}$ for $HfO_2$ that deviates from the classical JKD dependence of $E_c \propto d^{-2/3}$. The proposed scaling agrees well with the experimental trends in coercive field across various ferroelectric $HfO_2$ samples.</description>

      <title>Tuning of altermagnetism by strain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For all collinear altermagnets, we sort out piezomagnetic free-energy invariants allowed in the nonrelativistic limit and relativistic piezomagnetic invariants bilinear in the N\'eel vector $\mathbf{L}$ and magnetization $\mathbf{M}$, which include strain-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The symmetry-allowed responses are fully determined by the nonrelativistic spin Laue group. In the nonrelativistic limit, two distinct mechanisms are discussed: the band-filling mechanism, which exists in metals and is illustrated using the simple two-dimensional Lieb lattice model, and the temperature-dependent exchange-driven mechanism, which is illustrated using first-principles calculations for transition-metal fluorides. The leading second-order nonrelativistic term in the strain-induced magnetization is also obtained for CrSb. Piezomagnetism due to the strain-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is calculated from first principles for transition-metal fluorides, MnTe, and CrSb. Finally, we discuss triplet superconducting correlations supported by altermagnets and protected by inversion rather than time-reversal symmetry. We apply the nonrelativistic classification of Cooper pairs to describe the interplay between strain and superconductivity in the two-dimensional Lieb lattice and in bulk rutile structures. We show that triplet superconductivity is, on average, unitary in an unstrained altermagnet, but becomes non-unitary under piezomagnetically active strain.</description>

      <title>Hyperelastic characterization via deep indentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperelastic material characterization is crucial for understanding the behavior of soft materials, such as tissues, rubbers, hydrogels, and polymers, under quasi-static loading before failure. Traditional methods typically rely on uniaxial tensile tests, which require the cumbersome preparation of dumbbell-shaped samples for clamping in a uniaxial testing machine. In contrast, indentation-based methods, which can be conducted in situ without sample preparation, have been underexplored. To characterize the hyperelastic behavior of soft materials, deep indentation is required, where the material response extends beyond linear elasticity. In this study, we perform finite element analysis to link the force (F) vs. indentation depth (D) curve with the hyperelastic behavior of a soft incompressible material, using a one-term Ogden model for simplicity. We identify three indentation regimes based on the ratio between indentation depth and the radius (R) of the spherical-tipped cylindrical indenter: (1) the Hertzian regime (D&lt;0.1 R) with F=ER^0.5 D^1.5 16/9, (2) the parabolic regime (D&gt;10 R) with F=ED^2 \b{eta}, where the indenter radius becomes irrelevant, and (3) an intermediate regime (0.1 R&lt;D&lt;10 R) bridging the two extremes. We find that the Ogden strain-stiffening coefficient ({\alpha}) increases the parabolic indentation coefficient (\b{eta}), allowing for the estimation of {\alpha} from \b{eta}. Furthermore, we observe that Coulomb friction increases \b{eta}, potentially masking the effect of strain-stiffening for small {\alpha}. However, for {\alpha}&gt;3, friction has a negligible effect. Finally, our results show good agreement with experimental data, demonstrating that deep indentation can be an effective method for extracting hyperelastic properties from soft materials through in-situ testing.</description>

      <title>All-electrically controlled spintronics in altermagnetic heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent development of altermagnetic materials, supporting spin splitting without net magnetization, opens new directions for spintronics that are fundamentally distinct from conventional ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, or spin-orbit coupling systems. Here we investigate spin-selective quantum transport in heterostructures composed of a normal metal and a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet. We focus on two types of $d$-wave altermagnets, namely, weak and strong altermagnets that support close elliptic and open hyperbolic spin-resolved Fermi surfaces, respectively. Building on these distinct electronic structures, we propose all-electrically controlled spin filter and spin valve devices, where quantum resonant tunneling enables highly spin-polarized conductance tunable via gate voltage and interface transparency. In particular, we find that strong altermagnets allow gate-tunable full spin polarization that is robust against interface scattering and can be reversed by gate control. We further demonstrate that a double-gated spin valve electrically switches between parallel and antiparallel spin configurations, analogous to magnetic junctions but without the need for external magnetic fields. Our results establish both weak and strong altermagnets as promising platforms for realizing magnetic-field-free electrically tunable spintronic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Impact of Temporally Correlated Dephasing Noise on the Fidelity of the 2-Qubit Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the influence of realistic noise on quantum algorithms is paramount for the advancement of quantum computation. While often modeled as Markovian, environmental noise in quantum systems frequently exhibits temporal correlations, leading to non-Markovian dynamics that can significantly alter algorithmic performance. This paper investigates the impact of temporally correlated dephasing noise, modeled by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, on the fidelity of the 2-qubit Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. We perform numerical simulations using Qiskit, systematically varying the noise strength ($\sigma_{\text{OU}}$) and correlation time ($\tau_c$) of the OU process. Our results demonstrate that the algorithm's fidelity exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on $\tau_c$, particularly at higher noise strengths, with certain intermediate correlation times proving more detrimental than others. We find that a standard Markovian dephasing model, matched to the single-step error variance of the OU process, accurately predicts fidelity only in the limit of very short correlation times. For longer correlation times, the Markovian approximation often overestimates the algorithm's fidelity, failing to capture the complex error dynamics introduced by the noise memory. These findings highlight the necessity of incorporating non-Markovian characteristics for accurate performance assessment of quantum algorithms on near-term devices and underscore the limitations of simpler, memoryless noise models.</description>

      <title>Toward Greater Autonomy in Materials Discovery Agents: Unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim at designing language agents with greater autonomy for crystal materials discovery. While most of existing studies restrict the agents to perform specific tasks within predefined workflows, we aim to automate workflow planning given high-level goals and scientist intuition. To this end, we propose Materials Agent unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists, known as MAPPS. MAPPS consists of a Workflow Planner, a Tool Code Generator, and a Scientific Mediator. The Workflow Planner uses large language models (LLMs) to generate structured and multi-step workflows. The Tool Code Generator synthesizes executable Python code for various tasks, including invoking a force field foundation model that encodes physics. The Scientific Mediator coordinates communications, facilitates scientist feedback, and ensures robustness through error reflection and recovery. By unifying planning, physics, and scientists, MAPPS enables flexible and reliable materials discovery with greater autonomy, achieving a five-fold improvement in stability, uniqueness, and novelty rates compared with prior generative models when evaluated on the MP-20 data. We provide extensive experiments across diverse tasks to show that MAPPS is a promising framework for autonomous materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Magnetic excitations in the 1/3 plateau state in InCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic dynamics in InCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_3$ was investigated from the NMR relaxation rate measurement. In InCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_3$, the magnetization isotherm shows a plateau at the 1/3 of full-saturation magnetization, characterizing the 1/3 plateau state. As the 1/3 plateau state appears above 7 T upto 14 T, the microscopic magnetic properties were investigated with the NMR measurement in steady fields. The temperature and field dependence of $1/T_1$ measurement reveals a gap in the magnetic excitation spectrum and its evolution with field in the 1/3 plateau state. The field dependence of spin gap provides an important information to understand the microscopic origin of 1/3 plateau state in the kagome antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Application-specific Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials: Exploring the Trade-off Between Precision and Computational Cost</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are revolutionizing computational materials science and chemistry by offering an efficient alternative to {\em ab initio} molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, fitting high-quality MLIPs remains a challenging, time-consuming, and computationally intensive task where numerous trade-offs have to be considered, e.g. How much and what kind of atomic configurations should be included in the training set? Which level of {\em ab initio} convergence should be used to generate the training set? Which loss function should be used for fitting the MLIP? Which machine learning architecture should be used to train the MLIP? The answers to these questions significantly impact both the computational cost of MLIP training and the accuracy and computational cost of subsequent MLIP MD simulations. In this study, we highlight that simultaneously considering training set selection strategies, energy versus force weighting, precision of the {\em ab initio} reference simulations, as well as model complexity and computational cost of MLIPs can lead to a significant reduction in the overall computational cost associated with training and evaluating MLIPs. This opens the door to computationally efficient generation of high-quality MLIPs for a range of applications which demand different accuracy versus training and evaluation cost trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Defect-free and defective adaptations of crystalline sheets to stretching deformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elastic response of the crystalline sheet to the stretching deformation in the form of wrinkles has been extensively investigated. In this work, we extend this fundamental scientific question to the plastic regime by exploring the adaptations of crystalline sheets to the large uniaxial mechanical stretching. We reveal the intermittent plastic shear deformations leading to the complete fracture of the sheets wrapping the cylinder. Specifically, systematic investigations of crystalline sheets of varying geometry show that the fracture processes can be classified into defect-free and defective categories depending on the emergence of topological defects. We highlight the characteristic mechanical and geometric patterns in response to the large stretching deformation, including the shear-driven intermittent lattice tilting, the vortex structure in the displacement field, and the emergence of mobile and anchored dislocations as plastic excitations. The effects of noise and initial lattice orientation on the plastic deformation of the stretched crystalline sheet are also discussed. These results advance our understanding of the atomic level on the irreversible plastic instabilities of 2D crystals under large uniaxial stretching and may have potential practical implications in the precise engineering of structural instabilities in packings of covalently bonded particulate systems.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for in-situ composition mapping in a self-driving magnetron sputtering system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-driving labs (SDLs), employing automation and machine learning (ML) to accelerate experimental procedures, have enormous potential in the discovery of new materials. However, in thin film science, SDLs are mainly restricted to solution-based synthetic methods which are easier to automate but cannot access the broad chemical space of inorganic materials. This work presents an SDL based on magnetron co-sputtering. We are using combinatorial frameworks, obtaining accurate composition maps on multi-element, compositionally graded thin films. This normally requires time-consuming ex-situ analysis prone to systematic errors. We present a rapid and calibration-free in-situ, ML driven approach to produce composition maps for arbitrary source combinations and sputtering conditions. We develop a method to predict the composition distribution in a multi-element combinatorial thin film, using in-situ measurements from quartz-crystal microbalance sensors placed in a sputter chamber. For a given source, the sensor readings are learned as a function of the sputtering pressure and magnetron power, through active learning using Gaussian processes (GPs). The final GPs are combined with a geometric model of the deposition flux distribution in the chamber, which allows interpolation of the deposition rates from each source, at any position across the sample. We investigate several acquisition functions for the ML procedure. A fully Bayesian GP - BALM (Bayesian active learning MacKay) - achieved the best performance, learning the deposition rates for a single source in 10 experiments. Prediction accuracy for co-sputtering composition distributions was verified experimentally. Our framework dramatically increases throughput by avoiding the need for extensive characterisation or calibration, thus demonstrating the potential of ML-guided SDLs to accelerate materials exploration.</description>

      <title>Field-induced magnetic order in DyTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with two-dimensional pseudospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic ground state of geometrically frustrated antiferromagnet attracts great research interests due to the possibility to realize novel quantum magnetic state such as a quantum spin liquid. Here we present a comprehensive magnetic characterization of DyTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with ideal two-dimensional triangular lattice. DyTa$_7$O$_{19}$ exhibits $c$-axis single-ion magnetic anisotropy. Although long-range magnetic order is not observed down to 100 mK under zero field, by applying a small magnetic field ($\sim$0.1 T), a magnetically ordered state with net magnetization of $M_s$/3 below $T_m$=0.14 K is identified ($M_s$ denotes the saturated magnetization). We argue that this state is an up-up-down magnetic structure phase driven by the dipole-dipole interactions between Ising-like spins of Dy$^{3+}$ in a two-dimensional triangular lattice, since its ordering temperature and temperature-field phase diagram can be well explained by the theoretical calculations based on dipolar interactions. DyTa$_7$O$_{19}$ could be viewed as a rare material platform that realizing pure Ising-like dipolar interaction in a geometrically frustrated lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creep tests on heterogeneous materials under subcritical loading typically show a power-law decaying strain rate before failure, with the exponent often considered material-dependent but independent of applied stress. By imposing successive small stress relaxations through a displacement feedback loop, we probe creep dynamics and show experimentally that this exponent varies with both applied load and loading direction. Simulations of a disordered fiber bundle model reproduce this load dependence, demonstrating that such models capture essential features of delayed rupture dynamics.</description>

      <title>Correlated Structural and Optical Characterization during Van der Waals Epitaxy of PbI2 on Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures of 2D layered materials have gained much attention due to their flexible electronic properties, which make them promising candidates for energy, sensing, catalytic, and biomedical applications. Lead iodide (PbI2), a 2D layered semiconductor material belonging to the metal halide family, shows a thickness-dependent band gap with an indirect-to-direct transition above one monolayer. It has emerged as an excellent candidate for photodetectors and is a key component in metal halide perovskites solar cells. In the current work, we investigated the growth dynamics and the real-time correlation between structural and optical properties of PbI2 layers deposited on graphene/SiC(0001) by Molecular Beam Epitaxy. The structural and optical properties are probed respectively by Grazing Incidence Fast Atom Diffraction and Surface Differential Reflectance Spectroscopy. The growth proceeds layer-by-layer in a van der Waals-like epitaxy, with the zigzag direction of PbI2 parallel to the armchair direction of graphene. Both techniques bring evidence of significant modifications of the structural, electronic, and optical properties of the first PbI2 monolayer, characterized by a 1% tensile strain that relaxes over 3 to 5 monolayers. For a single monolayer, Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy reveals a charge transfer from graphene to PbI2, demonstrated by an energy shift of the order of 50 meV in the graphene band structure.</description>

      <title>Accurate and efficient predictions of keyhole dynamics in laser materials processing using machine learning-aided simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The keyhole phenomenon has been widely observed in laser materials processing, including laser welding, remelting, cladding, drilling, and additive manufacturing. Keyhole-induced defects, primarily pores, dramatically affect the performance of final products, impeding the broad use of these laser-based technologies. The formation of these pores is typically associated with the dynamic behavior of the keyhole. So far, the accurate characterization and prediction of keyhole features, particularly keyhole depth, as a function of time, has been a challenging task. In situ characterization of keyhole dynamic behavior using the synchrotron X-ray technique is informative but complicated and expensive. Current simulations are generally hindered by their poor accuracy and generalization abilities in predicting keyhole depths due to the lack of accurate laser absorptance data. In this study, we develop a machine learning-aided simulation method that accurately predicts keyhole dynamics, especially in keyhole depth fluctuations, over a wide range of processing parameters. In two case studies involving titanium and aluminum alloys, we achieve keyhole depth prediction with a mean absolute percentage error of 10%, surpassing those simulated using the ray-tracing method with an error margin of 30%, while also reducing computational time. This exceptional fidelity and efficiency empower our model to serve as a cost-effective alternative to synchrotron experiments. Our machine learning-aided simulation method is affordable and readily deployable for a large variety of materials, opening new doors to eliminate or reduce defects for a wide range of laser materials processing techniques.</description>

      <title>An Investigation into the Thermoelectric Characteristics of Silver-based Chalcopyrites Utilizing a Non-empirical Range-separated Dielectric-dependent Hybrid Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our investigation explores the intricate domain of thermoelectric phenomena within silver (Ag)-infused chalcopyrites, focusing on compositions such as AgXTe$_2$ (where X=Ga, In) and the complex quaternary system Ag$_2$ZnSn/GeY$_2$ (with Y=S, Se). Using a sophisticated combination of methodologies, we integrate a non-empirical screened dielectric-dependent hybrid (DDH) functional with semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. This approach allows us to conduct a detailed analysis of critical thermoelectric properties, including electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and power factor. Our methodology goes beyond superficial assessments, delving into the intricate interplay of material properties to reveal their true thermoelectric potential. Additionally, we investigate the often-overlooked phenomena of phonon scattering by leveraging both the elastic constant tensor and the deformation potential method. This enables a rigorous examination of electron relaxation time and lattice thermal conductivity, enhancing the robustness of our predictions and demonstrating our commitment to thorough exploration.Through our rigorous investigation, we identify materials with a thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT = $\sigma S^{2}T/ \kappa$) exceeding the critical threshold of unity. This significant achievement signals the discovery of materials capable of revolutionizing efficient thermoelectric systems. Our findings delineate a promising trajectory, laying the groundwork for the emergence of a new class of Ag-based chalcopyrites distinguished by their exceptional thermoelectric characteristics. This research not only contributes to the understanding of materials science principles but also catalyzes transformative advancements in thermoelectric technology.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Bandgap in Nano-Scale Graphite: A Computational and Experimental Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14244v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bandgaps in layered materials are critical for enabling functionalities such as tunable photodetection, efficient energy conversion, and nonlinear optical responses, which are essential for next-generation photonic and quantum devices. Gap engineering could form heterostructures with complementary materials like transition metal dichalcogenides or perovskites for multi-functional devices. Graphite, conventionally regarded as a gapless material, exhibits a bandgap of ~100 meV in nano-scale patterned highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), as revealed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and Raman measurements. Our state-of-the-art calculations, incorporating photoemission matrix element effects, predict this bandgap with remarkable accuracy and attribute it to mechanical distortions introduced during patterning. This work bridges theory and experiment, providing the direct evidence of a tunable bandgap in HOPG. Beyond its fundamental significance, this finding opens new possibilities for designing materials with tailored electronic properties, enabling advancements in terahertz devices and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Learning the Electronic Hamiltonian of Large Atomic Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in learning the ground-state electronic properties of materials, subverting ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations when the underlying lattices can be represented as small and/or repeatable unit cells (i.e., molecules and periodic crystals). Realistic systems are, however, non-ideal and generally characterized by higher structural complexity. As such, they require large (10+ Angstroms) unit cells and thousands of atoms to be accurately described. At these scales, DFT becomes computationally prohibitive, making GNNs especially attractive. In this work, we present a strictly local equivariant GNN capable of learning the electronic Hamiltonian (H) of realistically extended materials. It incorporates an augmented partitioning approach that enables training on arbitrarily large structures while preserving local atomic environments beyond boundaries. We demonstrate its capabilities by predicting the electronic Hamiltonian of various systems with up to 3,000 nodes (atoms), 500,000+ edges, ~28 million orbital interactions (nonzero entries of H), and $\leq$0.53% error in the eigenvalue spectra. Our work expands the applicability of current electronic property prediction methods to some of the most challenging cases encountered in computational materials science, namely systems with disorder, interfaces, and defects.</description>

      <title>The role of effective mass and long-range interactions in the band-gap renormalization of photo-excited semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how to control changes in electronic structure and related dynamical renormalizations by external driving fields is the key for understanding ultrafast spectroscopy and applications in electronics. Here we focus on the band-gap's modulation by external electric fields and uncover the effect of band dispersion on the gap renormalization. We employ the Green's function formalism using the real-time Dyson expansion to account for dynamical correlations induced by photodoping. The many-body formalism captures the dynamics of systems with long-range interactions, carrier mobility, and variable electron and hole effective mass. We also demonstrate that mean-field simulations based on the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian, which lacks dynamical correlations, yields a qualitatively incorrect picture of band-gap renormalization. We find the trend that increasing effective mass, thus decreasing mobility, leads to as much as a 6\% enhancement in band-gap renormalization. Further, the renormalization is strongly dependent on the degree of photodoping. As the screening induced by free electrons and holes effectively reduces any long-range and interband interactions for highly excited systems, we show that there is a specific turnover point with minimal band-gap. We further demonstrate that the optical gap renormalization follows the same trend though its magnitude is altered by the Moss-Burstein effect.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive landscape and simple rules for transition-metal Heusler semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heusler alloys, renowned for their multifunctionality and capacity for vast elemental customization, are primarily classified into half-Heusler (XYZ) and full-Heusler (X2YZ) structural types. Typically, the 18-electron half-Heusler and the 24-electron full-Heusler alloys are recognized as semiconductors, following the Slater-Pauling rule. Semiconductors are desired for many applications, but they represent a minor portion compared to the predominantly metallic and half-metallic members of the Heusler family. Recently, vacancy-filling off-stoichiometric Heuslers of ternary X1+bYZ (0 &lt;= b &lt;= 1) and quaternary XaX'bYZ (1 &lt;= a + b &lt;= 2) have emerged as a more versatile strategy. However, the flexibility associated with off-stoichiometry inevitably leads to complications, including issues with fractional filling ratios and complex site occupations. This work presents a comprehensive landscape of transition-metal-containing Heusler semiconductors, focusing on the off-stoichiometric Heuslers but seamlessly encompassing the integer-stoichiometric systems. The structural and electronic properties can be theoretically understood through a few simple rules. Many systems have been experimentally validated, showcasing their potential for applications such as thermoelectric converters.</description>

      <title>Roadmap on Advancements of the FHI-aims Software Package</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic-structure theory is the foundation of the description of materials including multiscale modeling of their properties and functions. Obviously, without sufficient accuracy at the base, reliable predictions are unlikely at any level that follows. The software package FHI-aims has proven to be a game changer for accurate free-energy calculations because of its scalability, numerical precision, and its efficient handling of density functional theory (DFT) with hybrid functionals and van der Waals interactions. It treats molecules, clusters, and extended systems (solids and liquids) on an equal footing. Besides DFT, FHI-aims also includes quantum-chemistry methods, descriptions for excited states and vibrations, and calculations of various types of transport. Recent advancements address the integration of FHI-aims into an increasing number of workflows and various artificial intelligence (AI) methods. This Roadmap describes the state-of-the-art of FHI-aims and advancements that are currently ongoing or planned.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the hybrid piezo and pyroelectric nanogenerators performance by SiO2 nanowires confinement in poly(vinylidene fluoride)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the development of a novel flexible piezo/pyro-electric nanogenerator (PPNG) that combines a uniform film of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) infiltrated over vertically supported SiO2 nanowires (NWs) to enhance both piezoelectric and pyroelectric energy harvesting capabilities. The synthetic procedure involves a low-temperature multi-step approach, including the soft-template formation of SiO2 NWs on a flexible substrate, followed by the infiltration of a PVDF thin film (TF). The plasma-enabled fabrication of SiO2 NWs facilitated vertical alignment and precise control over the surface microstructure, density, and thickness of the confined nanostructures. These strategic structural systems promote the development of the most favourable electroactive \b{eta}- and {\gamma}-phases in the PVDF matrix. Notably, the electrical poling plays a major role in aligning the random dipoles of the PVDF macromolecular chain in a more ordered fashion to nucleate the amplified electroactive phases. As a proof-of-concept, the fabricated PPNG exhibited a significant improvement in the instantaneous piezoelectric output power density (P), ~ 9-fold amplification relative to its bare PVDF TF counterpart. Analogously, the pyroelectric coefficient (p) demonstrated a 4-fold superior performance with referenced PVDF TF based PPNG. Thus, the engineered system of SiO2 NWs@PVDF comprising PPNG offers a promising pathway toward multisource energy harvesting capabilities through efficient energy transduction at mechanical excitation frequencies of 10-12 Hz and across a temperature difference ({\Delta}T) of 9 to 22 K.</description>

      <title>Efficient launch of shear phonons in photostrictive halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical generation of transverse coherent phonons by femtosecond light pulses is appealing for high-speed sub-THz active control of material properties. Lead-free double perovskite semiconductors, such as Cs2AgBiBr6, attract particular interest due to their cubic to tetragonal phase transition below room temperature and strong polaron effects from carrier-lattice coupling. Here, we reveal that the anisotropic photostriction in halide perovskites with tetragonal crystal structure represents an efficient non-thermal tool for generating transverse coherent phonons. In particular, we demonstrate that along with compressive strain, optical generation of photoexcited carriers leads to strong shear strain in Cs2AgBiBr6 below the phase transition temperature of 122 K. Using time-domain Brillouin spectroscopy, we observe coherent transverse and longitudinal acoustic phonons with comparable amplitudes in the tetragonal phase, while in the cubic phase only longitudinal phonons are generated. The polarization of the photoinduced transverse phonons is dictated by the projection of the c-axis on the surface plane, which leads to a prominent anisotropic polarization response in the detection. The generated strain pulses correspond to transverse acoustic soft eigenmodes with a strong temperature dependence of dispersion, which provides an additional degree of freedom for active hypersonic control.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast intrinsic optical-to-electrical conversion dynamics in graphene photodetector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.05752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical-to-electrical (O-E) conversion in graphene is a central phenomenon for realizing anticipated ultrafast and low-power-consumption information technologies. However, revealing its mechanism and intrinsic time scale require uncharted terahertz (THz) electronics and device architectures. Here, we succeeded in resolving O-E conversion processes in high-quality graphene by on-chip electrical readout of ultrafast photothermoelectric current. By suppressing the RC time constant using a resistive zinc oxide top gate, we constructed a gate-tunable graphene photodetector with a bandwidth of up to 220 GHz. By measuring nonlocal photocurrent dynamics, we found that the photocurrent extraction from the electrode is instantaneous without a measurable carrier transit time across several-micrometer-long graphene, following the Shockley-Ramo theorem. The time for photocurrent generation is exceptionally tunable from immediate to &gt; 4 ps, and its origin is identified as Fermi-level-dependent intraband carrier-carrier scattering. Our results bridge the gap between ultrafast optical science and device engineering, accelerating ultrafast graphene optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>On-chip transfer of ultrashort graphene plasmon wavepackets using terahertz electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Steering transport of ultrashort polariton wavepackets is essential for achieving on-chip integrated nanocircuits with tightly confined electromagnetic fields towards ultrafast information processing. However, conventional optical techniques have struggled to integrate the necessary components for transferring polariton signals. Here, we address this challenge by electrically generating, manipulating, and reading out terahertz graphene plasmon-polariton wavepackets on-chip. By injecting an electrical pulse into graphene via an ohmic contact, we achieve coherent conversion of the pulse into a plasmon wavepacket exhibiting a pulse duration of 1.2 ps and extreme three-dimensional spatial confinement within a volume of $2.1 \times 10^{-18} m^3$. We reveal the transport properties of plasmons along graphene ribbons in different dielectric environments, providing a basis for designing graphene plasmonic circuits. Furthermore, we find that the conversion efficiency between the electrical pulses and plasmon wavepackets reaches ~30% thanks to the absence of a momentum mismatch. With unprecedented controllability, our platform represents a significant advance in on-chip handling of plasmonic signals in various van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Thermally activated detection of dark particles in a weakly coupled quantum Ising ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ising$_h^2$ integrable field theory emerges when two quantum critical Ising chains are weakly coupled. This theory possesses eight types of relativistic particles, among which the lightest one ($B_1$) has been predicted to be a dark particle, which cannot be excited from the ground state through (quasi-)local operations. The stability on one hand highlights its potential for applications, and on the other hand makes it challenging to be observed. Here, we point out that the mass of the $B_1$ dark particle $m_{B_1}$ appears as a thermally activated gap extracted from local spin dynamical structure factor at low frequency ($\omega \ll m_{B_1}$) and low temperatures ($T \ll m_{B_1}$). We then further propose that this gapped behavior can be directly detected via the NMR relaxation rate measurement in a proper experimental setup. Our results provide a practical criterion for verifying the existence of dark particles.</description>

      <title>Electrical magnetochiral anisotropy and quantum metric in chiral conductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (EMCA) refers to the chirality- and current-dependent nonlinear magnetoresistance in chiral conductors and is commonly interpreted in a semiclassical picture. In this work, we reveal a quantum geometry origin of EMCA using a chiral rectangular lattice model that resembles a chiral organic conductor (DM-EDT-TTF)${}_2$ClO${}_4$ studied for EMCA recently and exhibits symmetry-protected Dirac bands similar to those of graphene. Compared to the semiclassical term, we find that Dirac states contribute significantly to both traditional longitudinal EMCA and the unconventional transverse EMCA via the quantum metric when Fermi energy is close to the Dirac point. Besides, we discover that a topological insulator state can emerge once spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is added to our chiral model lattice. Our work paves a path toward understanding quantum geometry in the magnetotransport of chiral materials.</description>

      <title>On the origin of heating-induced softening and enthalpic reinforcement in elastomeric nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite a century of use, the mechanism of nanoparticle-driven mechanical reinforcement of elastomers is unresolved. A major hypothesis attributes it to glassy interparticle bridges, supported by an observed inversion of the variation of the modulus E(T) on heating -- from entropic stiffening in elastomers to enthalpic softening in nanocomposites. Here, molecular simulations reveal that elastomer enthalpic softening can instead emerge from a competition over preferred nonequilibrium volumes between elastomer and nanoparticulate networks. A theory for this competition accounting for softening of the bulk modulus on heating predicts the simulated E(T) inversion, suggesting that reinforcement is driven by a volume-competition mechanism unique to co-continuous systems of soft and rigid networks.</description>
