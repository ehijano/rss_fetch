      <title>Inverse Design in Nanophotonics via Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse design in nanophotonics, the computational discovery of structures achieving targeted electromagnetic (EM) responses, has become a key tool for recent optical advances. Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization methods struggle with the inherently high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces and the substantial computational demands of EM simulations. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged to address these bottlenecks effectively. This review frames ML-enhanced inverse design methodologies through the lens of representation learning, classifying them into two categories: output-side and input-side approaches. Output-side methods use ML to learn a representation in the solution space to create a differentiable solver that accelerates optimization. Conversely, input-side techniques employ ML to learn compact, latent-space representations of feasible device geometries, enabling efficient global exploration through generative models. Each strategy presents unique trade-offs in data requirements, generalization capacity, and novel design discovery potentials. Hybrid frameworks that combine physics-based optimization with data-driven representations help escape poor local optima, improve scalability, and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and opportunities, emphasizing complexity management, geometry-independent representations, integration of fabrication constraints, and advancements in multiphysics co-designs.</description>

      <title>Advancing Atmospheric Pollution Monitoring with Airborne THz Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study details the development and validation of an airborne THz spectrometer designed for real-time, remote detection of atmospheric pollutants. The platform couples a stabilized unmanned aerial system (UAS) with a high-resolution terahertz continuous-wave (THz-CW) laser source and detector, enabling flexible, in situ spectroscopic analysis of dispersed atmospheric vapours. This proof-of-concept investigation confirms the feasibility of UAS-THz-CW systems for spatially resolved environmental pollutant monitoring. The demonstrated capability of this terahertz sensor for remote, multi-component detection of atmospheric contaminants holds significant potential for advancing air pollutant monitoring technologies, providing a pathway for more effective and portable detection. This advancement can contribute to the necessary alert actions for minimizing contaminants impacting public and environmental health, thereby safeguarding human and ecosystem health.</description>

      <title>Earth's field diamond vector magnetometry with isotropic magnetic flux concentrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector magnetometers based on the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond are being developed for applications such as navigation and geomagnetism. However, at low magnetic fields, such as that on Earth (~50 {\mu}T), diamond magnetometers suffer from spectral congestion whereby ODMR peaks are not easily resolved. Here, we experimentally investigate a potential solution of using an isotropic, three-dimensional magnetic flux concentrator to amplify Earth's field without altering its direction. The concentrator consists of six ferrite cones, in a face-centered cubic arrangement, centered about a diamond. We vary the direction of a 50 {\mu}T applied field and record and fit the resulting ODMR spectra. By comparing the fitted fields to those of a reference fluxgate magnetometer, we characterize the angular response of the diamond magnetometer and quantify absolute errors in the field magnitude and angle. We find that the enhancement factor is nearly isotropic, with a mean of 19.05 and a standard deviation of 0.16, when weighted by solid angle coverage. Gradient broadening of the ODMR lines is sufficiently small that the spectra are well resolved for nearly all field directions, alleviating spectral congestion. For ~98% of the total 4{\pi} solid angle, Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds for magnetic field estimation uncertainty are within a factor of 2 of those of the fully-resolved case, indicating minimal deadzones. We track the stability of the magnetometer over six hours and observe variations less than or approximately 40 nT/hour, limited by temperature drift. Our study presents a new route for diamond vector magnetometry at Earth's field, with potential applications in geomagnetic surveys, anomaly detection, and navigation.</description>

      <title>Origami of Multi-Layered Spaced Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) origami tessellations such as the Miura-ori are often generalized to build three-dimensional (3D) architected materials with sandwich or cellular structures. However, such 3D blocks are densely packed with continuity of the internal material, while for many engineering structures with multi-physical functionality, it is necessary to have thin sheets that are separately spaced and sparsely connected. This work presents a framework for the design and analysis of multi-layered spaced origami, which provides an origami solution for 3D structures where multiple flat sheets are intentionally spaced apart. We connect Miura-ori sheets with sparsely installed thin-sheet parallelogram-like linkages. To explore how this connectivity approach affects the behavior of the origami system, we model the rigid-folding kinematics using analytic trigonometry and rigid-body transformations, and we characterize the elastic-folding mechanics by generalizing a reduced order bar and hinge model for these 3D assemblies. The orientation of the linkages in the multi-layered spaced origami determines which of three folding paths the system will follow including a flat foldable type, a self-locking type, and a double-branch type. When the origami is flat foldable, a maximized packing ratio and a uniform in-plane shear stiffness can be achieved by strategically choosing the link orientation. We show possible applications by demonstrating how the multi-layered spaced origami can be used to build deployable acoustic cloaks and heat shields.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Driven Giant Electrostatic Modulation of Ion Permeation in Atomically Small Capillaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulating the electrostatic double layer and tuning the conductance in nanofluidic systems at salt concentrations of 100 mM or higher has been a persistent challenge. The primary reasons are (i) the short electrostatic proximity length, ~3-10 {\AA}, and (ii) difficulties in fabricating atomically small capillaries. Here, we successfully fabricate in-plane vermiculite laminates with transport heights of ~3-5 {\AA}, which exhibit a cation selectivity close to 1 even at a 1000 mM concentration, suggesting an overlapping electrostatic double layer. For gate voltages from -2 V to +1 V, the K+-intercalated vermiculite shows a remarkable conductivity modulation exceeding 1400% at a 1000 mM KCl concentration. The gated ON/OFF ratio is mostly unaffected by the ion concentration (10-1000 mM), which confirms that the electrostatic double layer overlaps with the collective ion movement within the channel with reduced activation energy. In contrast, vermiculite laminates intercalated with Ca2+ and Al3+ ions display reduced conductance with increasing negative gate voltage, highlighting the importance of ion-specific gating effects under {\AA}-scale confinement. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of electrostatic phenomena occurring in highly confined fluidic channels, opening the way to the exploration of the vast library of two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio-NEGF Fundamental Roadmap for Carbon-Nanotube and Two-Dimensional-Material MOSFETs at the Scaling and VDD Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using accurate Hybrid-Functional DFT coupled with the Non-Equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, we explore and benchmark the fundamental scaling limits of CNT-FETs against Si and 2D-material MoS$_2$ and HfS$_2$ Nanosheets, highlighting their potential for gate length (L) and supply voltage (VDD) scaling down to 5 nm and to 0.5 V, respectively. The highest drive current is achieved by CNT-FETs with sub 1.3 nm diameters down to $L = 9$ nm and using VDD in the 0.45-0.5V range. Below $L = 9$ nm, however, the HfS$_2$ NS offers the best drive and could further scale down to $L = 5$ nm with a reduced VDD of 0.5 V.</description>

      <title>Cascade of Modal Interactions in Nanomechanical Resonators with Soft Clamping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cascades of dynamical phenomena, where energy and motion transfer across coupled degrees of freedom, underlie complex behavior in physical systems spanning multiple time and length scales. Here, we demonstrate that soft-clamping techniques commonly employed to enhance the quality factor of nanomechanical resonators, can also be harnessed to engineer cascaded energy transfer conditions, enabling the sequential excitation of an increasing number of coupled vibrational modes during frequency sweeps. Using Si3N4 nanostrings with soft-clamping supports, we identify the conditions for mode coupling and obtain interactions among five flexural resonances , achieving a quasi-constant amplitude of the targeted resonant response over a broad frequency range. Analytical and nonlinear reduced-order models reveal that soft clamping can not only facilitate a sequence of interactions, but also amplify the geometric nonlinearity of the driven mode, enhancing effective spring hardening by more than an order of magnitude through dispersive couplings. This ability to activate and control energy flow in nanomechanical systems offers a strategy for realizing programmable nonlinear dynamics for next-generation resonators.</description>

      <title>Holographic hyperbranched polymer nanocomposite grating with exceptionally large neutron scattering length density modulation amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoparticle-polymer composite gratings incorporating ultrahigh-refractive-index hyperbranched polymers as organic nanoparticles have demonstrated exceptional light optical properties, yet their potential for neutron diffraction applications remains unexplored. We report on the neutron optical properties of a holographically structured hyperbranched-polymer-dispersed nanocomposite grating at a quasi-monochromatic neutron wavelength of 2 nm. We show that neutron diffraction measurements performed at the SANS-I instrument of the Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland) reveal exceptionally high neutron scattering length density modulation amplitudes. These scattering length density modulation amplitudes are the highest reported to date. Very high neutron diffraction efficiency is expected with the use of thicker uniform gratings and longer neutron wavelengths, with low angular and wavelength selectivity constraints.</description>
