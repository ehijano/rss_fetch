      <title>Solar activity and extreme rainfall over Kerala, India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the relationship between solar activity and extreme rainfall events in Kerala, India. Kerala receives minimum and maximum rainfall during the winter and monsoon seasons, respectively. Sunspot number, F10.7 Index, and cosmic ray intensity are the solar indices considered and their variations with rainfall were studied over a period of 57 years (1965-2021), i.e., starting from Solar Cycle 20. For each solar cycle, correlative studies are performed and correlation coefficients are calculated. We find that rainfall in Kerala is correlated with sunspot activity, but with varying degrees of significance. During Solar Cycle 21, rainfall and solar activity are correlated with high significance during both winter and monsoon seasons. The variation of different solar indices with rainfall is studied. The winter season showed a better link between the sun and rainfall than the monsoon season. The years with rainfall surplus and deficiency are calculated and compared with the solar indices. We find that the years with rainfall excess and deficit mostly occur in the years around solar maximum or minimum (within $\pm$2 years). We hypothesise a physical relationship between solar activity and extreme rainfall events in Kerala that contributes to their predictability.</description>

      <title>Spatial analysis of tails of air pollution PDFs in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outdoor air pollution is estimated to cause a huge number of premature deaths worldwide, it catalyses many diseases on a variety of time scales, and it has a detrimental effect on the environment. In light of these impacts it is necessary to obtain a better understanding of the dynamics and statistics of measured air pollution concentrations, including temporal fluctuations of observed concentrations and spatial heterogeneities. Here we present an extensive analysis for measured data from Europe. The observed probability density functions (PDFs) of air pollution concentrations depend very much on the spatial location and on the pollutant substance. We analyse a large number of time series data from 3544 different European monitoring sites and show that the PDFs of nitric oxide ($NO$), nitrogen dioxide ($NO_{2}$) and particulate matter ($PM_{10}$ and $PM_{2.5}$) concentrations generically exhibit heavy tails. These are asymptotically well approximated by $q$-exponential distributions with a given entropic index $q$ and width parameter $\lambda$. We observe that the power-law parameter $q$ and the width parameter $\lambda$ vary widely for the different spatial locations. We present the results of our data analysis in the form of a map that shows which parameters $q$ and $\lambda$ are most relevant in a given region. A variety of interesting spatial patterns is observed that correlate to properties of the geographical region. We also present results on typical time scales associated with the dynamical behaviour.</description>

      <title>Assessment of environmental impacts from authorized discharges of tritiated water from the Fukushima site to coastal and offshore regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In August 2023, the long-planned discharging of radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) started after the confirmation of its feasibility and safety. As this water contains elevated amounts of tritium even after being diluted, a lot of resources have been invested in the monitoring of the Fukushima coastal region where the discharge outlet is located. We compare the first $^3$H surface activity concentrations from these measurements (up to the end of November 2023) with the available background values to evaluate a possible impact of the long-term discharging on humans and environmental levels of the radionuclide of interest in the same or nearby area. From our results, we can conclude that the joint effect of horizontal and vertical mixing has been significant enough to reduce tritium concentrations at the monitored locations in the region close to the FDNPP port two days after the end of the respective phase of the discharging beyond the detection limit of the applied analytical methods (~ 0.3 Bq L$^{-1}$) which is by five orders of magnitude lower than safety limit for drinking water set by the World Health Organization (WHO). Moreover, the distant correlation analysis showed that tritium concentrations at stations located further than 1.4 km were very close to pre-discharge levels (~ 0.4 Bq L$^{-1}$). We also estimated that the $^3$H activity concentration in the offshore Fukushima region would be elevated by 0.01 Bq L$^{-1}$ at maximum over a year of continuous discharging, which is in concordance with the already published modelling papers and much less than the impact of the FDNPP accident in 2011.</description>

      <title>Tipping detection using climate networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of robust Early Warning Signals (EWS) is necessary to quantify the risk of crossing tipping points in the present-day climate change. Classically, EWS are statistical measures based on time series of climate state variables, without exploiting their spatial distribution. However, spatial information is crucial to identify the starting location of a transition process, and can be directly inferred by satellite observations. By using complex networks constructed from several climate variables on the numerical grid of climate simulations, we seek for network properties that can serve as EWS when approaching a state transition. We show that network indicators such as the normalized degree, the average length distance and the betweenness centrality are capable of detecting tipping points at the global scale, as obtained by the MIT general circulation model in a coupled-aquaplanet configuration for CO$_2$ concentration-driven simulations. The applicability of such indicators as EWS is assessed and compared to traditional methods. We also analyse the ability of climate networks to identify nonlinear dynamical patterns.</description>

      <title>Not So Fast: A New Catalog of Meteor Persistent Trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the results of a nearly two year long campaign to detect and analyze meteor persistent trains (PTs) - self-emitting phenomena which can linger up to an hour after their parent meteor. The modern understanding of PTs has been primarily developed from the Leonid storms at the turn of the century; our goal was to assess the validity of these conclusions using a diverse sample of meteors with a wide range of velocities and magnitudes. To this end, year-round observations were recorded by the Widefield Persistent Train camera, 2nd edition (WiPT2) and were passed through a pipeline to filter out airplanes and flag potential meteors. These were classified by visual inspection based on the presence and duration of trains. Observed meteors were cross-referenced with the Global Meteor Network (GMN) database, which independently detects and calculates meteor parameters, enabling statistical analysis of PT-leaving meteors. There were 4726 meteors codetected by the GMN, with 636 of these leaving trains. Among these were a large population of slow, dim meteors that left PTs; these slower meteors had a greater train production rate relative to their faster counterparts. Unlike prior research, we did not find a clear magnitude cutoff or a strong association with fast meteor showers. Additionally, we note several interesting trends not previously reported, which include PT eligibility being primarily determined by a meteor's terminal height and an apparent dynamical origin dependence that likely reflects physical meteoroid properties.</description>
