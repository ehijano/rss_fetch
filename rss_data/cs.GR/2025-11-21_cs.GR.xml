      <title>SPHaptics: A Real-Time Bidirectional Haptic Interaction Framework for Coupled Rigid-Soft Body and Lagrangian Fluid Simulation in Virtual Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Haptic feedback enhances immersion in virtual environments by allowing users to physically interact with simulated objects. Supporting accurate force responses in multiphysics systems is challenging because physically based simulation of fluid, rigid, and deformable materials is computationally demanding, especially when interaction must occur in real time. We present a unified framework for real-time, bidirectional haptic interaction with rigid bodies, deformable objects, and Lagrangian fluids in virtual reality (VR). Our approach integrates Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) with two-way force coupling and feedback smoothing to maintain stability and produce physically meaningful tactile responses. This enables users to manipulate objects immersed in fluid and feel reaction forces consistent with fluid-structure behavior. We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework through interactive VR scenarios involving fluid stirring, soft tissue manipulation, and rigid-body interaction. The proposed system advances haptic-enabled multiphysics simulation by unifying fluid, soft-body, and rigid-body dynamics into a single platform suitable for immersive educational applications.</description>

      <title>Controllable Layer Decomposition for Reversible Multi-Layer Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents Controllable Layer Decomposition (CLD), a method for achieving fine-grained and controllable multi-layer separation of raster images. In practical workflows, designers typically generate and edit each RGBA layer independently before compositing them into a final raster image. However, this process is irreversible: once composited, layer-level editing is no longer possible. Existing methods commonly rely on image matting and inpainting, but remain limited in controllability and segmentation precision. To address these challenges, we propose two key modules: LayerDecompose-DiT (LD-DiT), which decouples image elements into distinct layers and enables fine-grained control; and Multi-Layer Conditional Adapter (MLCA), which injects target image information into multi-layer tokens to achieve precise conditional generation. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, we build a new benchmark and introduce tailored evaluation metrics. Experimental results show that CLD consistently outperforms existing methods in both decomposition quality and controllability. Furthermore, the separated layers produced by CLD can be directly manipulated in commonly used design tools such as PowerPoint, highlighting its practical value and applicability in real-world creative workflows.</description>

      <title>Time-Critical Adversarial Influence Blocking Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial Influence Blocking Maximization (AIBM) aims to select a set of positive seed nodes that propagate synchronously with the known negative seed nodes on the graph to counteract their negative influence. Currently, most AIBM studies are based on the classical Independent Cascade (IC) model, which omits the time factor and thus hinders their applications to time-critical scenarios like political campaigns or public emergencies. More importantly, existing AIBM studies have not investigated in-depth the submodularity of the objective function, resulting in their failure to provide a theoretical lower bound for the problem. To address these challenges, firstly, this paper proposes the Time-Critical Independent Cascade (TC-IC) model, which incorporates time constraints into the classical IC model. Secondly, the Time-Critical Adversarial Influence Blocking Maximization (TC-AIBM) is established to better handle time-critical scenarios. A detailed formulation of the problem is then presented, along with a theoretical proof of its submodularity under three different tie-breaking rules. Finally, a Bidirectional Influence Sampling (BIS) algorithm is proposed to solve the TC-AIBM problem. The submodularity of the objective function guarantees that the BIS can provide an approximation guarantee of
  to the optimal solution. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed BIS algorithm exhibits excellent stability with various negative seeds, time constraints, and tie-breaking rules, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, BIS improves efficiency by up to three orders of magnitude compared to the Greedy algorithm.</description>

      <title>Clustered Error Correction with Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) methods struggle to accurately reconstruct dynamic scenes, often failing to resolve ambiguous pixel correspondences and inadequate densification in dynamic regions. We address these issues by introducing a novel method composed of two key components: (1) Elliptical Error Clustering and Error Correcting Splat Addition that pinpoints dynamic areas to improve and initialize fitting splats, and (2) Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting that improves consistency of mapping between splats and represented dynamic objects. Specifically, we classify rendering errors into missing-color and occlusion types, then apply targeted corrections via backprojection or foreground splitting guided by cross-view color consistency. Evaluations on Neural 3D Video and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves temporal consistency and achieves state-of-the-art perceptual rendering quality, improving 0.39dB of PSNR on the Technicolor Light Field dataset. Our visualization shows improved alignment between splats and dynamic objects, and the error correction method's capability to identify errors and properly initialize new splats. Our implementation details and source code are available at https://github.com/tho-kn/cem-4dgs.</description>

      <title>Layer-wise Noise Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction for Robust Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical deployment requires segmentation models to stay stable under distribution shifts and perturbations. The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation. These results indicate that LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly path to robust medical image segmentation in both adversarial and standard training regimes.</description>

      <title>TetraSDF: Precise Mesh Extraction with Multi-resolution Tetrahedral Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting meshes that exactly match the zero-level set of neural signed distance functions (SDFs) remains challenging. Sampling-based methods introduce discretization error, while continuous piecewise affine (CPWA) analytic approaches apply only to plain ReLU MLPs. We present TetraSDF, a precise analytic meshing framework for SDFs represented by a ReLU MLP composed with a multi-resolution tetrahedral positional encoder. The encoder's barycentric interpolation preserves global CPWA structure, enabling us to track ReLU linear regions within an encoder-induced polyhedral complex. A fixed analytic input preconditioner derived from the encoder's metric further reduces directional bias and stabilizes training. Across multiple benchmarks, TetraSDF matches or surpasses existing grid-based encoders in SDF reconstruction accuracy, and its analytic extractor produces highly self-consistent meshes that remain faithful to the learned isosurfaces, all with practical runtime and memory efficiency.</description>

      <title>Optimizing 3D Gaussian Splattering for Mobile GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image-based 3D scene reconstruction, which transforms multi-view images into a structured 3D representation of the surrounding environment, is a common task across many modern applications. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a new paradigm to address this problem and offers considerable efficiency as compared to the previous methods. Motivated by this, and considering various benefits of mobile device deployment (data privacy, operating without internet connectivity, and potentially faster responses), this paper develops Texture3dgs, an optimized mapping of 3DGS for a mobile GPU. A critical challenge in this area turns out to be optimizing for the two-dimensional (2D) texture cache, which needs to be exploited for faster executions on mobile GPUs. As a sorting method dominates the computations in 3DGS on mobile platforms, the core of Texture3dgs is a novel sorting algorithm where the processing, data movement, and placement are highly optimized for 2D memory. The properties of this algorithm are analyzed in view of a cost model for the texture cache. In addition, we accelerate other steps of the 3DGS algorithm through improved variable layout design and other optimizations. End-to-end evaluation shows that Texture3dgs delivers up to 4.1$\times$ and 1.7$\times$ speedup for the sorting and overall 3D scene reconstruction, respectively -- while also reducing memory usage by up to 1.6$\times$ -- demonstrating the effectiveness of our design for efficient mobile 3D scene reconstruction.</description>

      <title>PartUV: Part-Based UV Unwrapping of 3D Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: UV unwrapping flattens 3D surfaces to 2D with minimal distortion, often requiring the complex surface to be decomposed into multiple charts. Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.

      <title>SpeeDe3DGS: Speedy Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting with Temporal Pruning and Motion Grouping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07917v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic extensions of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieve high-quality reconstructions through neural motion fields, but per-Gaussian neural inference makes these models computationally expensive. Building on DeformableGS, we introduce Speedy Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (SpeeDe3DGS), which bridges this efficiency-fidelity gap through three complementary modules: Temporal Sensitivity Pruning (TSP) removes low-impact Gaussians via temporally aggregated sensitivity analysis, Temporal Sensitivity Sampling (TSS) perturbs timestamps to suppress floaters and improve temporal coherence, and GroupFlow distills the learned deformation field into shared SE(3) transformations for efficient groupwise motion. On the 50 dynamic scenes in MonoDyGauBench, integrating TSP and TSS into DeformableGS accelerates rendering by 6.78$\times$ on average while maintaining neural-field fidelity and using 10$\times$ fewer primitives. Adding GroupFlow culminates in 13.71$\times$ faster rendering and 2.53$\times$ shorter training, surpassing all baselines in speed while preserving superior image quality.</description>
