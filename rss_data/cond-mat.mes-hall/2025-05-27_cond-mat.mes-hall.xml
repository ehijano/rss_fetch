      <title>Quantum spin Hall effects in van der Waals materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, first predicted in graphene by Kane and Mele in 2004, has emerged as a prototypical platform for exploring spin-orbit coupling, topology, and electronic interactions. Initially realized experimentally in quantum wells exhibiting characteristic QSH signatures, the field has since expanded with the discovery of van der Waals (vdW) materials. This review focuses on vdW systems, which offer unique advantages: their exposed surfaces enable a combination of surface-sensitive spectroscopic and microscopic tools for comprehensive detection of the QSH state; mechanical stacking with other vdW layers facilitates symmetry engineering and proximity effects; and moir\'e engineering introduces layer skyrmion topological phases and strong correlation effects. We highlight two monolayer families, 1T$^\prime$-MX$_2$ and MM$^\prime$X$_4$, represented by WTe$_2$ and TaIrTe$_4$, respectively. These materials exhibit QSH phases intertwined with or in close proximity to other quantum phases, such as excitonic insulators, charge density waves, and superconductivity. Their low crystal symmetry and topology enable rich quantum geometrical responses, ranging from nonlinear Hall effects to circular photogalvanic effects. We also discuss moir\'e systems, which combine topology with flatband physics and enhanced correlations, driving spontaneous symmetry breaking and transitions from QSH to quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. Remarkably, fractionalized QAH and QSH states have recently been observed in moir\'e systems, significantly advancing the field of condensed matter physics. Finally, we explore emerging applications of QSH and derived materials, such as using nonlinear Hall effects for quantum rectification in microwave energy harvesting and harnessing fractional anomalous states for topological quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Generalized many-body exciton g-factors: magnetic hybridization and non-monotonic Rydberg series in monolayer WSe\textsubscript{2}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-optics of low dimensional semiconductors, such as monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, offers a vast playground for exploring complex quantum phenomena. However, current \textit{ab initio} approaches fail to capture important experimental observations related to brightening of excitonic levels and their g-factor dependence. Here, we develop a robust and general first principles framework for many-body exciton g-factors by incorporating off-diagonal terms for the spin and orbital angular momenta of single-particle bands and many-body states for magnetic fields pointing in arbitrary spatial directions. We implement our framework using many-body perturbation theory via the GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and supplement our analysis with robust symmetry-based models, establishing a fruitful synergy between many-body GW-BSE and group theory. Focusing on the archetypal monolayer WSe\textsubscript{2}, we accurately reproduce the known results of the low-energy excitons including the Zeeman splitting and the dark/grey exciton brightening. Furthermore, our theory naturally reveals fundamental physical mechanisms of magnetic-field hybridization of higher-energy excitons (s- and p-like) and resolves the long-standing puzzle of the experimentally measured non-monotonic Rydberg series (1s--4s) of exciton g-factors. Our framework offers a comprehensive approach to investigate, rationalize, and predict the non-trivial interplay between magnetic fields, angular momenta, and many-body exciton physics in van der Waals systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Transport Gaps of Fractional Quantum Hall Phases in Graphene Landau Levels are Induced by Spin-Valley Entangled Ground States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the transport gaps in the most prominent fractional quantum Hall states in the $\mathbf{n}{=}0$ and $\mathbf{n}{=}1$ Landau Levels of graphene, accounting for the Coulomb interaction, lattice-scale anisotropies, and one-body terms. We find that the fractional phases in the $\mathbf{n}{=}0$ Landau level are bond-ordered, while those in the $\mathbf{n}{=}1$ Landau level are spin-valley entangled. This resolves a long-standing experimental puzzle [Amet, $\textit{et al.}$, Nat. Comm. $\mathbf{6}$, 5838 (2015)] of the contrasting Zeeman dependence of the transport gaps in the two Landau levels. The spin-valley entangled phases host gapless Goldstone modes that can be probed via bulk thermal transport measurements. As a byproduct of our computations, we place strong constraints on the values of the microscopic anisotropic couplings such that these are consistent with all known experimental results.</description>

      <title>Dirac fermions on a surface with localized strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of a localized Gaussian deformation on massless Dirac fermions confined to a two-dimensional curved surface. Both in-plane and out-of-plane displacements are considered within the framework of elasticity theory. These deformations couple to the Dirac spinors via the spin connection and the vielbeins, leading to a position-dependent Fermi velocity and an effective geometric potential. We show that the spin connection contributes an attractive potential centered on the deformation and explore how this influences the fermionic density of states. Analytical and numerical solutions reveal the emergence of bound states near the deformation and demonstrate how the Lam\'{e} coefficients affect curvature and state localization. Upon introducing an external magnetic field, the effective potential becomes confining at large distances, producing localized Landau levels that concentrate near the deformation. A geometric Aharonov-Bohm phase is identified through the spinor holonomy. These results contribute to the understanding of strain-induced electronic effects in Dirac materials, such as graphene.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature spin-lifetime anisotropy exceeding 60 in bilayer graphene spin valves proximity coupled to WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spin lifetime anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane spins in bilayer graphene (BLG) can be achieved by spin-orbit proximity coupling of graphene to transition metal dichalcogenides. This coupling reduces the in-plane spin lifetime due to proximity-induced spin scattering, while the out-of-plane spin lifetime remains largely unaffected. We show that at room temperature spin lifetime anisotropy exceeds 60 in a bilayer graphene lateral spin valve proximity coupled to WSe$_2$. The out-of-plane spin lifetime of about 250 ps closely matches that of a BLG reference region not in contact with WSe$_2$. In contrast, the estimated in-plane spin lifetime of less than 4 ps leads to a complete suppression of the in-plane spin signal at the ferromagnetic Co/MgO spin detector. The proximity coupling of WSe$_2$ to BLG is particularly promising, as it does not compromise the charge carrier mobility within the graphene channel.</description>

      <title>A high-efficiency neuroevolution potential for tobermorite and calcium silicate hydrate systems with ab initio accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tobermorite and Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) systems are indispensable cement materials but still lack a satisfactory interatomic potential with both high accuracy and high computational efficiency for better understanding their mechanical performance. Here, we develop a Neuroevolution Machine Learning Potential (NEP) with Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark hybrid framework for tobermorite and C-S-H systems, which conveys unprecedented efficiency in molecular dynamics simulations with substantially reduced training datasets. Our NEP model achieves prediction accuracy comparable to DFT calculations using just around 300 training structures, significantly fewer than other existing machine learning potentials trained for tobermorite. Critically, the GPU-accelerated NEP computations enable scalable simulations of large tobermorite systems, reaching several thousand atoms per GPU card with high efficiency. We demonstrate the NEP's versatility by accurately predicting mechanical properties, phonon density of states, and thermal conductivity of tobermorite. Furthermore, we extend the NEP application to large-scale simulations of amorphous C-S-H, highlighting its potential for comprehensive analysis of structural and mechanical behaviors under various realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced magnetic damping anomaly in La$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$MnO$_{3}$ ($x=0.3$-$0.5$) thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic properties of La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_{3}$ (LSMO) are highly sensitive to various factors such as the Sr doping level $x$, lattice strain, and oxygen stoichiometry due to the strongly correlated nature of $3d$ electrons. For the development of energy-efficient spintronic devices with ultra-low magnetic damping of LSMO, a thorough understanding of its complex magnetization dynamics is of great importance. In this work, we have measured ferromagnetic resonance of LSMO thin films on Nb-doped SrTiO$_3$ (Nb-STO) substrates over a wide temperature and frequency range and observed an anomalous increase in the Gilbert damping constant and a decrease in the effective saturation magnetization at temperatures below 100 K. The anomalies become more pronounced as the LSMO thickness decreases while they are not observed for LSMO on (LaAlO$_3$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_2$TaAlO$_6$)$_{0.7}$ substrates with relatively small epitaxial strain. The results suggest that the epitaxial strain-induced magnetically dead layer at the LSMO/Nb-STO interface acts as a spin sink and leads to the anomalies in the magnetization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Revealing molecule-internal mechanisms that control phonon heat transport through single-molecule junctions by a genetic algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the thermal conductance of single-molecule junctions have recently been reported for the first time. It is presently unclear, how much the heat transport can be controlled through molecule-internal effects. The search for molecules with lowest and highest thermal conductance is complicated by the gigantic chemical space. Here we describe a systematic search for molecules with a low or a high phononic thermal conductance using a genetic algorithm. Beyond individual structures of well performing molecules, delivered by the genetic algorithm, we analyze patterns and identify the different physical and chemical mechanisms to suppress or enhance phonon heat flow. In detail, mechanisms revealed to reduce phonon transport are related to the choice of terminal linker blocks, substituents and corresponding mass disorder or destructive interference, meta couplings and molecule-internal twist. For a high thermal conductance, the molecules should instead be rather uniform and chain-like. The identified mechanisms are systematically analyzed at different levels of theory, and their significance is classified. Our findings are expected to be important for the emerging field of molecular phononics.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal magnetoconductivity in chiral multifold semimetals exemplified by pseudospin-1 nodal points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We embark on computing the longitudinal magnetoconductivity within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, where an isotropic triple-point semimetal (TSM) is subjected to collinear electric ($\boldsymbol E $) and magnetic ($\boldsymbol B$) fields. Except for the Drude part, the $B$-dependence arises exclusively from topological properties like the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment. We solve the Boltzmann equations exactly in the linear-response regime, applicable in the limit of weak/nonquantising magnetic fields. The novelty of our investigation lies in the consideration of the truly multifold character of the TSMs, where the so-called flat-band (flatness being merely an artifact of linear-order approximations) is made dispersive by incorporating the appropriate quadratic-in-momentum correction in the effective Hamiltonian. It necessitates the consideration of interband scatterings within the same node as well, providing a complex interplay of intraband, interband, intranode, and internode processes. The exact results are compared with those obtained from a naive relaxation-time approximation.</description>

      <title>Magnon-Driven Phononic Frequency Comb in Linear Elastic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phononic frequency combs (PFCs) typically require nonlinear elastic media, limiting their frequency range and stability. Here, we propose a transformative approach to generate PFCs in purely linear elastic media by harnessing the magnon nonlinearities, offering a new paradigm for frequency comb physics. By tuning the magnon-phonon coupling confined in a magnetic disk of a vortex state into the strong coupling regime, we demonstrate an efficient nonlinearity transfer from magnons to phonons. This mechanism is able to produce GHz-range PFCs with comb spacing set by the vortex core's gyration frequency. Full micromagnetic simulations verify our theoretical predictions, confirming robust comb formation at 3.5 GHz with 0.4 GHz spacing. This approach overcomes the sub-MHz constraints of conventional PFCs, enabling applications in high-precision metrology, nanoscale sensing, and quantum technologies. Our findings also deepen the understanding of the nonlinear dynamics in hybrid magnon-phonon systems and provide a versatile platform for exploring frequency combs in diverse physical systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Transport in Carbon Quantum Dot Electronic Devices: Experiment and Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are a promising material for electronic applications due to their easy fabrication and interesting semiconductor properties. Further, CQDs exhibit quantum confinement and charging effects, which may lead not only to improved performances but also to devices with novel functionalities. Here, we investigate the electronic transport of CQDs embedded on epoxy polymer. Our samples are coupled to interdigitated electrodes with individually addressable microelectrodes. Remarkably, the current-voltage characteristics show strongly nonlinear regimes at room temperature, ranging from Schottky diode to Coulomb blockade and even negative differential conductance behavior. We propose a master equation theoretical framework which allows us to compute current curves that agree well with the observations. This model emphasizes the importance of interacting dots and electron traps in generating a cohesive picture that encompasses all transport regimes. Overall, our results suggest that CQDs constitute a versatile materials platform for 3D integrated electronic purposes.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Memory Effects in the Dynamics of Two-Level System Defect Ensembles Using Broadband, Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-level system defects (TLSs) in dielectrics are believed to be the primary source of decoherence in superconducting circuits. However, the precise origin of these defects, including their atomistic morphology, frequency distributions, and dipole moments, remains relatively unexplored. A significant reason for this lack of understanding is that TLS defects are currently probed with resonators or qubits that require complex multi-stage fabrication processes. These probes are packaged, cooled in a dilution refrigerator, and measured to infer their corresponding coherence times. However, even frequency-tunable probes only gather information about TLS defects within their mode volume and a narrow bandwidth around their resonance frequency. As a result, a detailed understanding of the atomistic origins of TLS defects in isolated materials and interfaces is currently lacking, making it challenging to design the next generation of superconducting devices and dielectric materials from first principles. Here, we introduce a novel approach that enables probing the cryogenic dielectric response of TLS defect ensembles using a broadband 3D waveguide. This technique provides evidence of memory effects in the dynamics of TLS defect ensembles that may enable the extraction of critical information about the origins of the underlying TLS defects and their interactions. Importantly, this novel spectroscopy technique can be used at all stages of fabrication and ultimately inform mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of TLS defects on superconducting circuits. As a result, this technique will help usher in a new understanding of the atomistic origin of TLS defects, which will have profound consequences for quantum information science and the broader materials science community.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity above 2000 W/m.K in Boron Arsenide by Nanosecond Transducer-less Time-Domain Thermoreflectance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs) has been theoretically predicted to exhibit thermal conductivity \k{appa} comparable to that of diamond, yet experimental measurements have plateaued at ~1300W/mK. We report room-temperature \k{appa} exceeding 2000W/mK in c-BAs, on par with single-crystal diamond. This finding is enabled by high-quality single crystals and a newly developed nanosecond, transducer-less time-domain thermoreflectance technique that allows spatial mapping of \k{appa} without metal transducers. Thermal conductivity correlates with crystal quality, as evidenced by stronger photoluminescence and longer photoluminescence lifetimes. However, the observed nanosecond lifetimes remain shorter than expected for an indirect bandgap semiconductor, suggesting room for further crystal quality improvement and higher \k{appa}. These results challenge current theoretical models and highlight c-BAs as a promising material for next-generation electronics.</description>

      <title>Circuit-level-configurable Zero-field Superconducting Diodes: A Universal Platform Beyond Intrinsic Symmetry Breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern industry seeks next-generation microelectronics with ultra-low dissipation and noise beyond semiconducting systems, where the superconducting electronics offer promise. Its physical foundation is the superconducting diode effect (SDE) with nonreciprocal supercurrent. SDE has hitherto mainly relied on material-specific intrinsic symmetry breaking in superconductors, suffering from low yield, controllability, and compatibility with further functional extension - an undesirable aspect for applications. Here, we demonstrated a field-free SDE due to the chemical potential shift from external circuit line resistance, which is generic and challenges the previous interpretations of the intrinsic symmetry breaking in superconductivity for zero-field SDE. Moreover, this SDE is circuit-level configurable since it can be electrically switched on/off with its polarity and efficiency precisely modulated via gate voltage and circuit reconfiguration, facilitating functional extension. Such a generic, controllable and extensible SDE addresses critical challenges in dissipationless circuit towards application, and thus establishes a robust platform for scalable superconducting electronics.</description>

Abstract: Lindbladian dynamics of open systems may be employed to steer a many-body system towards a non-trivial ground state of a local Hamiltonian. Such protocols provide us with tunable platforms facilitating the engineering and study of non-trivial many-body states. Steering towards a degenerate ground state manifold provides us with a protected platform to employ many-body states as a resource for quantum information processing. Notably, ground states of frustrated local Hamiltonians have been known not to be amenable to steering protocols. Revisiting this intricate physics we report two new results: (i) we find a broad class of (geometrically) frustrated local Hamiltonians for which steering of the ground state manifold is possible through a sequence of discrete steering steps. Following the steering dynamics, states within the degenerate ground-state manifold keep evolving in a non-stationary manner. (ii) For the class of Hamiltonians with ground states which are non-steerable through local superoperators, we derive a "glass floor" on how close to the ground state one can get implementing a steering protocol. This is expressed invoking the concept of cooling-by-steering (a lower bound of the achievable temperature), or through an upper bound of the achievable fidelity. Our work provides a systematic outline for studying quantum state manipulation of a broad class of strongly correlated states.</description>

      <title>Photon emission gain in Er doped Si light emitting diodes by impact excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work demonstrates photon emission gain, i.e., emission of multiple photons per injected electron, through impact excitation in Er-doped silicon light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Conventional methods for exciting Er ions in silicon suffer from low efficiency due to mismatched energy transfer between exciton recombination and Er excitation. Here, we propose a reverse-biased Si PN junction diode where ballistically accelerated electrons induce inelastic collisions with Er ions, enabling tunable excitation via electric field modulation. Theoretical modeling reveals that photon emission gain arises from multiple impact excitations by a single electron traversing the electroluminescence region, with the gain value approximating the ratio of emission region width to electron mean free path, i.e., G = Lex/l. Experimental results show an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 1.84% at 78 K, representing a 20-fold enhancement over room-temperature performance. This work provides a critical foundation for on-chip integration of silicon-based communication-band lasers and quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Theory of two-component superfluidity of microcavity polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Bose-Einstein condensation and two-component superfluidity composed of upper (UP) and lower (LP) polaritons confined to a two-dimensional microcavity. By studying a modified Hamiltonian which incorporates interactions between both polariton branches, we derive the collective excitation spectrum and express the sound velocity as a function of detuning and Rabi splitting. Our analysis reveals that the interplay between effective masses and exciton-photon fractions in the UP and LP branches can significantly enhance the superfluid properties compared to a one-component condensate of only lower polaritons. Specifically, we discover that larger Rabi splitting increases the sound velocity and raises the critical temperature for superfluidity, while negative and positive detuning further favors a two-component condensate. Additionally, we demonstrate that these trends are consistent and applicable to various materials, including GaAs and the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), thereby indicating the potential for high-temperature superfluid phenomena in two-dimensional polariton systems. We hope these findings will provide a deeper understanding of the physics of structures containing multi-component polariton systems and generate experimental realizations of tunable quantum fluids with light.</description>

      <title>Signatures of edge states in antiferromagnetic van der Waals Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of superconductivity and magnetic textures represents a promising approach to explore unconventional superconducting phenomena, including new correlated and topological phases. Van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged in this context as a versatile platform to explore the interplay between these two competing orders. Here, we report on individual NbSe2/NiPS3/NbSe2 vdW Josephson junctions behaving as superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), which we attribute to the interplay between the superconductivity of NbSe2 and the spin texture of the vdW antiferromagnetic insulator NiPS3. The SQUID behavior, which persists for in-plane magnetic fields of at least 6 T, is the result of interference between localized transport channels that form in two separate regions of the sample. Microscopic modeling of the antiferromagnet insulator/superconductor (AFI/S) interface reveals the formation of localized states at the edges of the junction that can lead to localized channels that dominate the transport. Our findings highlight the potential of vdW superconducting heterostructures with AFs as platforms for engineering and probing novel superconducting phenomena, and they establish a new route for lithographic-free SQUIDs that operate in high magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Self-patterning of Liquid Field's Metal for Enhanced Performance of Two-dimensional Semiconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals semiconductors show promise for atomically thin flexible and transparent optoelectronic devices in future technologies.However, developing high-performance field-effect transistors (FETs) based on 2D materials is impeded by two key challenges, the high contact resistance at the 2D semiconductors-metal interface and the limited effective doping strategies. Here, we present a novel approach to overcome these challenges using self-propagating liquid Fields metal, a eutectic alloy with a low melting point of approximately 62 C. By modifying pre-patterned electrodes on WSe2 FETs through the deposition of Fields metal onto contact pad edges followed by vacuum annealing, we create new semimetal electrodes that seamlessly incorporate the liquid metal into 2D semiconductors. This integration preserves the original electrode architecture while transforming to semimetal compositions of Fields metal such as Bi, In, and Sn modifies the work functions to 2D semiconductors, resulting in reduced contact resistance without inducing Fermi-level pinning and charge carrier mobilities. Our method enhances the electrical performance of 2D devices and opens new avenues for designing high-resolution liquid metal circuits suitable for stretchable, flexible, and wearable 2D semiconductor applications.</description>

      <title>Running a six-qubit quantum circuit on a silicon spin qubit array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simplicity of encoding a qubit in the state of a single electron spin and the potential for their integration into industry-standard microchips continue to drive the field of semiconductor-based quantum computing. However, after decades of progress, validating universal logic in these platforms has advanced little beyond first-principles demonstrations of meeting the DiVincenzo criteria. Case in point, and specifically for silicon-based quantum dots, three-qubit algorithms have been the upper limit to date, despite the availability of devices containing more qubits. In this work, we fully exploit the capacity of a spin-qubit array and implement a six qubit quantum circuit, the largest utilizing semiconductor quantum technology. By programming the quantum processor, we execute quantum circuits across all permutations of three, four, five, and six neighbouring qubits, demonstrating successful programmable multi-qubit operation throughout the array. The results reveal that, despite the high quality of individual units, errors quickly accumulate when combining all of them in a quantum circuit. This work highlights the necessity to minimize idling times through simultaneous operations, boost dephasing times, and consistently improve state preparation and measurement fidelities.</description>

      <title>Universal dissipators for driven open quantum systems and the correction to linear response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate in parallel two common pictures used to describe quantum systems interacting with their surrounding environment, i.e., the stochastic Hamiltonian description, where the environment is implicitly included in the fluctuating internal parameters of the system, and the explicit inclusion of the environment via the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Utilizing these two different frameworks, we show that the dissipator characterizing the dynamics of the reduced system, determined up to second order in the noise strength or bath-system coupling, is universal. That is, it keeps the same form regardless of the drive term, as long as the drive is weak. We thoroughly discuss the assumptions on which this treatment is based and its limitations. By considering the first non-vanishing higher-order term in our expansion, we also derive the linear response correction due to memory-mediated environmental effects in driven-dissipative systems. We demonstrate this technique to be highly accurate for the problems of dephasing in a driven qubit and for the theory of pseudomodes for quantum environments.</description>

      <title>Spin-qubit readout analysis based on a Hidden Markov Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Across most qubit platforms, the readout fidelities do not keep up with the gate fidelities, and new ways to increase the readout fidelities are searched for. For semiconductor spin qubits, a typical qubit-readout signal consists of a finite stretch of a digitized charge-sensor output. Such a signal trace is usually analyzed by compressing it into a single value, either maximum or sum. The binary measurement result follows by comparing the single value to a decision threshold fixed in advance. This threshold method, while simple and fast, omits information that could potentially improve the readout fidelity. Here, we analyze what can be achieved by more sophisticated signal-trace processing using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The HMM is a natural choice, being the optimal statistical processing if the noise is white. It also has a computationally efficient implementation, known as the forward-backward algorithm, making HMM processing practical. However, unlike in many computer-simulation studies, in real experiments the noise is correlated. How this change affects the HMM implementation and reliability is our subject. We find that the HMM using white noise as the system statistical model is surprisingly sensitive to correlations; it only tolerates very small correlation times. We suggest alleviating this deficiency by a signal pre-filtering. The correlations have a similar strongly negative impact on the HMM model calibration (the Baum-Welch algorithm). Besides studying the effects of noise correlations, as a specific application of the HMM we calculate the readout fidelity at elevated temperatures, relevant to recent experimental pursuits of `hot' spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Structure and Elastic properties of Titanium MXenes: evaluation of COMB3, REAXFF and MEAM force fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Titanium carbide and nitride MXenes are two-dimensional inorganic materials that exhibit noteworthy physical and chemical properties. These materials are considered for a variety of technological applications, ranging from energy harvesting to optical and biomedical applications. Given the growing interest in titanium MXenes, there is an expanding demand for computational studies to predict physical properties and behaviors under diverse physical conditions. Complex and large-scale systems necessitate computational methodologies that surpass the constraints imposed by ab initio calculations. In this regard, it is imperative to ascertain the reliability of the computational tools employed to simulate and predict the physical properties of titanium MXenes. In this study, the ability of three known classical molecular dynamics (MD) potentials to provide the structural and elastic properties of titanium carbide and nitride MXenes is evaluated. The MD potentials that were the focus of this study include the Charge-Optimized Many-Body (COMB3), the Reactive Force Field (REAXFF) and the Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM). These three potentials possess two or more sets of parameters, herein referred to as force fields, capable of simulating Ti-C and Ti-N systems. The MD results for the lattice parameter and thickness of the MXenes are then compared to those from DFT calculations found in the literature. A total of ten force fields were considered; of these, two REAXFF and two MEAM ones were identified as the most adequate to simulate both the structure and elastic properties of titanium MXenes. Additionally, the values for the linear compressibility of MXenes are presented for the first time. Consequently, researchers can utilize the obtained results to design novel MD-based computational studies of titanium MXenes, leveraging the established relative validity of the available force fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider unconventional magnets with and without spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity and demonstrate the emergence of spin triplet states due to light drives. In particular, we find that a high-frequency linearly polarized light drive induces a spin-triplet density in $d$-wave altermagnets which does not exist in the static regime and can directly reveal the strength of the altermagnetic field. In this high-frequency regime, we also show that linearly polarized light enables the formation of odd-frequency spin-triplet superconducting correlations possessing $d$-wave and $s$-wave parities, which can be controlled by the light drive and accessed by measuring the spin density. Moreover, for low-frequency linearly and circularly polarized light drives, we obtain that the types of superconducting correlations are broadened due to the presence of Floquet bands, enabling spin-triplet pairs in $d$- and $p$-wave unconventional magnets, which are absent in the undriven phase.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Clusters of Anyons in Fractional Quantum Hall Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigates the effective interactions between anyons emerging from either model or realistic bare electron-electron (e-e) interactions in Laughlin and Moore-Read fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluids. Instead of being purely repulsive or attractive, such anyons display rich dynamics with interesting experimental consequences. Two Laughlin anyons prefer to form bound states with short-range e-e interactions, leading to $2e/3$ bunched quasiholes at low temperatures instead of the $e/3$ quasiholes. In non-Abelian Moore-Read FQH phases, two $e/4$ quasiholes can fuse into topologically distinct ''1'' or ''$\psi$'' anyons that are no longer degenerate with realistic two-body e-e interactions. This suggests the possibility to energetically separate and manipulate the two types of anyons by tuning the bare electron-electron interactions. We propose that the recently developed high-resolution STM measurements can be used to probe effective anyon interactions when anyons are clustered together after the tunneling of electrons. The local density of states from various bound states of anyon clusters are simulated for both Abelian and non-Abelian systems with (screened) Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <title>Missing odd-order Shapiro steps do not uniquely indicate fractional Josephson effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological superconductivity is expected to spur Majorana zero modes -- exotic states that are also considered a quantum technology asset. Fractional Josephson effect is their manifestation in electronic transport measurements, often under microwave irradiation. A fraction of induced resonances, known as Shapiro steps, should vanish, in a pattern that signifies the presence of Majorana modes. Here we report patterns of Shapiro steps expected in topological Josephson junctions, such as the missing first Shapiro step, or several missing odd-order steps. But our junctions, which are InAs quantum wells with Al contacts, are studied near zero magnetic field, meaning that they are not in the topological regime. We also observe other patterns such as missing even steps and several missing steps in a row, not relevant to topological superconductivity. Potentially responsible for our observations is rounding of not fully developed steps superimposed on non-monotonic resistance versus voltage curves, but several origins may be at play. Our results demonstrate that any single pattern, even striking, cannot uniquely identify topological superconductivity, and a multifactor approach is necessary to unambiguously establish this important phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02318v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the response tensors in planar Hall (or planar thermal Hall) configurations such that a three-dimensional Weyl or multi-Weyl semimetal is subjected to the influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and an effective magnetic field $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$, which are oriented at a generic angle with respect to each other. The effective magnetic field consists of two parts: (a) an actual/physical magnetic field $\mathbf B $, and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $ which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with opposite chiralities with opposite signs. We study the interplay of the orientations of these two components of $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$ with respect to the direction of the electric field (or temperature gradient) and elucidate how it affects the characteristics involving the chirality of the node. Additionally, we show that the magnitude and sharpness of the conductivity tensor profiles strongly depend on the value of the topological charge at the node in question.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the transport of vorticity on curved dynamical two-dimensional magnetic membranes. We find that topological transport can be controlled by geometrically reducing symmetries, enabling processes absent from flat magnetic systems. To this end, the vorticity 3-current is constructed, which obeys a continuity equation immune to local disturbances of the magnetic texture and spatiotemporal fluctuations of the membrane. We show how electric current can manipulate vortex transport in geometrically nontrivial magnetic systems. As an illustrative example, we propose a minimal setup that realizes an experimentally feasible energy storage device and discuss its thermodynamic efficiency in terms of a vortexoelectric counterpart of the thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$.</description>

      <title>Isolated nearly flat higher Chern band in monolayer transition metal trihalides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between non-trivial topology and strong electron interaction can generate a variety of exotic quantum matter. Here we theoretically propose that monolayer transition metal trihalides MoF$_3$ and W$X_3$ ($X$= Cl, Br, I) have isolated nearly flat band near the Fermi level with higher Chern number $\mathcal{C}=+3$ and $\mathcal{C}=-2$, respectively. The nontrivial topology of these flat Chern bands originates from the effective $sd^2$ hybridization of transition metal atom, which transform the apparent atomic $d$ orbitals on a hexagonal lattice into $(s, p_+, p_-)$ orbitals on a triangular lattice. Interestingly, the quantum geometry of flat Chern bands in these materials are comparable with those in moir\'e systems exhibiting fractional Chern insulator state. The Hofstadter butterfly of such flat Chern bands are further studied. These natural materials, if realized experimentally, could offer new platforms to explore correlated phenomena driven by flat Chern band with higher Chern number.</description>

Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators are an intriguing new family of topological states that host lower-dimensional boundary states. Concurrently, quasiperiodic systems have garnered significant interest due to their complex localization and topological properties. In this work we study the impact of chiral symmetry preserving quasiperiodic modulations on the paradigmatic Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model, which hosts topological insulating phases with zero-energy sublattice-polarized modes. We find that the topological properties are not only robust to the quasiperiodic modulation, but can even be enriched. In particular, we unveil the first instance of a quasiperiodic induced second-order topological insulating phase. Furthermore, in contrast with disorder, we find that quasiperiodic modulations can induce multiple reentrant topological transitions, showing an intricate sequence of localization properties. Our results open a promising avenue for exploring the rich interplay between higher-order topology and quasiperiodicity.</description>

      <title>Magnon Nonlinear Hall Effect in 2D Antiferromagnetic Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficient detection of the magnetism in 2D antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulators is crucial for the advancement of 2D AFM spintronics and remains a challenging problem. In this letter, we introduce the magnon nonlinear Hall current, a second-order Hall response of collective spin excitations in ordered magnets, as a novel probe for 2D layered AFM insulators. We theoretically demonstrate that the nonlinear Hall effect is intrinsically coupled to the underlying spin configuration. In particular, it exhibits a pronounced layer dependence in layered antiferromagnets, enabling direct characterization of the nature and strength of interlayer magnetic coupling in multilayer AFM insulators. Furthermore, we show that a a slight external field perturbation can induce and manipulate the magnon nonlinear Hall response. Our work establishes a novel approach for exploring 2D antiferromagnetism and holds great promise for AFM spintronic applications</description>

      <title>Anomalous topological edge modes in a periodically-driven trimer lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems have a longstanding reputation for establishing rich topological phenomena beyond their static counterpart. In this work, we propose and investigate a periodically driven extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with three sites per unit cell, obtained by replacing the Pauli matrices with their $3\times 3$ counterparts. The system is found to support a number of edge modes over a range of parameter windows, some of which have no static counterparts. Among these edge modes, of particular interest are those which are pinned at a specific quasienergy value. Such quasienergy-fixed edge modes arise due to the interplay between topology and chiral symmetry, which are typically not expected in a three-band static model due to the presence of a bulk band at the only chiral-symmetric energy value, i.e., zero. In our time-periodic setting, another chiral-symmetric quasienergy value exists at half the driving frequency, which is not occupied by a bulk band and could then host chiral-symmetry-protected edge modes ($\pi$ modes). Finally, we verify the robustness of all edge modes against spatial disorder and briefly discuss the prospect of realizing our system in experiments.</description>

      <title>Valley Gapless Semiconductor: Models and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emerging field of valleytronics harnesses the valley degree of freedom of electrons, akin to how electronic and spintronic devices utilize the charge and spin degrees of freedom of electrons respectively. The engineering of valleytronic devices typically relies on the coupling between valley and other degrees of freedom such as spin, giving rise to valley-spintronics where an external magnetic field manipulates the information stored in valleys. Here, the valley gapless semiconductor is proposed as a potential electrically controlled valleytronic platform because the valley degree of freedom is coupled to the carrier type, i.e., electrons and holes. The valley degree of freedom can be electrically controlled by tuning the carrier type via the device gate voltage. We demonstrate the proposal for realizing a valley gapless semiconductor in the honeycomb lattice with the Haldane and modified Haldane models. The system's valley-carrier coupling is further studied for its transport properties in an all-electrically controlled valley filter device setting. Our work highlights the significance of the valley gapless semiconductor for valleytronic devices.</description>

      <title>Electrostatics in semiconducting devices I : The Pure Electrostatics Self Consistent Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum nanoelectronics devices, the electrostatic energy is the largest energy scale at play and, to a large extend, it determines the charge distribution inside the devices. Here, we introduce the Pure Electrostatic Self consistent Approximation (PESCA) that provides a minimum model that describes how to include a semiconductor in an electrostatic calculation to properly account for both screening and partial depletion due to e.g. field effect. We show how PESCA may be used to reconstruct the charge distribution from the measurement of pinch-off phase diagrams in the gate voltages space. PESCA can also be extended to account for magnetic field and calculate the edge reconstruction in the quantum Hall regime. The validity of PESCA is controlled by a small parameter $\kappa = C_g/C_q$, the ratio of the geometrical capacitance to the quantum capacitance, which is, in many common situations, of the order of 1%, making PESCA a quantitative technique for the calculation of the charge distribution inside devices.</description>

      <title>Visualization of spin-splitter effect in altermagnets via non-equilibrium Green functions on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a charge current is injected into an altermagnet along a suitable crystallographic direction, a transverse spin current can be generated. This so-called spin-splitter effect does not rely on spin-orbit coupling, and is thus distinct from the spin Hall effect. The spin-splitter effect was predicted by \textit{ab initio} calculations and has been experimentally confirmed. To utilize the spin-splitter effect for practical purposes in spintronic devices, it is important to understand (i) how the system parameters affect the transverse spin current, such as filling fraction, altermagnetic strength, interface parameters, spin-orbit interactions, and impurities and (ii) determine the properties of any associated spin accumulation, which is the measurable quantity. Here, we determine the answer to these questions and provide a real-space visualization of the spin flow and spin accumulation due to the spin-splitter effect. We utilize the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green function method on a 2D square lattice to this end. We find that the presence of edges induces oscillations in the spin accumulation and strongly modify the signal for small samples. At half-filling, the spin accumulation acquires an anomalous pattern and the spin-splitter effect vanishes. We prove analytically that this follows from a combined particle-hole and spin-reversal symmetry of the model used for the altermagnetic state. Increasing the altermagnetic strength leads to a larger spin accumulation, as expected. However, when adding Rashba spin-orbit interaction, providing an additional spin Hall signal, we find that the spin accumulation is not simply the sum of the spin Hall and spin-splitter contribution. Finally, we show that the spin-splitter effect is robust towards moderate impurity scattering with a potential of the same order as the hopping parameter, which facilitates its observation in real materials.</description>

      <title>SEMIDV: A Compact Semiconductor Device Simulator with Quantum Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00214v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, I present SEMIDV - a compact semiconductor device simulator incorporating quantum effects. SEMIDV solves the Poisson-Drift-Diffusion equations for semiconductor devices and provides a user-friendly Python interface for scripting and data analysis. Localization landscape theory is introduced to provide quantum corrections to the Drift-Diffusion equation. This theory directly solves the ground state of the Schrodinger equation without further approximation, offering an efficient solution for quantum effect modeling. Additionally, a compact mobility model considering ballistic transport is developed to capture the ballistic length dependence of mobility and the velocity overshoot effect in short-channel devices. Finally, a study on a nanosheet FET using SEMIDV is conducted. I analyze the electrical characteristics of a state-of-the-art GAA/RibbonFET with a 6 nm gate length and discuss the effects of velocity overshoot and quantum confinement on currents and capacitances. A design for an ultra-short-channel transistor with a gate length down to 4.5 nm with a Vdd = 0.45 V is proposed to push the boundaries of integrated circuit technology further.</description>

      <title>Symphony of Symmetry Selective Resonances in Fe-MgO-ZnO-MgO-Fe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the perspective of symmetry-selective resonance of the $\Delta_1$ states in the Fe/MgO/ZnO/MgO/Fe heterostructures, offering a broad landscape to design magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) that yield a towering tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) up to $3.5\times10^4\%$ with the resistance area (RA) product dipping down to a minimum of $0.05~\Omega\cdot\mu \text{m}^2$, while maintaining a nearly perfect (99\%) spin polarization. Our predictions are based on the self-consistent coupling of the non-equilibrium Green's function with density functional theory. We also present the charge current, spin current, and TMR with applied voltage of the Fe/MgO(3-layer)/ZnO(3-layer)/MgO(3-layer)/Fe MTJ, which offers a superior performance triad of TMR ($1.3\times10^4\%$), RA ($0.45~\Omega\cdot\mu \text{m}^2$), and spin polarization (99\%) over a regular Fe/MgO(6-layer)/Fe based MTJ (TMR $\approx 3.4\times10^3\%$, RA $\approx 22~\Omega\cdot\mu \text{m}^2$). We provide a comprehensive insight integrating the transmission eigenchannel, spectral density, and the band structure of the Fe contacts to establish the role of symmetry-selective resonance in the Fe/MgO/ZnO/MgO/Fe MTJ.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06677v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement manifests itself in non-local correlations between the constituents of a system. In its simplest realization, a measurement on one subsystem is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple parties, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we argue that all forms of multipartite entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a physical state as it heats up, evolves in time in a large family of dynamical protocols, or as its parts become separated. We focus on the generic case where the system interacts with an environment. These results mainly follow from the geometry of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium, and a quantum spin chain. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that protects bipartite quantum correlations. However, genuinely collective fermionic entanglement disappears during typical evolution, thus sharing the same fate as in bosonic systems. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.</description>

      <title>Merons, hedgehogs and magnetoelectric switching in spiral multiferroics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spiral multiferroics, magnetism induces ferroelectricity, thus holding a promise for novel memory devices where an electric field switches magnetic bits. However, such a switching process, in which magnetic domain walls are moved electrically, is still poorly understood. We find multiferroic domain walls containing arrays of meron (half-skyrmion) strings with a plethora of topological defects, which profoundly affect wall dynamics. Minimum energy walls have alternating meron topological charges and move as relativistic massive particles, with velocity limited by the magnon speed. During domain nucleation, walls with non-alternating meron charges appear. Such defects result in a peculiar non-local dynamics where all the spins in the system rotate, and the wall mobility is suppressed. Meron strings possess 0D hedgehog defects, analogous to Bloch points, that pin the wall to the lattice. This fascinating interplay of magnetoelectric switching with a variety of topological defects and non-local spin dynamics opens a new playground for the electric manipulation of spins.</description>

      <title>Gain compression in Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) are increasingly used in various applications, including quantum computing, quantum sensing, and dark matter detection. However, one important characteristic of these amplifiers, gain compression, has not received much attention. As a result, there is a lack of comprehensive experimental exploration of this phenomenon in the existing literature. In this study, we present an experimental investigation of gain compression in a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier based on a four-wave mixing process. We have implemented a novel setup to monitor the complex transmission of both the pump and signal tones, which allows us to simultaneously track pump depletion and signal amplification as functions of signal power and frequency across the entire bandwidth of the device. Our findings indicate that, while pump depletion occurs during gain compression, it is not the only mechanism involved in the saturation of a TWPA. Power-induced phase-matching processes also take place within the device. This study provides valuable insights for optimizing TWPAs for applications that require high total input power, such as multiplexed qubit readout or broadband photon emission.</description>
