      <title>Mackey homological algebra over cyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C_n$ denote a cyclic group of order $n$. In this paper we investigate modules and chain complexes over the constant integral Mackey functor $\underline{\mathbb{Z}}$ and perform some related homological calculations. Along the way we develop a number of foundational tools for working with these categories. These results are useful for the study of $RO(C_n)$-graded Bredon cohomology, though such applications are delegated to a sequel paper.</description>

      <title>The Bredon equivariant cohomology of a point for cyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $RO(G)$-graded Bredon cohomology of a point in the case where $G$ is a cyclic group of odd order, expanding on the information provided by previous studies. Our methods center on the purely algebraic aspects of this matter, which interpret it as the "stable homotopy groups of spheres" problem for the derived category of modules over the constant-coefficient Mackey ring.</description>

      <title>Ganea decompositions of classifying spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study homotopy decompositions of the classifying spaces $BG$ of compact connected Lie groups obtained by (relative) fiber-cofiber construction. Given a pair of Borel fibrations $ F \to E \to BG $ and $F' \to E' \to BG $, this construction yields a tower (telescope) of spaces $ X_{m}(F,F') $ over $BG$ indexed by $ \mathbb{Z}_+ $ that converges in the sense that $\text{hocolim} \,(X_{m})\,$ is weakly homotopy equivalent to $BG$. We determine cohomological conditions on the fibrations that produce the spaces $X_{m}(F,F')$ with properties similar to those of the spaces of quasi-invariants of Weyl groups constructed by the first and third authors. We prove that, under these conditions, the resulting homotopy decompositions of $BG$ are sharp (over $\mathbb{Q}$), the spaces $X_{m}(F,F')$ are rationally formal and Cohen-Macaulay, their cohomology rings being finite rank free modules over $H^*(BG, \mathbb{Q})$. We construct many examples which include the fundamental (maximal torus) fibration $ G/T \to BT \to BG $ as well as the universal fibration $\, E_{\rm com}G_{\bf 1} \to B_{\rm com}G_{\bf 1} \to BG \,$ for the classifying space $B_{\rm com}G$ of commuting elements in $G$ introduced by Adem and G\'{o}mez, as the first fibration in the pair. In most cases, we give an explicit presentation for the (equivariant) cohomology rings in terms of characteristic classes and compute the (equivariant) $K$-theory of the spaces involved. The paper contains an Appendix, where we re-examine the topological fiber-cofiber construction in an abstract setting, proving an $\infty$-categorical extension of the classical Ganea Theorem.</description>

      <title>Topological shape transform for thymus structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euler characteristic transform (ECT) is an emerging and powerful framework within topological data analysis for quantifying the geometry of shape. The applicability of ECT has been limited due to its sensitivity to noisy data. Here, we introduce SampEuler, a novel ECT-based shape descriptor designed to achieve enhanced robustness to perturbations. We provide a theoretical analysis establishing the stability of SampEuler and validate these properties empirically through pairwise similarity analyses on a benchmark dataset and showcase it on a thymus dataset. The thymus is a primary lymphoid organ that is essential for the maturation and selection of self-tolerant T cells, and within the thymus, thymic epithelial cells are organized in complex three-dimensional architectures, yet the principles governing their formation, functional organization, and remodeling during age-related involution remain poorly understood. Addressing these questions requires robust and informative shape descriptors capable of capturing subtle architectural changes across developmental stages. We develop and apply SampEuler to a newly generated two-dimensional imaging dataset of mouse thymi spanning multiple age groups, where SampEuler outperforms both persistent homology--based methods and deep learning models in detecting subtle, localized morphological differences associated with aging. To facilitate interpretation, we develop a vectorization and visualization framework for SampEuler, which preserves rich morphological information and enables identification of structural features that distinguish thymi across age groups. Collectively, our results demonstrate that SampEuler provides a robust and interpretable approach for quantifying thymic architecture and reveals age-dependent structural changes that offer new insights into thymic organization and involution.</description>

In this text, we prove that: {\sl if the cohomology algebra $H^*(X;l\!k)$ is generated, as an algebra, by at least two linearly independent elements, then the sequence of Betti numbers $ \left( \dim H^n(LX;l\!k)\right)_{n\geq 1 }$ grows unbounded.</description>

      <title>Covering Maps with respect to Topologies on the Fundamental Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, using the classical covering theory, we introduce a generalization of covering maps of a space $X$ with respect to a topology $\tau$ on the fundamental group of $X$. We show that the famous notions, covering, semicovering, generalized covering and fibration maps are of special cases of this new notion $\pi_1^{\tau}$-covering map. Moreover, among presenting some properties for this new notion, we compare $\pi_1^{\tau}$-covering maps of a space $X$ for several famous topologies on the fundamental group of $X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish Poincar\'e embedding results in the relative setting, generalizing previously known results in the absolute case. Our primary motivation comes from applications to non-simply connected Poincar\'e surgery, which will be developed in a forthcoming paper. Along the way, we introduce a new tool: the relative Hopf invariant in the equivariant setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that discrete and classical homotopy theories are equivalent after localizing at n-equivalences for any non-negative integer n. By constructing an explicit homotopy inverse to the graph nerve functor associating an n-fibrant cubical set to a graph, we are also able to give explicit computations of several previously unknown discrete homotopy groups of boundaries of cubes and suspensions of cycles.</description>

      <title>Nonabelian Anyons attached to Superconducting Islands in FQH Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea that topologically protected quantum states, such as anyons, may be attached to super/semiconductor heterostructures has received enormous attention, but experimental signatures in 1D systems remain elusive. Here we revisit theoretical underpinnings of anyons in 2D fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems, whose signatures have been experimentally observed by independent groups. Invoking novel theorems about the Hopfion or $\mathbb{C}P^1$-model understood as flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy, we demonstrate a robust prediction for possibly nonabelian anyonic states induced by superconducting islands.</description>

      <title>Input/output coloring and Gr\"obner basis for dioperads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By selecting a specific input or output of a dioperadic tree, we transform it into a rooted tree and induce a corresponding colored operadic structure. This fundamental pictorial construction demonstrates how the machinery of Gr\"obner bases and the theory of Hilbert series (well-established for (colored) operads) can be adapted to the dioperadic setting.
  We illustrate this framework by providing several examples and applications: (1) we compute the dimensions of the spaces of operations for the dioperad of Lie bialgebras; (2) we describe a Gr\"obner basis and a minimal resolution for the dioperad of triangular Lie bialgebras; (3) we provide computations for the dioperad of ``algebraic string operations''; (4) we present a graphical construction that establishes the existence of quadratic Gr\"obner bases and the Koszul property for a broad class of dioperads originating from cyclic operads.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology via Finite Topological Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a functorial framework for persistent homology based on finite topological spaces and their associated posets. Starting from a finite metric space, we associate a filtration of finite topologies whose structure maps are continuous identity maps. By passing functorially to posets and to order complexes, we obtain persistence modules without requiring inclusion relations between the resulting complexes. We show that standard poset-level simplifications preserve persistent invariants and establish stability of the resulting persistence diagrams under perturbations of the input metric in a basic density-based instantiation, illustrating how stability arguments arise naturally in our framework. We further introduce a concrete density-guided construction, designed to be faithful to anchor neighborhood structure at each scale, and demonstrate its practical viability through an implementation tested on real datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.04787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe locally the representation varieties of fundamental groups for smooth complex varieties at representations coming from the monodromy of a variation of mixed Hodge structure. Given such a manifold $X$ and such a linear representation $\rho$ of its fundamental group $\pi_1(X,x)$, we use the theory of Goldman-Millson and pursue our previous work that combines mixed Hodge theory with derived deformation theory to construct a mixed Hodge structure on the formal local ring $\widehat{\mathcal{O}}_\rho$ to the representation variety of $\pi_1(X,x)$ at $\rho$. Then we show how a weighted-homogeneous presentation of $\widehat{\mathcal{O}}_\rho$ is induced directly from a splitting of the weight filtration of its mixed Hodge structure. In this way we recover and generalize theorems of Eyssidieux-Simpson ($X$ compact) and of Kapovich-Millson ($\rho$ finite).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2002.04735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the Smith question which reads as follows. Is it true that for a finite group acting smoothly on a sphere with exactly two fixed points, the tangent spaces at the fixed points have always isomorphic group module structures defined by differentiation of the action? We show that one can answer this question negatively by using the technique of induction of group representations. We apply our results to indicate new dimensions of spheres admitting actions of specific Oliver groups, which give the negative answer to the Smith question. In particular, for the first time, we indicate some solvable non-nilpotent Oliver groups which yield negative answers to the Smith question.</description>

Abstract: We develop foundations for abstract homotopy theory based on Grothendieck's idea of a "derivator". The theory is model-independent, and does not depend on model categories, nor on simplicial sets. It is designed to accomodate all the usual potential applications, such as e.g. enhancements for derived categories of coherent sheaves, in a way that is as close as possible to usual category theory.</description>

      <title>How to Build Anomalous (3+1)d Topological Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for constructing (3+1)-dimensional topological orders or topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) that realize specified anomalies of finite symmetries, as encountered in gauge theories with fermions or in fermionic lattice systems. Our approach generalizes the symmetry-extension construction to the fermionic setting, and is grounded in recent advances in the categorical classification of anomalous TQFTs in (3+1)d. In this framework, symmetry-extension data of a supercohomology theory are translated into a fusion 2-category, on which the anomalous TQFT is built. Building on this machinery, we demonstrate explicit calculations for various symmetry groups and their associated anomalies, with the help of a hastened Adams spectral sequence for computing supercohomology groups which we will detail in a planned sequel. Finally, we prove that all supercohomology anomalies can be realized by fermionic topological orders, whereas beyond-supercohomology anomalies cannot, resolving a question of C\'ordova--Ohmori for fermionic (3+1)d systems with finite symmetries.</description>

      <title>Localizing invariants of constructible sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an open-closed decomposition of the stratifying poset, we construct a new semi-orthogonal decomposition of the $\infty$-category of constructible sheaves on a stratified space admitting an exit-path $\infty$-category. From this we obtain a direct sum decomposition of the localizing invariants of the $\infty$-category of constructible sheaves. Since the $\ast$-pullback to the open stratum in the usual (recollement) semi-orthogonal decomposition is not strongly left adjoint, this splitting does not follow from pure sheaf theory considerations. Instead, the splitting crucially relies on the exodromy equivalence: it implies that on the level of constructible sheaves, the $\ast$-pullback to a closed stratum and the $!$-pushforward from an open stratum admit left adjoints. These new functors provide an additional semi-orthogonal decomposition (with the roles of open and closed reversed) in which the relevant functors are strongly left adjoint.</description>
