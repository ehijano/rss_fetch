      <title>Aptamer-protein interaction prediction model based on transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aptamers are single-stranded DNA/RNAs or short peptides with unique tertiary structures that selectively bind to specific targets. They have great potential in the detection and medical fields. Here, we present SelfTrans-Ensemble, a deep learning model that integrates sequence information models and structural information models to extract multi-scale features for predicting aptamer-protein interactions (APIs). The model employs two pre-trained models, ProtBert and RNA-FM, to encode protein and aptamer sequences, along with features generated from primary sequence and secondary structural information. To address the data imbalance in the aptamer dataset imbalance, we incorporated short RNA-protein interaction data in the training set. This resulted in a training accuracy of 98.9% and a test accuracy of 88.0%, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in accurately predicting APIs. Additionally, analysis using molecular simulation indicated that SelfTrans-Ensemble is sensitive to aptamer sequence mutations. We anticipate that SelfTrans-Ensemble can offer a more efficient and rapid process for aptamer screening.</description>

      <title>Generative Modeling of Full-Atom Protein Conformations using Latent Diffusion on Graph Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17064v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of dynamic proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for understanding their function, yet most generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore conformational diversity altogether. We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>Smartphone-integrated RPA-CRISPR-Cas12a Detection System with Microneedle Sampling for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of Potato Late Blight in Early Stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Potato late blight, caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans, is one of the most devastating diseases affecting potato crops in the history. Although conventional detection methods of plant diseases such as PCR and LAMP are highly sensitive and specific, they rely on bulky and expensive laboratory equipment and involve complex operations, making them impracticable for point-of care diagnosis in the field. Here in this study, we report a portable RPA-CRISPR based diagnosis system for plant disease, integrating smartphone for acquisition and analysis of fluorescent images. A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) microneedle patch was employed for sample extraction on the plant leaves within one minute, the DNA extraction efficiency achieved 56 ug/mg, which is approximately 3 times to the traditional CTAB methods (18 ug/mg). The system of RPA-CRISPR-Cas12a isothermal assay was established to specifically target P. infestans with no cross-reactivity observed against closely-related species (P. sojae, P. capsici). The system demonstrated a detection limit of 2 pg/uL for P. infestans genomic DNA, offering sensitivity comparable to that of benchtop laboratory equipment. The system demonstrates the early-stage diagnosis capability by achieving a approximately 80% and 100% detection rate on the third and fourth day post-inoculation respectively, before visible symptoms observed on the leaves. The smartphone-based "sample-to-result" system decouples the limitations of traditional methods that rely heavily on specialized equipment, offering a promising way for early-stage plant disease detection and control in the field.</description>
