      <title>Permanent Capture into the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, an interesting region about the Sun in phase space is described where the permanent capture of an object, $P$, of small mass from interstellar space can occur, under the gravitational perturbation of the resultant mass of the Galaxy. $P$ is never ejected back into interstellar space and won't collide with the Sun. It cycles about the Sun for all time, asymptotically approaching the capture set. In addition to being permanently captured, $P$ is also weakly captured. A recent result in \cite{Belbruno:2024} describes this region in general. It has a fractal structure. This is applied to the permanent capture of rogue planets and other objects from interstellar space</description>

      <title>Shadows Wreak Havocs in Transition Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that shadows cast on a proto-planetary disk can drive it eccentric. Stellar irradiation dominates heating across much of these disks, so an uneven illumination can have interesting dynamical effects. Here, we focus on transition disks. We carry out 3D Athena++ simulations, using a constant thermal relaxation time to describe the disk's response to changing stellar illumination. We find that an asymmetric shadow, a feature commonly observed in real disks, perturbs the radial pressure gradient and distorts the fluid streamlines into a set of twisted ellipses. Interactions between these streamlines have a range of consequences. For a narrow ring, an asymmetric shadow can sharply truncate its inner edge, possibly explaining the steep density drop-offs observed in some disks and obviating the need for massive perturbers. For a wide ring, such a shadow can dismantle it into two (or possibly more) eccentric rings. These rings continuously exert torque on each other and drive gas accretion at a healthy rate, even in the absence of disk viscosity. Signatures of such twisted eccentric rings may have already been observed as, e.g., twisted velocity maps inside gas cavities. We advocate for more targeted observations, and for a better understanding on the origin of such shadows.</description>

      <title>A JWST/MIRI analysis of the ice distribution and PAH emission in the protoplanetary disk HH 48 NE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ice-coated dust grains provide the main reservoir of volatiles that play an important role in planet formation processes and may become incorporated into planetary atmospheres. However, due to observational challenges, the ice abundance distribution in protoplanetary disks is not well constrained. We present JWST/MIRI observations of the edge-on disk HH 48 NE carried out as part of the IRS program Ice Age. We detect CO$_2$, NH$_3$, H$_2$O and tentatively CH$_4$ and NH$_4^+$. Radiative transfer models suggest that ice absorption features are produced predominantly in the 50-100 au region of the disk. The CO$_2$ feature at 15 micron probes a region closer to the midplane (z/r = 0.1-0.15) than the corresponding feature at 4.3 micron (z/r = 0.2-0.6), but all observations trace regions significantly above the midplane reservoirs where we expect the bulk of the ice mass to be located. Ices must reach a high scale height (z/r ~ 0.6; corresponding to modeled dust extinction Av ~ 0.1), in order to be consistent with the observed vertical distribution of the peak ice optical depths. The weakness of the CO$_2$ feature at 15 micron relative to the 4.3 micron feature and the red emission wing of the 4.3 micron CO$_2$ feature are both consistent with ices being located at high elevation in the disk. The retrieved NH$_3$ abundance and the upper limit on the CH$_3$OH abundance relative to H$_2$O are significantly lower than those in the interstellar medium (ISM), but consistent with cometary observations. Full wavelength coverage is required to properly study the abundance distribution of ices in disks. To explain the presence of ices at high disk altitudes, we propose two possible scenarios: a disk wind that entrains sufficient amounts of dust, thus blocking part of the stellar UV radiation, or vertical mixing that cycles enough ices into the upper disk layers to balance ice photodesorption.</description>

      <title>PEPSI Investigation, Retrieval, and Atlas of Numerous Giant Atmospheres (PIRANGA). I. The Ubiquity of Fe I Emission and Inversions in Ultra Hot Jupiter Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution optical emission spectroscopy observations of the ultra hot Jupiters (UHJs) TOI-1431 b and TOI-1518 b using the PEPSI spectrograph on the LBT. We detect emission lines from Fe I with a significance of 5.40$\sigma$ and 7.85$\sigma$ for TOI 1431 b and TOI-1518 b, respectively. We also detect Cr I emission from TOI-1431 b at $4.23\sigma$. For TOI-1518 b, we tentatively detect Ni I, Fe I, and Mg I, as well as possibly CaH, at significance levels ranging from $3-4\sigma$. Detection of emission lines indicates that both planets possess temperature inversions in their atmospheres, providing further evidence of the ubiquity of stratospheres among UHJs. By analyzing the population of hot Jupiters, we compare models that predict the distribution of planets in the temperature-gravity space, and find a recent global circulation model suite from Roth et al. (2024) provides a reasonable match, if TiO is not included in the models. The ubiquity of strong Fe I emission lines among UHJs, together with the paucity of detections of TiO, suggest that atomic iron is the dominant optical opacity source in their atmospheres and can be responsible for the inversions.</description>

      <title>Polar orbits around the newly formed Earth-Moon binary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the dynamics and stability of circumbinary particles orbiting around the Earth-Moon binary system. The moon formed close to the Earth (semi-major axis $a_{EM}\approx 3\, R_\oplus$) and expanded through tides to its current day semi-major axis ($a_{ EM}= 60\, R_\oplus$). Circumbinary orbits that are polar or highly inclined to the Earth-Moon orbit are subject to two competing effects: (i) nodal precession about the Earth-Moon eccentricity vector and (ii) Kozai-Lidov oscillations of eccentricity and inclination driven by the Sun. While we find that there are no stable polar orbits around the Earth-Moon orbit with the current day semi-major axis, polar orbits were stable immediately after the formation of the Moon, at the time when there was a lot of debris around the system, up to when the semi-major axis reached about $a_{ EM}\approx 10\, R_\oplus$. We discuss implications of polar orbits on the evolution of the Earth-Moon system and the possibility of polar orbiting moons around exoplanet-moon binaries.</description>

      <title>Badminton Birdie-Like Aerodynamic Alignment of Drifting Dust Grains by Subsonic Gaseous Flows in Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent (sub)millimeter polarization observations of protoplanetary disks reveal toroidally aligned, effectively prolate dust grains large enough (at least ~100 $\mu$m) to efficiently scatter millimeter light. The alignment mechanism for these grains remains unclear. We explore the possibility that gas drag aligns grains through gas-dust relative motion when the grain's center of mass is offset from its geometric center, analogous to a badminton birdie's alignment in flight. A simple grain model of two non-identical spheres illustrates how a grain undergoes damped oscillations from flow-induced restoring torques which align its geometric center in the flow direction relative to its center of mass. Assuming specular reflection and subsonic flow, we derive an analytical equation of motion for spheroids where the center of mass can be shifted away from the spheroid's geometric center. We show that a prolate or an oblate grain can be aligned with the long axis parallel to the gas flow when the center of mass is shifted along that axis. Both scenarios can explain the required effectively prolate grains inferred from observations. Application to a simple disk model shows that the alignment timescales are shorter than or comparable to the orbital time. The grain alignment direction in a disk depends on the disk (sub-)structure and grain Stokes number (St) with azimuthal alignment for large St grains in sub-Keplerian smooth gas disks and for small St grains near the gas pressure extrema, such as rings and gaps.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous terminators on the exoplanet WASP-39 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy has been a workhorse technique over the past two decades to constrain the physical and chemical properties of exoplanet atmospheres. One of its classical key assumptions is that the portion of the atmosphere it probes -- the terminator region -- is homogeneous. Several works in the past decade, however, have put this into question for highly irradiated, hot ($T_{eq}\gtrsim 1000$ K) gas giant exoplanets both empirically and via 3-dimensional modelling. While models predict clear differences between the evening (day-to-night) and morning (night-to-day) terminators, direct morning/evening transmission spectra in a wide wavelength range has not been reported for an exoplanet to date. Under the assumption of precise and accurate orbital parameters on WASP-39 b, here we report the detection of inhomogeneous terminators on the exoplanet WASP-39 b, which allows us to retrieve its morning and evening transmission spectra in the near-infrared ($2-5\ \mu$m) using JWST. We observe larger transit depths in the evening which are, on average, $405 \pm 88$ ppm larger than the morning ones, also having qualitatively larger features than the morning spectrum. The spectra are best explained by models in which the evening terminator is hotter than the morning terminator by $177^{+65}_{-57}$ K with both terminators having C/O ratios consistent with solar. General circulation models (GCMs) predict temperature differences broadly consistent with the above value and point towards a cloudy morning terminator and a clearer evening terminator.</description>

      <title>Resilience of Snowball Earth to Stochastic Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth went through at least two periods of global glaciation (i.e., ``Snowball Earth'' states) during the Neoproterozoic, the shortest of which (the Marinoan) may not have lasted sufficiently long for its termination to be explained by the gradual volcanic build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Large asteroid impacts and supervolcanic eruptions have been suggested as stochastic geological events that could cause a sudden end to global glaciation via a runaway melting process. Here, we employ an energy balance climate model to simulate the evolution of Snowball Earth's surface temperature after such events. We find that even a large impactor (diameters of $d \sim 100\,\mathrm{km}$) and the supervolcanic Toba eruption ($74\,\mathrm{kyr}$ ago), are insufficient to terminate a Snowball state unless background CO$_2$ has already been driven to high levels by long-term outgassing. We suggest, according to our modeling framework, that Earth's Snowball states would have been resilient to termination by stochastic events.</description>

      <title>Outstanding questions and future research of magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This short article highlights the unsolved problems of magnetic reconnection in collisionless plasma. The advanced in-situ plasma measurements and simulations enabled scientists to gain a novel understanding of magnetic reconnection. Still, outstanding questions remain on the complex dynamics and structures in the diffusion region, on the cross-scale and regional couplings, on the onset of magnetic reconnection, and on the details of energetics. Future directions of the magnetic reconnection research in terms of new observations, new simulations and interdisciplinary approaches are discussed.</description>

      <title>Automatic Parallel Tempering Markov Chain Monte Carlo with Nii-C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the high dimensionality or multimodality that is common in modern astronomy, sampling Bayesian posteriors can be challenging. Several publicly available codes based on different sampling algorithms can solve these complex models, but the execution of the code is not always efficient or fast enough. The article introduces a C language general-purpose code, Nii-C (https://github.com/shengjin/nii-c.git), that implements a framework of Automatic Parallel Tempering Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Automatic in this context means that the parameters that ensure an efficient parallel tempering process can be set by a control system during the initial stages of a sampling process. The auto-tuned parameters consist of two parts, the temperature ladders of all parallel tempering Markov chains and the proposal distributions for all model parameters across all parallel tempering chains. In order to reduce dependencies in the compilation process and increase the code's execution speed, Nii-C code is constructed entirely in the C language and parallelised using the Message-Passing Interface protocol to optimise the efficiency of parallel sampling. These implementations facilitate rapid convergence in the sampling of high-dimensional and multi-modal distributions, as well as expeditious code execution time. The Nii-C code can be used in various research areas to trace complex distributions due to its high sampling efficiency and quick execution speed. This article presents a few applications of the Nii-C code.</description>

      <title>The radiative torque spin-up efficiency of ballistic dust grain aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. Understanding the rotational dynamics of interstellar dust grains is quintessential for the analysis of the observed dust polarization signal. We aim to constrain the set of parameters for an accurate description of the rotational spin-up process of ballistic dust grain aggregates driven by radiative torques (RATs).
  Methods. We model the dust grains as complex fractal aggregates grown by the ballistic aggregation of uniform spherical particles (monomers) of different sizes. A broad variation of dust materials, shapes, and sizes are studied in the presence of different radiation sources.
  Results. We find that the canonical parametrization for the torque efficiency overestimates the maximal angular velocity $\omega_{\mathrm{RAT}}$ caused by RATs of grain aggregates, and to resolve this problem we propose a new parametrization which predicts $\omega_{\mathrm{RAT}}$ more accurately. We find that RATs are strongest for larger grains with smaller monomer-density, this manifests as size and monomer-density dependence in the constant part of the parametrization. Following the constant part, the parametrization has two power-laws with different slopes, which retain the universality for all grain sizes. The maximum grain rotation does not scale linearly with radiation strength, due to different drag mechanisms dominating depending on grain material and environment. The angular velocity $\omega_{\mathrm{RAT}}$ of individual single dust grains has a wide distribution and may even differ from the mean by up to two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Tidal Dissipation in Evolved Low and Intermediate Mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the observed occurrence for planets or stellar companions orbiting low and intermediate-mass evolved stars is increasing, so does the importance of understanding and evaluating the strength of their interactions. One of the fundamental mechanisms to understand this interaction is the tidal dissipation in these stars, as it is one of the engines of orbital/rotational evolution of star-planet/star-star systems. This article builds on previous works studying the evolution of the tidal dissipation along the pre-MS and the MS, which have shown the strong link between the structural and rotational evolution of stars and tidal dissipation. This article provides for the first time a complete picture of tidal dissipation along the entire evolution of low and intermediate-mass stars, including the advanced phases of evolution. Using stellar evolutionary models, the internal structure of the star is computed from the pre-MS all the way up to the white dwarf phase, for stars with initial mass between 1 and 4 Msun. Tidal dissipation is separated into two components: the dissipation of the equilibrium (non-wavelike) tide and the dissipation of the dynamical (wavelike) tide. For evolved stars the dynamical tide is constituted by progressive internal gravity waves. The significance of both the equilibrium and dynamical tide dissipation becomes apparent within distinct domains of the parameter space. The dissipation of the equilibrium tide is dominant when the star is large in size or the companion is far away from the star. Conversely the dissipation of the dynamical tide is important when the star is small in size or the companion is close to the star. Both the equilibrium and the dynamical tides are important in evolved stars, and therefore both need to be taken into account when studying the tidal dissipation in evolved stars and the evolution of planetary or/and stellar companions orbiting them.</description>

      <title>The updated BOSZ synthetic stellar spectral library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The modeling of stellar spectra of flux standards observed by the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes requires a large synthetic spectral library that covers a wide atmospheric parameter range.
  Aims. The aim of this paper is to present and describe the calculation methods behind the updated version of the BOSZ synthetic spectral database, which was originally designed to fit the CALSPEC flux standards. These new local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) models incorporate both MARCS and ATLAS9 model atmospheres, updated continuous opacities, and 23 new molecular line lists.
  Methods. The new grid was calculated with Synspec using the LTE approximation and covers metallicities [M/H] from -2.5 to 0.75 dex, [alpha/M] from -0.25 to 0.5 dex, and [C/M] from -0.75 to 0.5 dex, providing spectra for 336 unique compositions. Calculations for stars between 2800 and 8000 K use MARCS model atmospheres, and ATLAS9 is used between 7500 and 16,000 K.
  Results. The new BOSZ grid includes 628,620 synthetic spectra from 50 nm to 32 microns with models for 495 Teff - log g parameter pairs per composition and per microturbulent velocity. Each spectrum has eight different resolutions spanning a range from R = 500 to 50,000 as well as the original resolution of the synthesis. The microturbulent velocities are 0, 1, 2, and 4 km/s.
  Conclusions. The new BOSZ grid extends the temperature range to cooler temperatures compared to the original grid because the updated molecular line lists make modeling possible for cooler stars. A publicly available and consistently calculated database of model spectra is important for many astrophysical analyses, for example spectroscopic surveys and the determination of stellar elemental compositions.</description>

Abstract: How does molecular complexity emerge and evolve during the process leading to the formation of a planetary system? Astrochemistry is experiencing a golden age, marked by significant advancements in the observation and understanding of the chemical processes occurring in the inner regions of protostellar systems. However, many questions remain open, such as the origin of the chemical diversity observed in the early evolutionary stages, which may influence the chemical composition of the forming planets. Additionally, astrochemistry provides us with powerful tools to investigate the accretion/ejection processes occurring in the inner regions of young embedded objects, such as jets, winds, accretion streamers, and shocks. In this chapter, we review the observational efforts carried out in recent years to chemically characterize the inner regions of Solar-System analogs. We summarize our current understanding of molecular complexity in planet-forming disks and shed light on the existing limitations and unanswered questions. Finally, we highlight the important role of future radio facilities, like SKAO and ngVLA, in exploring the chemical complexity of the regions where planetary systems are emerging.</description>

      <title>Stellar metallicity is a key parameter for the search of Life in the Universe</title>

Abstract: The search for Life in the Universe generally assumes three basic life's needs: I) building block elements (i.e., CHNOPS), II) a solvent to life's reactions (generally, liquid water) and III) a thermodynamic disequilibrium. It is assumed that similar requirements might be universal in the Cosmos. On our planet, life is able to harvest energy from a wide array of thermodynamic disequilibria, generally in the form of redox disequilibrium. The amount of different redox couples used by living systems has been estimated to be in the range of several thousands of reactions. Each of these energy yielding reactions requires specialised proteins called oxidoreductases, that have one or more metal cofactors acting as catalytic centres to exchange electrons. These metals are de facto the key component of the engines that life uses to tap into the thermodynamic disequilibria needed to fuel metabolism. The availability of these transition metals is not uniform in the Universe, and it is a function of the distribution (in time and space) of complex dynamics. Despite this, Life's need for specific metals to access thermodynamic disequilibria has been so far completely overlooked in identifying astrobiological targets. We argue that the availability of at least some transition elements appears to be an essential feature of habitability, and should be considered a primary requisite in selecting exoplanetary targets in the search for life.</description>

      <title>Doomed Worlds I: No new evidence for orbital decay in a long-term survey of 43 ultra-hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-hot Jupiters are likely doomed by tidal forces to undergo orbital decay and eventual disruption by their stars, but the timescale over which this process unfolds is unknown. We present results from a long-term project to monitor ultra-hot Jupiters transits. We recovered WASP-12 b's orbital decay rate of dP/dt = -29.8 +/- 1.6 ms yr-1, in agreement with prior work. Five other systems initially had promising non-linear transit ephemerides. However, a closer examination of two -- WASP-19 b and CoRoT-2 b, both with prior tentative detections -- revealed several independent errors with the literature timing data; after correction neither planet shows signs of orbital decay. Meanwhile, a potential decreasing period for TrES-1 b, dP/dt = -16 +/- 5 ms yr-1, corresponds to a tidal quality factor Q*' = 160 and likely does not result from orbital decay, if driven by dissipation within the host star. Nominal period increases in two systems, WASP-121 b and WASP-46 b, rest on a small handful of points. Only 1/43 planets (WASP-12 b) in our sample is experiencing detectable orbital decay. For nearly half (20/42) we can rule out dP/dt as high as observed for WASP-12 b. Thus while many ultra-hot Jupiters could still be experiencing rapid decay that we cannot yet detect, a sizeable sub-population of UHJs are decaying at least an order of magnitude more slowly than WASP-12 b. Our reanalysis of Kepler-1658 b with no new data finds that it remains a promising orbital decay candidate. Finally, we recommend that the scientific community take steps to avoid spurious detections through better management of the multi-decade-spanning datasets needed to search for and study planetary orbital decay.</description>

      <title>Support for fragile porous dust in a gravitationally self-regulated disk around IM Lup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks, the birthplace of planets, are expected to be gravitationally unstable in their early phase of evolution. IM Lup, a well-known T-Tauri star, is surrounded by a protoplanetary disk with spiral arms likely caused by gravitational instability. The IM Lup disk has been observed using various methods, but developing a unified explanatory model is challenging. Here we present a physical model of the IM Lup disk that offers a comprehensive explanation for diverse observations spanning from near-infrared to millimeter wavelengths. Our findings underscore the importance of dust fragility in retaining the observed millimeter emission and reveal the preference for moderately porous dust to explain observed millimeter polarization. We also find that the inner disk region is likely heated by gas accretion, providing a natural explanation for bright millimeter emission within 20 au. The actively heated inner region in the model casts a 100-au-scale shadow, aligning seamlessly with the near-infrared scattered light observation. The presence of accretion heating also supports the fragile dust scenario in which accretion efficiently heat the disk midplane. Due to the fragility of dust, it is unlikely that a potential embedded planet at 100 au formed via pebble accretion in a smooth disk, pointing to local dust enhancement boosting pebble accretion or alternative pathways such as outward migration or gravitational fragmentation.</description>

      <title>From traffic jams to roadblocks: The outer regions of TW Hya with ALMA Band 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of TW Hya at 0.65 mm with 0.5 arcsecond angular resolution, together with high angular resolution archival observations at 0.87 mm, 1.3 mm, 2.1 mm and 3.1 mm. We constrain the outer disk emission with both image-plane retrieval, and visibility-plane modeling with non-parametric and parametric fitting tools. Our results confirm emission in the outer disk regions of TW Hya (60 au &lt;= R &lt;= 110 au) at 0.65 mm, 0.87 mm and 1.3 mm. With image-plane retrieval, we resolve the new continuum gap and ring, namely D79 and B86, at 0.87 mm and 1.3 mm. With visibility-plane modeling, we also detect this substructure at 0.65 mm in the form of a quasi-constant emission at the 1-sigma level. Furthermore, it has a high spectral index of 3.7, which may indicate dust grain sizes &lt;&lt; 1 mm. It may be a dust trap or a traffic jam, that has a flux density of 60 mJy and a mass (1.59 earth masses) that accounts for up to 2% of the dust disk at 0.65 mm. In conclusion, we confirm the existence of a faint ring in the outer regions of TW Hya at multiple millimeter wavelengths. With visibility-plane modeling, we are able to set constrains that are 3 times better than the resolution of our Band 8 observations.</description>

      <title>Tidal synchronization trapping in stars and planets with convective envelopes</title>

Abstract: Tidal torques can alter the spins of tidally interacting stars and planets, usually over shorter timescales than the tidal damping of orbital separations or eccentricities. Simple tidal models predict that, in eccentric binary or planetary systems, rotation periods will evolve toward a "pseudosynchronous" ratio with the orbital period. However, this prediction does not account for "inertial" waves that are present in stars or gaseous planets with (i) convective envelopes and (ii) even very slow rotation. We demonstrate that tidal driving of inertial oscillations in eccentric systems generically produces a network of stable "synchronization traps" at ratios of orbital to rotation period that are simple to predict but can deviate significantly from pseudosynchronization. The mechanism underlying spin synchronization trapping is similar to tidal resonance locking, involving a balance between torques that is maintained automatically by the scaling of inertial mode frequencies with the rotation rate. In contrast with many resonance locking scenarios, however, the torque balance required for synchronization trapping need not drive mode amplitudes to nonlinearity. Synchronization traps may provide an explanation for low-mass stars and hot Jupiters with observed rotation rates that deviate from pseudosynchronous or synchronous expectations.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and stability of biomolecules in C-H-O-N fluids at extreme pressure-temperature conditions</title>

Abstract: How life started on Earth is an unsolved mystery. There are various hypotheses for the location ranging from outer space to the seafloor, subseafloor or potentially deeper. Here, we applied extensive ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to study chemical reactions between NH3, H2O, H2, and CO at pressures (P) and temperatures (T) approximating the conditions of Earth's upper mantle (i.e. 10-13 GPa, 1000-1400 K). Contrary to the previous assumptions that larger organic molecules might readily disintegrate in aqueous solutions at extreme P-T conditions, we found that many organic compounds formed without any catalysts and persisted in C-H-O-N fluids under these extreme conditions, including glycine, ribose, urea, and uracil-like molecules. Particularly, our free energy calculations showed that the C-N bond is thermodynamically stable at 10 GPa and 1400 K. Moreover, while the pyranose (six-membered-ring) form of ribose is more stable than the furanose (five-membered-ring) form at ambient conditions, we observed the predominant formation of the five-membered-ring form of ribose at extreme conditions, which is consistent with the exclusive incorporation of \{beta}-D-ribofuranose in RNA. We have uncovered a previously unexplored pathway through which the building blocks of biomolecules may have originated in early Earth and other planets. Our findings contribute to an evolving understanding of the fundamental conditions necessary for life to arise.</description>
