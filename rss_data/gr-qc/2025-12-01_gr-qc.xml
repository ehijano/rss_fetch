      <title>Parity breaking reshapes black hole spectral dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a dynamical amplification mechanism for detecting symmetry breaking in black holes through environmentally driven spectral instabilities of quasinormal modes. Focusing on dynamical Chern-Simons gravity as a paradigm for parity violation, we perturb the Schwarzschild background with a localized potential bump. Our analysis reveals three distinctive phenomena absent in general relativity: 1) topological reconnections of mode branches, 2) counterintuitive mode stabilization that delays overtaking transitions, and 3) scalar mode dominance emerging at intermediate coupling strengths. These dynamical features amplify weak static splittings into observable signatures, establishing a connection between gravitational symmetry breaking and non-Hermitian spectral physics. Our framework provides new pathways for testing modified gravity theories through gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of hypershadows in higher-dimensional black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a fully numerical framework to compute and visualize the \emph{hypershadow}\cite{Novo:2024wyn}, the three-dimensional generalization of the black hole shadow in five-dimensional spacetimes. Our method is based on backward ray tracing and allows flexible control over observer position, enabling the reconstruction of the full shadow volume. For visualization, we combine discrete sampling with surface contouring and introduce reflection difference maps on central slices to quantify mirror symmetries. Applying this method to the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini and Myers-Perry geometries, we validate the former's spherical symmetry and systematically discuss the hypershadow's dependence on observer position and black hole spin parameters. We also provide compact quantitative measures for size reduction and global displacement, revealing clear monotonic trends.The framework is readily extendible to other metrics and opens the way to numerical studies of more exotic objects, such as black rings and their prospective toroidal hypershadows.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Conserved Quantities in $f(R)$-Gravity: Mei vs. Noether Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the symmetries and conserved quantities in $f(R)$ gravity for the static, spherically symmetric Reissner--Nordstr\"om spacetime using two complementary frameworks: Noether symmetries and Mei symmetries. Starting from a canonical Lagrangian for radial metric functions and the curvature scalar $R$, we derive the associated Hamiltonian and show that the Legendre map is regular whenever both the first derivative of $f(R)$ with respect to $R$ and the second derivative with respect to $R$ is non-zero. Within Noether's approach (variational and Lie-derivative forms), we obtain general, canonical, and internal symmetry classes and identify explicit generators; for the quadratic model $f(R)=R^{2}$ these include radial translations and scaling symmetries. We then formulate Mei symmetry conditions as invariance of the Euler--Lagrange equations under the first prolongation, which yields an overdetermined partial differential equation (PDE) system for the generator components. Solving this system for $f(R)=R^{2}$, we find eight independent Mei generators and construct the corresponding conserved currents, some without a direct Noether analog. The analysis demonstrates that Mei symmetries extend the standard Noether framework for higher-order Lagrangians and provide additional conserved quantities relevant to black-hole dynamics in modified gravity. We conclude with a comparison of the two symmetry schemes and outline applications to broader $f(R)$ models and to rotating spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from the late inspiral, transition, and plunge of small-mass-ratio eccentric binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole binaries with small mass ratios will be important sources for the forthcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. Models of such binaries also serve as useful tools for understanding the dynamics of compact binary systems and the gravitational waves they emit. Using an eccentric Ori-Thorne procedure developed in previous work, we build worldlines that describe the full inspiral and plunge of a small body on an initially eccentric orbit of a Kerr black hole. We now calculate the gravitational waves associated with these trajectories using a code that solves the Teukolsky equation in the time domain. The final cycles of these waveforms, the ringdown, contains a superposition of Kerr quasinormal modes followed by a power-law tail. In this paper, we study how a binary's eccentricity and orbital anomaly angle affect the excitation of both quasinormal modes and late-time tails. We find that the relative excitation of quasinormal modes varies in an important and interesting way with these parameters. For some anomaly angles, the relative excitations of quasinormal modes are essentially indistinguishable from those excited in quasi-circular coalescences. Consistent with other recent studies, we find that eccentricity tends to amplify the late-time power-law tail, though the amount of this amplification varies significantly with orbital anomaly. We thus find that eccentricity has an important impact on the late-time coalescence waveform, but the interplay of eccentricity and orbit anomaly complicates this impact.</description>

      <title>Bayesian analysis of late-time tails in spin-aligned eccentric binary black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of late-time tails in gravitational radiation from merging spin-aligned eccentric binary black holes, using high-accuracy point-particle black hole perturbation theory simulations. We simulate the late-time evolution of 15 binary black hole mergers with mass ratio $q = 1000$, dimensionless spins $\chi = [-0.9, -0.6, 0.0, 0.6, 0.9]$ and eccentricity at the last stable orbit $e_{\rm LSO} = [0.8, 0.9, 0.95]$. We track the tail amplitudes and exponents up to a retarded time coordinate $t = 9000M$ after merger for the six spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes $(2,1)$, $(2,2)$, $(3,2)$, $(3,3)$, $(4,3)$, and $(4,4)$ employing both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. We note that the tails are increasingly pronounced for binaries with high eccentricity $e_{\rm LSO}$ and large negative spin $\chi$. We find that the overall late-time exponents closely approach their predicted asymptotic values ($p=-\ell-4$ for Weyl curvature scalar $\psi_{4,\ell m}$ where $\ell$ is the spin-weighted spherical harmonic index), while estimates restricted to the latest portion of the data exactly recover them. We further verify numerically that modes with the same spherical index $\ell$ share identical tail exponents, while variations in $m$ do not affect the tail behavior. Our analysis framework is publicly available through the gwtails Python package.</description>

      <title>Searches for Post-Merger Gravitational Waves with CoCoA: Sensitivity Projections Across Large Template Banks for Current and Next-Generation Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-messenger detection of the binary neutron star (NS) merger GW170817 has revolutionized the field of gravitational wave (GW) astronomy. However, several important questions remain to be answered. One of these is the nature of the compact remnant leftover by GW170817 (short- or long-lived NS versus black hole). A key goal going forward is to understand the diversity of NS-NS merger remnants, and how such diversity maps onto their viability as gamma-ray burst (GRB) central engines. Here, we present a study aimed at assessing the sensitivity of triggered searches for intermediate-duration, post-merger GWs powered by long-lived GRB remnants using networks of current and future ground-based GW detectors and the Cross-Correlation Algorithm (CoCoA). We develop a Python-based framework to efficiently estimate CoCoA distance horizons for a broad range of post merger secular bar-mode waveforms and for different GW detector networks. This framework can be used to identify the most promising regions of parameter space in which to concentrate search efforts, helping design future search strategies to optimally balance search sensitivity and related parameter space gridding schema against computational cost.</description>

      <title>Measuring Cosmological Redshift Using Gravitational Waves from Compact Binaries with Mass Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass transfer process is prevalent during the inspiral phase of compact binary systems. Detection of gravitational waves from the inspiral phase of binaries with white dwarfs will allow us to measure the mass transfer rate. Mass transfer effects provide additional contributions to the phase of gravitational waves, which can break the degeneracy between binary masses and redshift. Based on the analytic mass transfer rate to the first order post-Newtonian evolution of orbital angular frequency, we use the Fisher matrix to forecast the ability of DECIGO to measure the redshift of compact binaries with mass transfer. We conclude that for compact binary systems containing white dwarfs, the redshift can be determined to an accuracy of $10\%$ for $z=0.01$ with a $SNR\thicksim 30$.</description>

      <title>Abelian and non-Abelian mimetic black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate black hole solutions in the mimetic extension of the Einstein-Yang-Mills system, in which the Yang-Mills term is constrained to be constant. In the Abelian U(1) case, we find a static spherically symmetric solution that includes the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom black holes as special cases. Moreover, we identify a stealth Schwarzschild solution with an electric hair. We show that it is impossible to have magnetic hair in the U(1) gauge case, while, in contrast, the non-Abelian SU(2) stealth solutions can sustain both electric and magnetic hair. Unlike the conventional SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills black hole, which requires a unit magnetic parameter to exhibit nontrivial non-Abelian contributions, the stealth mimetic SU(2) solution admits genuinely non-Abelian configurations with arbitrary integer magnetic parameter.</description>

      <title>Hotspot Image Driven by Magnetic Reconnection in Kerr-anti-de Sitter Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the Comisso-Asenjo mechanism, we investigate the kinematic images of plasma before and after magnetic reconnection in Kerr-Anti-de Sitter(Kerr-AdS) black holes. Following a brief review of the Comisso-Asenjo process in Kerr-AdS black holes, we introduce the hotspot model and the imaging method. Building upon these foundational theories, we obtain the trajectory of the plasma and the temporal evolution of the hotspot images. It is found that there are three flares within the observing time, which is driven by the Comisso-Asenjo mechanism. We also discuss the influence of the cosmological parameter on the hotspot imaging. The results indicate that the hotspot image enlarges as the absolute value of $\Lambda$ increases, demonstrating that the cosmological constant significantly affects the hotspot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that General Relativity and other geometrical theories can be viewed as a degenerate Otto cycle with only heat-exchange legs in emergent gravity. Including work-producing legs yields controlled violations of local Lorentz invariance and energy-momentum conservation, which produce late-time cosmological acceleration. Implications for the cosmological constant problem, structure formation and local observations are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the newly obtained static black hole in bumblebee gravity affects the behavior of accreting matter and its observable signatures. The Lorentz-violating parameter that characterizes this geometry modifies photon trajectories and shifts the location of the critical curve that defines the shadow. Using ray tracing, we examine light deflection, the structure of direct emission, lensing rings, and photon rings, and we explore three thin-disk emission models--starting at the ISCO, at the photon sphere, and at the event horizon--together with static and infalling spherical accretions. Larger values of this parameter enlarge the shadow, move all optical features outward, and suppress the observed intensity through gravitational redshift, with additional dimming produced by Doppler effects for infalling matter</description>

      <title>Kerr black holes as circular polarizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the retrograde second caustics of extremal Kerr black holes, where the intensity of the light beam is infinitely magnified. We find that the caustics of different polarized beams are split by as much as $10^{-3}$rad by an external black hole for a suitable range of parameters. A lensing black hole at several lys away separates the polarized beams about $10^{12}$m apart. This splitting is larger than the radius of the Earth. Therefore, an observer on Earth would see different circularly polarized light according to their location. The polarization will change while the detector is wandering around. Thus, the polarization of light beams can be an important quantity in retrolensing observations.</description>

      <title>Net Charge Accretion in Magnetized Kerr Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the charging process of a rotating Kerr black hole of mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$ immersed in a stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically uniform magnetic field of strength $B_{0}$. In Wald's classic analysis (Wald 1974), which was based on the assumption of vanishing injection energy, the black hole was predicted to acquire a universal "saturation charge" $Q_{\mathrm{w}}=2B_{0}J$. However, the physical mechanism that sets the saturation charge must ultimately be governed by the competition between the absorption rates of positively and negatively charged particles. Motivated by this observation, we revisit the problem in the framework of a simple accretion model, where two dilute, equivalent fluxes of charged particles of opposite signs are injected from infinity along the magnetic field lines. The problem then reduces to that of individual particle motion in the electromagnetic field of the magnetized Kerr black hole. Using a combination of numerical and analytical tools, we determine the domains of absorption and establish both lower and upper bounds on the corresponding absorption cross sections. At $Q=Q_\mathrm{w}$ these bounds reveal a systematic difference between the two charge signs. In particular, for sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the lower bound on the absorption cross section for the "attracted" charge exceeds the upper bound for the "repelled" one. This charge accretion imbalance (which we find to become extreme at the limit of large $B_{0}$) indicates a persistent net charge accretion at $Q=Q_{\mathrm{w}}$, implying that the actual saturation charge must differ from Wald's charge $Q_{\mathrm{w}}$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Spectra and Wave Propagation in Regular Black Holes Supported by a Dehnen Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational perturbations, quasinormal modes, grey-body factors, and absorption cross-sections of the recently proposed regular and asymptotically flat black hole supported by a Dehnen-type dark-matter halo. This geometry provides a remarkably simple analytic model of supermassive black holes embedded in galactic environments, having a lapse function $
f(r)=1-2 M r^{2}/(r+a)^{3}, $
[R. A. Konoplya, A. Zhidenko, 2511.03066]. The regularizing parameter $a$ is the characteristic scale of the halo. We compute the quasinormal spectrum for both axial "up" and "down" perturbations using the WKB method and verify the results through time-domain integration. The two sectors are no longer isospectral, and the deviations grow with the halo scale parameter. The grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections are extracted via standard scattering boundary conditions and the WKB approach, and their behaviour is fully consistent with the structure of the effective potentials. Altogether, our analysis demonstrates that a dark-matter halo imprint induces modifications in the gravitational response, while the employed approximation schemes remain sufficiently accurate for quantitative predictions. At asymptotically late times, the presence of the halo does not alter the Price-law decay, which remains identical to that of a Schwarzschild black hole in vacuum.</description>

      <title>Minimum spacetime length and the thermodynamics of spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theories of emergent gravity have established a deep connection between entropy and the geometry of spacetime by looking at the latter through a thermodynamic lens. In this framework, the macroscopic properties of gravity arise in a statistical way from an effective small scale discrete structure of spacetime and its information content. In this review we begin by outlining how theories of quantum gravity imply the existence of a minimum length of spacetime as a general feature. We then describe how such a structure can be implemented in a way that is independent from the details of the quantum fluctuations of spacetime via a bi-tensorial quantum metric $q_{\alpha\beta}(x, x')$ that yields a finite geodesic distance in the coincidence limit $x\rightarrow x'$. Finally, we discuss how the entropy encoded by these microscopic degrees of freedom can give rise to the field equations for gravity through a thermodynamic variational principle.</description>

      <title>Multipole moments do not uniquely characterise spacetimes beyond general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacetimes in general relativity can be uniquely decomposed into a set of multipole moments. Given the usefulness of moments in the categorisation of radiation patterns, tidal deformations, and other phenomena associated with compact objects, a number of studies have explored their construction in beyond-Einstein theories of gravity. It is shown here that uniqueness does not necessarily extend across theories: by comparing a few static and spherically-symmetric solutions in different theories, we find that two distinct objects can possess the same Geroch-Hansen moments. Moreover, two metrics can match and yet take different moments. Implications of this result are explored in the context of black-hole shadows and ``universal'' relations hinging on moment computations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Bouncing Cosmology in Rastall-like Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the thermodynamic aspects of a modified version of Rastall's gravity theory and its implications for cosmological scenarios. We analyze the role of non-conserved energy-momentum tensor equations and investigate their influence on particle production within an irreversible thermodynamic framework. By introducing a novel Lagrangian, we derive modified field equations and establish their relationship with matter production, both with and without entropy generation. Our analysis focuses on ideal fluid models and extends to spatially flat LFRW cosmologies, providing key equations that govern energy density, pressure, and curvature dynamics. Furthermore, we propose a bouncing cosmological model, in which the universe undergoes cycles of contraction and expansion, avoiding the singularity associated with the Big Bang. Our results indicate that this bouncing scenario is feasible within the Rastall-like gravity framework, supported by particle production processes and stability conditions. The violation of energy conditions near the bounce point further confirms the consistency of this alternative cosmological model. The present work is focused on the theoretical foundations and internal consistency of the model; possible observational implications will be addressed in future investigations. We conclude that the proposed theory offers a coherent phenomenological approach to matter production and provides new insights into non-standard cosmological evolution.</description>

      <title>A Universal Smarr Formula via Coupling Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In gravitational theories containing matter fields and higher-derivative corrections, the standard Smarr formula often fails unless all dimensionful couplings are incorporated consistently. Traditionally, parameters such as the cosmological constant or the coefficients of higher-derivative terms are regarded as immutable features of the theory and therefore excluded from the thermodynamic phase space. In our recent work, we developed a fully general framework that promotes every such coupling to a dynamical, freely varying parameter of black hole solutions. This is accomplished by introducing, for each coupling, an auxiliary scalar and gauge field, through which the coupling appears as a conserved charge associated with the global sector of an emergent gauge symmetry. The corresponding conjugate variables naturally arise as electric potentials evaluated at the black hole horizon. As a result, the first law and the Smarr relation acquire additional, systematically determined contributions, yielding a consistent and universal extension of black hole thermodynamics. We illustrate the validity of this construction by revisiting several black hole examples in the literature where the Smarr formula remains inconsistent even after treating the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic variable. Our analysis shows that only by including all dimensionful couplings in this generalized manner can one obtain an internally consistent Smarr relation, thereby providing the foundation for a truly universal formulation of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic radiation from circular orbits in Schwarzschild--de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a charged particle orbiting a four-dimensional Schwarzschild--de Sitter black hole using a semiclassical approach. We calculate the probability amplitude for the charged particle to emit a photon, from which we derive the emitted power and spectral distributions. The results are compared with those obtained for scalar fields, considering both minimal and nonminimal coupling, as well as the corresponding electromagnetic case in the Schwarzschild spacetime. It is found that the total electromagnetic power is approximately twice that of the scalar field with conformal coupling for orbits with low angular velocity, similar to the Schwarzschild case, whereas for minimal coupling, the scalar power can even exceed the electromagnetic power. We also investigate the spectral distributions and possible synchrotron emission by orbits near the photon sphere. The electromagnetic case has a much broader frequency spectrum, with a non-negligible lower multipole contribution.</description>

      <title>Echoes of Traversable Wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study linear scalar perturbations of the four-dimensional, traversable wormhole solution of Maldacena, Milekhin, and Popov(arXiv:1807.04726). The geometry is constructed by matching an asymptotically flat, near-extremal Reissner--Nordstr\"om region to a throat described by $AdS_2 \times S^2$, supported by charged massless fermions. We derive the effective scalar potential governing wave dynamics, which when viewed in the tortoise coordinate, exhibits two extremely sharp and widely separated barriers. These barriers form a resonant cavity and are a direct consequence of the near-horizon geometry of the wormhole mouths. Using time-domain integration, we analyze the wormhole's response to an initial scalar wave packet inside the throat. We find that the late-time signal contains a distinct train of echoes whose amplitude depends on the angular momentum number $l$. We show that higher $l$ modes produce significantly stronger echoes, as the corresponding potential barriers are taller and more reflective, which results in more efficient trapping of the wave within the wormhole throat.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics and Universality in Black Holes: from the quasinormal Weyl's law to the binary merger waveform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art approaches to black hole (BH) dynamics, encompassing several effective approximation schemes, offer a remarkable control of the quantitative aspects of strong gravity. They also provide key insights into some qualitative aspects of the problem. In spite of this, there remain blind spots that hinder the understanding of the mechanisms underlying some observed phenomena, in particular concerning simplicity and universality in BH spacetimes. Adopting an 'asymptotic reasoning' approach, by filtering non-essential degrees of freedom, can potentially unveil universality patterns by identifying key underlying structural stability mechanisms. We first illustrate such an asymptotic approach by focusing on a BH quasinormal (QNM) Weyl's law, that accounts for the universal asymptotics of the QNM "counting function". This permits to identify light-trapping and the (local) redshift effect as the underlying mechanisms, also offering a bridge to the universal patterns found in BH QNM spectral instability. As a by-product, Weyl's law universality formally opens an observational access to spacetime (effective) dimensionality. More heuristically, we sketch a program recently put forward to apply such 'asymptotic reasoning' to address the observed simplicity and universality patterns in binary BH merger dynamics. This program is built as a hierarchy of asymptotic models, potentially making contact with integrability theory in gravity, namely through the background sector in a "wave-mean flow" approach to BH binary dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinite towers of higher-order corrections to General Relativity have been proposed as a mechanism to resolve singularities in early-universe cosmology and black holes, in a variety of settings. In this work, we consider an infinite tower of higher-order Proca corrections inspired by dimensional regularizations of Lovelock invariants. We find that the Big Bang singularity present in General Relativity is replaced by an inflationary epoch. Furthermore, the Lovelock-Proca tower allows for regular planar black hole solutions and spherically symmetric black holes with primary hair.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to the Calculation of Particle Creation from Analog Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of particle creation from accelerating mirrors is crucial for interpreting forthcoming analog Hawking radiation experiments such as AnaBHEL. However, realistic experimental setups render the associated Bogoliubov integrals analytically intractable. To address this challenge, we introduce the Inertial Replacement Method (IRM), a hybrid analytic-numerical framework for computing Bogoliubov coefficients for general moving-mirror trajectories. The IRM replaces the asymptotically inertial portions of a trajectory with analytic inertial extensions, so that numerical evaluation is required only for the finite accelerating segment. We derive perturbative error bounds for both perfectly and imperfectly reflecting mirrors, providing controlled accuracy estimates and guiding the choice of segmentation thresholds. The method is validated against analytically solvable trajectories and then applied to a fully numerical, PIC-based Chen-Mourou plasma-mirror trajectory relevant to the planned AnaBHEL experiment. A key physical insight emerging from this analysis is that the radiation spectrum is determined almost entirely by the finite accelerating region, with negligible sensitivity to the far-past and far-future inertial motion. These results establish the IRM as a reliable and broadly applicable computational tool for modeling particle creation in realistic analog-gravity systems such as AnaBHEL.</description>

      <title>Strong-field Gravitational Wave Lensing in the Kerr Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) can encode valuable information about the properties of the intervening lens, yet most existing studies remain restricted to the small-deflection, weak-field regime. To bridge this crucial gap, this work presents the first systematic analysis of strong-field, wave-optical GW lensing by a Kerr black hole (BH), extending recent results for non-rotating lenses obtained in Chan et al. to the astrophysically more relevant case of spinning lens. Using the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi formalism, we compute the strong-field scattering factor (SFSF) and show that the the spin produces characteristic modifications to the lensed waveform, and high-frequency incident radiation is not strongly absorbed by the BH lens, contrary to earlier claims in Chan et al. We further derive an explicit expression for the observed waveform for the general source-lens-observer configuration, showcasing the distortions produced by the scattering and quantifying their departure from the Schwarzschild case. Specializing to on-axis scattering, a mismatch analysis for a \texttt{GW150914}-like source lensed by a Kerr BH of mass $M=10^2M_\odot$ situated $100GM/c^2$ away from the source reveals percentage-level deviations from the direct (unscattered) wave at scattering angles near $30^\circ$, across a range of lens spin values. The mismatch exhibits a sharp decrease at larger scattering angles. For a fixed scattering angle, however, the mismatch shows only a weak dependence on the BH spin in the case of on-axis scattering, which may improve for more general off-axis considerations. The framework developed here offers a unified treatment of strong-field GW scattering in Kerr spacetime and provides tools for interpreting future high-precision observations of compact-object lenses in the wave-optics regime.</description>

      <title>Probing Observable Features of Lorentz violation in Low-Energy Ho\v{r}ava Gravity with Accretion Disk Images of Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the observable signatures of Lorentz violation (LV) in low-energy Horava gravity by simulating the images and polarization features of rotating LV black holes using a backward ray-tracing method. Within a thin-disk accretion model and the ZAMO framework, we numerically solve the geodesics equation of photon and simulate the corresponding thin-disk images and polarization patterns. The results show that the LV parameter l strongly affects the inner shadow, brightness asymmetry, and polarization properties of the thin disk. The decrease of l leads to a more elliptical and untilted inner shadow, while increasing l produces a pronounced leftward D-shaped structure of the critical curve. In addition, the variation of l alters the distribution of polarized intensity and polarization direction, especially near the critical curve. Moreover, it also shows that a positive l enhances the black hole's angular velocity, while a negative one suppresses it, indicating that the sign of l determines the trend direction of the LV effect. These findings suggest that future high-resolution EHT observations combining the thin-disk images and polarization patterns could provide valuable tests of the LV effect.</description>

      <title>Internal structure of Hayward black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular black holes, free of central singularities, provide an ideal laboratory for probing the geometric structure of spacetime. The global structure of some regular black holes, e.g. Hayward black hole, features an event horizon and a Cauchy horizon, raising fundamental questions about the latter's stability. In this work, we investigate collapse of a scalar field in Hayward spacetime. Under weak scalar perturbations, the inner horizon maintains a stable finite radius. In the circumstance of a strong scalar field, the inner horizon shrinks to zero volume, accompanied by the formation of a spacelike singularity. The Hayward geometry is effectively converted into a Schwarzschild-like geometry. Furthermore, the strength of the scalar field governs the contraction dynamics of the inner horizon. As the parameter $p$ of the initial profile for the scalar field approaches the critical threshold ${p_*}$, the radius of the inner horizon ${r_{-}}$ exhibits a universal scaling behavior: ${r_{-}}\propto{|p - {p_*}|^\gamma}$, with a critical exponent $\gamma\approx 0.5$.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear late-time tails on dynamical black hole spacetimes via time integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the global leading-order late-time asymptotic behaviour of solutions to inhomogeneous wave equations on dynamical black hole exterior backgrounds that settle down to Schwarzschild backgrounds with arbitrarily small decay rates. In particular, we show that for non-spherically symmetric solutions arising from compactly supported initial data, the late-time decay deviates from Price's law -- governing the decay for stationary black hole backgrounds -- by exhibiting slower time decay by exactly one additional power.
  Our proof is based around the observation that the emergence of late-time "tails", featuring inverse-polynomial decay in time, is intimately connected to conformal irregularity properties in space (towards future null infinity) of time integrals of the solutions. This relationship is exploited through a purely physical-space approach based around energy estimates, in which the dynamical wave operator is treated as a Schwarzschild wave operator with an inhomogeneous term. Going from almost-sharp decay to global asymptotics is achieved by exploiting this relation for the difference between the solution and a carefully chosen global tail function.
  We further apply our method to several examples of nonlinear wave equations and comment on its robustness to more general settings, such as dynamical spacetimes converging to sub-extremal Kerr spacetimes and higher-dimensional wave operators with even or odd spacetime dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We use diffeomorphic mappings to connect black hole metrics with complex solutions allowed by the Kontsevich-Segal criterion. By swapping radial and time-like coordinates and applying complex mappings, we derive dynamic metrics suitable for a Quantum Field Theory. This is shown for static and rotating black holes, mapping their interiors into the Kantowski-Sachs and a specific Gowdy-type cosmological model. We offer interpretations of the period during which the Kontsevich-Segal criterion holds.</description>

      <title>Multipartite entanglement features of primordial non-gaussianities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss some entanglement features associated with cubic non-Gaussian perturbations in single-field inflationary scenarios. We adopt standard momentum-space techniques to show how multipartite entanglement arises for inflationary perturbation modes, focusing on the dynamics of the comoving curvature perturbation. In particular, we quantify entanglement generation via the recently proposed Entanglement Distance, which introduces a geometric interpretation of quantum correlations in terms of the Fubini-Study metric. In the continuum limit, we show that the Entanglement Distance arising from displacement transformations is proportional to the total number of excitations in the quantum state for cubic perturbations, thus providing an upper bound on the von Neumann entanglement entropy of any reduced state compatible with such excitations. Within the interaction picture, we further observe that the quantum correlations arising from cubic gravitational interactions are typically much larger than the standard squeezing contribution, in agreement with previous studies focusing on von Neumann entropy generation across the Hubble horizon. We further show how the inflationary parameters affect the total amount of such correlations, highlighting in particular their dependence on the inflationary energy scales and the number of e-foldings during slow-roll.</description>

      <title>Cosmology in generalized hybrid metric-Palatini with matter-geometry coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological implications of a class of hybrid metric-Palatini gravity with a non-minimal matter-geometry coupling is considered. The theory contains a metric curvature tensor, together with a curvature tensor constructed from an independent affine connection. We will show that the model could be written as a bi-scalar-tensor gravity with a non-minimal coupling between matter sector and a scalar field. The theory will then be confronted with observational data from Cosmic Chronometers, BAO dataset from DESI and the Pantheon$^+$ dataset. We will show that the theory could be a good alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM model with the difference that the conservation of the baryonic matter sector holds only at the background level. The statefinder analysis will also be applied to the theory and it is observed that the DE behavior of the theory exhibits a quintessence to phantom transition occurs at redshifts around $z\approx0.86$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the tree-level scattering of massless scalars followed by an emission of a soft graviton in the small compact region inside the static patch in de Sitter space. We derive in the small cosmological constant limit the perturbative corrections to the Weinberg soft graviton theorem. Exploiting the remarkable relationship between asymptotic symmetries and soft theorems in flat space, we derive perturbative corrections to the supertranslation Ward identity. We further show that the derived supertranslation Ward identity reduces to the perturbative soft graviton theorem for the same choice of the supertranslation parameter as in flat space.</description>

      <title>Probing Exotic Astrophysical Dark objects through Astrometric Microlensing from Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive study of astrometric microlensing by exotic astrophysical dark objects, focusing on two theoretically motivated models -- Q-ball and boson star. We demonstrate that these extended objects generate distinctive signatures that depart markedly from point-mass lenses like primordial black holes. The smoking-gun signature for these exotic objects is the emergence of caustics, which form when the lens radius is below a critical threshold. Crossing these caustics induces discontinuous jumps in the images-centroid trajectory, a distinctive feature of these extended dark objects. We show these patterns are sensitive to the internal mass profile, with boson stars generating larger, more prominent caustic structures than Q-balls -- enabling the models to be distinguished. Using the Gaia DR3 stellar catalogue, we forecast a high-yield discovery potential, up to $\sim 6000$ detectable astrometric microlensing events for a 10-year mission, peaking for $M \sim 1-10~M_\odot$ and $R \lesssim 10~\text{AU}$. In the absence of anomalous detections, Gaia can set powerful 90% confidence level constraints on the fractional abundance of these exotic objects, reaching $f_{\mathrm{DM}} \le 10^{-3}$ in the peak region which covers masses from $10^{-1}-10^{7}~M_{\odot}$ and radii $R&lt;10^{6}~\text{AU}$. Crucially, these projected astrometric microlensing constraints are significantly stronger than existing photometric microlensing limits in the $1-10~M_\odot$ mass range. This work establishes astrometric microlensing with Gaia as a powerful, complementary, and near-future probe with the potential to discover exotic astrophysical dark objects.</description>

      <title>Algebras for generalized entanglement wedges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In asymptotically AdS spacetimes, the mathematical structure of the set of entanglement wedges reflects the algebraic structure of the underlying holographic description. For more general spacetimes, Bousso and Penington (BP) have recently proposed a generalization of entanglement wedges sharing many of the same properties as usual entanglement wedges. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that each generalized entanglement wedge can be associated with an algebra in the (generally unknown) fundamental description (in a semiclassical limit). We postulate features of the map from entanglement wedges to algebras that provide a natural algebraic interpretation for some of the basic mathematical properties of the set of entanglement wedges. Quantitatively, we suggest a possible generalization of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula that associates the gravitational entropy of a generalized entanglement wedge with an entropic quantity for the associated algebra. Through this assignment, inclusion monotonicity and strong-subadditivity properties shown by BP for generalized entanglement wedges would follow from various inequalities satisfied by algebraic entropies. We include a detailed appendix reviewing relevant algebraic background, including a discussion of algebraic entropies and their inequalities.</description>

      <title>Composite AdS geodesics for CFT correlators and timelike entanglement entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how to recover timelike worldlines in AdS from CFT data as a toy model for holographically reconstructing realistic observers. We give a bulk extremization procedure that determines composite timelike-spacelike geodesics that connect timelike-separated boundary points. The total geodesic length matches the length extracted from CFT correlators at the timelike-separated points. We show agreement in Poincar\'e AdS, for generic boundary points in global AdS, and also for the BTZ solution, in which the timelike segment probes behind the horizon. We refine related methods to compute timelike entanglement entropy in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ and recover known results.</description>

      <title>Robust evidence for dynamical dark energy in light of DESI DR2 and joint ACT, SPT, and Planck data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements released by DESI, when combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and type Ia supernova (SN) data, suggest a significant preference for dynamical dark energy (DDE) that exhibits the phantom-like behavior in the past and has transitioned into quintessence-like behavior today. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of six representative DDE parametrization models by utilizing the latest and most precise CMB data jointly from ACT, SPT, and Planck, in conjunction with BAO data from DESI DR2 and SN data from DESY5, PantheonPlus, and Union3. Our overall analysis indicates that the preference for DDE in the Quintom-B regime remains robust, regardless of the DDE parameterization model and the data combination employed. The trend of this preference is significantly strengthened with the support of DESY5 SN data. Specifically, when using the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, for the Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.785 \pm 0.047$ and $w_a = -0.43^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, which significantly deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM values and provide evidence for DDE at the $4.2\sigma$ level. By the reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$, normalized dark energy density $f_{\mathrm{DE}}(z)$, and the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, we also observe clear departures from $\Lambda$CDM, further reinforcing the case for DDE. Furthermore, the Bayesian evidence analysis indicates that the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, BA and Exponential models are moderately favored relative to $\Lambda$CDM based on the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data.</description>

      <title>Holographic origin of $a$-maximization and higher-derivative AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a consistent partially off-shell framework for evaluating higher-derivative actions of five-dimensional $\cal{N}=1$ gauged supergravity with abelian vector multiplets on AdS$_5$. Using the superconformal formalism, we show that the resulting holographic expression reproduces the trial $a$-anomaly coefficient of the dual conformal field theory, identifying the supergravity equations of motion with $a$-maximization. We present an exact correspondence between Chern-Simons couplings and the anomaly polynomial of the boundary theory. We illustrate our proposal by applying it to all known two- and four-derivative actions, including the ``off-diagonal'' invariants never before considered in the gauged supergravity literature. Finally, we argue that all invariants beyond four-derivative yield no genuinely new contributions to asymptotically AdS$_5$ BPS backgrounds, but instead reduce to linear combinations of the established two- and four-derivative actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) successfully predicts the density of topological defects deposited by the phase transitions, but it is not clear why. Its key conjecture is that, near the critical point of the second-order phase transition, critical slowing down will result in a period when the system is too sluggish to follow the potential that is changing faster than its reaction time. The correlation length at the freeze-out instant $\hat t$ when the order parameter catches up with the post-transition broken symmetry configuration is then decisive, determining when the mosaic of broken symmetry domains locks in topological defects. To understand why the KZM works so well we analyze Landau-Ginzburg model and show why temporal evolution of the order parameter plays such a key role. The analytical solutions we obtain suggest novel, hitherto unexplored, experimentally accessible observables that can shed light on symmetry breaking dynamics while testing the conjecture on which the KZM is based.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have recently entered the detection era, quickly moving beyond the goal of simply improving sensitivity at the lowest frequencies for the sake of observing the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB), and focusing on its accurate spectral characterization. While all PTA collaborations around the world use Fourier-domain Gaussian processes to model the GWB and intrinsic long time-correlated (red) noise, techniques to model the time-correlated radio frequency-dependent (chromatic) processes have varied from collaboration to collaboration. Here we test a new class of models for PTA data, Gaussian processes based on time-domain kernels that model the statistics of the chromatic processes starting from the covariance matrix. As we will show, these models can be effectively equivalent to Fourier-domain models in mitigating chromatic noise. This work presents a method for Bayesian model selection across the various choices of kernel as well as deterministic chromatic models for non-stationary chromatic events and the solar wind. As PTAs turn towards high frequency (&gt;1/yr) sensitivity, the size of the basis used to model these processes will need to increase, and these time-domain models present some computational efficiencies compared to Fourier-domain models.</description>

      <title>Imprints of flat space analyticity in de Sitter S-matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analytic structure of the flat-space S-matrix provides non-perturbative constraints on low-energy effective field theories based on the properties of high-energy theory. While the analytic structure of the flat-space S-matrix is well understood, extending this framework to de Sitter space is challenging, as the expanding background complicates the definition of asymptotic states and breaks time-translation symmetry. This paper investigates how flat-space analyticity is imprinted on the de Sitter S-matrix. We derive a relation between flat-space amplitude and de Sitter S-matrix on a specific limit called the Hubble flat-space limit. Specifically, we show that the relation holds for tree-level amplitude exchanging a massive scalar field with any local derivative interactions. Finally, we argue that the flat-space limit is more compatible with the description of effective field theory, as the total energy dependence of de Sitter S-matrix becomes trivial, allowing the Mandelstam variable to be identified as the unique energy scale, just as in flat space.</description>

      <title>Constraining of Nuclear Matter Equations of State With Rotating Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars can be regarded as natural laboratories that enable us to investigate nuclear matter properties under extreme conditions that are otherwise impossible to access in terrestrial experiments. Astrophysical observations of neutron stars provide invaluable information on existing nuclear interaction models and equations of state (EoSs) at various densities. Most studies of neutron star structure employ the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation which describes spherically symmetric, non-rotating stars in hydrostatic equilibrium. However, since neutron stars rotate fast, they could experience significant centrifugal deformation, and axially-symmetric calculations are required for accurate description of internal structure. The Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu (KEH) method is well known for modeling rapidly-rotating compact objects in a fully general relativistic manner. In this contribution, we report results of KEH calculations for rapidly-rotating neutron stars using EoSs based on Gogny-type finite-range effective nucleon-nucleon interactions. Our results show that the mass-radius relation systematically changes with increasing angular velocity, highlighting the importance of including rotational effects when confronting theoretical EoSs with observational data.</description>

      <title>Incorporating neutron star physics into gravitational wave inference with neural priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference, widely used in gravitational-wave parameter estimation, depends on the choice of priors, i.e., on our previously existing knowledge. However, to investigate neutron star mergers, priors are often chosen in an agnostic way, leaving valuable information from nuclear physics and independent observations of neutron stars unused. In this work, we propose to encode information on neutron star physics into data-driven prior distributions constructed with normalizing flows, referred to as neural priors. These priors take input from constraints on the nuclear equation of state and neutron star population models. Applied to GW170817, GW190425, and GW230529, we highlight two contributions of the framework. First, we demonstrate its ability to provide source classification and to enable model selection of equation of state constraints for loud signals such as GW170817, directly from the gravitational-wave data. Second, we obtain narrower constraints on the source properties through these informed priors. As a result, the neural priors consistently recover higher luminosity distances compared to agnostic priors. Our method paves the way for classifying future ambiguous low-mass mergers observed through gravitational waves and for continuously incorporating advances in our understanding of neutron star properties into gravitational-wave data analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate two different definitions of a scalar field effective potential in quantum field theory in de Sitter spacetime: the standard textbook definition, and the constraint effective potential proposed by O'Raifeartaigh et al. in 1986. While these definitions are equivalent in Minkowski spacetime, they differ significantly in de Sitter. We demonstrate this by computing them both explicitly at one-loop order in perturbation theory. It is well known that the perturbative expansion of the standard effective potential fails converge for light fields. In contrast, the constraint effective potential does not suffer from this infrared problem, and it can therefore be computed using perturbation theory. We discuss the physical interpretation of the two effective potentials. In particular, we provide evidence supporting an earlier conjecture that the constraint effective potential is the correct one to use in the stochastic Starobinsky-Yokoyama theory.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the motion of a rotating test body in the Schwarzschild space-time. After reduction, this problem reduces to an analysis of a three-degree-of-freedom. Hamiltonian system whose desired trajectories lie on the invariant manifold described by the Tulczyjew condition. An analysis is made of the fixed points of this system which describe the motion of the test body in a circle. New circular orbits are found for which the orbital angular momentum is not parallel to the angular momentum of the test body. Using a Poincare map, bifurcations of periodic solutions are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Minimal Hilbert Space in the Classical Dual States of Quantum Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A precise physical description and understanding of the classical dual content of quantum theory is necessary in many disciplines today: from concepts and interpretation to quantum technologies and computation. In this paper we investigate Quantum Entanglement with the new approach APL Quantum 2, 016104 (2025) on dual Classicalization. Thus, the results of this paper are twofold: Entanglement and Classicalization and the relationship between them. Classicalization truly occurs only under the action of the Metaplectic group Mp(n) (Minimal Representation group, double covering of the Symplectic group). Some of the results of this paper involves the computation and analysis of the entanglement for different types of coherent (coset and non coset) states and topologies: in the circle and the cylinder. We project the entangled wave functions onto the even (+) and odd (-) irreducible Hilbert Mp(n) subspaces, and compute their square norms: Entanglement Probabilities P++, P--, P+-, (eg in the same or in the different subspaces), and the Total sum of them, and more. These theoretical and conceptual results can be of experimental and practical real-world interest.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter and the Tachyonic Trap During Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that resonant processes during multi-field inflation can generate a large curvature perturbation on small scales. This perturbation naturally leads to the formation of primordial black holes that may constitute dark matter, as well as to the production of stochastic induced gravitational waves in the deci-Hz band. Such waves are within reach of future space-based interferometers such as LISA, DECIGO and BBO. In addition, primordial black hole binaries formed at late times produce merger gravitational waves that can be probed by the resonant cavity experiments in addition to DECIGO and BBO.</description>

      <title>Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential revisited in the context of Warm Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Warm Inflation is a scenario in which the inflaton field dissipates its energy during inflation to maintain a subdominant constant radiation bath. Two of its remarkable features are (i) inflation can be realized even by very steep potentials and (ii) such a scenario doesn't call for a separate post-inflation reheating phase. We exploit the first feature to show that Warm Inflation can successfully take place on the very steep left wing of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential while remaining in excellent agreement with current cosmological data (joint analysis of Planck, ACT and DESI). The Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential has a flatter right wing as well, which opens up the possibility of dark energy when the field rolls along this wing. However in order to successfully realize quintessential inflation one needs to (i) normalize the two wings of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential differently in order to bridge between the two extreme energy scales of inflation and dark energy, (ii) allow the quintessence field to be dissipative, which is consistent with the presence of a dissipative term in warm inflation. The dissipative dynamics of the quintessence field is needed in order to sustain slow-roll in the right wing. With these modifications, we demonstrate that the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential can give rise to a unified model of warm inflation (on the left wing) and transient dark energy (on the right wing).</description>

      <title>SlotFlow: Amortized Trans-Dimensional Inference with Slot-Based Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring the number of distinct components contributing to an observation, while simultaneously estimating their parameters, remains a long-standing challenge across signal processing, astrophysics, and neuroscience. Classical trans-dimensional Bayesian methods such as Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) provide asymptotically exact inference but can be computationally expensive. Instead, modern deep learning provides a faster alternative to inference but typically assume fixed component counts, sidestepping the core challenge of trans-dimensionality. To address this, we introduce SlotFlow, a deep learning architecture for trans-dimensional amortized inference. The architecture processes time-series observations, which we represent jointly in the frequency and time domains through parallel encoders. A classifier produces a distribution over component counts K, and its MAP estimate specifies the number of slots instantiated. Each slot is parameterized by a shared conditional normalizing flow trained via permutation-invariant Hungarian matching. On sinusoidal decomposition with up to 10 overlapping components and Gaussian noise, SlotFlow achieves 99.85% cardinality accuracy and well-calibrated parameter posteriors, with systematic biases well below one posterior standard deviation. Direct comparison with RJMCMC shows close agreement in amplitude and phase, with Wasserstein distances $W_2 &lt; 0.01$ and $&lt; 0.03$, indicating that shared global context captures inter-component structure despite a factorized posterior. Frequency posteriors remain centered but exhibit 2-3x broader intervals, consistent with an encoder bottleneck in retaining long-baseline phase coherence. The method delivers a $\sim 10^6\times$ speedup over RJMCMC, suggesting applicability to time-critical workflows in gravitational-wave astronomy, neural spike sorting, and object-centric vision.</description>

      <title>Vector-field spontaneous baryogenesis with Lorentz invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend spontaneous baryogenesis by considering the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_B$ through a complex vector field. This field interacts with baryons and leptons via a vector-current coupling and, by construction, acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value. Accordingly, the theory also exhibits a spontaneous violation of Lorentz invariance, effectively realizing a Bumblebee model. In this picture, the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson arising from spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)_B$ global symmetry is the global phase of the Bumblebee vector and, in the broken phase, it results minimally coupled with the baryonic current, guaranteeing the violation of the baryon number. Consequently, we assume that the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone, arising from spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_B$, plays the role of the inflaton, leading to baryogenesis across the entire inflationary stage, up to when the inflaton decays into baryon-antilepton and antibaryon-lepton pairs through a CP-violating interaction that also violates the Lorentz symmetry. Afterwards, we address the issue of flavor oscillations among baryon and lepton fields, including the oscillation probability in the calculation of the baryon asymmetry. Remarkably, our framework predicts a non-null mixing factor even for massless fermions. This mixing acts on the spatial momenta rather than on the masses of the produced fermions, allowing larger values of the coupling constant even guaranteeing the production of light fermions. The net baryon asymmetry results accordingly modified, and may also reproduce the experimental data for allowed values of the coupling constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a higher-dimensional universe that is a product of Minkowski space and the non-orientable Klein Bottle. The topology explicitly breaks important symmetries, such as translational invariance and (5+1)-dimensional CP invariance. Somewhat surprisingly, the (3+1)-dimensional cp of the Minkowski space can also be broken by the Klein Bottle, both explicitly and in the presence of a brane. The topology enforces a background of fermion correlations that amounts to a condensate wall localized in the Klein Bottle. The wall acts as an order parameter for the broken symmetries. If a brane passes through the wall, brane fermions that couple to the condensate are produced as quantified by the Bogoliubov coefficients for a time-dependent mass. The scenario meets the conditions, including cp violation, to potentially generate the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe.</description>

      <title>Schwinger effect with backreaction in 1+1D massive QED with a strong external field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of a strong electric field, the vacuum is unstable to the production of pairs of charged particles -- the Schwinger effect. The created pairs extract energy from the electric field, resulting in nontrivial backreaction. In this paper, we study 1+1D massive QED subject to strong external electric fields in a self-consistent and fully quantum manner. We use the bosonized version of the theory, which attains a cosine interaction term in the presence of nonzero fermion mass $m$. However, the assumption of strong electric field justifies a perturbative treatment of the cosine interaction, i.e., an expansion in $m$. We calculate the vacuum expectation value of the electric field to first order in $m$ and show that -- surprisingly -- it satisfies a classical nonlinear partial differential equation (related to the sine-Gordon equation). We show that the electric field exhibits dissipation-free oscillations (analogous to ordinary plasma oscillations) and calculate the plasma frequency analytically. We also compare to the semiclassical approximation commonly used to study backreaction, showing that it fails to capture the $O(m)$ shift in the plasma frequency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.15838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new, physical-space-based method for deriving the precise leading-order late-time behaviour of solutions to geometric wave equations on asymptotically flat spacetime backgrounds and apply it to the setting of wave equations with asymptotically inverse-square potentials on Schwarzschild black holes. This provides a useful toy model setting for introducing methods that are applicable to more general linear and nonlinear geometric wave equations, such as wave equations for electromagnetically charged scalar fields, wave equations on extremal Kerr black holes and geometric wave equations in even space dimensions, where existing proofs for deriving precise late-time asymptotics might not apply. The method we introduce relies on exploiting the spatial decay properties of time integrals of solutions to derive the existence and precise genericity properties of asymptotic late-time tails and obtain sharp, uniform decay estimates in time.</description>

      <title>A Weyl's law for black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a Weyl's law for the quasi-normal modes of black holes that recovers the structural features of the standard Weyl's law for the eigenvalues of Laplacian-like operators in compact regions. Specifically, we propose that the asymptotics of the counting function $N(\omega)$ of quasi-normal modes of $(d+1)$-dimensional black holes follows a power-law $N(\omega)\sim \mathrm{Vol}_d^{\mathrm{eff}}\omega^d$, with $\mathrm{Vol}_d^{\mathrm{eff}}$ an effective $d$-volume determined by the light-trapping properties of the black hole geometry. Concretely, the factorisation $\mathrm{Vol}_d^{\mathrm{eff}} \sim \left(8\pi/\kappa\right) \cdot \mathrm{Vol}^{\mathrm{trapped}}_{d-1}$ makes apparent the two underlying structural ingredients, namely the (local) redshift effect controlled by the surface gravity $\kappa$ and the volume $\mathrm{Vol}^{\mathrm{trapped}}_{d-1}$ of the (phase space) trapped set. In particular, this proposal extends the Weyl's law proved by Dyatlov &amp; Zworski for the counting of slowest decaying quasi-normal modes, to include overtones. As an application, these Weyl's laws could provide a probe into the effective spacetime dimensionality, upon the counting of sufficiently many quasi-normal modes in the ringdown signal of binary black hole mergers.</description>

      <title>Evolution of fluctuations in horizon energy and its dependence on the degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09771v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Taking account of the thermal nature of the Hubble horizon of the expanding universe, we analysed the evolution of relative fluctuations of horizon energy. For this analysis, we used two approaches: (i) by treating the Hubble horizon as a system in canonical ensemble, and (ii) by considering the microscopic degrees of freedom on the horizon. In both approaches, we obtained the relative fluctuations by using two different definitions of the horizon temperature; first, the Gibbons-Hawking temperature, and second, the Kodama-Hayward temperature. For a given temperature, both approaches yield the same general evolution for the fluctuations. In the asymptotic limit, the relative energy fluctuations corresponding to the Gibbons-Hawking temperature, is $[{\hbar G}/{2\pi}] H^2,$ and $2/N_{sur}$ for the first and second approaches respectively.
  Similarly, using the Kodama-Hayward temperature, the asymptotic fluctuations are $[{5\hbar G}/{2\pi}] H^2,$ and $10/N_{sur}.$
  This implies that, the magnitude of the relative fluctuations of the horizon energy is higher in the case of Kodama-Hayward temperature.
  The inverse dependence of the fluctuation on $N_{sur},$ the number of degrees of freedom on the horizon, reflects a familiar behaviour in ordinary thermal systems: fluctuations decrease as the number of degrees of freedom increases. Notably, we also found that the relative energy fluctuations establish a connection between the Planck length scale $L_p,$ characteristic length scale of the very early epoch of the universe, and $\sqrt{3/\Lambda},$ the length scale associated with the late-time accelerated phase. This relationship can offer valuable insights that could help in addressing the cosmological constant problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present exact solutions describing a fake Schwarzschild black hole that cannot be distinguished from the Schwarzschild black hole by observations. They are constructed by attaching a spherically symmetric dynamical interior solution with a matter field to the Schwarzschild exterior solution at the event horizon without a lightlike thin shell. The dynamical region inside a Killing horizon of a static spherically symmetric perfect-fluid solution obeying an equation of state $p=\chi\rho$ for $\chi\in[-1/3,0)$ can be the interior of a fake Schwarzschild black hole. The matter field inside such a black hole is an anisotropic fluid that violates at least the weak energy condition and can be interpreted as a spacelike (tachyonic) perfect fluid. While the author constructed the first model of fake Schwarzschild black holes using Semiz's solution for $\chi=-1/5$, we present another one using Whittaker's solution for $\chi=-1/3$ in this paper. We also present a model of fake Kerr black holes whose interior is filled with a different matter field violating only the dominant energy condition near the event horizon. Because it contradicts the conservation theorem, this configuration of black holes is, in fact, precluded by the dominant energy condition.</description>

Abstract: We consider semiclassical gravity with a Klein-Gordon field with mass $m^2 \geq 0$ and curvature coupling $\xi = 1/2$. We identify a special class of Hadamard two-point functions for which the semiclassical system is quasi-linear hyperbolic and, within this class, provide the first well-posedness result for semiclassical gravity without spacetime symmetries. These two-point functions yield stress-energy expectation values proportional to the spacetime metric (modulo ambiguities). If the proportionality constant vanishes, one has a quantum version of gravitational `stealth' configurations. We discuss that some of these solutions have regular Cauchy horizons in the light of strong cosmic censorship.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen rapid progress in calculations of gravitational waveforms from asymmetric compact binaries containing spinning secondaries. Here we outline a complete waveform-generation scheme, through first post-adiabatic order (1PA) in gravitational self-force theory, for generic secondary spin and generic (eccentric, precessing) orbital configurations around a generic Kerr primary. We emphasize the utility of a Fermi-Walker frame in parametrizing the secondary spin, and we analyse precession and nutation effects in the spin-orbit dynamics. We also explain convenient gauge choices within the waveform-generation scheme, and the gauge invariance of the resulting waveform. Finally, we highlight that, thanks to recent results due to Grant and Witzany et al., all relevant spin effects at 1PA order can now be computed without evaluating local self-forces or torques.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the absorption and scattering of charged massive scalar waves by the Kerr-Newman black-bounce spacetime when the waves are incident along the rotation axis. Our findings indicate that a faster (slower) rotating spacetime or a more repulsive (attractive) electric force tends to reduce (increase) the absorption cross section and results in larger (smaller) angular widths of the scattered wave oscillations. We find that the rotation parameter exerts a suppressive influence on superradiance, which contrasts with the enhancing effect of the repulsive electric force. It is worth mentioning that the regularization parameter $k$ is found to modify the absorption or scattering cross sections only weakly, but can cause a noticeable reduction of superradiance. To further clarify the role of the parameters in superradiance, we study the energy extraction efficiency in the electric Penrose process. For particles moving along the rotation axis, we find that the influence of the parameters ($a, q, k$) on this efficiency is consistent with their effects on superradiance. We also discuss potential astrophysical applications, showing that particles in this process could be accelerated to ultrahigh energies in realistic environments, and could therefore be used to constrain black hole parameters. For the effect of field mass, it is found that a heavier scalar field leads to a larger absorption cross section and a wider interference fringe of the differential scattering cross section. When superradiance happens, i.e., the absorption cross section becomes negative, it is also found that the differential scattering cross section only changes smoothly, with no apparent qualitative feature showing up.</description>

      <title>Waveform models for the gravitational-wave memory effect: II. Time-domain and frequency-domain models for nonspinning binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonlinear gravitational-wave (GW) memory effect$\unicode{x2014}$a permanent shift in the GW strain that arises from nonlinear GW interactions in the wave zone$\unicode{x2014}$is a prediction of general relativity which has not yet been observed. The amplitude of the GW memory effect from binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers is small compared to that of primary (oscillatory) GWs and is unlikely to be detected by current ground-based detectors. Evidence for its presence in the population of all the BBH mergers is more likely, once thousands of detections are made by these detectors. Having an accurate and computationally efficient waveform model of the memory signal will assist detecting the memory effect with current data-analysis pipelines. In this paper, we build on our prior work to develop analytical time-domain and frequency-domain models for the dominant nonlinear memory multipole signal ($l=2$, $m=0$) from nonspinning BBH mergers in quasicircular orbits. The model is calibrated for mass ratios between one and eight. There are three parts to the time-domain signal model: a post-Newtonian inspiral, a quasinormal-mode-based ringdown, and a phenomenological signal during the late inspiral and merger (which interpolates between the inspiral and ringdown). The time-domain model also has an analytical Fourier transform, which we compute in this paper. We assess the accuracy of our model using the mismatch between our waveform model and the memory signal computed from the oscillatory modes of a numerical-relativity surrogate model. We use the advanced LIGO sensitivity curve from the fourth observing run and find that the mismatch increases with the total mass of the system and is of order $10^{-2}\unicode{x2013}10^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>Can quantum gravity be both consistent and complete?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General relativity, despite its profound successes, fails as a complete theory due to presence of singularities. While it is widely believed that quantum gravity has the potential to be a complete theory, in which spacetime consistently emerges from quantum degrees of freedom through computational algorithms, we argue that this goal could be fundamentally unattainable. We examine how this limitation could emerge in various contexts, depending on whether or not every mathematically valid result is physically realized. In the first case, Godel's incompleteness theorems, along with related results by Tarski and Chaitin, imply that no theory formulated as a formal axiomatic system can be complete, and that within any computational framework, a fully consistent internal truth predicate is impossible. In the second case, if only a subset of mathematical truths is realized in nature, we argue that this selection cannot be determined by any purely computational process. Hence, a meta-theoretical approach based on non-algorithmic understanding is indispensable in every case. We discuss some possible consequences of this observation for describing physical systems and note that a non-algorithmic approach should be essential for any theory of everything.</description>

Abstract: Cosmic evolution is the most sensational topic among researchers of modern cosmology. This article explores cosmic evolution in 4D Einstein Gauss Bonnet (EGB) gravity, focusing on mass accretion of compact objects (black holes and wormholes) by dark energy (DE). Three DE models Chevallier Polarski Linder (CPL), Jassal Bagla Padmanabhan (JBP), and Barboza Alcaniz (BA) parameterizations are studied within 4D EGB gravity, with their Hubble parameters derived and compared against observational data (Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and CMB). Bayesian analysis favors the CPL and BA models, with CPL providing the best fit. For black holes, mass accretion of CPL and JBP DE shows transitions between quintessence and phantom eras, while BA and LambdaCDM strictly exhibit quintessence-like behavior, driving cosmic acceleration. In contrast, wormholes exhibit the opposite trend, favoring a phantom-dominated era for the BA and LambdaCDM models. The study highlights the dynamic nature of DE in 4D EGB gravity and its role in cosmic expansion.</description>

Applying the conversion in early universe with primordial magnetic field and the neutron star with strong magnetosphere, the generated gravitational waves, converted from the scalar field, exhibit distinct power spectra which can be potentially probed by future experiments such as DECIGO, BBO, CE and ET.</description>

      <title>Effect of Noncommutative Geometry on Accretion Disks around RGI-Schwarzschild Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the combined effects of quantum gravity induced by non-commutativity and scale-dependent gravitational coupling on the thermal properties of the thin accretion disks around a Schwarzschild black hole. We consider a $\kappa$-deformed Renormalization Group Improved (RGI) Schwarzschild black hole, where the classical Schwarzschild black hole geometry is modified by the $\kappa$-deformation of space-time and the running Newton's coupling constant $G(r)$. Using the modified metric, we derive the geodesic motion of massive particles, the effective potential, and the thermal properties such as the radiated energy flux, luminosity, and the temperature profile of the accretion disk around the $\kappa$-deformed RGI-Schwarzschild black hole. Our study shows that when non-commutativity is combined with the RGI framework, the effects produce a noticeable deviation from the classical Schwarzschild case. In particular, for small values of the deformation parameter, we observe an increase in the peak energy flux and the temperature of the accretion disk. This suggests that quantum gravity corrections enhance the disk's radiative efficiency, especially in the inner regions closer to the black hole.</description>

Abstract: An exact and analytical solution, in four-dimensional general relativity, describing a collinear array of an arbitrary number of Kerr black holes inside an expanding bubble of nothing is built, thanks to the inverse scattering technique. Physical properties and thermodynamics of the single Kerr in the bubble are studied. No cosmic strings or struts are present. The binary black hole system displays equilibrium configurations, because the expanding bubble surrounding the black holes balances the mutual gravitational attraction of the two constituents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of the stable distance over stable spacetimes are used as a reference to propose a simplified, abstract notion of spacetime. The discussion shows that spacetime, with its topology, causal order and (upper semi-continuous) Lorentzian distance, can be introduced in a general and minimalistic way. Specifically, it is shown that spacetime can be represented as nothing more than a family of functions defined over an arbitrary set, the functions being a posteriori interpreted as rushing time functions. The proof makes use of the product trick which reduces causality and metricity to causality in a space with one additional dimension, so leading to a kind of unification for the notions of time function and proper time. Ultimately, our results show that time fully characterizes spacetime.</description>

      <title>Strong Field Scattering of Two Black Holes: Exploring Gauge Flexibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in post-Minkowskian (PM) gravity provide new avenues for the high precision modeling of compact binaries. In conjunction with the effective one body (EOB) formalism, highly accurate PM informed models of binary black holes on scattering trajectories have emerged. Several complementary approaches currently exist, in particular the SEOB-PM model, the $w$_{\rm EOB} framework and the recent Lagrange-EOB (LEOB) approach. These models incorporate PM results in fundamentally different ways, employing distinct resummation schemes and gauge choices. Notably, both SEOB-PM and LEOB have been used to compute gravitational waves of bound systems, showing excellent agreement with numerical relativity (NR). The essential component to all of the models is the EOB mass-shell condition describing the dynamics of the two-body spacetime. In this work we will investigate how this mass-shell condition is constructed, paying particular attention to the impact of gauge choices and how they interact with different resummation schemes, showing that there is a strong dependence on both coordinate choice and EOB gauge. For the region of parameter space considered, we find that the best performing gauges coincide with the choices made in SEOB-PM and $w$_{\rm EOB}, with other choices exhibiting worse performance. The case of spinning black holes is also considered, where the current techniques for spinning EOB-PM are reviewed and compared. We also introduce a new gauge based upon the centrifugal radius, which improves upon previous models, particularly for large and negative spins. This offers a promising avenue for further resummation of spin information within the EOB-PM framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Carrollian limit ($c \to 0$) of General Relativity provides the geometric language for describing null hypersurfaces, such as black hole event horizons and null infinity. Motivated by the well-established electric and magnetic limits of Galilean electromagnetism, we perform a systematic analysis of the low-velocity limit of linearized gravity to derive its Carrollian counterparts. Using a 1+3 covariant decomposition, we study the transformation properties of linear tensor perturbations (gravitational waves) on a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker background under Carrollian boosts. We demonstrate that, analogous to the electromagnetic case, the full set of linearized Einstein's equations is not Carrollian-invariant. Instead, the theory bifurcates into two distinct and consistent frameworks: a Carrollian Electric Limit and a Carrollian Magnetic Limit. In the electric limit, dynamics are frozen, leaving a static theory of tidal forces ($E_{ab}$) constrained by the matter distribution. In contrast, the Magnetic Limit yields a consistent dynamical theory where the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor ($H_{ab}$), which governs gravito-magnetic and radiative effects, remains well-defined and is sourced by the spacetime shear. This framework resolves ambiguities in defining Carrollian gravity and provides a robust theory for gravito-magnetic dynamics in ultra-relativistic regimes. Our results have direct implications for the study of black hole horizons, gravitational memory, and the holographic principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive generalized geodesic equations in curved spacetime that include conservative forces, dissipative effects, and quantum-gravity-motivated minimal-length corrections. Conservative interactions are incorporated through external vector potentials, while dissipative dynamics arise from an exponential rescaling of the particle Lagrangian. Phenomenological study of Quantum-gravity effects is introduced via Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) deformed Poisson brackets in the Hamiltonian framework. We show that free-particle geodesics remain unaffected at leading order, but external potentials induce velocity-dependent corrections, implying possible violations of the equivalence principle. As an application, we analyze modified trajectories in Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes dominated by dust, radiation, stiff matter, and dark energy. Our results establish a unified approach to conservative, dissipative, and GUP-corrected geodesics, providing a framework to probe the interplay between external forces, spacetime curvature, and Planck-scale physics.</description>

      <title>Bound State Perturbations in the Interior of Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit our earlier work and investigate the bound state perturbations in the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole. The bound sates are defined as the perturbations in the interior of the black hole with an imaginary spectrum which are regular at the center of black hole while their time-dependent profile falls off exponentially on the event horizon. Using the scale factor in the expanding direction in the interior of the black hole as the clock, we rewrite the corresponding Regge-Wheeler equation and solve it semi-analytically as well as numerically. We confirm that the bound state solutions exist for scalar, vector and axial tensor perturbations. It is shown that for a given value of $\ell &gt;s$, there are total $\ell-s$ such bound states. We obtain the universal lower bound $2 G M \omega_I &gt;1$ for the spectrum of bound state which is asymptotically saturated in the large $\ell$ limit. Furthermore, we obtain an upper bound on the spectrum of axial perturbations which for large $\ell$ scales like $2 G M \omega_I \lesssim 0.04\, \ell^4 $. As observed recently, these bound states have the curious property that the profile of the total wave function has a non-zero magnitude near the future event horizon.</description>

Abstract: Under the coset formulation of pure Einstein spacetime, we solve the reduction problem of the nonlinear \(\sigma\)-model for this spacetime and present the process of the inverse scattering technique after simplification. Through the simplified inverse scattering process, taking the pure Rindler metric as the background, we introduce a pair of solitons on the imaginary axis and obtain an accelerating solution in the form of three solitons in this model. By means of appropriate parameter selection and coordinate transformation, we prove that this accelerating solution in the three-soliton formulation is equivalent to the accelerating Kerr solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-topological gravities (QTGs) are higher-curvature extensions of Einstein gravity in $D\geq 5$ spacetime dimensions. Throughout the years, different notions of QTGs constructed from analytic functions of polynomial curvature invariants have been introduced in the literature. In this paper, we show that all such definitions may be reduced to three distinct inequivalent notions: type I QTGs, for which the field equations evaluated on a single-function static and spherically symmetric ansatz are second order; type II QTGs, whose field equations on general static and spherically symmetric backgrounds are second order; and type III QTGs, for which the trace of the field equations on a general background is second order. We show that type II QTGs are a subset of type I QTGs and that type III QTGs are a subset of type II QTGs modulo pure Weyl invariants. Moreover, we prove that type II QTGs possess second-order equations on general spherical backgrounds. This allows us to prove that any theory satisfying a Birkhoff theorem is a type II QTG, and that the reverse implication also holds up to a zero-measure set of theories. For every theory satisfying Birkhoff's theorem, the most general spherically symmetric solution is a generalization of the Schwarzschild spacetime characterized by a single function which satisfies an algebraic equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information science has been broadly explored in Einstein gravity and in various modified gravity theories; however, its extension to quantum gravity settings remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, in this paper we investigate the degradation of quantum entanglement of scalar and Dirac fields in the third-type black hole geometry arising from effective quantum gravity, which incorporates generic quantum gravitational corrections beyond classical general relativity. This quantum corrected spacetime is free of a Cauchy horizon and can be cast into a Rindler form in the near-horizon regime, allowing a direct identification of vacuum modes and a clear correspondence with the framework developed for uniformly accelerated observers. Within this framework, we compute the quantum entanglement and mutual information of uniformly entangled detector pairs in terms of the quantum parameter $\tilde{\zeta}$, the mode frequency $\tilde{\omega}$, and Bob's radial position $R_0$. The quantum parameter $\tilde{\zeta}$ consistently weakens the horizon-induced loss of correlations. For scalar fields this effect is pronounced, producing clear departures from the classical behavior, whereas for Dirac fields the familiar correlation pattern remains intact but its degradation is noticeably reduced. Overall, $\tilde{\zeta}$ acts as a universal protective factor against gravitational suppression of quantum correlations. The third-type effective quantum black hole therefore provides a controlled and physically transparent arena for probing how quantum-gravity corrections influence relativistic quantum information.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Bound State Perturbations Inside Black Holes and Isospectrality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the bound state solutions for the polar perturbations in the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole. It is shown that for a given value of the spherical harmonic index $\ell$, there are a total of $\ell-1$ bound states for polar perturbations. We show both analytically and numerically that the spectrum of $\ell-2$ of these perturbations coincides exactly with the spectrum of axial perturbations. Consequently, the isospectrality between the bound states of axial and polar perturbations in the interior of the black hole is preserved. Furthermore, the additional mode found in the spectrum of polar perturbations is the algebraically special mode, which also furnishes the ground state of polar perturbations. It is shown that the spectrum of the highly excited states is equally spaced, which, in the semi-classical approximation, yields the black hole area quantization $\Delta A = 16 \pi l_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work, we developed a method for computing two-point correlators by decomposing the mode degrees of freedom into fast and slow components. Building on this framework, we present a numerical implementation to study the evolution of primordial scalar perturbations under controlled state deformations induced by the simplest environment corrections from the Lindblad equation. Our approach generalizes to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and does not rely on the slow-roll approximation. The computational routine is numerically efficient and allows users to configure arbitrary sequences of decoherence events, with full control over their duration, shape, amplitude and effective wavelength range. The resulting outputs are compatible with nonlinear numerical codes, enabling studies of how decoherence effects propagate during reheating.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the framework of Newer General Relativity, defined by all independent quadratic invariants of the non-metricity tensor, including the unique quadratic parity-violating term. We analyze linear perturbations around a flat FLRW background and find that the theory generically exhibits ghost instabilities and/ or propagates more degrees of freedom than in the Minkowski limit, signalling strong coupling. There are two notable exceptions: the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR) and the transverse-diffeomorphism-invariant gravity subclass, both of which are supplemented by the parity-violating operator. However, since the parity-violating term explicitly breaks (transverse) diffeomorphism invariance, we show, using both the Dirac-Bergmann procedure and the Cartan-Kuranishi algorithm, that the parity-violating extension of STEGR propagates eight degrees of freedom at the fully non-linear level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a wide range of quantum gravity theories, quasiclassical geometries, which are solutions to the Einstein field equations approximately, are described by "coherent states." Here we propose a Hamiltonian formalism for gravitational dynamics with respect to this coherent state basis, which generates time evolution of the spacetime with respect to a clock at infinity. Since the coherent states are not orthogonal, an initial quasiclassical geometry is dynamically driven into a superposition of different amplitudes. Our framework provides a dynamical mechanism for tunneling between geometries that is ubiquitous in a number of approaches to quantum gravity, from loop quantum gravity to the Euclidean path integral. We apply our framework to the problem of black hole evaporation, providing a hint at how unitarity may be preserved with the inclusion of quantum corrections to the semiclassical evolution of the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we performed Simpson-Visser (SV)-regularization scheme to Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes and then studied thermal properties of the resulting spacetime geometry. We considered the validity of the first law of black hole thermodynamics in this case and derived an entropy formula consistent with this new regular geometry. Next, we carried out the free energy analysis and studied the phase structure of these black holes. We discovered non-trivial phase transition properties dependent on the SV-regularization parameter. We also considered the validity of the second law of black hole thermodynamics and analyzed a merger scenario of two equal mass SV-regular black holes. In particular, we investigated the impact of the SV-regularization parameter on the constraints on post-merger black hole mass. Intrestingly, we found that the bounds initially increase and then fall sharply with increasing the SV-regularization parameter. All results are compared with standard black holes for vanishing SV-regularization parameter.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints of diffusive dark-fluid cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02913v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate late-time cosmology and the evolution of cosmic structures using an interacting dark fluid model in which dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) interact through a diffusive mechanism. To provide a comprehensive understanding, we derive the background evolution and perturbation equations within this model and obtain cosmological parameters through MCMC simulations. We use recent measurements for statistical analysis and constrain the parameters $H_0$ in km/s/Mpc, $\Omega_m$, $r_d$, $M$, $\sigma_8$, $S_8$, and the interaction term $Q_{dm}$. From the constrained values of $Q_{dm}$, we show that the diffusive model is a promising alternative DE model, capable of driving late-time cosmic acceleration due to energy exchange from DM to DE. State-finder diagnostics indicate that the model behaves like a Chaplygin gas when energy transfers from DM to DE during the Universe's expansion. We also investigate the growth of density contrast, finding $\delta_m(z)\gg\delta_{de}(z)$, which highlights the dominant role of DM in structure formation. Redshift space distortion and growth rate analysis show that minor deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at low redshifts, with larger differences at higher redshifts, indicate the impact of energy diffusion on early structure growth. Finally, we perform a detailed statistical analysis, including ${\mathcal{L}(\hat{\Theta}|data)}$, $\chi^2$, $\rm{AIC}$, and $\rm{BIC}$, which strongly supports the proposed diffusive dark-fluid model.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-timelike loops in signature changing semi-Riemannian manifolds with a transverse radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02403v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1983, Hartle and Hawking proposed the no-boundary proposal, suggesting that the universe has no beginning in the sense of a spacetime singularity or boundary. Nevertheless, there is an origin of time. Mathematically, this involves signature-type changing manifolds in which a Riemannian region smoothly transitions to a Lorentzian region across the hypersurface $\mathcal{H}$ where time begins.
  We develop a coherent framework for signature changing manifolds with a degenerate yet smooth metric. Established Lorentzian tools and results are then adapted to this setting, and new definitions are introduced that carry unforeseen causal implications. A noteworthy consequence is the presence of locally time-reversing loops through every point on the hypersurface. Imposing global hyperbolicity on the Lorentzian region, we prove that for every point $p \in M$ there exists a pseudo-timelike loop self-intersecting at $p$. Equivalently, $M$ always admits a closed pseudo-timelike path around which the time direction reverses, preventing any consistent distinction between future- and past-directed vectors. To an observer near $\mathcal{H}$, such loops may appear as the creation of a particle-antiparticle pair at two distinct points.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave background anisotropies from inflation with non-Bunch-Davies states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) have anisotropies generated by squeezed-type tensor non-Gaussianities originating from scalar-tensor-tensor (STT) and tensor-tensor-tensor cubic interactions. While the squeezed tensor non-Gaussianities in the standard slow-roll inflation with the Bunch-Davies vacuum state are suppressed due to the so-called consistency relation, those in extended models with the violation of the consistency relation can be enhanced. Among such extended models, we consider the inflation model with the non-Bunch-Davies state that is known to enhance the squeezed tensor non-Gaussianities. We explicitly formulate the primordial STT bispectrum induced during inflation in the context of Horndeski theory with the non-Bunch-Davies state and show that the induced SGWB anisotropies can be enhanced. We then discuss the detectability of those anisotropies in future gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the cohomological setting developed by Batalin, Fradkin and Vilkovisky (BFV), which produces a resolution of coisotropic reduction in terms of hamiltonian dg manifolds, to the case of nested coisotropic embeddings $C\hookrightarrow C_\circ \hookrightarrow F$ inside a symplectic manifold $F$. To this, we naturally assign $\underline{C}$ and $\underline{C_\circ}$, as well as the respective BFV dg manifolds. We show that the data of a nested coisotropic embedding defines a natural graded coisotropic embedding inside the BFV dg manifold assigned to $\underline{C}$, whose reduction can further be resolved using the BFV prescription. We call this construction \emph{double BFV resolution}, and we use it to prove that "resolution commutes with reduction" for a general class of nested coisotropic embeddings. We then deduce a quantisation of $\underline{C}$, from the (graded) geometric quantisation of the double BFV Hamiltonian dg manifold (when it exists), following the quantum BFV prescription. As an application, we provide a well defined candidate space of (physical) quantum states of three-dimensional Einstein--Hilbert theory, which is thought of as a partial reduction of the Palatini--Cartan model for gravity.</description>

Abstract: We present an explicit formulation of cosmological perturbation theory for three-field models with a flat field space. By performing rotations to align one field with the direction of curvature perturbations and applying the same rotations to the other two field directions, we introduce the semikinematic basis, which is applicable to models with more than two fields. We derive the governing equations in this basis. We also stress a characteristic property of more-than-two-field models: the freedom in choosing the isocurvature perturbations. This framework enables the computation of the curvature and two isocurvature power spectra for any given potential. We numerically solve the background and perturbation equations for three distinct scenarios. First, to validate the consistency of our three-field formalism, we examine an effective two-field model inspired by the two-block case of the multigiant vacua matrix inflation scenario. Next, we analyze a purely three-field system without direct interfield interactions. Finally, we study a three-field case that incorporates direct interactions. For all scenarios, we numerically compute the curvature perturbation power spectra and highlight the effects of rapid turns on the spectra. Finally, we investigate the relationship between these quantities and the observables in the early radiation-dominated era. Through both general arguments and a simple example, we show that three-field inflation can yield a much richer phenomenology. This is particularly true when we assume the initial perturbations in the radiation era include two isocurvature modes.</description>

Abstract: We study null hypersurfaces approaching null infinity in asymptotically flat spacetimes within the Bondi-Sachs gauge. The null Raychaudhuri constraint is shown to asymptote to the Bondi mass-loss formula, interpreted as a stress tensor conservation law. This stress tensor, the null Brown-York tensor, yields a Carrollian stress tensor at null infinity from the bulk. Furthermore, we establish that the canonical phase space on finite-distance null hypersurfaces asymptotes to the Ashtekar-Streubel phase space. This connection between finite-distance null physics and null infinity unveils promising insights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) may have formed in the early Universe due to the collapse of super-horizon curvature fluctuations. Simulations of PBH formation have been essential for inferring the initial conditions that lead to black hole formation and for studying their properties and impact on our Universe. The Misner-Sharp formalism is commonly used as a standard approach for these simulations. Recently, type-II fluctuations, characterized by a non-monotonic areal radius, have gained interest. In the standard Misner-Sharp approach for simulating PBH formation with these fluctuations, the evolution equations exhibit divergent terms ($0/0$), which complicate and prevent the simulations. We formulate a new approach to overcome this issue in a simple manner by using the trace of the extrinsic curvature as an auxiliary variable, allowing simulations of type-II fluctuations within the Misner-Sharp formalism. Using a set of standard exponential-shaped curvature profiles, we apply and test our new approach and numerical code based on pseudospectral methods to study the time evolution of the gravitational collapse, threshold values of type A/B PBHs and PBH mass. Interestingly, we identify cases of type-II fluctuations that do not necessarily result in PBH formation.</description>

      <title>A multi-messenger window into galactic magnetic fields and black hole mergers with LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale (i.e., $\gtrsim {\rm kpc}$) and micro-Gauss scale magnetic fields have been observed throughout the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. These fields depend on the geometry and matter-energy composition, can display complicated behavior such as direction reversals, and are intimately related to the evolution of the source galaxy. Simultaneously, gravitational-wave astronomy offers a new probe into astrophysical systems, for example the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe the mergers of massive (i.e., $M ~&gt; 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$) black-hole binaries and provide extraordinary constraints on the evolution of their galactic hosts. In this work, we show how galactic, large-scale magnetic fields and their electromagnetic signatures are connected with LISA gravitational-wave observations via their common dependence on the massive black-hole binary formation scenario of hierarchical galaxy mergers. Combining existing codes, we astrophysically evolve a population of massive binaries from formation to merger and find that they are detectable by LISA with signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 10^3$ which is correlated with quantities from the progenitors' phase of circumbinary disk migration such as the maximum magnetic field magnitude $|\mathbf{B}| \approx 7 \,\mu$G, polarized intensity, and Faraday rotation measure. Interesting correlations result between these observables arising from their dependencies on the black-hole binary total mass, suggesting a need for further analyses of the full parameter space. We conclude with a discussion on this new multi-messenger window into galactic magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: The dynamics of near-BPS black holes are governed by the breaking of the conformal symmetry that emerges near their horizons. Using the classification of superconformal symmetries, we systematically classify and quantize all effective theories that can arise in the near-BPS limit of black holes. Using these results, we argue, under certain physical assumptions, that BPS black holes cannot preserve more than four supercharges. This conclusion is consistent with existing constructions in string theory.</description>

      <title>Domain Wall as Cosmological Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the domain wall within the framework of a cosmological harmonic oscillator. We investigate the interaction between the domain wall and a periodic background field, which can induce perturbations in the oscillatory behavior of the wall. We propose a novel mechanism for resolving the domain wall problem through the phenomenon of resonant oscillation. Resonant oscillation occurs when the frequency of the external driving force aligns with the intrinsic frequency of the domain wall. This synchrony can significantly amplify the amplitude of the oscillation. If the amplitude of oscillation exceeds a predetermined critical deformation threshold, the domain wall may be deconstructed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this mechanism remains valid in models that preserve discrete symmetry.</description>

      <title>Gravitomagnetism from Temporal Dimensional Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00525v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the Taub-NUT metric can be envisaged as a (3+1) dimensional analog of the Kaluza-Klein (4+1) dimensional metric. After dimensional reduction of the Taub-NUT metric to (3) spatial dimensions, by treating time as the extra curled dimension (since the closed time-like curves can exist in the Taub-NUT framework, such a dimensional reduction is justified), we end up with three dimensional Einstein field equations plus the Maxwell equations for the gravitomagnetic field, which also acts as a source to Einstein field equations. Hence, the Taub-NUT metric unifies gravity and the NUT charge related gavitomagnetism in four dimensions, at the same footing the Kaluza-Klein metric unifies gravity and electromagnetism in five dimensions. We also introduce a relation between the 4-dimensional gravitational constant and the NUT charge.</description>

      <title>Einstein causality of quantum measurements in the Tomonaga-Schwinger picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14693v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a generalisation to L\"uders' rule \`a la Aharonov-Albert in those globally hyperbolic spacetimes which allow unitarily equivalent Hilbert spaces to be defined along Cauchy hypersurfaces, thus relying on the existence of an interaction picture \`a la Tomonaga-Schwinger. We show that under this rule and under the additional assumptions of the integrability and unitarity of the Tomonaga-Schwinger dynamics and the foliation-independence of rays on acausal Cauchy hypersurfaces, selective quantum measurements satisfy a state-independent anyonic commutation relation over spacelike-separated precompact regions. We highlight that this propagates to positive operator-valued measures, where the commutation is necessarily bosonic. In the instantaneous-measurement idealisation, this implies quantum no-signalling for non-selective measurements. We then examine Sorkin's impossible measurements and show that immediate contradictions can be averted as long as collapse-inducing measurements are irreversible. These results reaffirm the consistency of the Tomonaga-Schwinger picture of relativistic quantum theory, for which unitarity, integrability and foliation-independence of the states exclude superluminal signalling despite the ``instantaneity" of a side-cone measurement collapse rule. We finish by discussing the possibility of extending such results beyond the interaction picture.</description>

      <title>Cosmological abundance of primordial black holes in mixed dark matter scenarios incorporating Kaluza-Klein dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) dark matter particles and primordial black holes (PBHs) emerge as plausible candidates for dark matter. In scenarios where dark matter is a mix of KK particles and PBHs, PBHs can attract surrounding KK dark matter particles post-formation, leading to the creation of ultracompact dark matter halos (UCMHs). The distribution of KK dark matter particles within UCMHs tends to be steeper than in classical dark matter halo structures, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White model. Consequently, the annihilation rate of KK dark matter particles in UCMHs is significant. The high-energy photons resulting from the annihilation of KK particles in UCMHs contribute to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB). Leveraging data from the $\mathtt{Fermi\text{-}LAT}$ experiment, we have derived, for the first time, upper limits on the cosmological abundance of PBHs in the context of KK dark matter annihilation. For a KK dark matter mass range of $500\le m_{\rm B^{(1)}}\le 1500$ GeV, which aligns with the observed present abundance of dark matter, the conservative limits on the fraction of dark matter in PBHs, for massive PBHs with $M_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim 10^{-11}M_{\odot}$, are $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 2\times 10^{-5}$.</description>

Abstract: We show that superrotations can be described using the geometric conformal completion method of Penrose. In particular, superrotation charges can be described and calculated using the linkage method of Geroch and Winicour.
  Whether superrotation charges are calculated using the coordinate based Bondi formalism or the geometric Penrose formalism, the fact that the superrotation blows up at a point makes the superrotation charge formally ill defined. Nonetheless, we show that it can be made well defined through a regularization procedure devised by Flanagan and Nichols.</description>

      <title>Foliations by critical surfaces of the Hawking energy in asymptotically flat initial data sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Area-constrained critical surfaces for the Hawking quasi-local energy ("Hawking surfaces") provide a natural setting for that energy: they enjoy positivity and rigidity properties. We construct large-scale foliations at infinity by Hawking surfaces in asymptotically Schwarzschild initial data sets. Using a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction within a Willmore-foliation framework, we prove existence and uniqueness of the foliation and study its coordinate center. Under the dominant energy condition, we show that along the leaves of the foliation, the Hawking energy is positive and converges to the ADM energy in the large-sphere limit; moreover, subject to an explicit integral constraint, it is monotone along the foliation. Under weaker assumptions we construct an on-center family of Hawking surfaces that, while not necessarily a foliation, still enjoys positivity and the large-sphere limit. Finally, we obtain a rigidity statement and verify that our hypotheses hold in a broad class of data, initial data sets with harmonic or York asymptotics, thereby demonstrating the robustness of Hawking surfaces as a quasi-local energy tool in dynamical spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex states of quantum gravity in flat and AdS gravity can have features that are inaccessible to classical asymptotic observers. The missing information appears to such observers to be hidden behind a horizon or in a baby universe. Here we use the gravitational path integral to ask whether quantum observables can access the hidden data. We show that generic probes give a universal result and contain no information about the state. However, a probe appropriately fine-tuned to the state can give a large signal because of novel wormhole saddles in the path integral. Thus, in these settings, asymptotic observers cannot easily determine the state of the universe, but can check a proposal for it. Using these fine-tuned probes we show that an asymptotic observer can detect information hidden in a disconnected baby universe. Furthermore we show that the state of a two-boundary black hole can be detected using Lorentzian operators localised on just one of the boundaries.</description>

      <title>Where did Heavy Binaries Go? Gravitational-wave Populations Using Delaunay Triangulation with Optimized Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the joint mass-redshift evolution of the binary black-hole merger rate in the latest Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, GWTC-4.0. We present and apply a novel non-parametric framework for modeling multi-dimensional, correlated distributions based on Delaunay triangulation. Crucially, the complexity of the model -- namely, the number, positions, and weights of triangulation nodes -- is inferred directly from the data, resulting in a highly efficient approach that requires about one to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and significantly less calibration than current state-of-the-art methods. We find no evidence for a peak at $M_{\mathrm{tot}} \sim 70\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ at low redshifts ($z \sim 0.2$), where it would correspond to the $m_1 \sim 35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ feature reported in redshift-independent mass spectrum analyses, and we infer an increased merger rate at high redshifts ($z \sim 1$) around those masses, compatible with such a peak. When related to the time-delay distribution from progenitor formation to binary black-hole merger, our results suggest that sources contributing to the $m_1 \sim 35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ feature follow a steeper (shallower) time-delay distribution at high (low) redshifts. This hints at contributions from different formation channels -- for example dense environments and isolated binary evolution, respectively -- although firm identification of specific formation pathways will require further observations and analyses.</description>

      <title>Evidence for increasing dark energy in DESI from the Local Distance Ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. A comprehensive survey of Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) in the Large Scale Structure (LSS), in stratified data covering a finite redshift range is provided by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Extracting cosmological parameters in a joint analysis of LSS-CMB data is hereby inherently a nonlinear problem. Aims. In particular, this nonlinearity may concern the unknown equation of state of dark energy w(a), defined in the general w(a)CDM framework. Nevertheless, a common approach is the linearized approximation hereto notably w0waCDM, also applied by DESI. Here, we consider a potential source of a systematic uncertainty in this linearization due to non-commutativity between w0waCDM and a posteriori linearization of w(a)CDM, identified with an intrinsic symmetry in the latter, which is violated in the former. We shall refer to these as early and late linearization, respectively. Methods. Observational consequences of symmetry violation is inherent to early linearization regardless of choice of data, here elucidated in the analysis of the Hubble expansion in the Local Distance Ladder (LDL) using cosmic chronometer data. Results. Strikingly, opposite results are found for the evolution of dark energy by early versus late linearization, indicating a thawing or respectively, increasing dark energy. This is further confirmed by mock data experiments. Accordingly, it is unlikely that the DESI pipeline is immune to the same contradiction. Conclusions. Our results show rather than thawing, claimed by DESI, dark energy may in fact be increasing upon preserving the underlying symmetry. Further confirmation is expected from Euclid.</description>

      <title>Cosmic voids and the kinetic analysis. V. Hubble tension, the cosmological constant and aperiodic filaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the appearance and specific properties of the structures in the local Universe by means of the Vlasov kinetic technique. We consider the role of the cosmological constant in local structure formation via the theorem on the general function that satisfies the identity of the gravity of the sphere and of the point mass. Then, the Hubble tension is naturally explained as a result of two flows, a local and a global one, with non-coinciding Hubble parameters. The linearized Vlasov-Poisson equation with the cosmological term is shown to lead to van Kampen's waves, Landau damping, and then to aperiodic structures. Aperiodicity thereby emerges as a intrinsic feature of the filamentary and void structure of the local Universe, and reveals the self-consistent field mechanism of its formation. The damping of the aperiodicity is then predicted and can be observationally traced upon the increase in the scale of the filaments.</description>

      <title>Magnusian: Relating the Eikonal Phase, the On-Shell Action, and the Scattering Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two fundamentally distinct types of quantities are both called "eikonal" in present amplitudes literature. The unitarity of the S-matrix ensures it can be written as the exponential of a Hermitian operator. The eikonal generator or Magnusian, which is the classical limit of the expectation value of that operator, generates all scattering observables. The leading order classical behavior of the phase of an S-matrix element is called the classical eikonal phase, and it coincides with a classical on-shell action. We demonstrate that the eikonal generator (Magnusian) and the eikonal phase (classical on-shell action) are inequivalent and find the exact general relationship between them. That relationship explains the special case of integrable scattering in which the two do coincide up to a Legendre transformation and explains why such a correspondence fails in general when spin or radiation are included.</description>

      <title>The Geometric View of Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent critiques of the semantic conception of scientific theories suggest that a theory is not best formulated as a collection of models satisfying some set of kinematical or dynamical conditions. Thus it has been argued that additional structure on the set of models is required. Furthermore, there are calls for developing a 'theory of theories', where what was formerly a 'theory' is seen as a 'model' within a larger theoretical structure. This paper makes a two-pronged proposal for the ''shape'' that physical theories should take, based on recent insights on dualities and quasi-dualities in physics. First, I develop a geometric view of theories, according to which a physical theory is a set of models with topological and geometric structure on it. This general view is briefly illustrated in an example from quantum cosmology. Second, I make a more specific proposal for a natural structure that can encompass various 'theories' as its models, with topological and algebraic-geometric structure on them. I call the latter more specific structure a 'model bundle', where the models are in the fibres and there is a moduli space in the base. I illustrate my second proposal in an example from quantum field theory. This view highlights the important role of quasi-dualities as local transition functions between fibres; dualities are recovered as global transition functions when the bundle is trivial. I discuss some philosophical issues that this geometric view of physical theories opens up, such as its realist interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that the first law of holographic pseudo-entropy, which is a non-Hermitian generalization of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT), is equivalent to the perturbative Einstein equation in three-dimensional de Sitter (dS) space, assuming the dS/CFT correspondence. Our analysis reveals that the geodesic that accurately satisfies the first law of holographic pseudo-entropy consists of a timelike curve and a curve whose coordinates are complex. We also demonstrate that infinitesimal changes to the pseudo entropy satisfy a Klein-Gordon equation in two-dimensional de Sitter space. These imply the emergence of a time coordinate from a Euclidean CFT in dS/CFT.</description>

      <title>Full spectrum of Love numbers of Reissner-Nordstrom black hole in D-dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the full spectrum of tidal Love numbers for Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black holes in general spacetime dimensions. By perturbing the Einstein-Maxwell theory around the $D$-dimensional RN background, we derive an effective two dimensional quadratic action encompassing tensor, vector, and scalar-type perturbation sectors. Through diagonalization, we obtain master equations governing each sector and extract the corresponding Love numbers from the asymptotic behavior of the solutions. Our results confirm that all Love numbers vanish for four-dimensional RN black holes. In higher dimensions, the tensor and vector Love numbers reproduce previously known results. For the previously unknown scalar-type Love numbers, we show also they vanish for integer valued effective multipolar indices and display logarithmic running behavior when the corresponding indices are half integers.</description>

      <title>Analyticity of the Black Hole S-Matrix</title>

Abstract: We establish the analytic structure of the S-matrix in the complex-frequency plane for classical wave scattering on a Schwarzschild background in four space-time dimensions. Our argument relies on the analytic continuation of the gravitational potential, with the singularity behind the horizon playing a crucial role. We find that in the lower half-plane the partial-wave amplitudes are analytic except for the quasinormal-mode poles and the branch cut associated with late-time tails. As a direct consequence of causality, the retarded Green's function and absorption amplitude are analytic in the upper-half plane. We show, however, that Stokes phenomena can obstruct this analyticity domain from carrying over to the elastic amplitude, which instead develops a branch-cut in the upper-half plane. We also determine the effect of infrared (IR) regulators on the analytic structure, showing that polynomial boundedness requires a sharp lower bound on the IR cutoff in terms of the Schwarzschild radius.</description>

      <title>50-km fiber interferometer for testing gravitational signatures in quantum interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics and general relativity are the foundational pillars of modern physics, yet experimental tests that combine the two frameworks remain rare. Measuring optical phase shifts of massless photons in a gravitational potential provides a unique quantum platform to probe gravity beyond Newtonian descriptions, but laboratory-based interferometers have not yet reached the sensitivity needed to access this regime. Here, we report the realization of a 50-km table-top Mach-Zehnder fiber interferometer operating at the single-photon level, achieving a phase sensitivity of $4.42\times10^{-6}$ rad root-mean-square (RMS) within the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 5 Hz. We demonstrate that this sensitivity is sufficient to resolve a phase-shift signal of $(6.18 \pm 0.44)\times10^{-5}$ rad RMS at 0.1 Hz, associated with a modulated gravity-induced signal. Our results establish a milestone for quantum sensing with large-scale optical interferometry, demonstrating the capability to detect gravitational redshifts in a local laboratory, thereby paving the way for testing quantum phenomena within general relativistic frameworks.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb Z_2$-Stable Dark Matter via Broken $\text{SU}(5)$ Gauge Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I construct and analyze a dark matter sector that is neutral under the unbroken Standard Model gauge group and couples only to the broken $\text{SU}(5)$ gauge directions, the leptoquark vectors $X,Y$. An exact $\mathbb Z_2$ renders the dark matter stable. I give a gauge-covariant definition of projectors onto the unbroken Standard Model and broken ($X,Y$) subspaces, demonstrate that the covariant derivative of dark matter selects only $X,Y$, and integrate out $X,Y$ at tree level to obtain the leading effective operators. I also derive the loop-induced $\chi^2\,G^a_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu}$ coupling to gluons, prove color neutrality, and show consistency with cold dark matter phenomenology. Cosmological production proceeds via UV freeze-in or even more suppressed channels in.</description>
