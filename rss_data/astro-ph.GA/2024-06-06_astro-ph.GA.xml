      <title>The SMILES Mid-Infrared Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) for JWST is supplied with a suite of imaging bandpass filters optimized for full spectral coverage in eight intermediate-width bands from 5 to 26 microns and a narrower one at 11.3 microns. This contrasts with previous infrared space telescopes, which generally have provided only two broad bands, one near 10 microns and the other near 20 microns. The expanded MIRI spectral capability provides new possibilities for detailed interpretation of survey results. This is an important feature of the instrument, on top of its great increase in sensitivity and angular resolution over any previous mission. The Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES) was designed to take full advantage of this capability. This paper briefly describes the history of infrared surveys that paved the way for MIRI on JWST and for our approach to designng SMILES. It illustrates the use of the observations for a broad range of science programs, and concludes with a brief summary of the need for additional surveys with JWST/MIRI.</description>

      <title>Objects May Be Closer Than They Appear: Significant Host Galaxy Dispersion Measures of Fast Radio Bursts in Zoom-in Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the contribution of host galaxies to the overall Dispersion Measures (DMs) for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) using the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) cosmological zoom-in simulation suite. We calculate DMs from every star particle in the simulated L* galaxies by ray-tracing through their multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM), summing the line-of-sight free thermal electron column for all gas elements within $\pm$20 kpc of the galactic mid-plane. At $z=0$, we find average (median) host-galaxy DMs of 74 (43) and 210 (94) pc cm$^{-3}$ for older ($\gtrsim$10 Myr) and younger ($\lesssim$10 Myr) stellar populations, respectively. Inclination raises the median DM measured for older populations ($\gtrsim$10 Myr) in the simulations by a factor of $\sim$2, but generally does not affect the younger stars deeply embedded in H{\small II} regions except in extreme edge-on cases (inclination $\gtrsim 85^\circ$). In kinematically disturbed snapshots ($z = 1$ in FIRE), the average (median) host-galaxy DMs are higher: 80 (107) and 266 (795) pc cm$^{-3}$ for older ($\gtrsim$10 Myr) and younger ($\lesssim$10 Myr) stellar populations, respectively. FIRE galaxies tend to have higher DM values than cosmological simulations such as IllustrisTNG. As a result, FRB host galaxies may be closer (lower redshift) than previously inferred. Furthermore, constraining host-galaxy DM distributions may help significantly constrain FRB progenitor models.</description>

      <title>Any Way the Wind Blows: Quantifying Superbubbles and their Outflows in Simulated Galaxies across $z \approx 0-3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an investigation of clustered stellar feedback in the form of superbubbles identified within eleven galaxies from the FIRE-2 (Feedback in Realistic Environments) cosmological zoom-in simulation suite, at both cosmic noon (1 &lt; z &lt; 3) and in the local Universe. We study the spatially-resolved multiphase outflows that these supernovae drive, comparing our findings with recent theory and observations. These simulations consist of five LMC-mass galaxies and six Milky Way-mass progenitors (with a minimum baryonic particle mass of $m_{b.min} = 7100 M_{\odot}$), for which we calculate the local mass and energy loading factors on 750~pc scales from the identified outflows. We also characterize the multiphase morphology and properties of the identified superbubbles, including the `shell' of cool ($T&lt;10^5$ K) gas and break out of energetic hot ($T&gt;10^5$ K) gas when the shell bursts. For all galaxies, the outflow mass, momentum, and energy fluxes appear to reach their peak during the identified superbubbles, and we investigate the effects on the interstellar medium (ISM), circumgalactic medium (CGM), and subsequent star formation rates. We find that these simulations, regardless of redshift, have mass-loading factors and momentum fluxes in the cool gas that largely agree with recent observations. Lastly, we also investigate how methodological choices in measuring outflows can affect loading factors for galactic winds.</description>

      <title>Validation of the Bond et al. (2010) SDSS-derived kinematic models for the Milky Way's disk and halo stars with Gaia Data Release 3 proper motion and radial velocity data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We validate the Bond et al. (2010) kinematic models for the Milky Way's disk and halo stars with Gaia Data Release 3 data. Bond et al. constructed models for stellar velocity distributions using stellar radial velocities measured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and stellar proper motions derived from SDSS and the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey astrometric measurements. These models describe velocity distributions as functions of position in the Galaxy, with separate models for disk and halo stars that were labeled using SDSS photometric and spectroscopic metallicity measurements. We find that the Bond et al. model predictions are in good agreement with recent measurements of stellar radial velocities and proper motions by the Gaia survey. In particular, the model accurately predicts the skewed non-Gaussian distribution of rotational velocity for disk stars and its vertical gradient, as well as the dispersions for all three velocity components. Additionally, the spatial invariance of velocity ellipsoid for halo stars when expressed in spherical coordinates is also confirmed by Gaia data at galacto-centric radial distances of up to 15 kpc.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Massive Star-Forming Galaxies from JWST and ALMA: Dusty, High Redshift Disk Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the JWST NIRCam and MIRI morphological properties of 80 massive ($\log_{10}(M_\ast[M_{\odot}])$=11.2$\pm$0.1) dusty star-forming galaxies at $z$$=$2.7$^{+1.2}_{-0.7}$, identified as sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) by ALMA, that have been observed as part of the JWST PRIMER project. To compare the structure of these massive, active galaxies to more typical star-forming galaxies, we define a sample of 850 field galaxies with matched redshifts and specific star formation rates. We identify 20$\pm$5% of the SMGs as candidate late-stage major mergers, a further 40$\pm$10% as potential minor mergers and 40$\pm$10% which have comparatively undisturbed disk-like morphologies, with no obvious massive neighbours on $\lesssim$20-30kpc (projected) scales. These rates are comparable to those for the field sample and indicate that the majority of the sub-millimetre-detected galaxies are not late-stage major mergers, but have interaction rates similar to the less-active population at $z$$\sim$2-3. Through a multi-wavelength morphological analysis, we establish that SMGs have comparable near-infrared sizes to the less active population, but exhibit lower S\'ersic indices, consistent with bulge-less disks and have more structured morphologies at 2$\mu$m relative to 4$\mu$m. We find evidence for dust reddening as the origin of the morphological differences between the populations, identifying a strong correlation between the F200W$-$F444W pixel colour and the 870$\mu$m surface brightness. We conclude that SMGs and less active galaxies at the same epochs share a common disk-like structure, but the weaker bulge components of the SMGs results in a lower dynamical stability. Consequently, instabilities triggered either secularly or by minor external perturbations result in higher levels of activity (and dust content) in SMGs compared to typical star-forming galaxies.

      <title>Chemical Abundances of Early Quiescent Galaxies: New Observations and Modelling Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent stellar chemical abundance measurements of a handful of $z\sim2$ quiescent galaxies have suggested these galaxies exhibit a remarkably strong $\alpha$-enhancement compared to their local and intermediate redshift counterparts. This apparent chemical evolution following quenching suggests that even the innermost regions of massive early-type galaxies may have experienced substantial mixing of stars in mergers, challenging a purely inside-out growth model. However, larger samples are needed to determine whether a high $\alpha$-enhancement ([Mg/Fe] $\approx 0.5$) is common in $z \sim 2$ quiescent galaxies, and a comparative analysis is needed to determine whether it is consistently inferred using different stellar population synthesis models. We report age and stellar chemical abundance measurements for a sample of four gravitationally lensed quiescent galaxies at $z\sim2.1-2.65$ based on Magellan/FIRE spectroscopy. For three of these galaxies we constrain the $\alpha$-enhancement, and in two cases we measure high values comparable to earlier results when the spectra are analyzed consistently. We also find that the choice of modeling approach can exert a significant effect on the measured abundances. This model dependence can be partly, but not entirely, explained by the complex abundance patterns of $\alpha$ elements in galaxies, which has been observed at lower redshifts and in one $z \sim 2$ quiescent galaxy. Our investigation highlights the importance of independently varying abundance of $\alpha$ elements when fitting the spectra of such galaxies. Observations with JWST will soon deliver precise and spatially resolved abundances of these and other quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon, opening a new window into their evolution.</description>

      <title>The signatures of density fluctuations and mixing gas in circumgalactic absorption systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the prospects for detecting and constraining density and temperature inhomogeneities in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) using absorption measurements of metal ions. Distributions in the gas thermal properties could arise from turbulence, gas cooling from the hot phase, and mixing between the cool and hot phases. Focusing on these physically motivated models, we parameterize each with a single parameter for simplicity and provide empirical and theoretical estimates for reasonable parameter values. We then construct the probability distribution functions for each of these scenarios, calculate the effective ion fractions, and fit our models to the COS-Halos absorption measurements to infer the gas densities and metallicities. We find that the models we consider (i) produce similarly good fits to the observations with or without distributions in the gas thermal properties, and (ii) result in detectable changes in the column densities only at the boundaries of reasonable parameter values. We show that He II self-shielding can have a larger effect on the ion fractions than density and temperature fluctuations. As a result, uncertainties in cloud geometry and their spatial distribution, affecting the details of radiation transfer, may obscure the effect of inhomogeneities.</description>

      <title>Confirming the Explosive Dispersal Outflow in DR21 with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3 mm continuum and CO(2-1) line emission observations toward the high-mass star formation region DR21. Five new continuum sources are found. We identify eighteen outflow streamers detected in CO emission radially arising from a common origin. The velocity spread of the outflow streamers range between $-$100 to $+$70 km s$^{-1}$. The radial velocities of each outflow roughly follow linear gradients (Hubble-Lemaitre-like expansion motions). Using the CO emission of the whole ensemble of streamers we estimate a total outflow mass of 120-210M$_{\odot}$. Additionally, we derived the dynamical age (8600 yr), momentum ($\sim10^{3}$ M$_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$), and kinetic energy ($\sim10^{48}$ erg) of the outflow. The morphology and kinematics presented by the CO outflow streamers confirm the presence of an explosive dispersal outflow at the heart of DR21. Five dispersal explosive outflows associated with massive star-forming regions have been confirmed in our Galaxy (Orion BN/KL, G5.89-0.39, S106-IR, IRAS16076-5134 and IRAS 12326-6245). However, their frequency of occurrence in the Galaxy and the originating nature are still uncertain.</description>

      <title>Molecular Cloud Matching in $\mathrm{CO}$ and Dust in M33 I. High-Resolution Hydrogen Column Density Maps from {\sl \textbf{Herschel}}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study is aimed to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular hydrogen distribution in the galaxy M33 by introducing novel methods for generating high angular resolution (18.2$''$, equivalent to 75 pc) column density maps of molecular hydrogen ($N_{\rm H_2}$). M33 is a local group galaxy that has been observed with Herschel in the far-infrared wavelength range from 70 to 500 $\mum$. Previous studies have presented total hydrogen column density maps ($N_{\rm H}$), using these FIR data (partly combined with mid-IR maps), employing various methods. We first performed a spectral energy distribution fit to the 160, 250, 350, and 500 $\mum$ continuum data obtain $N_{\rm H}$, using a technique similar to one previously reported in the literature. We also use a second method which involves translating only the 250 $\mum$ map into a $N_{\rm H}$ map at the same angular resolution. An $N_{\rm H_2}$ map via each method is then obtained by subtracting the HI component. Distinguishing our study from previous ones, we adopt a more versatile approach by considering a variable emissivity index, $\beta$ and dust absorption coefficient, $\kappa_0$. This choice enables us to construct a $\kappa_0$ map, thereby enhancing the depth and accuracy of our investigation of the hydrogen column density. We address the inherent biases and challenges within both methods (which give similar results) and compare them with existing maps available in the literature. Moreover, we calculate a map of the carbon monoxide CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor (\Xco\ factor), which shows a strong dispersion around an average value of $1.8\times10^{20}\,\cmKkms$ throughout the disk. We obtain column density probability distribution functions (N-PDFs) from the $N_{\rm H}$, $N_{\rm H_2}$, and $N_{HI}$ maps and discuss their shape, consisting of several log-normal and power-law tail components.</description>

      <title>The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2: A Stacking Analysis Investigating the Evolution of Star Formation Rates and Stellar Masses in Groups and Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of galaxies depends on their masses and local environments; understanding when and how environmental quenching starts to operate remains a challenge. Furthermore, studies of the high-redshift regime have been limited to massive cluster members, owing to sensitivity limits or small fields of views when the sensitivity is sufficient, intrinsically biasing the picture of cluster evolution. In this work, we use stacking to investigate the average star formation history of more than 10,000 groups and clusters drawn from the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2 (MaDCoWS2). Our analysis covers near ultraviolet to far infrared wavelengths, for galaxy overdensities at $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 2.54$. We employ SED fitting to measure the specific star formation rates (sSFR) in four annular apertures with radii between 0 and 1000 kpc. At $z \gtrsim 1.6$, the average sSFR evolves similarly to the field in both the core and the cluster outskirts. Between $\overline{z} = 1.60$ and $\overline{z} = 1.35$, the sSFR in the core drops sharply, and continues to fall relative to the field sSFR at lower redshifts. We interpret this change as evidence that the impact of environmental quenching dramatically increases at $z \sim 1.5$, with the short time span of the transition suggesting that the environmental quenching mechanism dominant at this redshift operates on a rapid timescale. We find indications that the sSFR may decrease with increasing host halo mass, but lower-scatter mass tracers than the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) are needed to confirm this relationship.</description>

      <title>CLASSY X: Highlighting Differences Between Partial Covering and Semi-Analytic Modeling in the Estimate of Galactic Outflow Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback driven massive outflows play a crucial role in galaxy evolution by regulating star formation and influencing the dynamics of surrounding media. Extracting outflow properties from spectral lines is a notoriously difficult process for a number of reasons, including the possibility that a substantial fraction of the outflow is carried by dense gas in a very narrow range in velocity. This gas can hide in spectra with insufficient resolution. Empirically motivated analysis based on the Apparent Optical Depth method, commonly used in the literature, neglects the contribution of this gas, and may therefore underestimate the true gas column density. More complex semi-analytical line transfer (e.g., SALT) models, on the other hand, allow for the presence of this gas by modeling the radial density and velocity of the outflows as power laws. Here we compare the two approaches to quantify the uncertainties in the inferences of outflow properties based on 1-D "down-the-barrel" using the UV spectra of the CLASSY galaxy sample. We find that empirical modeling may significantly underestimate the column densities relative to SALT analysis, particularly in the optically thick regime. We use simulations to show that the main reason for this discrepancy is the presence of large amount of dense material at low velocities, which can be hidden by the finite spectral resolution of the data. The SALT models in turn could over-estimate the column densities if the assumed power laws of the density profiles strong are not a property of actual outflows.</description>

      <title>Shockingly Bright Warm Carbon Monoxide Molecular Features in the Supernova Remnant Cassiopeia A Revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST NIRCam (F356W and F444W filters) and MIRI (F770W) images and NIRSpec- IFU spectroscopy of the young supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A). We obtained the data as part of a JWST survey of Cas A. The NIRCam and MIRI images map the spatial distributions of synchrotron radiation, Ar-rich ejecta, and CO on both large and small scales, revealing remarkably complex structures. The CO emission is stronger at the outer layers than the Ar ejecta, which indicates the reformation of CO molecules behind the reverse shock. NIRSpec-IFU spectra (3 - 5.5 microns) were obtained toward two representative knots in the NE and S fields. Both regions are dominated by the bright fundamental rovibrational band of CO in the two R and P branches, with strong [Ar VI] and relatively weaker, variable strength ejecta lines of [Si IX], [Ca IV], [Ca V] and [Mg IV]. The NIRSpec-IFU data resolve individual ejecta knots and filaments spatially and in velocity space. The fundamental CO band in the JWST spectra reveals unique shapes of CO, showing a few tens of sinusoidal patterns of rovibrational lines with pseudo-continuum underneath, which is attributed to the high-velocity widths of CO lines. The CO also shows high J lines at different vibrational transitions. Our results with LTE modeling of CO emission indicate a temperature of 1080 K and provide unique insight into the correlations between dust, molecules, and highly ionized ejecta in supernovae, and have strong ramifications for modeling dust formation that is led by CO cooling in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>The magnetic field of the Radcliffe Wave: starlight polarization at nearest approach to the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the geometry of the magnetic field towards the Radcliffe Wave, a coherent 3-kpc-long part of the nearby Local Arm recently discovered via three-dimensional dust mapping. We use archival stellar polarization in the optical and new measurements in the near-infrared to trace the magnetic field as projected on the plane of the sky. Our new observations cover the portion of the structure that is closest to the Sun, between Galactic longitudes of 122$^\circ$ and 188$^\circ$. The polarization angles of stars immediately background to the Radcliffe Wave appear to be aligned with the structure as projected on the plane of the sky. The observed magnetic field configuration is inclined with respect to the Galactic disk at an angle of 18$^\circ$. This departure from a geometry parallel to the plane of the Galaxy is contrary to previous constraints from more distant stars and polarized dust emission. We confirm that the polarization angle of stars at larger distances shows a mean orientation parallel to the Galactic disk. We discuss implications of the observed morphology of the magnetic field for models of the large-scale Galactic magnetic field, as well as formation scenarios for the Radcliffe Wave itself.</description>

      <title>Morpho-Photometric Classification of KiDS DR5 Sources Based on Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Star-Quasar-Galaxy Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel multimodal neural network for classifying astronomical sources in multiband ground-based observations, from optical to near infrared, to separate sources in stars, galaxies and quasars. Our approach combines a convolutional neural network branch for learning morphological features from $r$-band images with an artificial neural network branch for extracting spectral energy distribution (SED) information. Specifically, we have used 9-band optical ($ugri$) and NIR ($ZYHJK_s$) data from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) Data Release 5. The two branches of the network are concatenated and feed into fully-connected layers for final classification. We train the network on a spectroscopically confirmed sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey cross-matched with KiDS. The trained model achieves 98.76\% overall accuracy on an independent testing dataset, with F1 scores exceeding 95\% for each class. Raising the output probability threshold, we obtain higher purity at the cost of a lower completeness. We have also validated the network using external catalogs cross-matched with KiDS, correctly classifying 99.74\% of a pure star sample selected from Gaia parallaxes and proper motions, and 99.74\% of an external galaxy sample from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey, adjusted for low-redshift contamination. We apply the trained network to 27,334,751 KiDS DR5 sources with $r \leqslant 23$ mag to generate a new classification catalog. This multimodal neural network successfully leverages both morphological and SED information to enable efficient and robust classification of stars, quasars, and galaxies in large photometric surveys.</description>

      <title>The Lyman Alpha Reference Sample XV. Relating Ionised Gas Kinematics with Lyman-$\alpha$ observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas kinematics affect the radiative transfer and escape of hydrogen Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emission from galaxies. We investigate this interplay empirically by relating the ionised gas kinematics of 42 galaxies in the extended Ly$\alpha$ Reference Sample with their Ly$\alpha$ escape fractions, $f_\rm{esc}$, Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths, $\rm{EW}_\rm{Ly\alpha}$, and Ly$\alpha$ luminosities, $L_\rm{Ly\alpha}$. To this aim we use PMAS integral-field spectroscopic observations of the Balmer-$\alpha$ line. We calculate shearing velocities, $v_\rm{shear}$, and intrinsic velocity dispersions, $\sigma_0^\rm{obs}$ (empirically corrected for beam-smearing effects), as global kinematical measures for each galaxy. The sample is characterised by highly turbulent motions and more than half of the sample shows dispersion dominated kinematics. We uncover clear trends between Ly$\alpha$ observables and global kinematical statistics. We discuss statistically the importance of $v_\rm{shear}$, $\sigma_0^\rm{obs}$, and $v_\rm{shear}/\sigma_0^\rm{obs}$ for regulating the Ly$\alpha$ observables in comparison to other galaxy parameters. It emerges that $\sigma_0^\rm{obs}$ is the dominating parameter for $\rm{EW}_\rm{Ly\alpha}$ and that is as important as nebular extinction, gas covering fraction, and ionising photon production efficiency in regulating $f_\rm{esc}$. A simple scenario where the starburst age is simultaneously regulating turbulence, $\rm{EW}_\rm{Ly\alpha}$, and $f_\rm{esc}$ does not find support by our observations. However, we show that the small scale distribution of dust appears to be influenced by turbulence in some galaxies. In support of our observational result we discuss how turbulence is theoretically expected to play a significant role in modulating $f_\rm{esc}$.

      <title>The SKA Galactic Centre Survey -- A White Paper</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With its extreme density of stars and stellar remnants, dense young massive clusters, high specific star formation rate, intense radiation field, high magnetic field strength, and properties of the interstellar medium that resemble those in high redshift galaxies and starbursts, the Galactic Centre is the most extreme environment that we can observe in detail. It is also the only nucleus of a galaxy that we can observe with a resolution of just a few milli parsecs. This makes it a crucial target to understand the physics of galactic nuclei and star formation, as well as the connection between them. It enables studies of a large number of otherwise rare objects, such as extremely massive stars and stellar remnants, at a well-defined distance, thus facilitating the interpretation of their properties. The Galactic Centre has been and is being studied intensively with the most advanced facilities. In this White Paper, we advocate for a large-area, multi-wavelength survey with the Square Kilometre Array of an area of about 1.25x0.3 deg**2 (180x40 pc**2), centered on the massive black hole Sagittarius A* and for repeated deep observations of the nuclear star cluster over a decade, which will allow the community to address multiple science problems with a single data set.</description>

      <title>Photometric Classification of Stars Around the Milky Way's Central Black Hole: I. Central Parsec</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of young massive stars in the Galactic Centre (GC) raises questions about star formation near the black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Additionally, the initial mass function (IMF) in this region appears different from the standard Salpeter/Kroupa law. Extreme extinction and crowding limit our understanding of the stellar population, with spectroscopic data available only for selected bright sources. We aim to improve knowledge about the distribution and IMF of young, massive stars near Sgr A*. Using intermediate band (IB) photometry, we identify candidates for massive young stars through Bayesian inference, a neural network, and a gradient-boosted trees algorithm. We obtained spectral energy distributions for 6590 stars, 1181 of which have been previously classified spectroscopically. We identify 351 stars classified as early types by all three methods, including 155 newly identified candidates. The radial density profiles for late and early-type stars fit broken power laws, with a break radius of 9.2 +- 0.6'' for early-type stars. Late-type stars show a core-like distribution around Sgr A*, while early-type stars' density increases steeply towards the black hole. We infer a top-heavy IMF of young stars near Sgr A* (R &lt; 9''), with a power-law of 1.6 +- 0.1. At greater distances, a standard Salpeter/Kroupa IMF fits the data. IB photometry also constrains the metallicities of late-type stars, estimating metallicities for over 600 stars. The IMF variation with radial distance suggests different star formation mechanisms, with a top-heavy IMF near Sgr A* consistent with disc star formation.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of jellyfish galaxy candidates in Fornax, Antlia, and Hydra from the S-PLUS survey: A self-supervised visual identification aid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study 51 jellyfish galaxy candidates in the Fornax, Antlia, and Hydra clusters. These candidates are identified using the JClass scheme based on the visual classification of wide-field, twelve-band optical images obtained from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey. A comprehensive astrophysical analysis of the jellyfish (JClass &gt; 0), non-jellyfish (JClass = 0), and independently organized control samples is undertaken. We develop a semi-automated pipeline using self-supervised learning and similarity search to detect jellyfish galaxies. The proposed framework is designed to assist visual classifiers by providing more reliable JClasses for galaxies. We find that jellyfish candidates exhibit a lower Gini coefficient, higher entropy, and a lower 2D S\'ersic index as the jellyfish features in these galaxies become more pronounced. Jellyfish candidates show elevated star formation rates (including contributions from the main body and tails) by $\sim$1.75 dex, suggesting a significant increase in the SFR caused by the ram-pressure stripping phenomenon. Galaxies in the Antlia and Fornax clusters preferentially fall towards the cluster's centre, whereas only a mild preference is observed for Hydra galaxies. Our self-supervised pipeline, applied in visually challenging cases, offers two main advantages: it reduces human visual biases and scales effectively for large datasets. This versatile framework promises substantial enhancements in morphology studies for future galaxy image surveys.</description>

      <title>Exploring magnetic fields in merging galaxy: combining polarization and velocity gradient in the Centaurus Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we apply the Velocity Gradient Technique (VGT) to the merging Centaurus galaxy. We compare gradient maps derived from the PHANGS-ALMA survey using CO emission lines with magnetic field tracings from dust polarization data obtained via the HAWC+ instrument. Our analysis reveals a strong correspondence between the directions indicated by these two tracers across most of the galactic image. Specifically, we identify jet regions as areas of anti-alignment, consistent with previous reports that gradients tend to rotate 90 degrees in outflow regions. Statistically, we find that the alignment of magnetic fields, as revealed by polarization, is most accurate in regions with the highest signal-to-noise ratios. Our findings underscore the utility of velocity gradients as a valuable complementary tool for probing magnetic fields and dynamical processes in merging galaxies.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Search for Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision astrometry offers a way to probe new physics. By measuring the angular position of light sources at unprecedented precision, astrometry could probe minuscule fluctuations of underlying spacetime. This work explores the possibility of probing ultralight dark matter candidates using precision astrometry. Through the coherent and stochastic density fluctuations over the scale of its wavelength, ultralight dark matter perturbs the propagation of light and the geodesics of the observer and source, leading to unique time-dependent signatures in the angular position of background light sources. With detector specifications similar to the current and future astrometry observations, such as Gaia and Roman Space Telescope, it is shown that the ultralight scalar dark matter of mass $10^{-18}\,{\rm eV} \, \textrm{--} \, 10^{-16} \,{\rm eV}$ could be probed when its density near the solar system is about a few thousand times larger than the nominal dark matter density measured on a much larger kpc-scale. This sensitivity is comparable to current pulsar timing array observations at a similar mass range. Explicit expressions for the angular deflection induced by most generic metric perturbations are derived and its gauge invariance is explicitly checked at the linear order.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray diffusion in magnetic fields amplified by nonlinear turbulent dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusion of cosmic rays (CRs) in turbulent magnetic fields is fundamental to understand various astrophysical processes. We explore the CR diffusion in the magnetic luctuations amplified by the nonlinear turbulent dynamo, in the absence of a strong mean magnetic field. Using test particle simulations, we identify three distinct CR diffusion regimes: mirroring, wandering, and magnetic moment scattering (MMS). With highly inhomogeneous distribution of the dynamo-amplified magnetic fields, we find that the diffusion of CRs is also spatially inhomogeneous. Our results reveal that lower-energy CRs preferentially undergo the mirror and wandering diffusion in the strong-field regions, and the MMS diffusion in the weak-field regions. The former two diffusion mechanisms play a more important role toward lower CR energies, resulting in a relatively weak energy dependence of the overall CR mean free path. In contrast, higher-energy CRs predominantly undergo the MMS diffusion, for which the incomplete particle gyration in strong fields has a more significant effect than the nonresonant scattering by small-scale field tangling/reversal. Compared with lower-energy CRs, they are more poorly confined in space, and their mean free paths have a stronger energy dependence. We stress the fundamental role of magnetic field inhomogeneity of nonlinear turbulent dynamo in causing the different diffusion behavior of CRs compared to that in sub-Alfv\'enic MHD turbulence.</description>

      <title>Repeating nuclear transients from repeating partial tidal disruption events: reproducing ASASSN-14ko and AT2020vdq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some electromagnetic outbursts from the nuclei of distant galaxies have been found to repeat on months-to-years timescales, and each of these sources can putatively arise from the accretion flares generated through the repeated tidal stripping of a star on a bound orbit about a supermassive black hole (SMBH), i.e., a repeating partial tidal disruption event (rpTDE). Here we test the rpTDE model through analytical estimates and hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between a range of stars, which differ from one another in mass and age, and an SMBH. We show that higher-mass ($\gtrsim 1 M_{\odot}$), evolved stars can survive many ($\gtrsim 10-100$) encounters with an SMBH while simultaneously losing $few \times 0.01 M_{\odot}$, resulting in accretion flares that are approximately evenly spaced in time with nearly the same amplitude, quantitatively reproducing ASASSN-14ko. We also show that the energy imparted to the star via tides can lead to a change in its orbital period that is comparable to the observed decay in the recurrence time of ASASSN-14ko's flares, $\dot{P}\simeq-0.0016$. Contrarily, lower-mass and less-evolved stars lose progressively more mass and produce brighter accretion flares on subsequent encounters for the same pericenter distances, leading to the rapid destruction of the star and cessation of flares. Such systems cannot reproduce ASASSN-14ko-like transients, but are promising candidates for recreating events such as AT2020vdq, which displayed a second and much brighter outburst compared to the first. Our results imply that the lightcurves of repeating transients are tightly coupled with stellar type.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the accretion disc spectra of Dwarf Novae and Novalike variables: implications for the standard disc model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion discs are fundamental to much of astronomy. They can occur around stars both young and old, around compact objects they provide a window into the extremes of physics, and around supermassive black holes in galaxy centres they generate spectacular luminosities that can outshine the entire galaxy. However, our understanding of the inner workings of accretion discs remains far from complete. Here we revisit a conundrum in the observations of some of the simplest accreting systems; the Cataclysmic Variables (CVs). The high-accretion-rate states of (non-magnetic) CVs can be divided into the short-lived outbursts ($\sim$ a week) typical of dwarf novae (DNe) and the long-lived (and sometimes perpetual) high states of nova-like (NL) CVs. Since both sorts of high-state occur in approximately steady-state accretion discs with similar properties and accretors, we would expect them to display similar spectral energy distributions. However, previous analyses based on UV spectra from the {\it International Ultraviolet Explorer} have shown that their spectral energy distributions are different. We perform a re-analysis of the data using up to date calibrations and distance (and thus dereddening) estimates to test whether this difference persists and whether it is statistically significant over the sample. We find that it does persist and it is statistically significant. We propose routes to investigating this discrepancy further and discuss the implications this has for other accreting systems, such as X-ray binaries, Active Galactic Nuclei and protoplanetary discs.</description>

      <title>UOCS. XIV. Uncovering extremely low mass white dwarfs and blue lurkers in NGC 752</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary pathways of binary systems are vastly different from single stellar evolution, and thus, there is a need to quantify their frequency and diversity. Open clusters are the best test-bed to unveil the secrets of binary populations due to their coeval nature. And the availability of multi-wavelength data in recent years has been critical in characterising the binary population. NGC 752 is a solar metallicity, intermediate-age open cluster located at 460 pc. In this work, we aim to identify the optically subluminous white dwarfs in NGC 752 and identify the illusive blue lurkers by association. We used multiwavelength photometry from Astrosat/UVIT, swift/UVOT, Gaia DR3 and other archival surveys to analyse the colour-magnitude diagrams and spectral energy distributions of 37 cluster members. We detected eight white dwarfs as companions to cluster members. Four of the systems are main sequence stars with extremely low mass white dwarfs as their companions. Two are these main sequence stars are also fast rotators. The presence of low mass white dwarfs and high rotation signals a past mass transfer, and we classified the four main sequence stars as blue lurkers. The binary fraction in NGC 752 was estimated to be 50--70%, and it shows that the contribution of optically undetected stars is crucial in quantifying the present-day binary fraction.</description>

      <title>An explanation for the absence of echoes in black hole light curve autocorrelations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed radiation from hot gas accreting onto a black hole depends on both the details of the flow and the spacetime geometry. The lensing behavior of a black hole produces a distinctive pattern of autocorrelations within its photon ring that encodes its mass, spin, and inclination. In particular, the time autocorrelation of the light curve is expected to display a series of peaks produced by light echoes of the source, with each peak delayed by the characteristic time lapse $\tau$ between light echoes. However, such peaks are absent from the light curves of observed black holes. Here, we develop an analytical model for such light curves that demonstrates how, even though light echoes always exist in the signal, they do not produce autocorrelation peaks if the characteristic correlation timescale $\lambda_0$ of the source is greater than $\tau$. We validate our model against simulated light curves of a stochastic accretion model ray traced with a general-relativistic code, and then fit the model to an observed light curve for Sgr A*. We infer that $\lambda_0&gt;\tau$, providing an explanation for the absence of light echoes in the time autocorrelations of Sgr A* light curves. Our results highlight the importance for black hole parameter inference of spatially resolving the photon ring via future space-based interferometry.</description>

Abstract: An important characteristic of cosmic hydrogen reionization is the growth of ionized gas bubbles surrounding early luminous objects. Ionized bubble sizes are beginning to be probed using Lyman-$\alpha$ emission from high-redshift galaxies, and will also be probed by upcoming 21-cm maps. We present results from a study of bubble sizes using the state-of-the-art THESAN radiation-hydrodynamics simulation suite, which self-consistently models radiation transport and realistic galaxy formation. We employ the mean-free path method, and track the evolution of the effective ionized bubble size at each point ($R_{\rm eff}$) throughout the Epoch of Reionization. We show there is a slow growth period for regions ionized early, but a rapid "flash ionization" process for regions ionized later as they immediately enter a large, pre-existing bubble. We also find that bright sources are preferentially in larger bubbles, and find consistency with recent observational constraints at $z \gtrsim 9$, but tension with idealized Lyman-$\alpha$ damping-wing models at $z \approx 7$. We find that high overdensity regions have larger characteristic bubble sizes, but the correlation decreases as reionization progresses, likely due to runaway formation of large percolated bubbles. Finally, we compare the redshift at which a region transitions from neutral to ionized ($z_{\rm reion}$) with the time it takes to reach a given bubble size and conclude that $z_{\rm reion}$ is a reasonable local probe of small-scale bubble size statistics ($R_\text{eff} \lesssim 1\,\rm{cMpc}$). However, for larger bubbles, the correspondence between $z_{\rm reion}$ and size statistics weakens due to the time delay between the onset of reionization and the expansion of large bubbles, particularly at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Central-surface-densities correlation in general MOND theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the foundational axioms of MOND alone predict a strong correlation between a bulk measure of the baryonic surface density, $\Sigma_B$, and the corresponding dynamical one, $\Sigma_D$, of an isolated object, such as a galaxy. The correlation is encapsulated by its high- and low-$\Sigma_B$ behaviors. For $\Sigma_B\gg\Sigma_M\equiv a_0/2\pi G$ ($\Sigma_M$ is the critical MOND surface density) one has $\Sigma_D\approx\Sigma_B$. Their difference -- which would be interpreted as the contribution of dark matter -- is $\Sigma_P=\Sigma_D-\Sigma_B\sim\Sigma_M\ll\Sigma_B$. In the deep-MOND limit, $\Sigma_B\ll\Sigma_M$, one has $\Sigma_D\sim (\Sigma_M\Sigma_B)^{1/2}$. This is a primary prediction of MOND, shared by all theories that embody its basic tenets. Sharper correlations, even strict algebraic relations, $\Sigma_D(\Sigma_B)$, are predicted in specific MOND theories, for specific classes of mass distribution -- e.g., pure discs, or spherical systems -- and for specific definitions of the surface densities. I proceed to discuss such tighter correlations for the central surface densities of axisymmetric galactic systems, $\Sigma^0_B$ and $\Sigma^0_D$. Past work has demonstrated such relations for pure discs in the AQUAL and QUMOND theories. Here I consider them in broader classes of MOND theories. For most observed systems, $\Sigma^0_D$ can not be determined directly at present, but, in many cases, a good proxy for it is the acceleration integral $\mathcal{G}\equiv\int_0^\infty g_r d\ln~r$, where $g_r$ is the radial acceleration along a reflection-symmetry plane of a system, such as a disc galaxy. $\mathcal{G}$ can be determined directly from the rotation curve. I discuss the extent to which $\mathcal{G}$ is a good proxy for $\Sigma^0_D$, and how the relation between them depends on system geometry, from pure discs, through disc-plus-bulge ones, to quasi-spherical systems.</description>

      <title>MHONGOOSE -- A MeerKAT Nearby Galaxy HI Survey</title>

Abstract: The MHONGOOSE (MeerKAT HI Observations of Nearby Galactic Objects: Observing Southern Emitters) survey maps the distribution and kinematics of the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) gas in and around 30 nearby star-forming spiral and dwarf galaxies to extremely low HI column densities. The HI column density sensitivity (3 sigma over 16 km/s) ranges from ~ 5 x 10^{17} cm^{-2} at 90'' resolution to ~4 x 10^{19} cm^{-2} at the highest resolution of 7''. The HI mass sensitivity (3 sigma over 50 km/s) is ~5.5 X 10^5 M_sun at a distance of 10 Mpc (the median distance of the sample galaxies). The velocity resolution of the data is 1.4 km/s. One of the main science goals of the survey is the detection of cold, accreting gas in the outskirts of the sample galaxies. The sample was selected to cover a range in HI masses, from 10^7 M_sun to almost 10^{11} M_sun, to optimally sample possible accretion scenarios and environments. The distance to the sample galaxies ranges from 3 to 23 Mpc. In this paper, we present the sample selection, survey design, and observation and reduction procedures. We compare the integrated HI fluxes based on the MeerKAT data with those derived from single-dish measurement and find good agreement, indicating that our MeerKAT observations are recovering all flux. We present HI moment maps of the entire sample based on the first ten percent of the survey data, and find that a comparison of the zeroth- and second-moment values shows a clear separation between the physical properties of the HI in areas with star formation and areas without, related to the formation of a cold neutral medium. Finally, we give an overview of the HI-detected companion and satellite galaxies in the 30 fields, five of which have not previously been catalogued. We find a clear relation between the number of companion galaxies and the mass of the main target galaxy.</description>

      <title>Towards unveiling the Cosmic Reionization: the ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_{ion}$) of Low-mass H$\alpha$ emitters at $z \sim 2.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the galaxy properties of $\sim$400 low-mass ($&lt;10^9\,M_{\odot}$) H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) at z $\sim$ 2.3 in the ZFOURGE survey. The selection of these HAEs is based on the excess in the observed $K_s$ broad-band flux compared to the stellar continuum estimated from the best-fit SED. These low-mass HAEs have elevated SFR(H$\alpha$) above the star formation main sequence (SFMS), making them potential analogs of the galaxies that reionized the universe during the epoch of reionization. The ionizing photon production efficiencies ($\xi_{ion}$) of the low-mass HAEs have a median value of $\mathrm{log}(\xi_{ion}/erg^{-1} Hz)=25.24^{+0.10}_{-0.13}\ (25.35^{+0.12}_{-0.15})$, assuming the Calzetti (SMC) curve for the stellar continuum dust correction. This value is higher than that of main sequence galaxies by $\sim$0.2 dex at similar redshift, indicating that the low-mass HAEs are more efficient in producing ionizing photons. Our results also consolidate the trend of increasing $\xi_{ion}$ with redshift, but reveal a "downsizing" relationship between $\xi_{ion}$ and stellar mass ($M_{\odot}$) with increasing redshift. We further explore the dependence of $\xi_{ion}$ on other galaxy properties, such as the UV spectral slope ($\beta_{\mathrm{UV}}$), the UV magnitude ($M_{\mathrm{UV}}$), the equivalent widths ($EWs$) of H$\alpha$ and [O{\sc iii}] emission lines. Galaxies with the bluer UV slopes, fainter UV luminosities and higher equivalent widths exhibit elevated $\xi_{ion}$ by a factor of $\sim$2 compared to the median $\xi_{ion}$ of our sample. JWST data will provide an opportunity to extend our method and further investigate the properties of low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Metallicity Dependence of Pressure-Regulated Feedback-Modulated Star Formation in the TIGRESS-NCR Simulation Suite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new simulation suite for the star-forming interstellar medium (ISM) in galactic disks using the TIGRESS-NCR framework. Distinctive aspects of our simulation suite are: (1) sophisticated and comprehensive numerical treatments of essential physical processes including magnetohydrodynamics, self-gravity, and galactic differential rotation, as well as photochemistry, cooling, and heating coupled with ray-tracing UV radiation transfer and resolved supernova feedback and (2) wide parameter coverage including metallicity over $Z'\equiv Z/Z_\odot\sim0.1-3$, gas surface density $\Sigma_{\rm gas}\sim5-150 M_{\odot}{\rm pc^{-2}}$, and stellar surface density $\Sigma_{\rm star}\sim 1-50 M_{\odot}{\rm pc^{-2}}$. The range of emergent star formation rate surface density is $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}\sim 10^{-4}-0.5 M_{\odot}{\rm kpc^{-2}yr^{-1}}$ and ISM total midplane pressure is $P_{\rm tot}/k_B=10^3-10^6{\rm cm^{-3}K}$, with $P_{\rm tot}$ equal to the ISM weight $W$. For given $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm star}$, we find $\Sigma_{\rm SFR} \propto Z'^{0.3}$. We provide an interpretation based on the pressure-regulated feedback-modulated (PRFM) star formation theory. We characterize feedback modulation in terms of the yield $\Upsilon$, defined as the ratio of each stress to $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$. The thermal feedback yield varies sensitively with both weight and metallicity as $\Upsilon_{\rm th}\propto W^{-0.46}Z'^{-0.53}$, while the combined turbulent and magnetic feedback yield shows weaker dependence $\Upsilon_{\rm turb+mag}\propto W^{-0.22}Z'^{-0.18}$. The reduction in $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ at low metallicity is due mainly to enhanced thermal feedback yield, resulting from reduced attenuation of UV radiation. With the metallicity-dependent calibrations we provide, PRFM theory can be used for a new subgrid star formation prescription in cosmological simulations where the ISM is unresolved.</description>

      <title>Extended emission line regions in post-starburst galaxies hosting tidal disruption events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an extended emission line region (EELR) in MUSE observations of Markarian 950, a nearby ($z=0.01628$) post-starburst (PSB) galaxy that hosted the tidal disruption event (TDE) iPTF-16fnl. The EELR requires a non-stellar ionizing continuum with a luminosity L$_{\rm ion, min} \gtrsim 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, inconsistent with the current weak state (L$_{\rm IR,AGN} &lt; 2.5 \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$) of the galactic nucleus. The ionized gas has low velocity ($\sim$-50 km s$^{-1}$) and low turbulence ($\sigma_{\rm gas} \lesssim$ 50 km s$^{-1}$), and is kinematically decoupled from the stellar motions, indicating that the gas kinematics are not AGN driven. Markarian 950 is the third post-starburst galaxy to host a weak nuclear ionizing source as well as an EELR and a TDE. The overall properties of these three galaxies, including the kinematics and accretion history, are unusual but strikingly similar. We estimate that the incidence of EELRs in PSB-TDE hosts is a factor of $\sim 10 \times$ higher than in other PSB galaxies. This suggests that a gas-rich post-merger environment is a key ingredient in driving elevated TDE rates. Based on the current observations, we cannot rule out that the EELRs may be powered through an elevated TDE rate in these galaxies. If the EELRs are not TDE-powered, the presence of intermittent AGN activity, and in particular the fading of the AGN, may be associated with an increased TDE rate and/or an increased rate of detecting TDEs.</description>

      <title>HYMALAIA: A Hybrid Lagrangian Model for Intrinsic Alignments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic alignment of galaxies is an important ingredient for modelling weak-lensing measurements, and a potentially valuable cosmological and astrophysical signal. In this paper, we present HYMALAIA: a new model to predict the intrinsic alignments of biased tracers. HYMALAIA is based on a perturbative expansion of the statistics of the Lagrangian shapes of objects, which is then advected to Eulerian space using the fully non-linear displacement field obtained from $N$-body simulations. We demonstrate that HYMALAIA is capable of consistently describing monopole and quadrupole of halo shape-shape and matter-shape correlators, and that, without increasing the number of free parameters, it does so more accurately than other perturbatively inspired models such as the non-linear alignment (NLA) model and the tidal-alignment-tidal-torquing (TATT) model.</description>

      <title>Detecting the tidal heating with the generic extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15532v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The horizon of a classical black hole (BH), functioning as a one-way membrane, plays a vital role in the dynamic evolution of binary BHs, capable of absorbing fluxes entirely. Tidal heating, stemming from this phenomenon, exerts a notable influence on the production of gravitational waves(GWs). If at least one member of a binary is an exotic compact object (ECO) instead of a BH, the absorption of fluxes is expected to be incomplete and the tidal heating would be different. Thus, tidal heating can be utilized for model-independent investigations into the nature of compact object. In this paper, assuming that the extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) contains a stellar-mass compact object orbiting around a massive ECO with a reflective surface, we compute the GWs from the generic EMRI orbits. Using the accurate and analytic flux formulas in the black hole spacetime, we adapted these formulas in the vicinity of the ECO surface by incorporating a reflectivity parameter. Under the adiabatic approximation, we can evolve the orbital parameters and compute the EMRI waveforms. The effect of tidal heating for the spinning and non-spinning objects can be used to constrain the reflectivity of the surface at the level of 10^-4 by computing the mismatch and fisher information matrix.</description>

      <title>cosmICweb: Cosmological Initial Conditions for Zoom-in Simulations in the Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the online service cosmICweb (COSMological Initial Conditions on the WEB) - the first database and web interface to store, analyze, and disseminate initial conditions for zoom simulations of objects forming in cosmological simulations: from galaxy clusters to galaxies and more. Specifically, we store compressed information about the Lagrangian proto-halo patches for all objects in a typical simulation merger tree along with properties of the halo/galaxy across cosmic time. This enables a convenient web-based selection of the desired zoom region for an object fitting user-specified selection criteria. The information about the region can then be used with the MUSIC code to generate the zoom ICs for the simulation. In addition to some other simulations, we currently support all objects in the EAGLE simulation database, so that for example the Auriga simulations are easily reproduced, which we demonstrate explicitly. The framework is extensible to include other simulations through an API that can be added to an existing database structure and with which cosmICweb can then be interfaced. We make the web portal and database publicly available to the community.</description>

      <title>Photometric segregation of dwarf and giant FGK stars using the SVO Filter Profile Service and photometric tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is focused on the segregation of FGK dwarf and giant stars through narrow-band photometric data using the Spanish Virtual Observatory (SVO) Filter Profile Service and associated photometric tools. We selected spectra from the MILES, STELIB, and ELODIE stellar libraries, and used SVO photometric tools to derive the synthetic photometry in 15 J-PAS narrow filters, which were especially selected to cover spectral features sensitive to gravity changes. Using machine-learning techniques as the Gaussian mixture model and the support vector machine, we defined several criteria based on J-PAS colours to discriminate between dwarf and giant stars. We selected five colour-colour diagrams that presented the most promising separation between both samples. Our results show an overall accuracy in the studied sample of $\sim$0.97 for FGK stars, although a dependence on the luminosity type and the stellar effective temperature was found. We also defined a colour-temperature relation for dwarf stars with effective temperatures between 4\,000 and 7\,000\,K, which allows one to estimate the stellar effective temperature from four J-PAS filters ($J0450$, $J0510$, $J0550$, and $J0620$). Additionally, we extended the study to M-type giant and dwarf stars, achieving a similar accuracy to that for FGK stars.</description>
