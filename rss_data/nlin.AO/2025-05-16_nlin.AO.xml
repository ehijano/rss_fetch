      <title>Extreme Synchronization Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across natural and human-made systems, transition points mark sudden changes of order and are thus key to understanding overarching system features. Motivated by recent experimental observations, we here uncover an intriguing class of transitions in coupled oscillators, extreme synchronization transitions, from asynchronous disordered states to synchronous states with almost completely ordered phases. Whereas such a transition appears like discontinuous or explosive phase transitions, it exhibits markedly distinct features. First, the transition occurs already in finite systems of $N$ units and so constitutes an intriguing bifurcation of multi-dimensional systems rather than a genuine phase transition that emerges in the thermodynamic limit $N\rightarrow \infty$ only. Second, the synchronization order parameter jumps from moderate values of the order of $N^{-1/2}$ to values extremely close to $1$, its theoretical maximum, immediately upon crossing a critical coupling strength. We analytically explain the mechanisms underlying such extreme transitions in coupled complexified Kuramoto oscillators. Extreme transitions may similarly occur across other systems of coupled oscillators as well as in certain percolation processes. In applications, their occurrence impacts our ability of ensuring or preventing strong forms of ordering, for instance in biological and engineered systems.</description>

      <title>Waveform proportionality and Taylor's law in coupled Lorenz systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taylor's law (TL) describes a power-law relationship between the mean and variance of a quantity, a phenomenon observed across diverse scientific disciplines. Despite its ubiquity, the underlying mechanisms responsible for TL are not yet fully elucidated. In particular, the frequent empirical observation of TL with an exponent 2 warrants further investigation. In a previous study [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 167202 (2025)], we hypothesized that synchronization contributes to the emergence of TL with an exponent 2. We validated this hypothesis using coupled oscillator models derived from a food chain model, the R\"ossler system, the Brusselator, and the Lorenz system. Our analytical and numerical results demonstrated that strong coupling leads to a form of synchronization wherein time series become proportional to each other, consequently resulting in TL with an exponent 2. Here, we extend our previous findings for the coupled Lorenz system and provide detailed calculations.</description>

      <title>Inferring entropy production in many-body systems using nonequilibrium MaxEnt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables (such as spatiotemporal correlation functions). It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. It may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different kinds of interactions, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a thermodynamic uncertainty relation. We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.</description>

      <title>Networked Infectiousness: Cascades, Power Laws, and Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networked SIR models have become essential workhorses in the modeling of epidemics, their inception, propagation and control. Here, and building on this venerable tradition, we report on the emergence of a remarkable self-organization of infectiousness in the wake of a propagating disease front. It manifests as a cascading power-law distribution of disease strength in networked SIR simulations, and is then confirmed with suitably defined kinetics, then stochastic modeling of surveillance data. Given the success of the networked SIR models which brought it to light, we expect this scale-invariant feature to be of universal significance, characterizing the evolution of disease within and across transportation networks, informing the design of control strategies, and providing a litmus test for the soundness of disease propagation models.</description>

      <title>Exploring localization in nonlinear oscillator systems through network-based predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Localized vibrations, arising from nonlinearities or symmetry breaking, pose a challenge in engineering, as the resulting high-amplitude vibrations may result in component failure due to fatigue. During operation, the emergence of localization is difficult to predict, partly because of changing parameters over the life cycle of a system. This work proposes a novel, network-based approach to detect an imminent localized vibration. Synthetic measurement data is used to generate a functional network, which captures the dynamic interplay of the machine parts, complementary to their geometric coupling. Analysis of these functional networks reveals an impending localized vibration and its location. The method is demonstrated using a model system for a bladed disk, a ring composed of coupled nonlinear Duffing oscillators. Results indicate that the proposed method is robust against small parameter uncertainties, added measurement noise, and the length of the measurement data samples. The source code for this work is available.</description>

      <title>Information bounds production in replicator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate minimal replicator systems that are able to use information in a functional manner. We consider a population of autocatalytic replicators in a flow reactor that are subject to fluctuating environments. We derive expressions of replicator production in terms of information-theoretic quantities, reflecting separate contributions from environmental uncertainty, side information, and distribution mismatch. We also derive the optimal strategy for preparing replicator concentrations, as well as a universal information-theoretic bound on the increase of productivity. We compare and contrast our findings with existing results, including 'Kelly gambling' in information theory and 'substitutional load' in evolutionary biology. The results are illustrated on a model of real-world self-assembled molecular replicators. In this real-world system, we demonstrate the benefit of internal memory when subjected to environments with temporal correlations, and we propose a plausible experimental setup for detecting the signature of functional information. We briefly discuss the role that information-processing may play in guiding the evolution of prebiotic replicator networks.</description>
