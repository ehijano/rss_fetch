      <title>Gamma Ray Detection Efficiency of GAGG Crystal Scintillator Using Three Tagged Gamma Ray Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A CubeSat with a prototype scintillating detector with a sensitive volume of GAGG crystal is being developed with a possible launch date of 2025. Its purpose is to characterize the background signals that mimic the neutrino interaction that the nuSOL team is looking for. An important part of the characterization of the backgrounds and the expected real signal is understanding the gamma ray detection efficiency of the prototype detector. To this end we have used and developed three techniques to do an absolute measurement of gamma ray efficiency. The first is using EC sources that emit an X-ray before prompt emission of a de-excitation gamma ray, specifically Zn-65 and Mn-54. The second is using a beta + decay source wherein a positron annihilates on an atomic shell electron producing two back-to-back 511 keV gammas followed promptly by a de-excitation gamma, specifically Na-22. The third is using a gamma cascade of two near-simultaneous de-excitation gammas from the same nucleus, specifically from Co-60 decay.</description>

      <title>Development of a method to measure trace level of uranium and thorium in scintillation films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have established a method to measure picograms-per-gram (pg g$^{-1}$) levels of $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th in scintillation films by combining the dry ashing method and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Trace amounts of $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th were measured in up to 2~g of the scintillation film with almost 100% collection efficiency. This paper details the experimental procedure, including the pretreatment of the samples and labware, detection limit of the method, collection efficiencies of $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th, and measurement of $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th in a polyethylene naphthalate film. This method is also applicable to $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th measurements in other low-background organic materials for rare event search experiments.</description>

      <title>Beam-induced backgrounds measured in the ATLAS detector during local gas injection into the LHC beam vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inelastic beam-gas collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), within a few hundred metres of the ATLAS experiment, are known to give the dominant contribution to beam backgrounds. These are monitored by ATLAS with a dedicated Beam Conditions Monitor (BCM) and with the rate of fake jets in the calorimeters. These two methods are complementary since the BCM probes backgrounds just around the beam pipe while fake jets are observed at radii of up to several metres. In order to quantify the correlation between the residual gas density in the LHC beam vacuum and the experimental backgrounds recorded by ATLAS, several dedicated tests were performed during LHC Run 2. Local pressure bumps, with a gas density several orders of magnitude higher than during normal operation, were introduced at different locations. The changes of beam-related backgrounds, seen in ATLAS, are correlated with the local pressure variation. In addition the rates of beam-gas events are estimated from the pressure measurements and pressure bump profiles obtained from calculations. Using these rates, the efficiency of the ATLAS beam background monitors to detect beam-gas events is derived as a function of distance from the interaction point. These efficiencies and characteristic distributions of fake jets from the beam backgrounds are found to be in good agreement with results of beam-gas simulations performed with the FLUKA Monte Carlo programme.</description>

      <title>First Measurement of Correlated Charge Noise in Superconducting Qubits at an Underground Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure space- and time-correlated charge jumps on a four-qubit device, operating 107 meters below the Earth's surface in a low-radiation, cryogenic facility designed for the characterization of low-threshold particle detectors. The rock overburden of this facility reduces the cosmic ray muon flux by over 99% compared to laboratories at sea level. Combined with 4$\pi$ coverage of a movable lead shield, this facility enables quantifiable control over the flux of ionizing radiation on the qubit device. Long-time-series charge tomography measurements on these weakly charge-sensitive qubits capture discontinuous jumps in the induced charge on the qubit islands, corresponding to the interaction of ionizing radiation with the qubit substrate. The rate of these charge jumps scales with the flux of ionizing radiation on the qubit package, as characterized by a series of independent measurements on another energy-resolving detector operating simultaneously in the same cryostat with the qubits. Using lead shielding, we achieve a minimum charge jump rate of 0.19$^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ mHz, almost an order of magnitude lower than that measured in surface tests, but a factor of roughly eight higher than expected based on reduction of ambient gammas alone. We operate four qubits for over 22 consecutive hours with zero correlated charge jumps at length scales above three millimeters.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature photonic quantum computing in integrated silicon photonics with germanium-silicon single-photon avalanche diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most, if not all, photonic quantum computing (PQC) relies upon superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) based on Nb operated at a temperature &lt; 4 K. This paper proposes and analyzes 300 K Si-waveguide-integrated GeSi single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) based on the recently demonstrated normal-incidence GeSi SPADs operated at room temperature, and shows that their performance is competitive against that of SNSPDs in a series of metrics for PQC with a reasonable time-gating window to resolve the issue of dark-count rate (DCR). These GeSi SPADs become photon-number-resolving avalanche diodes (PNRADs) by deploying a spatially multiplexed M-fold-waveguide array of M SPADs. Using on-chip waveguided spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) sources and waveguided field-programmable interferometer mesh (FPIM) circuits, together with the high-metric SPADs and PNRADs, high-performance quantum computing at room temperature is predicted for this PQC architecture.</description>

      <title>A Method of Measuring TES Complex ETF Response in Frequency-domain Multiplexed Readout by Single Sideband Power Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The digital frequency domain multiplexing (DfMux) technique is widely used for astrophysical instruments with large detector arrays. Detailed detector characterization is required for instrument calibration and systematics control. We conduct the TES complex electrothermal-feedback (ETF) response measurement with the DfMux readout system as follows. By injecting a single sideband signal, we induce modulation in TES power dissipation over a frequency range encompassing the detector response. The modulated current signal induced by TES heating effect is measured, allowing for the ETF response characterization of the detector. With the injection of an upper sideband, the TES readout current shows both an upper and a lower sideband. We model the upper and lower sideband complex ETF response and verify the model by fitting to experimental data. The model not only can fit for certain physical parameters of the detector, such as loop gain, temperature sensitivity, current sensitivity, and time constant, but also enables us to estimate the systematic effect introduced by the multiplexed readout. The method is therefore useful for in-situ detector calibration and for estimating systematic effects during astronomical telescope observations, such as those performed by the upcoming LiteBIRD satellite.</description>

      <title>Constraining the core radius and density jumps inside Earth using atmospheric neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric neutrinos can act as a tool to probe the interior of Earth using weak interactions, and can provide information complementary to that obtained from gravitational and seismic measurements. While passing through Earth, multi-GeV neutrinos encounter Earth matter effects due to the coherent forward scattering with the ambient electrons, which alter the neutrino oscillation probabilities. These matter effects depend upon the density distribution of electrons inside Earth, and hence, can be used to determine the internal structure of Earth. In this work, we employ a five-layered model of Earth where the layer densities and radii are modified, keeping the mass and moment of inertia of Earth unchanged and respecting the hydrostatic equilibrium condition. We use the proposed INO-ICAL detector as an example of an atmospheric neutrino experiment that can distinguish between neutrinos and antineutrinos efficiently in the multi-GeV energy range. Our analysis demonstrates the role such an experiment can play in simultaneously constraining the density jumps inside Earth and the location of the core-mantle boundary.</description>

      <title>A Design of Hadronic Calorimeter for DarkSHINE Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sensitivity of the dark photon search through invisible decay final states in low background experiments significantly relies on the neutron and muon veto efficiency, which depends on the amount of material used and the design of detector geometry. This paper presents an optimized design of a hadronic calorimeter (HCAL) used for the DarkSHINE experiment, which is studied using a GEANT4-based simulation framework. The geometry is optimized by comparing a traditional design with uniform absorbers to one that uses different thicknesses at different locations of the detector, which enhances the efficiency of vetoing low-energy neutrons at the sub-GeV level. The overall size and total amount of material used in HCAL are optimized to be lower due to the load and budget requirements, while the overall performance is studied to meet the physical objectives.</description>

      <title>Geometry dependence of TLS noise and loss in a-SiC:H parallel plate capacitors for superconducting microwave resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parallel plate capacitors (PPC) significantly reduce the size of superconducting microwave resonators, reducing the pixel pitch for arrays of single photon energy-resolving kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). The frequency noise of KIDs is typically limited by tunneling Two-Level Systems (TLS), which originate from lattice defects in the dielectric materials required for PPCs. How the frequency noise level depends on the PPC's dimensions has not been experimentally addressed. We measure the frequency noise of 56 resonators with a-SiC:H PPCs, which cover a factor 44 in PPC area and a factor 4 in dielectric thickness. To support the noise analysis, we measure the TLS-induced, power-dependent, intrinsic loss and temperature-dependent resonance frequency shift of the resonators. From the TLS models, we expect a geometry-independent microwave loss and resonance frequency shift, set by the TLS properties of the dielectric. However, we observe a thickness-dependent microwave loss and resonance frequency shift, explained by surface layers that limit the performance of PPC-based resonators. For a uniform dielectric, the frequency noise level should scale directly inversely with the PPC area and thickness. We observe that an increase in PPC size reduces the frequency noise, but the exact scaling is, in some cases, weaker than expected. Finally, we derive an engineering guideline for the design of KIDs based on PPC-based resonators.</description>

      <title>Radon Concentration Measurement with a High-Sensitivity Radon Detector at the Yemilab</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiation emitted from radon is a critical background in rare event search experiments conducted at the Yemi Underground Laboratory (Yemilab) in Jeongseon, Korea. A Radon Reduction System(RRS) has been developed and installed in Yemilab to reduce radon concentration in the air. The RRS primarily provides a purified air of 50 m3/h to the cleanroom used to assemble crystal detectors in the AMoRE, a neutrinoless double beta decay search experiment. RRS can reduce the radon level by a factor of 300, so a high-sensitivity radon detector was required. A highly sensitive radon detector was constructed using a 70 L chamber with a large PIN photodiode to measure radon concentration in the purified air. The radon detector shows an excellent resolution of 72 keV (FWHM) for 6.003 MeV alphas from 218Po decay and a sensitivity down to 23.8 +- 2.1 mBq/m3 with a boil-off N2 gas sample. The radon concentration level from the RRS measured by the radon detector was below 0.29 Bq/m3 with a reduction factor of about 300.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a novel proton-CT scanner based on Silicon and LaBr$_3$(Ce) detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Treatment planning systems at proton-therapy centres generally use X-ray computed tomography (CT) as primary imaging technique to infer the proton treatment doses to tumour and healthy tissues. However, proton stopping powers in the body, as derived from X-ray images, suffer from important proton-range uncertainties. In order to reduce this uncertainty in range, one could use proton-CT images instead. The main goal of this work is to test the capabilities of a newly-developed proton-CT scanner, based on the use of a set of tracking detectors and a high energy resolution scintillator for the residual energy of the protons. Different custom-made phantoms were positioned at the field of view of the scanner and were irradiated with protons at the CCB proton-therapy center in Krakow. We measured with the phantoms at different angles and produced sinograms that were used to obtain reconstructed images by Filtered Back-Projection (FBP). The obtained images were used to determine the capabilities of our scanner in terms of spatial resolution and proton Relative Stopping Power mapping and validate its use as proton-CT scanner. The results show that the scanner can produce medium-high quality images, with spatial resolution better than 2 mm in radiography, below 3 mm in tomography and resolving power in the RSP comparable to other state of the art pCT cameras.</description>

      <title>Probing Neutrino Oscillations with Reactor Antineutrinos in JUNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a multi-purpose neutrino experiment currently under construction in South China, in an underground laboratory with approximately 650 m of rock overburden (1800 m.w.e.). The detector consists of a 20 kton liquid scintillator target, contained inside a 35.4-meter-diameter spherical acrylic vessel. The central detector (CD) is equipped with 17,612 20-inch and 25,600 3-inch Photomultipliers Tubes (PMTs), providing more than 75% total photocathode coverage. JUNO's main goal is the determination of the neutrino mass ordering with reactor antineutrinos, emitted from two adjacent nuclear power plants on a ~52.5 km baseline from the experimental site. JUNO's strategic location at a baseline corresponding to the first solar oscillation maximum, where the kinematic phase $\Delta_{21} \simeq \frac{\pi}{2}$, grants it the unique capability to simultaneously probe the effects of oscillations on both solar and atmospheric scales; moreover, it stands out as the first experiment to address the unresolved NMO question through vacuum-dominant oscillations. The oscillated energy spectrum in JUNO changes subtly depending on the neutrino mass ordering, which manifests as an energy-dependent phase shift, thus providing sensitivity to this parameter. Furthermore, the unparalleled size and energy resolution will enable to achieve a sub-percent precision on three parameters: $\Delta m_{21}^{2}$, $\Delta m_{31}^{2}$, and $\sin^2\theta_{12}$. This contribution will focus on JUNO's oscillation physics potential with reactor antineutrinos, with a particular emphasis on its crucial role in inaugurating a new era of precision within the neutrino sector.</description>
