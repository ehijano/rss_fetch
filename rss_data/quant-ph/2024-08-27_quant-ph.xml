      <title>Towards Equivalence Checking of Classical Circuits Using Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers and quantum algorithms have made great strides in the last few years and promise improvements over classical computing for specific tasks. Although the current hardware is not yet ready to make real impacts at the time of writing, this will change over the coming years. To be ready for this, it is important to share knowledge of quantum computing in application domains where it is not yet represented. One such application is the verification of classical circuits, specifically, equivalence checking. Although this problem has been investigated over decades in an effort to overcome the verification gap, how it can potentially be solved using quantum computing has hardly been investigated yet. In this work, we address this question by considering a presumably straightforward approach: Using Grover's algorithm. However, we also show that, although this might be an obvious choice, there are several pitfalls to avoid in order to get meaningful results. This leads to the proposal of a working concept of a quantum computing methodology for equivalent checking providing the foundation for corresponding solutions in the (near) future.</description>

      <title>A recipe for local simulation of strongly-correlated fermionic matter on quantum computers: the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of quantum many-body systems, relevant for quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics, is one of the most promising applications of near-term quantum computers before fault-tolerance. However, since the vast majority of quantum computing technologies are built around qubits and discrete gate-based operations, the translation of the physical problem into this framework is a crucial step. This translation will often be device specific, and a suboptimal implementation will be punished by the exponential compounding of errors on real devices. The importance of an efficient mapping is already revealed for models of spinful fermions in two or three dimensions, which naturally arise when the relevant physics relates to electrons. Using the most direct and well-known mapping, the Jordan-Wigner transformation, leads to a non-local representation of local degrees of freedom, and necessities efficient decompositions of non-local unitary gates into a sequence of hardware accessible local gates. In this paper, we provide a step-by-step recipe for simulating the paradigmatic two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model on a quantum computer using only local operations. To provide the ingredients for such a recipe, we briefly review the plethora of different approaches that have emerged recently but focus on the Derby-Klassen compact fermion mapping in order to make our discussion concrete. We provide a detailed recipe for an end-to-end simulation including embedding on a physical device, preparing initial states such as ground states, simulation of unitary time evolution, and measurement of observables and spectral functions. We explicitly compute the resource requirements for simulating a global quantum quench and conclude by discussing the challenges and future directions for simulating strongly-correlated fermionic matter on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Scalar Gravitational Aharonov-Bohm Effect: Generalization of the Gravitational Redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Aharonov-Bohm effect is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that demonstrates how potentials can have observable effects even when the classical fields associated with those potentials are absent. Initially proposed for electromagnetic interactions, this effect has been experimentally confirmed and extensively studied over the years. More recently, the effect has been observed in the context of gravitational interactions using atom interferometry. Additionally, recent predictions suggest that temporal variations in the phase of an electron wave function will induce modulation sidebands in the energy levels of an atomic clock, solely driven by a time-varying scalar gravitational potential [1]. In this study, we consider the atomic clock as a two-level system undergoing continuous Rabi oscillations between the electron's ground and excited state. We assume the photons driving the transition are precisely frequency-stabilized to match the transition, enabling accurate clock comparisons. Our analysis takes into account, that when an atom transitions from its ground state to an excited state, it absorbs energy, increasing its mass according to the mass-energy equivalence principle. Due to the mass difference between the two energy levels, we predict that an atomic clock in an eccentric orbit will exhibit a constant frequency shift relative to a ground clock corresponding to the orbit's average gravitational redshift, with additional modulation sidebands due to the time-varying gravitational potential.</description>

      <title>Perturbative power series for block diagonalisation of Hermitian matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Block diagonalisation of matrices by canonical transformation is important in various fields of physics. Such diagonalization is currently of interest in condensed matter physics, for modelling of gates in superconducting circuits and for studying isolated quantum many-body systems. While the block diagonalisation of a particular Hermitian matrix is not unique, it can be made unique with certain auxiliary conditions. It has been assumed in some recent literature that two of these conditions, ``least action" vs. block-off-diagonality of the generator, lead to identical transformations. We show that this is not the case, and that these two approaches diverge at third order in the small parameter. We derive the perturbative power series of the ``least action", exhibiting explicitly the loss of block-off-diagnoality.</description>

      <title>Preparing angular momentum eigenstates using engineered quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled angular momentum eigenstates are widely used in atomic and nuclear physics calculations, and are building blocks for spin networks and the Schur transform. To combine two angular momenta $\mathbf{J}_1$ and $\mathbf{J}_2$, forming eigenstates of their total angular momentum $\mathbf{J}=\mathbf{J}_1+\mathbf{J}_2$, we develop a quantum-walk scheme that does not require inputting $O(j^3)$ nonzero Clebsch-Gordan (CG) coefficients classically. In fact, our scheme may be regarded as a unitary method for computing CG coefficients on quantum computers with a typical complexity of $O(j)$ and a worst-case complexity of $O(j^3)$. Equivalently, our scheme provides decompositions of the dense CG unitary into sparser unitary operations. Our scheme prepares angular momentum eigenstates using a sequence of Hamiltonians to move an initial state deterministically to desired final states, which are usually highly entangled states in the computational basis. In contrast to usual quantum walks, whose Hamiltonians are prescribed, we engineer the Hamiltonians in $\mathfrak{su}(2)\times \mathfrak{su}(2)$, which are inspired by, but different from, Hamiltonians that govern magnetic resonances and dipole interactions. To achieve a deterministic preparation of both ket and bra states, we use projection and destructive interference to double pinch the quantum walks, such that each step is a unit-probability population transfer within a two-level system. We test our state preparation scheme on classical computers, reproducing CG coefficients. We also implement small test problems on current quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Circumventing Traps in Analog Quantum Machine Learning Algorithms Through Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning QML algorithms promise to deliver near-term, applicable quantum computation on noisy, intermediate-scale systems. While most of these algorithms leverage quantum circuits for generic applications, a recent set of proposals, called analog quantum machine learning (AQML) algorithms, breaks away from circuit-based abstractions and favors leveraging the natural dynamics of quantum systems for computation, promising to be noise-resilient and suited for specific applications such as quantum simulation. Recent AQML studies have called for determining best ansatz selection practices and whether AQML algorithms have trap-free landscapes based on theory from quantum optimal control (QOC). We address this call by systematically studying AQML landscapes on two models: those admitting black-boxed expressivity and those tailored to simulating a specific unitary evolution. Numerically, the first kind exhibits local traps in their landscapes, while the second kind is trap-free. However, both kinds violate QOC theory's key assumptions for guaranteeing trap-free landscapes. We propose a methodology to co-design AQML algorithms for unitary evolution simulation using the ansatz's Magnus expansion. We show favorable convergence in simulating dynamics with applications to metrology and quantum chemistry. We conclude that such co-design is necessary to ensure the applicability of AQML algorithms.</description>

      <title>Realtime Compilation for Continuous Angle Quantum Error Correction Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is necessary to run large scale quantum programs. Regardless of error correcting code, hardware platform, or systems architecture, QEC systems are limited by the types of gates which they can perform efficiently. In order to make the base code's gate set universal, they typically rely on the production of a single type of resource state, commonly T, in a different code which is then distilled and injected into the base code. This process is neither space nor time efficient and can account for a large portion of the total execution time and physical qubit cost of any program. In order to circumvent this problem, alternatives have been proposed, such as the production of continuous angle rotation states \cite{akahoshi2023partially, choi2023fault}. These proposals are powerful because they not only enable localized resource generation but also can potentially reduce total space requirements.
  However, the production of these states is non-deterministic and can require many repetitions in order to obtain the desired resource. The original proposals suggest architectures which do not actively account for realtime management of its resources to minimize total execution time. Without this, static compilation of programs to these systems will be unnecessarily expensive. In this work, we propose a realtime compilation of programs to these continuous angle systems and a generalized resource sharing architecture which actively minimizes total execution time based on expected production rates. To do so, we repeatedly redistribute resources on-demand which depending on the underlying hardware can cause excessive classical control overhead. We further address this by dynamically selecting the frequency of recompilation. Our compiler and architecture improves over the baseline proposals by an average of $2\times$.</description>

      <title>Strategy of satellite QKD with passive high brightness entangled photon pair source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-brightness entangled photon pair (HBEPP) source is essential for conducting entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) between a satellite and a ground station. While an ultrabright source can overcome significant losses in satellite-based QKD (SQKD) and increase the sifted key rate, it also induces the multi-photon effect, raising the system's error rate. To accurately estimate system performance, we first present an analytical model for calculating the measurement probabilities of HBEPP distribution through an asymmetric loss channel. Based on this model, we propose the use of a passive-intensity HBEPP source for SQKD systems, assuming a polarization-independent channel and threshold detectors for measurement. We confirm that fixing the mean photon number at $\bar{\mu}=0.1$ achieves a performance of $99.7\%$ compared to the ideal one-way communication entanglement-based SQKD protocol, which is effectively optimizing the HBEPP source brightness in accordance with system losses.</description>

      <title>Molecular Entanglement Witness by Absorption Spectroscopy in Cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Producing and maintaining molecular entanglement at room temperature and detecting multipartite entanglement features of macroscopic molecular systems remain key challenges for understanding inter-molecular quantum effects in chemistry. Here, we study the quantum Fisher information, a central concept in quantum metrology, as a multipartite entanglement witness. We generalize the entanglement witness functional related to quantum Fisher information regarding non-identical local response operators. We show that it is a good inter-molecular entanglement witness for ultrastrong light-matter coupling in cavity quantum electrodynamics, including near the superradiant phase transition. We further connect quantum Fisher information to the dipole correlator, which suggests that this entanglement could be detected by absorption spectroscopy. Our work proposes a general protocol to detect inter-molecular entanglement in chemical systems at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Weakly Fault-Tolerant Computation in a Quantum Error-Detecting Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many current quantum error correcting codes that achieve full fault-tolerance suffer from having low ratios of logical to physical qubits and significant overhead. This makes them difficult to implement on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers and results in the inability to perform quantum algorithms at useful scales with near-term quantum processors. Due to this, calculations are generally done without encoding. We propose a middle ground between these two approaches: constructions in the [[n,n-2,2]] quantum error detecting code that can detect any error from a single faulty gate by measuring the stabilizer generators of the code and additional ancillas at the end of the computation. This achieves what we call weak fault-tolerance. As we show, this demonstrates a significant improvement over no error correction for low enough physical error probabilities and requires much less overhead than codes that achieve full fault-tolerance. We give constructions for a set of gates that achieve universal quantum computation in this error detecting code, while satisfying weak fault-tolerance up to analog imprecision on the physical rotation gate.</description>

      <title>Practical quantum advantage on partially fault-tolerant quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving quantum speedups in practical tasks remains challenging for current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. These devices always encounter significant obstacles such as inevitable physical errors and the limited scalability of current near-term algorithms. Meanwhile, assuming a typical architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), realistic applications inevitably require a vast number of qubits, typically exceeding $10^6$, which seems far beyond near-term realization. In this work, to bridge the gap between the NISQ and FTQC eras, we propose an alternative approach to achieve practical quantum advantages on early-FTQC devices. Our framework is based on partially fault-tolerant logical operations to minimize spatial overhead and avoids the costly distillation techniques typically required for executing non-Clifford gates. To this end, we develop a space-time efficient state preparation protocol to generate an ancillary non-Clifford state consumed for implementing an analog rotation gate with an arbitrary small angle $\theta$ and a remarkably low worst-case error rate below $\mathcal{O}(|\theta| p_{\text{ph}})$, where $p_{\text{ph}}$ is the physical error rate. Furthermore, we propose several error suppression schemes tailored to our preparation protocol, which are essential to minimize the overhead for mitigating errors. Based on this framework, we present several promising applications that leverage the potential of our framework, including the Trotter simulation and quantum phase estimation (QPE). Notably, we demonstrate that our framework allows us to perform the QPE for $(8\times 8)$-site Hubbard model with fewer than $4.9\times 10^4$ qubits and an execution time of 9 days (or 12 minutes with full parallelization) under $p_{\text{ph}}=10^{-4}$, which is significantly faster than recent classical estimation with tensor network techniques (DMRG and PEPS).</description>

      <title>Compilation of Trotter-Based Time Evolution for Partially Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving practical quantum speedup with limited resources is a crucial challenge in both academic and industrial communities. To address this, a partially fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture called ``space-time efficient analog rotation quantum computing architecture (STAR architecture)'' has been recently proposed. This architecture focuses on minimizing resource requirements while maximizing the precision of non-Clifford gates, essential for universal quantum computation. However, non-deterministic processes such as the repeat-until-success (RUS) protocol and state injection can introduce significant computational overhead. Therefore, optimizing the logical circuit to minimize this overhead by using efficient fault-tolerant operations is essential. This paper presents an efficient method for simulating the time evolution of the 2D Hubbard model Hamiltonian, a promising application of the STAR architecture. We present two techniques, parallel injection protocol and adaptive injection region updating, to reduce unnecessary time overhead specific to our architecture. By integrating these with the existing fSWAP technique, we develop an efficient Trotter-based time evolution operation for the 2D Hubbard model. Our analysis reveals an acceleration of over 10 times compared to naive serial compilation. This optimized compilation enables us to estimate the computational resources required for quantum phase estimation of the 2D Hubbard model. For devices with a physical error rate of $p_{\rm phys} = 10^{-4}$, we estimate that approximately $6.5 \times 10^4$ physical qubits are required to achieve faster ground state energy estimation of the $8\times8$ Hubbard model compared to classical computation.</description>

      <title>A little bit of self-correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of stable subspaces in the low-temperature quantum thermal dynamics of finite spin chains. Our analysis reveals the existence of effective decoherence-free qudit subspaces, persisting for timescales exponential in $\beta$. Surprisingly, the appearance of metastable subspaces is not directly related to the entanglement structure of the ground state(s). Rather, they arise from symmetry relations in low-lying excited states. Despite their stability within a 'phase', practical realization of stable qubits is hindered by susceptibility to symmetry-breaking perturbations. This work highlights that there can be non-trivial quantum behavior in the thermal dynamics of noncommuting many body models, and opens the door to more extensive studies of self-correction in such systems.</description>

      <title>Dichroic mirror pulses for optimized higher-order atomic Bragg diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing the sensitivity of light-pulse atom interferometers progressively relies on large-momentum transfer techniques. Precise control of such methods is imperative to exploit the full capabilities of these quantum sensors. One key element is the mitigation of deleterious effects such as parasitic paths deteriorating the interferometric signal. In this work, we present the experimental realization of dichroic mirror pulses for atom interferometry specifically designed for higher-order Bragg diffraction. Our approach selectively reflects resonant atom paths into the detected interferometer output, ensuring that these contribute to the signal with intent. Simultaneously, parasitic paths are efficiently transmitted by the mirror and not directed to the relevant interferometer outputs. This method effectively isolates the desired interferometric signal from noise induced by unwanted paths. It not only demonstrates enhanced control over the atomic trajectories but also represents a significant step forward in optimizing the performance of light-pulse atom interferometers for high-precision applications.</description>

      <title>European Quantum Ecosystems -- Preparing the Industry for the Quantum Security and Communications Revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is mounting evidence that a second quantum revolution based on the technological capabilities to detect and manipulate single quantum particles (e.g., electrons, photons, ions, etc), a feat not achieved during the first quantum revolution, is progressing fast. It is expected that in less than 10 years, this second quantum revolution shall have a significant impact over numerous industries, including finance, medicine, energy, transportation, etc. Quantum computers threaten the status quo of cybersecurity, due to known quantum algorithms that can break asymmetric encryption, which is what gives us the ability to communicate securely using a public channel. Considering the world's dependence on digital communication through data exchange and processing, retaining the ability to communicate securely even once quantum computers come into play, cannot be stressed enough. Two solutions are available: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC); which, we emphasise, are not mutually exclusive. The EuroQCI initiative, of which EQUO is a part of, focuses on QKD and aims to build a network whereby EU countries can communicate securely through QKD. To this aim, the DEP (Digital Europe Programme) project aims to bring technological matureness to QKD by deploying a QKD test network and, through this exercise, understand what is lacking from an operator's point of view when the time to integrate QKD in their network comes.</description>

      <title>Beam Splitter for Dark and Bright States of Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam splitters are indispensable elements in optical and photonic systems, and are therefore employed in both classical and quantum technologies. Depending on the intended application, these devices can divide incident light according to its power, polarization state, or wavelength. In this work, we theoretically present a novel type of beam splitter capable of separating a light beam into its two-mode bright and dark components. We propose a prototype based on an optical cross-cavity system resonantly coupled to a $\Lambda$-type three-level atom. The dark component of the incoming light is transmitted because the antisymmetric collective mode of the cavity setup is decoupled from the atom. Meanwhile, in a high-cooperativity regime, the bright component is reflected due to Autler-Townes splitting, which arises from the strong coupling between the atom and the symmetric collective mode of the cavity setup. Although the device requires only a two-level atom to operate, using a three-level atom allows the device to be turned on or off by controlling the atomic ground state. Our results pave the way for new applications of beam splitters that leverage the collective properties of light. Manipulating and exploiting this additional degree of freedom can advance the field of quantum optics and contribute to the development of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Squeezing light to get non-classical work in quantum engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light can be squeezed by reducing the quantum uncertainty of the electric field for some phases. We show how to use this purely-quantum effect to extract net mechanical work from radiation pressure in a simple quantum photon engine. Along the way, we demonstrate that the standard definition of work in quantum systems is not appropriate in this context, as it does not capture the energy leaked to these quantum degrees of freedom. We use these results to design an Otto engine able to produce mechanical work from squeezing baths, in the absence of thermal gradient. Interestingly, while work extraction from squeezing generally improves for low temperatures, there exists a nontrivial squeezing-dependent temperature for which work production is maximal, demonstrating the complex interplay between thermal and squeezing effects.</description>

      <title>Design of a release-free piezo-optomechanical quantum transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum transduction between microwave and optical photons could combine the long-range connectivity provided by optical photons with the deterministic quantum operations of superconducting microwave qubits. A promising approach to quantum microwave-optics transduction uses an intermediary mechanical mode along with piezo-optomechanical interactions. So far, such transducers have been released from their underlying substrate to confine mechanical fields -- preventing proper thermal anchoring and creating a noise-efficiency trade-off resulting from optical absorption. Here, we introduce a release-free, i.e. non-suspended, piezo-optomechanical transducer intended to circumvent this noise-efficiency trade-off. We propose and design a silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) release-free transducer with appealing piezo- and optomechanical performance. Our proposal integrates release-free lithium niobate electromechanical crystals with silicon optomechanical crystals on a sapphire substrate meant to improve thermal anchoring along with microwave and mechanical coherence. It leverages high-wavevector mechanical modes firmly guided on the chip surface. Beyond quantum science and engineering, the proposed platform and design principles are attractive for low-power acousto-optic systems in integrated photonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, I highlight a useful formula for the SWAP operator as an average of anti-correlated Heisenberg-Weyl displacements, valid for arbitrary-dimensional quantum systems. As an application I show how the relation can be used to quickly prove normalization identities for the Weyl function, and apply the result to Weyl magic and Wigner magic as the generalization of the recently suggested Renyi Stabilizer entropy to q-dits and CV.</description>

      <title>Detecting quasi-degenerate ground states in 1D topological models via VQE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the exact ground states of the Su--Schrieffer--Heeger open chain and of the Kitaev open chain, using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. These models host symmetry-protected topological phases, characterized by edge modes with vanishing single-particle energy in the thermodynamic limit. The same fact prevents the standard VQE algorithm from converging to the correct ground state for finite chains, since it is quasi-degenerate in energy with other many-body states. Notably, this quasi-degeneracy cannot be removed by small perturbations, as in typical spin systems. We address this issue by imposing appropriate constraints on the VQE evolution and constructing appropriate variational circuits, to restrict the probed portion of the Hilbert space along the same evolution. These constraints stem from both general properties of the topological phases and of the studied Hamiltonians. In this way, the improved VQE algorithm achieves an accurate convergence to the exact ground states in each phase. The present approach promises large applicability, also to realistic systems and possibly with different topology, thanks to the very high fidelity achieved also on systems with a relatively high number of qubits.</description>

      <title>Canonical Form and Finite Blocklength Bounds for Stabilizer Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First, a canonical form for stabilizer parity check matrices of arbitrary size and rank is derived. Next, it is shown that the closely related canonical form of the Clifford group can be computed in time $O(n^3)$ for $n$ qubits, which improves upon the previously known time $O(n^6)$. Finally, the related problem of finite blocklength bounds for stabilizer codes and Pauli noise is studied. A finite blocklength refinement of the hashing bound is derived, and it is shown that no argument that uses guessing the error as a substitute for guessing the coset can lead to a significantly better achievability bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Frenkel's integral representation of the quantum relative entropy provides a natural framework to derive continuity bounds for quantum information measures. Our main general result is a dimension-independent semi-continuity relation for the quantum relative entropy with respect to the first argument. Using it, we obtain a number of results: (1) a tight continuity relation for the conditional entropy in the case where the two states have equal marginals on the conditioning system, resolving a conjecture by Wilde in this special case; (2) a stronger version of the Fannes-Audenaert inequality on quantum entropy; (3) a tighter continuity relation for quantum capacity; (4) better estimates on the quantum capacity of approximately degradable channels; (5) an improved continuity relation for the entanglement cost; (6) general upper bounds on asymptotic transformation rates in infinite-dimensional entanglement theory; and (7) a proof of a conjecture due to Christandl, Ferrara, and Lancien on the continuity of 'filtered' relative entropy distances.</description>

      <title>Engineering a Josephson junction chain for the simulation of the clock model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous improvement of fabrication techniques and high-quality semiconductor-superconductor interfaces allowed for unprecedented tunability of Josephson junction arrays (JJA), making them a promising candidate for analog quantum simulations of many-body phenomena. While most experimental proposals so far focused on quantum simulations of ensembles of two-level systems, the possibility of tuning the current-phase relation beyond the sinusoidal regime paves the way for studying statistical physics models with larger local Hilbert spaces. Here, we investigate a particular JJA architecture that can be mapped into a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model. Through matrix-product-states simulations and bosonization analysis, we show that few experimentally accessible control parameters allow for the exploration of the rich phase diagrams of the associated low-energy field theories. Our results expand the horizon for analog quantum simulations with JJAs towards models that can not be efficiently captured with qubit architectures.</description>

      <title>Tunneling half-lives in macroscopic-microscopic picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tunneling half lives are obtained in a minimalistic deformation picture of nuclear decays. As widely documented in other deformation models, one finds that the effective mass of the nucleus changes with the deformation parameter. However, contrary to the approach used in literature, a position-dependant mass potentially makes using WKB tunneling probabilities unreliable for estimating nuclear lifetimes. We instead use a new approach, a combination of the Transmission Matrix and WKB methods, to estimate tunneling probabilities. Because of the simplistic nature of the model, the calculated lifetimes are not accurate, however, the relative trends in the lifetimes of isotopes of individual nuclei are found to be consistent. Using this, we develop an empirical scaling to obtain the actual half-lives, and find the primary scaling parameter to have remarkably consistent values for all nuclei considered. The new tunneling method proposed here, which produces very different probabilities as compared to the usual WKB approach, is another key result of this work, and can be utilized for arbitrary potentials and mass variations.</description>

Abstract: We develop a model describing long-range atom-atom interactions in a two-dimensional periodic or aperiodic lattice of optical centers inside a solid-state host material. We consider realistic environmental and technical conditions such as frequency and position broadening. Even when considering a significant frequency broadening in the ensemble (approximately 300 GHz), we observe up to a three-fold increase in directional scattering from the resonant lattice in a system. The model can be used to scalably design quantum optical elements, e.g. a quantum lens, harnessing atomistic engineering (e.g. via ion implantation) of collective interactions in materials to enhance quantum properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom electric field sensors are tunable quantum sensors that can perform sensitive radio frequency (RF) measurements. Their qualities have piqued interest at longer wavelengths where their small size compares favorably to impedance-matched antennas. Here, we compare the signal detection sensitivity of cm-scale Rydberg sensors to similarly sized room-temperature electrically small antennas with active and passive receiver backends. We present and analyze effective circuit models for each sensor type, facilitating a fair sensitivity comparison for cm-scale sensors. We calculate that contemporary Rydberg sensor implementations are less sensitive than unmatched antennas with active amplification. However, we find that idealized Rydberg sensors operating with a maximized atom number and at the standard quantum limit may perform well beyond the capabilities of antenna-based sensors at room temperature, the sensitivities of both lying below typical atmospheric background noise.</description>

      <title>Toward Mixed Analog-Digital Quantum Signal Processing: Quantum AD/DA Conversion and the Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signal processing stands as a pillar of classical computation and modern information technology, applicable to both analog and digital signals. Recently, advancements in quantum information science have suggested that quantum signal processing (QSP) can enable more powerful signal processing capabilities. However, the developments in QSP have primarily leveraged \emph{digital} quantum resources, such as discrete-variable (DV) systems like qubits, rather than \emph{analog} quantum resources, such as continuous-variable (CV) systems like quantum oscillators. Consequently, there remains a gap in understanding how signal processing can be performed on hybrid CV-DV quantum computers. Here we address this gap by developing a new paradigm of mixed analog-digital QSP. We demonstrate the utility of this paradigm by showcasing how it naturally enables analog-digital conversion of quantum signals -- specifically, the transfer of states between DV and CV quantum systems. We then show that such quantum analog-digital conversion enables new implementations of quantum algorithms on CV-DV hardware. This is exemplified by realizing the quantum Fourier transform of a state encoded on qubits via the free-evolution of a quantum oscillator, albeit with a runtime exponential in the number of qubits due to information theoretic arguments. Collectively, this work marks a significant step forward in hybrid CV-DV quantum computation, providing a foundation for scalable analog-digital signal processing on quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a special decomposition of the Lie $\mathfrak{su}(4)$ algebra into the direct sum of orthogonal subspaces, $\mathfrak{su}(4)=\mathfrak{k}\oplus\mathfrak{a}\oplus\mathfrak{a}^\prime\oplus\mathfrak{t}\,,$ with $\mathfrak{k}=\mathfrak{su}(2)\oplus\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and a triplet of 3-dimensional Abelian subalgebras $(\mathfrak{a}, \mathfrak{a}^{\prime}, \mathfrak{t})\,,$ such that the exponential mapping of a neighbourhood of the $0\in \mathfrak{su}(4)$ into a neighbourhood of the identity of the Lie group provides the following factorization of an element of $SU(4)$ \[ g = k\,a\,t\,, \] where $k \in \exp{(\mathfrak{k})} = SU(2)\times SU(2) \subset SU(4)\,,$ the diagonal matrix $t$ stands for an element from the maximal torus $T^3=\exp{(\mathfrak{t})},$ and the factor $a=\exp{(\mathfrak{a})}\exp{(\mathfrak{a}^\prime)}$ corresponds to a point in the double coset $SU(2)\times SU(2)\backslash SU(4)/T^3.$
  Analyzing the uniqueness of the inverse of the above exponential mappings, we establish a logarithmic coordinate chart of the $SU(4)$ group manifold comprising 6 coordinates on the embedded manifold $ SU(2)\times SU(2) \subset SU(4)$ and 9 coordinates on three copies of the regular octahedron with the edge length $2\pi\sqrt{2}\,$.</description>

We introduce a new readout scheme, termed Time to Space (T2S) encoding which decouples spin manipulation from optical readout both temporally and spatially. This is achieved by controlling the spin state within a region of interest, followed by rapid scanning of the optical readout position using an acousto-optic modulator. Time tracking allows the optical readout position to be encoded as a function of time. Using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles in diamond, we first demonstrate that the T2S scheme enables correlated experiments for efficient common mode noise cancellation in various nano- and microscale sensing scenarios. In the second example, we show highly scalable multi-pixel imaging that does not require a camera and has the potential to accelerate data acquisition by several hundred times compared to conventional scanning methods. We anticipate widespread adoption of this technique, as it requires no additional components beyond those commonly used in optically addressable spin systems.</description>

      <title>Long-lived entanglement of molecules in magic-wavelength optical tweezers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realising quantum control and entanglement of particles is crucial for advancing both quantum technologies and fundamental science. Significant developments in this domain have been achieved in a variety of systems. In this context, ultracold polar molecules offer new and unique opportunities due to their more complex internal structure associated with vibration and rotation, coupled to the existence of long-range interactions. However, the same properties make molecules highly sensitive to their environment, impacting their coherence and utility in some applications. Here we show that by engineering an exceptionally controlled environment using rotationally-magic optical tweezers, we can achieve long-lived entanglement between pairs of molecules using hertz-scale interactions. We demonstrate the highest reported fidelity to date for a two-molecule Bell state ($0.976^{+0.014}_{-0.016}$) and present the first realisation of a microwave-driven entangling gate between two molecules, preparing the molecules in a decoherence-free subspace. We show that the magic-wavelength trap preserves the entanglement, with no measurable decay over 0.5 s, opening new avenues for quantum-enhanced metrology, ultracold chemistry and the use of rotational states for quantum simulation, quantum computation and as quantum memories. The extension of precise quantum control to complex molecular systems will allow their additional degrees of freedom to be exploited across many domains of quantum science.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic couplings as a stabilization mechanism in long-range Rydberg molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range Rydberg molecules are typically bound in wells formed in their oscillatory potential energy curves. In alkaline Rydberg molecules, bound vibrational states exist even when these potential wells are disrupted by level repulsion from the steep butterfly potential energy curve induced by a scattering shape resonance. The binding in this case is attributed to quantum reflection. However, the rapidly varying regions of the potential energy landscape where quantum reflection occurs often coincide with regions where non-adiabatic coupling becomes significant. By comparing the molecular states calculated within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where quantum reflection is the only binding mechanism, with those obtained from the full set of coupled channel equations, we can assess the effects of non-adiabatic coupling on vibrational energies and lifetimes. Our findings show that these couplings can stabilize the molecule by providing an additional barrier which protects the vibrational states from predissociation and non-radiative transitions. There can also be extreme cases where non-adiabatic coupling completely dominates the binding and the molecular lifetimes saturate at the atomic Rydberg lifetime.</description>

      <title>Exact Polaron-Polaron interactions in a Quantum Hall Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact solution for effective polaron-polaron interactions between heavy impurities, mediated by a sea of non-interacting light fermions in the quantum Hall regime with highly degenerate Landau levels. For weak attraction between impurities and fermions, where only the manifold of lowest Landau levels is relevant, we obtain an analytical expression of mediated polaron-polaorn interactions. Remarkably, polaron interactions are exactly zero when fermions in lowest Landau levels outnumber heavy impurities. For strong attraction, different manifolds of higher Landau levels come into play and we derive a set of equations that can be used to numerically solve the mediated polaron interaction potential. We find that the potential vanishes when the distance R between impurities is larger than the magnetic length, but strongly diverges at short range following a Coulomb form -1/R. Our exact results of polaron-polaron interactions might be examined in cold-atom setups, where a system of Fermi polarons in the quantum Hall regime is realized with synthetic gauge field or under fast rotation. Our predictions could also be useful to understand the effective interaction between exciton-polarons in electron-doped semiconductors under strong magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Feynman 1947 letter on path integral for the Dirac equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1947, four months before the famous Shelter Island conference, Richard Feynman wrote a lengthy letter to his former MIT classmate Theodore Welton, reporting on his efforts to develop a path integral describing the propagation of a Dirac particle. While these efforts never came to fruition, and were shortly abandoned in favor of a very different method of dealing with the electron propagator appearing in in QED, the letter is interesting both from the historical viewpoint of revealing what Feynman was thinking about during that period just before the development of QED, and for its scientific ideas. It also contains at the end some philosophical remarks, which Feynman wraps up with the comment, ``Well enough for the baloney.'' In this article I present a transcription of the letter along with editorial notes, and a facsimile of the original handwritten document. I also briefly comment on Feynman's efforts and discuss their relation to some later work.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of Levy Rosenzweig-Porter model via supersymmetric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using the Efetov's super-symmetric formalism we computed analytically the mean spectral density $\rho(E)$ for the L\'evy and the L\'evy -Rosenzweig-Porter random matrices which off-diagonal elements are strongly non-Gaussian with power-law tails. This makes the standard Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation inapplicable to such problems. We used, instead, the functional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation which allowed to solve the problem analytically for large sizes of matrices. We show that $\rho(E)$ depends crucially on the control parameter that drives the system through the transition between the ergodic and the fractal phases and it can be used as an order parameter.</description>

Abstract: In a recent manuscript~[J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57 235204 (2024)], a candidate Hamiltonian for the Hilbert-P\'olya Conjecture was introduced. Here, we elegantly demonstrate that the corresponding eigenfunctions are square-integrable and, crucially, that the eigenvalues are real. The latter represents a significant step toward proving the Riemann Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Low-cost demonstration of the Zeeman effect: From qualitative observation to quantitative experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Zeeman effect, a fundamental quantum phenomenon, demonstrates the interaction between magnetic fields and atomic systems. While precise spectroscopic measurements of this effect have advanced significantly, there remains a lack of simple, visually accessible demonstrations for educational purposes. Here, we present a low-cost experiment that allows for direct visual observation of the Zeeman effect. Our setup involves a flame containing sodium (from table salt) placed in front of a sodium vapor lamp. When a magnetic field is applied to the flame, the shadow cast by the flame noticeably lightens, providing a clear, naked-eye demonstration of the Zeeman effect. Furthermore, we conduct two quantitative experiments using this setup, examining the effects of varying magnetic field strength and sodium concentration. This innovative approach not only enriches the experimental demonstration for teaching atomic physics at undergraduate and high school levels but also provides an open platform for students to explore the Zeeman effect through hands-on experience.</description>

Abstract: We apply numerical optimization and linear algebra algorithms for classical computers to the problem of automatically synthesizing algorithms for quantum computers. Using our framework, we apply several common techniques from these classical domains and numerically examine their suitability for and performance on this problem. Our methods are evaluated on single-qubit systems as well as on larger systems. While the first part of our proposed method outputs a single unitary matrix representing the composite effects of a quantum circuit or algorithm, we use existing tools - and assess the performance of these - to factor such a matrix into a product of elementary quantum gates. This enables our pipeline to be truly end-to-end: starting from desired input/output examples, our code ultimately results in a quantum circuit diagram. We release our code to the research community (upon acceptance).</description>

Abstract: One of the primary motivations of the research in the field of computation is to optimize the cost of computation. The major ingredient that a computer needs is the energy to run a process, i.e., the thermodynamic cost. The analysis of the thermodynamic cost of computation is one of the prime focuses of research. It started back since the seminal work of Landauer where it was commented that the computer spends kB T ln2 amount of energy to erase a bit of information (here T is the temperature of the system and kB represents the Boltzmann's constant). The advancement of statistical mechanics has provided us the necessary tool to understand and analyze the thermodynamic cost for the complicated processes that exist in nature, even the computation of modern computers. The advancement of physics has helped us to understand the connection of the statistical mechanics (the thermodynamics cost) with computation. Another important factor that remains a matter of concern in the field of computer science is the error correction of the error that occurs while transmitting the information through a communication channel. Here in this article, we have reviewed the progress of the thermodynamics of computation starting from Landauer's principle to the latest model, which simulates the modern complex computation mechanism. After exploring the salient parts of computation in computer science theory and information theory, we have reviewed the thermodynamic cost of computation and error correction. We have also discussed about the alternative computation models that have been proposed with thermodynamically cost-efficient.</description>

Abstract: The problem of defining a hermitian quantum phase operator is nearly as old as quantum mechanics itself. Throughout the years, a number of solutions was proposed, ranging from abstract operator formalisms to phase-space methods. In this work, we make an explicit connection between two of the most prominent approaches, by proving that the probability distribution of phase in the Paul formalism follows exactly from the Pegg-Barnett formalism by combining the latter with the quantum limited amplifier channel. Our findings suggest that the Paul framework may be viewed as a semi-classical limit of the Pegg-Barnett approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.00107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $U_d$ be a unitary operator representing an arbitrary $d$-dimensional unitary quantum operation. This work presents optimal quantum circuits for transforming a number $k$ of calls of $U_d$ into its complex conjugate $\bar{U_d}$. Our circuits admit a parallel implementation and are proven to be optimal for any $k$ and $d$ with an average fidelity of $\left\langle{F}\right\rangle =\frac{k+1}{d(d-k)}$. Optimality is shown for average fidelity, robustness to noise, and other standard figures of merit. This extends previous works which considered the scenario of a single call ($k=1$) of the operation $U_d$, and the special case of $k=d-1$ calls. We then show that our results encompass optimal transformations from $k$ calls of $U_d$ to $f(U_d)$ for any arbitrary homomorphism $f$ from the group of $d$-dimensional unitary operators to itself, since complex conjugation is the only non-trivial automorphisms on the group of unitary operators. Finally, we apply our optimal complex conjugation implementation to design a probabilistic circuit for reversing arbitrary quantum evolutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the quantum query complexity of $k$-distinctness is known to be $O\left(n^{3/4-1/4(2^k-1)}\right)$ for any constant $k \geq 4$, the best previous upper bound on the time complexity was $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{1-1/k}\right)$. We give a new upper bound of $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{3/4-1/4(2^k-1)}\right)$ on the time complexity, matching the query complexity up to polylogarithmic factors. In order to achieve this upper bound, we give a new technique for designing quantum walk search algorithms, which is an extension of the electric network framework. We also show how to solve the welded trees problem in $O(n)$ queries and $O(n^2)$ time using this new technique, showing that the new quantum walk framework can achieve exponential speedups.</description>

      <title>Perturbative gadgets for gate-based quantum computing: Non-recursive constructions without subspace restrictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03099v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perturbative gadgets are a tool to encode part of a Hamiltonian, usually the low-energy subspace, into a different Hamiltonian with favorable properties, for instance, reduced locality. Many constructions of perturbative gadgets have been proposed over the years. Still, all of them are restricted in some ways: Either they apply to some specific classes of Hamiltonians, they involve recursion to reduce locality, or they are limited to studying time evolution under the gadget Hamiltonian, e.g., in the context of adiabatic quantum computing, and thus involve subspace restrictions. In this work, we fill the gap by introducing a versatile universal, non-recursive, non-adiabatic perturbative gadget construction without subspace restrictions, that encodes an arbitrary many-body Hamiltonian into the low-energy subspace of a three-body Hamiltonian and is therefore applicable to gate-based quantum computing. Our construction requires $rk$ additional qubits for a $k$-body Hamiltonian comprising $r$ terms. Besides a specific gadget construction, we also provide a recipe for constructing similar gadgets, which can be tailored to different properties, which we discuss.</description>

Abstract: The multi-stage Stern$\unicode{x2013}$Gerlach experiment conducted by Frisch and Segr\`e includes two cascaded quantum measurements with a nonadiabatic flipper in between. The Frisch and Segr\`e experiment has been modeled analytically by Majorana without the nuclear effect and subsequently revised by Rabi with the hyperfine interaction. However, the theoretical predictions do not match the experimental observation accurately. Here, we numerically solve the standard quantum mechanical model, via the von Neumann equation, including the hyperfine interaction for the time evolution of the spin. Thus far, the coefficients of determination from the standard quantum mechanical model without using free parameters are still low, indicating a mismatch between the theory and the experiment. Non-standard variants that improve the match are explored for discussion.</description>

Abstract: Quantum annealing (QA) is a method for solving combinatorial optimization problems. We can estimate the computational time for QA using the adiabatic condition. The adiabatic condition consists of two parts: an energy gap and a transition matrix. Most past studies have focused on the relationship between the energy gap and computational time. The success probability of QA is considered to decrease exponentially owing to the exponentially decreasing energy gap at the first-order phase-transition point. In this study, through a detailed analysis of the relationship between the energy gap, transition matrix, and computational cost during QA, we propose a general method for constructing counterintuitive models wherein QA with a constant annealing time fails despite a constant energy gap, based on polynomial energy. We assume that the energy of the total Hamiltonian is at most $\Theta(L)$, where $L$ is the number of qubits. In our formalism, we choose a known model that exhibits an exponentially small energy gap during QA, and modify the model by adding a specific penalty term to the Hamiltonian. In the modified model, the transition matrix in the adiabatic condition becomes exponentially large as the number of qubits increases, while the energy gap remains constant. Moreover, we achieve a quadratic speedup, for which the upper bound for improvement in the adiabatic condition is determined by the polynomial energy. As examples, we consider the adiabatic Grover search and the $p$-spin model. In these cases, with the addition of the penalty term, although the success probability of QA on the modified models becomes exponentially small despite a constant energy gap; we can achieve a success probability considerably higher than that of conventional QA. Moreover, we numerically show the scaling of the computational cost is quadratically improved compared to the conventional QA.</description>

Abstract: Quantum speed limits provide upper bounds on the rate with which a quantum system can move away from its initial state. Here, we provide a different kind of speed limit, describing the divergence of a perturbed open system from its unperturbed trajectory. In the case of weak coupling, we show that the divergence speed is bounded by the quantum Fisher information under a perturbing Hamiltonian, up to an error which can be estimated from system and bath timescales. We give two applications of our speed limit. Firstly, it enables experimental estimation of quantum Fisher information in the presence of decoherence that is not fully characterised. Secondly, it implies that large quantum work fluctuations are necessary for a thermal system to be driven quickly out of equilibrium under a quench. Moreover, it can be used to bound the response to perturbations of expectation values of observables in open systems.</description>

      <title>Noise-aware variational eigensolvers: a dissipative route for lattice gauge theories</title>

Abstract: We propose a novel variational ansatz for the ground-state preparation of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) in quantum simulators. It combines dissipative and unitary operations in a completely deterministic scheme with a circuit depth that does not scale with the size of the considered lattice. We find that, with very few variational parameters, the ansatz can achieve $&gt;\!99\%$ precision in energy in both the confined and deconfined phase of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT. We benchmark our proposal against the unitary Hamiltonian variational ansatz showing a reduction in the required number of variational layers to achieve a target precision. After performing a finite-size scaling analysis, we show that our dissipative variational ansatz can predict accurate critical exponents without requiring a number of layers that scale with the system size, which is the standard situation for unitary ans\"{a}tze. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of this variational eigensolver subject to circuit-level noise, determining variational error thresholds that fix the error rate below which it would be beneficial to increase the number of layers. In light of these quantities and for typical gate errors $p$ in current quantum processors, we provide a detailed assessment of the prospects of our scheme to explore the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT on near-term devices.</description>

Abstract: Existing classical optical network infrastructure cannot be immediately used for quantum network applications due to photon loss. The first step towards enabling quantum networks is the integration of quantum repeaters into optical networks. However, the expenses and intrinsic noise inherent in quantum hardware underscore the need for an efficient deployment strategy that optimizes the allocation of quantum repeaters and memories. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for network planning, aiming to efficiently distributing quantum repeaters across existing infrastructure, with the objective of maximizing quantum network utility within an entanglement distribution network. We apply our framework to several cases including a preliminary illustration of a dumbbell network topology and real-world cases of the SURFnet and ESnet. We explore the effect of quantum memory multiplexing within quantum repeaters, as well as the influence of memory coherence time on quantum network utility. We further examine the effects of different fairness assumptions on network planning, uncovering their impacts on real-time network performance.</description>

Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics predicts open quantum system dynamics with unique topological features such as exceptional points and the non-Hermitian skin effect. We show that this new paradigm of topological systems can serve as probes for bulk Hamiltonian parameters with quantum-enhanced sensitivity reaching Heisenberg scaling. Such enhancement occurs close to a spectral topological phase transition, where the entire spectrum undergoes a delocalization transition. We provide an explanation for this enhanced sensitivity based on the closing of point gap, which is a genuinely non-Hermitian energy gap with no Hermitian counterpart. This establishes a direct connection between energy-gap closing and quantum enhancement in the non-Hermitian realm. Our findings are demonstrated through several paradigmatic non-Hermitian topological models in various dimensions and potential experimental implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the interplay of confinement, string breaking and entanglement asymmetry on a 1D quantum Ising chain. We consider the evolution of an initial domain wall and show that, surprisingly, while the introduction of confinement through a longitudinal field typically suppresses entanglement, it can also serve to increase it beyond a bound set for free particles. Our model can be tuned to conserve the number of domain walls, which gives an opportunity to explore entanglement asymmetry associated with link variables. We study two approaches to deal with the non-locality of the link variables, either directly or following a Kramers-Wannier transformation that maps bond variables (kinks) to site variables (spins). We develop a numerical procedure for computing the asymmetry using tensor network methods and use it to demonstrate the different types of entanglement and entanglement asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Efficient, High-Fidelity Single-Photon Switch Based on Waveguide-Coupled Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate theoretically that waveguide-coupled cavities with embedded two-level emitters can act as a highly efficient, high-fidelity quantum switch for photons propagating in the waveguide. The switch reflects photons in the weak emitter-cavity coupling regime and transmits photons in the strong coupling regime. By calculating transmission and reflection spectra using the input-output formalism of quantum optics and the transfer matrix approach, we obtain the fidelity and efficiency of the switch in both regimes. We find that a single waveguide-coupled cavity can route input photon wavepackets with near-unity efficiency and fidelity if the wavepacket width is smaller than the cavity mode linewidth. We also find that using multiple waveguide-coupled cavities increases the switching bandwidth, allowing wider wavepackets to be routed with high efficiency and fidelity. For example, an array of three waveguide-coupled cavities can reflect an input Gaussian wavepacket with a full width at half-maximum of 1 nm (corresponding to a few-picosecond pulse) with an efficiency E_r = 96.4% and a fidelity F_r = 97.7%, or transmit the wavepacket with an efficiency E_t = 99.7% and a fidelity F_t = 99.8%. Such efficient, high-fidelity single-photon routing is essential for scalable photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Shortcut to Adiabaticity for State Preparation in a Finite-Sized Jaynes-Cummings Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In noisy quantum systems, achieving high-fidelity state preparation using the adiabatic approach faces a dilemma: either extending the evolution time to reduce diabatic transitions or shortening it to mitigate decoherence effects. Here, we present a quantum shortcut to adiabaticity for state preparation in a finite-sized Jaynes-Cummings lattice by applying counter-diabatic (CD) driving along given adiabatic trajectories. Leveraging the symmetry of eigenstates in our system, we convert the CD driving to an implementable Hamiltonian that only involves local qubit-cavity couplings for a two-site lattice with one polariton excitation. Additionally, we derive a partial analytical form of the CD driving for the lattice with two excitations. Our numerical results demonstrate that circuit errors and environmental noise have negligible effects on our scheme under practical parameters. We also show that our scheme can be characterized through the detection of qubit operators. This approach can lead to a promising pathway to high-fidelity state preparation in a significantly reduced timescale when compared to conventional adiabatic methods.</description>

Abstract: A quantum emitter interacting with photons in a single optical-mode constitutes a one-dimensional atom. A coherent and efficiently coupled one-dimensional atom provides a large nonlinearity, enabling photonic quantum gates. Achieving a high coupling efficiency ($\beta$-factor) and low dephasing is challenging. Here, we use a semiconductor quantum dot in an open microcavity as an implementation of a one-dimensional atom. With a weak laser input, we achieve an extinction of $99.2\%$ in transmission and a concomitant bunching in the photon statistics of $g^{(2)}(0) = 587$, showcasing the reflection of the single-photon component and the transmission of the multi-photon components of the coherent input. The tunable nature of the microcavity allows $\beta$ to be adjusted and gives control over the photon statistics -- from strong bunching to anti-bunching -- and the phase of the transmitted photons. We obtain excellent agreement between experiment and theory by going beyond the single-mode Jaynes-Cummings model. Our results pave the way towards the creation of exotic photonic states and two-photon phase gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16410v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining quantum and Bayesian principles leads to optimality in metrology, but the optimisation equations involved are often hard to solve. This work mitigates this problem with a novel class of measurement strategies for quantities isomorphic to location parameters, which are shown to admit a closed-form optimisation. The resulting framework admits any parameter range, prior information, or state, and the associated estimators apply to finite samples. As an example, the metrology of relative weights is formulated from first principles and shown to require hyperbolic errors. The primary advantage of this approach lies in its simplifying power: it reduces the search for good strategies to identifying which symmetry leaves a state of maximum ignorance invariant. This will facilitate the application of quantum metrology to fundamental physics, where symmetries play a key role.</description>

Abstract: A quantum position-verification scheme attempts to verify the spatial location of a prover. The prover is issued a challenge with quantum and classical inputs and must respond with appropriate timings. We consider two well-studied position-verification schemes known as $f$-routing and $f$-BB84. Both schemes require an honest prover to locally compute a classical function $f$ of inputs of length $n$, and manipulate $O(1)$ size quantum systems. We prove the number of quantum gates plus single qubit measurements needed to implement a function $f$ is lower bounded linearly by the communication complexity of $f$ in the simultaneous message passing model with shared entanglement. Taking $f(x,y)=\sum_i x_i y_i$ to be the inner product function, we obtain a $\Omega(n)$ lower bound on quantum gates plus single qubit measurements. The scheme is feasible for a prover with linear classical resources and $O(1)$ quantum resources, and secure against sub-linear quantum resources.</description>

Abstract: What are the fundamental limits and advantages of using a catalyst to aid thermodynamic transformations between quantum systems? In this work, we answer this question by focusing on transformations between energy-incoherent states under the most general energy-conserving interactions among the system, the catalyst, and a thermal environment. The sole constraint is that the catalyst must return unperturbed and uncorrelated with the other subsystems. More precisely, we first upper bound the set of states to which a given initial state can thermodynamically evolve (the catalysable future) or from which it can evolve (the catalysable past) with the help of a strict catalyst. Secondly, we derive lower bounds on the dimensionality required for the existence of catalysts under thermal process, along with bounds on the catalyst's state preparation. Finally, we quantify the catalytic advantage in terms of the volume of the catalysable future and demonstrate its utility in an exemplary task of generating entanglement and cooling a quantum system using thermal resources.</description>

Abstract: Quantum communication networks are crucial for both secure communication and cryptographic networked tasks. Building quantum communication networks in a scalable and cost-effective way is essential for their widespread adoption, among which a stable and miniaturized high-quality quantum light source is a key component. Here, we establish a complete polarization entanglement-based fully connected network, which features an ultrabright integrated Bragg reflection waveguide quantum source, managed by an untrusted service provider, and a streamlined polarization analysis module, which requires only one single-photon detector for each end user. We perform a continuously working quantum entanglement distribution and create correlated bit strings between users. Within the framework of one-time universal hashing, we provide the first experimental implementation of source-independent quantum digital signatures using imperfect keys circumventing the necessity for private amplification. More importantly, we further beat the 1/3 fault-tolerance bound in Byzantine agreement, achieving unconditional security without relying on sophisticated techniques. Our results offer an affordable and practical route for addressing consensus challenges within the emerging quantum network landscape.</description>

Abstract: Explicit mathematical reconstructions of quantum networks play a significant role in developing quantum information science. However, tremendous parameter requirements and physical constraint implementations have become computationally non-ignorable encumbrances. In this work, we propose an efficient method for quantum network tomography by learning isometries on the Stiefel manifold. Tasks of reconstructing quantum networks are tackled by solving a series of unconstrained optimization problems with significantly fewer parameters. The stepwise isometry estimation shows the capability for providing information of the truncated quantum network while processing the tomography. Remarkably, this method enables the dimension-reduced quantum network tomography by reducing the ancillary dimensions of isometries with bounded error. As a result, our proposed method exhibits high accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the fundamental limit of quantum transduction via intraband entanglement</title>

Abstract: A quantum transducer converts an input signal to an output probe at a distant frequency band while maintaining the quantum information with high fidelity, which is crucial for quantum networking and distributed quantum sensing and computing. In terms of microwave-optical quantum transduction, the state-of-the-art quantum transducers suffer low transduction efficiency from weak nonlinear coupling, wherein increasing pump power to enhance efficiency inevitably leads to thermal noise from heating. Moreover, we reveal that the efficiency-bandwidth product of a cavity electro-optical or electro-optomechanical transducer is fundamentally limited by pump power and nonlinear coupling coefficient, irrespective of cavity engineering efforts. To overcome this fundamental limit, we propose to noiselessly boost the transduction efficiency by consuming intraband entanglement (e.g., microwave-microwave or optical-optical entanglement in the case of microwave-optical transduction). Via a squeezer-coupler-antisqueezer sandwich structure, the protocol enhances the transduction efficiency to unity in the ideal lossless case, given an arbitrarily weak pump and nonlinear coupling. In practical cavity systems, our entanglement-assisted protocol surpasses the non-assisted fundamental limit of the efficiency-bandwidth product and reduces the threshold cooperativity for positive quantum capacity by a factor proportional to two-mode squeezing gain. Given a fixed cooperativity, our approach increases the broadband quantum capacity by orders of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: The ability for quantum and conventional networks to operate in the same optical fibers would aid the deployment of quantum network technology on a large scale. Quantum teleportation is a fundamental operation in quantum networking, but has yet to be demonstrated in fibers populated with high-power conventional optical signals. Here we report to the best of our knowledge the first demonstration of quantum teleportation over fibers carrying conventional telecommunications traffic. Quantum state transfer is achieved over a 30.2-km fiber carrying 400-Gbps C-band classical traffic with a Bell state measurement performed at the fiber midpoint. To protect quantum fidelity from spontaneous Raman scattering noise, we use optimal O-band quantum channels, narrow spectro-temporal filtering, and multi-photon coincidence detection. Fidelity is shown to be well maintained with an elevated C-band classical power of 18.7 dBm, which could support multiple classical channels totaling many terabits/s aggregate data rates. These results show the feasibility of advanced quantum and classical network applications operating within a unified fiber infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Complex Stochastic Optimal Control Foundation of Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15964v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies extend the use of the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation to include complex variables for deriving quantum mechanical equations. However, these studies often assume that it is valid to apply the HJB equation directly to complex numbers, an approach that overlooks the fundamental problem of comparing complex numbers when finding optimal controls. This paper explores the application of the HJB equation in the context of complex variables. It provides an in-depth investigation of the stochastic movement of quantum particles within the framework of stochastic optimal control theory. We obtain the complex diffusion coefficient in the stochastic equation of motion using the Cauchy-Riemann theorem, considering that the particle's stochastic movement is described by two perfectly correlated real and imaginary stochastic processes. During the development of the covariant form of the HJB equation, we demonstrate that if the temporal stochastic increments of the two processes are perfectly correlated, then the spatial stochastic increments must be perfectly anti-correlated, and vice versa. The diffusion coefficient we derive has a form that enables the linearization of the HJB equation. The method for linearizing the HJB equation, along with the subsequent derivation of the Dirac equation, is developed in our previous work [V. Yordanov, Scientific Reports 14, 6507 (2024)]. These insights deepen our understanding of quantum dynamics and enhance the application of stochastic optimal control theory to quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Joint estimation of noise and nonlinearity in Kerr systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address characterization of lossy and dephasing channels in the presence of self-Kerr interaction using coherent probes. In particular, we investigate the ultimate bounds to precision in the joint estimation of loss and nonlinearity and of dephasing and nonlinearity. To this aim, we evaluate the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM), and compare the symmetric quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCR) to the bound obtained with Fisher information matrix (FIM) of feasible quantum measurements, i.e., homodyne and double-homodyne detection. For lossy Kerr channels, our results show the loss characterization is enhanced in the presence of Kerr nonlinearity, especially in the relevant limit of small losses and low input energy, whereas the estimation of nonlinearity itself is unavoidably degraded by the presence of loss. In the low energy regime, homodyne detection of a suitably optimized quadrature represents a nearly optimal measurement. The Uhlmann curvature does not vanish, therefore loss and nonlinearity can be jointly estimated only with the addition of intrinsic quantum noise. For dephasing Kerr channels, the QFIs of the two parameters are independent of the nonlinearity, and therefore no enhancement is observed. Homodyne and double-homodyne detection are suboptimal for the estimation of dephasing and nearly optimal for nonlinearity. Also in this case, the Uhlmann curvature is nonzero, proving that the parameters cannot be jointly estimated with maximum precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) are explored to improve quantum sensing and weak signal detection. Changes in the ground state at a QPT enhance indicators of parameter estimation, such as the quantum Fischer information. Here, we show that in systems that lack a QPT, quantum sensitivity can still be enhanced due to excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs). Our analysis is done for a Kerr parametric oscillator with two ESQPTs associated with the onset of a hyperbolic point and a local maximum in the classical limit. These points change the system's phase space structure, which results in the amplification of the quantum Fisher information and the squeezing of the uncertainty in position at specific values of the control parameter. Our study showcases the relationship between non-conventional quantum critical phenomena and quantum sensing with potential experimental applications in exciton-polariton condensates and superconducting circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Erasure qubits offer a promising avenue toward reducing the overhead of quantum error correction (QEC) protocols. However, they require additional operations, such as erasure checks, that may add extra noise and increase runtime of QEC protocols. To assess the benefits provided by erasure qubits, we focus on the performance of the surface code as a quantum memory. In particular, we analyze various erasure check schedules, find the correctable regions in the phase space of error parameters and probe the subthreshold scaling of the logical error rate. We then consider a realization of erasure qubits in the superconducting hardware architectures via dual-rail qubits. We use the standard transmon-based implementation of the surface code as the performance benchmark. Our results indicate that QEC protocols with erasure qubits can outperform the ones with state-of-the-art transmons, even in the absence of precise information about the locations of erasure errors.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition in the Quantum Capacity of Quantum Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite years of extensive research into quantum channels, determining their capacities remains an extraordinarily challenging problem, even though it is of fundamental importance. Establishing precise lower and upper bounds for these capacities has proven to be difficult, making it essential to at least identify conditions under which the quantum capacity of a channel vanishes. In this paper, we prove that the quantum capacity of any quantum channel $\Lambda$, when contaminated by white noise, as described by $\Lambda_x (\rho):=(1-x)\Lambda(\rho)+\frac{x}{d}I_d$ becomes zero when $x\geq \frac{1}{2}$. To prove this, we first show that the depolarizing channel with $x\geq \frac{1}{2}$ is anti-degradable, and we provide the exact form of the channel that connects it to its complement. The zero-capacity region we establish for this channel is significantly larger than the previously known entanglement-binding threshold, which depends on dimension and is given by $x\geq \frac{d}{d+1}$.</description>

Abstract: Logical qubits can be protected against environmental noise by encoding them into a highly entangled state of many physical qubits and actively intervening in the dynamics with stabilizer measurements. In this work, we numerically optimize the rate of these interventions: the number of stabilizer measurement rounds for a logical qubit encoded in a surface code patch and idling for a given time. We model the environmental noise on the circuit level, including gate errors, readout errors, amplitude and phase damping. We find, qualitatively, that the optimal number of stabilizer measurement rounds is getting smaller for better qubits and getting larger for better gates or larger code sizes. We discuss the implications of our results to some of the leading architectures, superconducting qubits, and neutral atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Petz map has been established as a quantum version of the Bayes' rule. It unifies the conceptual belief update rule of a quantum state observed after a forward quantum process, and the operational reverse process that brings the final state to a recovered state equal to the updated belief, counteracting the forward process. Here, we study a higher-order generalization of the quantum Bayes' rule by considering a quantum process undergoing a quantum supermap. For a few families of initial beliefs, we show that a similar unification is possible -- the rules to update the belief of quantum channels can be implemented via a "reverse" quantum supermap, which we call the retrodiction supermap, allowing for applications such as error correction in quantum cloud computing. Analytical solutions are provided for those families, while a recipe for arbitrary initial beliefs is yet to be found.</description>

      <title>A dissipation-induced superradiant transition in a strontium cavity-QED system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), emitters and a resonator are coupled together to enable precise studies of quantum light-matter interactions. Over the past few decades, this has led to a variety of quantum technologies such as more precise inertial sensors, clocks, memories, controllable qubits, and quantum simulators. Furthermore, the intrinsically dissipative nature of cavity QED platforms makes them a natural testbed for exploring driven-dissipative phenomena in open quantum systems as well as equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase transitions in quantum optics. One such model, the so-called cooperative resonance fluorescence (CRF) model, concerns the behavior of coherently driven emitters in the presence of collective dissipation (superradiance). Despite tremendous interest, this model has yet to be realized in a clean experimental system. Here we provide an observation of the continuous superradiant phase transition predicted in the CRF model using an ensemble of ultracold $^{88}$Sr atoms coupled to a driven high-finesse optical cavity on a long-lived optical transition. Below a critical drive, atoms quickly reach a steady state determined by the self-balancing of the drive and the collective dissipation. The steady state possesses a macroscopic dipole moment and corresponds to a superradiant phase. Above a critical drive strength, the atoms undergo persistent Rabi-like oscillations until other decoherence processes kick in. In fact, our platform also allows us to witness the change of this phase transition from second to first order induced by single-particle spontaneous emission, which pushes the system towards a different steady state. Our observations are a first step towards finer control of driven-dissipative systems, which have been predicted to generate quantum states that can be harnessed for quantum information processing and in particular quantum sensing.</description>

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have shown potential for quantum advantage with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices for quantum machine learning (QML). However, given the high cost and limited availability of quantum resources, delegating VQAs via cloud networks is a more practical solution for clients with limited quantum capabilities. Recently, Shingu et al.[Physical Review A, 105, 022603 (2022)] proposed a variational secure cloud quantum computing protocol, utilizing ancilla-driven quantum computation (ADQC) for cloud-based VQAs with minimal quantum resource consumption. However, their protocol lacks verifiability, which exposes it to potential malicious behaviors by the server. Additionally, channel loss requires frequent re-delegation as the size of the delegated variational circuit grows, complicating verification due to increased circuit complexity. This paper introduces a new protocol to address these challenges and enhance both verifiability and tolerance to channel loss in cloud-based VQAs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multimodal contrastive learning utilizing a quantum encoder to integrate EEG (electroencephalogram) and image data. This groundbreaking attempt explores the integration of quantum encoders within the traditional multimodal learning framework. By leveraging the unique properties of quantum computing, our method enhances the representation learning capabilities, providing a robust framework for analyzing time series and visual information concurrently. We demonstrate that the quantum encoder effectively captures intricate patterns within EEG signals and image features, facilitating improved contrastive learning across modalities. This work opens new avenues for integrating quantum computing with multimodal data analysis, particularly in applications requiring simultaneous interpretation of temporal and visual data.</description>

      <title>On Yang-Mills Stability Bounds and Plaquette Field Generating Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.07376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Yang-Mills (YM) QFT with group $U(N)$. We take a finite lattice regularization $\Lambda\subset a\mathbb Z^d$, $d = 2,3,4$, with $a\in (0,1]$ and $L$ (even) sites on a side. Each bond has a gauge variable $U\in U(N)$. The Wilson partition function is used and the action is a sum of gauge-invariant plaquette (minimal square) actions times $a^{d-4}/g^2$, $g^2\in(0,g_0^2]$, $0&lt;g_0^2&lt;\infty$. A plaquette action has the product of its four variables and the partition function is the integral of the Boltzmann factor with a product of $U(N)$ Haar measures. Formally, when $a\searrow 0$ our action gives the usual YM continuum action. For free and periodic b.c., we show thermodynamic and stability bounds for a normalized partition function of any YM model defined as before, with bound constants independent of $L,a,g$. The subsequential thermodynamic and ultraviolet limit of the free energy exist. To get our bounds, the Weyl integration formula is used and, to obtain the lower bound, a new quadratic global upper bound on the action is derived. We define gauge-invariant physical and scaled plaquette fields. Using periodic b.c. and the multi-reflection method, we bound the generating function of $r-$scaled plaquette correlations. A normalized generating function for the correlations of $r$ scaled fields is absolutely bounded, for any $L,a,g$, and location of the external fields. From the joint analyticity on the field sources, correlations are bounded. The bounds are new and we get $a^{-d}$ for the physical two-plaquette correlation at coincident points. Comparing with the $a\searrow 0$ singularity of the physical derivative massless scalar free field two-point correlation, this is a measure of ultraviolet asymptotic freedom in the context of a lattice QFT. Our methods are an alternative and complete the more traditional ones.</description>

      <title>Transverse Recoil Imprinted on Free-Electron Radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phenomena of free-electron X-ray radiation are treated almost exclusively with classical electrodynamics, despite the intrinsic interaction being that of quantum electrodynamics. The lack of quantumness arises from the vast disparity between the electron energy and the much smaller photon energy, resulting in a small cross-section that makes quantum effects negligible. Here we identify a fundamentally distinct phenomenon of electron radiation that bypasses this energy disparity, and thus displays extremely strong quantum features. This phenomenon arises when free-electron transverse scattering occurs during the radiation process, creating entanglement between each transversely recoiled electron and the photons it emitted. This phenomenon profoundly modifies the characteristics of free-electron radiation mediated by crystals, compared to conventional classical analysis and even previous quantum analysis. We also analyze conditions to detect this phenomenon using low-emittance electron beams and high-resolution X-ray spectrometers. These quantum radiation features could guide the development of compact coherent X-ray sources facilitated by nanophotonics and quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of SU(3) Lattice Yang Mills Theory at Leading Order in Large N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10265v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of the dynamics of QCD have been limited by the complexities of mapping the continuous gauge fields onto quantum computers. By parametrizing the gauge invariant Hilbert space in terms of plaquette degrees of freedom, we show how the Hilbert space and interactions can be expanded in inverse powers of N_c. At leading order in this expansion, the Hamiltonian simplifies dramatically, both in the required size of the Hilbert space as well as the type of interactions involved. Adding a truncation of the resulting Hilbert space in terms of local energy states we give explicit constructions that allow simple representations of SU(3) gauge fields on qubits and qutrits. This formulation allows a simulation of the real time dynamics of a SU(3) lattice gauge theory on a 5x5 and 8x8 lattice on ibm_torino with a CNOT depth of 113.</description>

      <title>Structural Stability Hypothesis of Dual Unitary Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Having spectral correlations that, over small enough energy scales, are described by random matrix theory is regarded as the most general defining feature of quantum chaotic systems as it applies in the many-body setting and away from any semiclassical limit. Although this property is extremely difficult to prove analytically for generic many-body systems, a rigorous proof has been achieved for dual-unitary circuits -- a special class of local quantum circuits that remain unitary upon swapping space and time. Here we consider the fate of this property when moving from dual-unitary to generic quantum circuits focussing on the \emph{spectral form factor}, i.e., the Fourier transform of the two-point correlation. We begin with a numerical survey that, in agreement with previous studies, suggests that there exists a finite region in parameter space where dual-unitary physics is stable and spectral correlations are still described by random matrix theory, although up to a maximal quasienergy scale. To explain these findings, we develop a perturbative expansion: it recovers the random matrix theory predictions, provided the terms occurring in perturbation theory obey a relatively simple set of assumptions. We then provide numerical evidence and a heuristic analytical argument supporting these assumptions.</description>

      <title>Quantum 2D Liouville Path-Integral Is a Sum over Geometries in AdS$_3$ Einstein Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a renowned solution of the modular bootstrap that defines the UV complete quantum Liouville theory. We triangulate the path-integral of this Liouville CFT on any 2D surface $\mathcal{M}$, by proposing a shrinkable boundary condition for this special CFT that allows small holes to close, analogous to the proposal in rational CFTs [1-3]. This is essentially a tensor network that admits an interpretation of a state-sum of a 3D topological theory constructed with quantum 6j symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, and it reduces to a sum over 3D geometries weighted by the Einstein-Hilbert action to leading order in large $c$. The boundary conditions of quantum Liouville theory specifies a very special sum over bulk geometries to faithfully reproduce the CFT path-integral. The triangulation coincides with producing a network of geodesics in the AdS bulk, which can be changed making use of the pentagon identity and orthogonality condition satisfied by the 6j symbols, and arranged into a precise holographic tensor network.</description>

      <title>On the measurements in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this essay, we argue that certain aspects of the measurement require revision in Quantum Gravity. Using entropic arguments, we propose that the number of measurement outcomes and the accuracy (or the range) of the measurement are limited by the entropy of the black hole associated with the observer scale. This also implies the necessity of modifying the algebra of commutation relationships to ensure a finite representation of observables, changing the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in this manner.</description>

      <title>Simulating nonlinear optical processes on a superconducting quantum device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating plasma physics on quantum computers is difficult because most problems of interest are nonlinear, but quantum computers are not naturally suitable for nonlinear operations. In weakly nonlinear regimes, plasma problems can be modeled as wave-wave interactions. In this paper, we develop a quantization approach to convert nonlinear wave-wave interaction problems to Hamiltonian simulation problems. We demonstrate our approach using two qubits on a superconducting device. Unlike a photonic device, a superconducting device does not naturally have the desired interactions in its native Hamiltonian. Nevertheless, Hamiltonian simulations can still be performed by decomposing required unitary operations into native gates. To improve experimental results, we employ a range of error mitigation techniques. Apart from readout error mitigation, we use randomized compilation to transform undiagnosed coherent errors into well-behaved stochastic Pauli channels. Moreover, to compensate for stochastic noise, we rescale exponentially decaying probability amplitudes using rates measured from cycle benchmarking. We carefully consider how different choices of product-formula algorithms affect the overall error and show how a trade-off can be made to best utilize limited quantum resources. This study provides an example of how plasma problems may be solved on near-term quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Semi-Classical Subspaces, The No Synchronization Law, and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper looks at the intersection of algorithmic information theory and physics, namely quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and black holes. We discuss theorems which characterize the barrier between the quantum world and the classical realm. The notion of a ``semi-classical subspace'' is introduced. Partial signals and partial cloning can be executed on quantum states in semi-classical subspaces. The No Synchronization Law is detailed, which says separate and isolated physical systems evolving over time cannot have thermodynamic algorithmic entropies that are in synch. We look at future work involving the Kolmogorov complexity of black holes.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Excitation by Near-Resonant Electron Transition in $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical considerations are made for the nuclear excitation from the ground state to the 8 eV $^{229m}$Th isomer via near-resonant electron transitions in Sb-like ($q=39+$) thorium ions. The energy of the first excited atomic state ($J=7/2$) in the $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ ion is estimated to be 8.308$\pm$0.011 eV, which is very close to the new reference value for the $^{229m}$Th nuclear isomer energy, 8.338$\pm$0.024 eV [Kraemer et al., Nature 617, 706 (2023)]. It was found that within the uncertainty range of both atomic and nuclear excitation energies, the rate of nuclear excitation by electron transition can vary by more than 20 orders of magnitude. Our results indicate that the upper theoretical limit for the $^{229m}$Th isomer excitation rate reaches an enormous value of $1.05\times10^{16}$ s$^{-1}$ at resonance ($\Delta=0$ meV). Additionally, it was shown that using an electron beam ion trap (EBIT), the production of the $^{229}$Th isomer can reach rates ranging from tenths to approximately $6\times10^{19}$ s$^{-1}$. Thus, EBIT experimental studies could serve as an extremely sensitive tool for the independent verification of the excitation energy of the isomeric state in the $^{229}$Th nucleus.</description>

      <title>Emergent Gauge Fields and the "Choi-Spin Liquids" in Steady States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the steady states of the evolution of a class of Lindbladians can be mapped to the "Gutzwiller projected" wave functions in the doubled Hilbert space, i.e. the representation of the density matrix through the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism. A Gutzwiller projection is a standard approach of constructing spin liquid states. For example, if one starts with a gapless free fermion pure quantum state, the steady state of the Lindbladian evolution in the doubled Hilbert space is an analog of an algebraic spin liquid, which is dubbed the "Choi-spin liquid". The Choi-spin liquid can also be produced through strong measurement without post-selection. Predictions of the Choi-spin liquids can be made based on the understanding on spin liquids, and we will design the experimental protocol to test these predictions. If one starts with a Chern insulator, theory predicts that the steady state of the Lindbladian evolution is expected to have a spontaneous "strong-to-weak" U(1) symmetry breaking, which corresponds to a superconductor in the doubled Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Gravity from entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime to a density matrix. The matter fields curve spacetime, defining a metric induced by the matter fields. The entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained reduce to the Einstein equations in the regime of low coupling. To simplify the theory, exclusively scalar matter fields are considered. This theoretical framework can be extended in different directions, for instance by including fermionic matter fields and gauge fields. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity.</description>
