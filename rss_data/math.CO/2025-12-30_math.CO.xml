      <title>On the number of words of $N=3 \,M$ letters with a three-letter alphabet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we address the well-known problem of counting the number of $3M$-letter words that can be formed from a three-letter alphabet by decomposing it into four possible cases based on its remainder when divided by three. The solution to the problem also gives us some sums of trinomial coefficients.</description>

      <title>Spectral supersaturation for color-critical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is color-critical if it contains an edge whose deletion reduces its chromatic number. This class of graphs, including cliques and odd cycles, plays a central role in extremal graph theory. In this paper, following an influential line of research initiated by Bollob\'as-Nikiforov, we study the spectral supersaturation problem for color-critical graphs. Let $T_{n,r}$ be the $r$-partite Tur\'an graph, let $\mathcal{T}_{n,r,q}$ denote the family of graphs obtained from $T_{n,r}$ by adding $q$ edges, and let $\lambda(G)$ be the spectral radius of a graph $G$. We first prove that for any color-critical graph $F$ with chromatic number $r+1$, there exists $\delta_F &gt; 0$ such that for sufficiently large $n$ and all $1 \leq q \leq \delta_F \sqrt{n}$, any $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\lambda(G) \ge \min_{T \in \mathcal{T}_{n,r,q}} \lambda(T)$ contains at least $q \cdot c(n,F)$ copies of $F$, where $c(n,F)$ denotes the minimum number of copies of $F$ created by adding a single edge to $T_{n,r}$; moreover, any extremal graph $G$ must belong to $ \mathcal{T}_{n,r,q}$.Next, we prove a spectral supersaturation result for the analogous condition $\lambda(G) \ge \max_{T \in \mathcal{T}_{n,r,q}} \lambda(T)$, valid for all $1 \leq q \leq \delta_F n$. Together, these results provide a complete resolution to a problem proposed by Ning-Zhai, and establish a spectral counterpart to the well-known results of Mubayi and Pikhurko-Yilma in the extremal supersaturation setting. A notable feature of our first result is that the restriction $q = O(\sqrt{n})$ is tight up to a constant factor, in contrast to the linear bounds provided by other settings discussed above. As applications, we extend a result of Liu-Mubayi, and solve a related conjecture by Li-Lu-Peng.</description>

      <title>Distinctive power and comparability of Harary polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a graph property. A $\mathcal{P}$-coloring with at most $k$ colors is a coloring of the vertices of a simple graph $G$ such that each color class induces a graph in $\mathcal{P}$. Harary polynomials are generalizations of the chromatic polynomial for simple graphs based on conditional colorings. We denote by $\chi_{\mathcal{P}}(G; k)$ the number of $\mathcal{P}$-colorings of $G$ with at most $k$ colors. $\chi_{\mathcal{P}}(G; k)$ is a polynomial in $\Z[k]$. A first paper studying Harary polynomials systematically was published in 2021 by O.Herscovici, J.A. Makowsky and V. Rakita. It studies under which conditions on $\mathcal{P}$ is $\chi_{\mathcal{P}}(G; k)$ definable in Monadic Second Order Logic and under which conditions is $\chi_{\mathcal{P}}(G; k)$ a chromatic invariant. Let $\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{Q}$ be two graph properties. Two graphs $G, H$ are $\mathcal{P}$-mates if $\chi_{\mathcal{P}}(G; k) = \chi_{\mathcal{P}}(H; k)$. $\chi_{\mathcal{Q}}$ is at least as distinctive as $\chi_{\mathcal{P}}$, $\chi_{\mathcal{P}} \leq \chi_{\mathcal{Q}}$, if for all graphs $G, H$ we have that $\chi_{\mathcal{Q}}(G; k) = \chi_{\mathcal{Q}}(H; k)$ implies $\chi_{\mathcal{P}}(G; k) = \chi_{\mathcal{P}}(H; k)$. In this paper we study under which conditions on $\mathcal{P}$ are there any (many) $\mathcal{P}$-mates and under which conditions on $\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{Q}$ is $\chi_{\mathcal{Q}}$ is at least as distinctive as $\chi_{\mathcal{P}}$.</description>

      <title>On the growth rate of the Stanley-Wilf limit of blockable permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a permutation $\pi$, let $\text{Av}_n(\pi)$ be the number of permutations of length $n$ that avoid $\pi$ as a subpermutation. The celebrated resolution of the Stanley-Wilf conjecture by Marcus and Tardos confirmed that the limit $L(\pi) = \lim_{n \to \infty} |\text{Av}_n(\pi)|^{1/n}$ exists. A central and challenging question concerns the behavior of $L(\pi)$ as a function of the pattern length $|\pi|$. While Fox proved that $L(\pi)$ is exponential in $|\pi|$ for almost all permutations, it is known that $L(\pi)$ grows polynomially for specific structural classes. For instance, $L(\pi)$ is known to be quadratic in $|\pi|$ when $\pi$ is a monotone or a layered permutation. In this paper, we address this question for {\it blockable} permutations $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Tiling Triangles with $2\pi/3$ Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a question of Erd\"{o}s and inquiries by Beeson and Laczkovich, we explore the possible $N$ for which a triangle $T$ can tile into $N$ congruent copies of a triangle $R$. The \emph{reptile} cases (where $T$ is similar to $R$) and the \emph{commensurable-angles} cases (where all angles of $R$ are rational multiples of $\pi$) are well-understood. We tackle the most interesting remaining case, which is when $R$ contains an angle of $2\pi/3$ and when $T$ is one of $6$ ``sporadic'' specific triangles, of which only $2$ were known to have constructions. For each of these, we create a family of constructions and conjecture that they are the only possible $N$ that occur for these triangles.</description>

      <title>Tilings of $\mathcal{H}_{q}(n,w)$ with optimal $(n,d,w)_{q}$-codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metric space $\mathcal{H}_{q}(n,w)$ is the set of all words of length $n$ with weight $w$ over the alphabet $\mathbb{Z}_{q}$, under the Hamming distance metric. A $q$-ary constant-weight code, as a nonempty subset of $\mathcal{H}_{q}(n,w)$, has always been a fundamental topic in coding theory. This paper investigates the tiling problem of $\mathcal{H}_{q}(n,w)$ with optimal $(n,d,w)_{q}$-codes, simply denoted by $\mathrm{TOC}_{q}(n,d,w)$, meaning a partition of $\mathcal{H}_{q}(n,w)$ into mutually disjoint optimal $q$-ary constant-weight codes with distance $d$. When the distance $d$ is odd, we investigate large sets of generalized Steiner systems. When $d$ is even, we define large sets of generalized maximum H-packings. We present several general construction approaches for generating $\mathrm{TOC}_{q}(n,d,w)$s via $t$-resolvable Steiner systems and almost-regular edge-colorings of complete hypergraphs. For the cases $d=2$ and $d=2w$, we completely resolve the existence problem of $\mathrm{TOC}_{q}(n,d,w)$s for all parameters $q,n$ and $w$. Particularly, we pay attention to tilings for weight three. For binary case and weight three, the existence problem of $\mathrm{TOC}_{2}(n,d,3)$s is totally resolved. For specific alphabet size $q\ge 3$, we obtain many infinite families of $\mathrm{TOC}_{q}(n,d,3)$s for distances $d=3,4,5$.</description>

      <title>Graphs with large maximum forcing number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$ with order $2n$ and a perfect matching, let $f(G)$ and $F(G)$ denote the minimum and maximum forcing number of $G$ respectively. Then $0\leq f(G)\leq F(G)\leq n-1$. Liu and Zhang [10] ever proposed a conjecture: $e(G)\geq \frac{n^2}{n-F(G)}$, where $e(G)$ denotes the number of edges of $G$. In this paper we confirm this conjecture and obtain $F(G)\leq n-\frac{n^2}{e(G)}$. If $F(G)=n-1$, Liu and Zhang [9] proved that any two perfect matchings of $G$ can be obtained from each other by a series of matching switches along 4-cycles. If $G$ is bipartite and $F(G)\geq n-k$, $1\leq k\leq n-1$, we show that any two perfect matchings of $G$ can be obtained from each other by a series of matching switches along even cycles of length at most $2(k+1)$. Finally, we ask whether $f(G)\geq \lceil\frac{n}{k}\rceil-1$ holds for such bipartite graphs $G$, and give positive answers for the cases $k=1,2$. Further we show all minimum forcing numbers of the bipartite graphs $G$ of order $2n$ and with $F(G)=n-2$ form an integer interval $[\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor, n-2]$.</description>

      <title>The Grothendieck Group of the Variety of Spanning Line Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Grothendieck group of the variety $X_{n,k}$ of spanning line configurations introduced by Pawlowski--Rhoades [arXiv:1711.08301] as a geometric model for the generalized coinvariant algebra $R_{n,k}$. Our first result is a localization statement in $K$-theory for the complements of cell closures in smooth cellular varieties. Combining with the Fulton--Lascoux degeneracy loci formula, we prove that $K_0(X_{n,k})$ is canonically isomorphic to $R_{n,k}$, extending classical isomorphisms for the flag variety. We next identify the classes of the Pawlowski--Rhoades varieties with Grothendieck polynomials associated to words $w \in [k]^n$. Motivated by this identification, we develop models of classical and bumpless pipe dreams for words. We show that Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials of words are monomial-weight generating functions for these pipe dreams, extending the classical story from permutations to words and ordered set partitions.</description>

      <title>Proper conflict-free choosability of planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proper conflict-free coloring of a graph is a proper vertex coloring wherein each non-isolated vertex's open neighborhood contains at least one color appearing exactly once. For a non-negative integer $k$, a graph $G$ is said to be proper conflict-free (degree+$k$)-choosable if given any list assignment $L$ for $G$ where $|L(v)| = d(v) + k$ holds for every vertex $v \in V(G)$, there exists a proper conflict-free coloring $\phi$ of $G$ such that $\phi(v) \in L(v)$ for all $v \in V(G)$. Recently, Kashima, \v{S}krekovski, and Xu proposed two related conjectures on proper conflict-free choosability: the first asserts the existence of an absolute constant $k$ such that every graph is proper conflict-free (degree+$k$)-choosable, while the second strengthens this claim by restricting to connected graphs other than the cycle of length 5 and reducing the constant to $k=2$. In this paper, we confirm the second conjecture for three graph classes: $K_4$-minor-free graphs with maximum degree at most 4, outer-1-planar graphs with maximum degree at most 4, and planar graphs with girth at least 12; we also confirm the first conjecture for these same graph classes, in addition to all outer-1-planar graphs (without degree constraints). Moreover, we prove that planar graphs with girth at least 12 and outer-1-planar graphs are proper conflict-free $6$-choosable.</description>

      <title>Fast algorithm for $S$-packing coloring of Halin graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by frequency assignment problems in wireless broadcast networks, Goddard, Hedetniemi, Hedetniemi, Harris, and Rall introduced the notion of $S$-packing coloring in 2008. Given a non-decreasing sequence $S = (s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k)$ of positive integers, an $S$-packing coloring of a graph $G$ is a partition of its vertex set into $k$ subsets $\{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\}$ such that for each $1 \leq i \leq k$, the distance between any two distinct vertices $u, v \in V_i$ is at least $s_i + 1$. In this paper, we study the $S$-packing coloring problem for Halin graphs with maximum degree $\Delta \leq 5$. Specifically, we present a linear-time algorithm that constructs a $(1,1,2,2,2)$-packing coloring for any Halin graph satisfying $\Delta \leq 5$. It is worth noting that there are Halin graphs that are not $(1,2,2,2)$-packing colorable.</description>

      <title>Exact rainbow numbers of cycle-related graphs in multi-hubbed wheels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rainbow number ${\rm rb}(G, H)$ is the minimum number of colors $k$ for which any edge-coloring of $G$ with at least $k$ colors guarantees a rainbow subgraph isomorphic to $H$. The rainbow number has many applications in diverse fields such as wireless communication networks, cryptography, bioinformatics, and social network analysis. In this paper, we determine the exact rainbow number $\mathrm{rb}(G, H)$ where $G$ is a multi-hubbed wheel graph $W_d(s)$, defined as the join of $s$ isolated vertices and a cycle $C_d$ of length $d$ (i.e., $W_d(s) = \overline{K_s} + C_d$), and $H = \theta_{t,\ell}$ represents a cycle $C_t$ of length $t$ with $0 \leq \ell \leq t-3$ chords emanating from a common vertex, by establishing \[ {\rm rb}(W_{d}(s), \theta_{t,\ell}) = \begin{cases} \left\lfloor \dfrac{2t - 5}{t - 2}d \right\rfloor + 1, &amp; \text{if } \ell=t-3,~s = 1 \text{ and } t\ge 4, \\[10pt] \left\lfloor \dfrac{3t-10}{t - 3}d \right\rfloor + 1, &amp; \text{if } \ell=t-3,~s = 2\text{ and } t\ge 6,\\[10pt] \left\lfloor \dfrac{(s + 1)t - (3s + 4)}{t - 3}d \right\rfloor + 1, &amp; \text{if } \ell=t-3,~s \geq 3\text{ and } t\ge 7,\\[10pt] \left\lfloor \dfrac{2t - 7}{t - 3}d \right\rfloor + 1, &amp; \text{if } s = 1 \text{ and } t\ge \max\{5,\ell+4\}, \end{cases} \] when $d\geq 3t-5$, with all bounds for the parameter $t$ presented here being tight. This addresses the problems proposed by Jakhar, Budden, and Moun (2025), which involve investigating the rainbow numbers of large cycles and large chorded cycles in wheel graphs (specifically corresponding to the cases in our framework where $s=1$ and $\ell\in \{0,1\}$). Furthermore, it completely determines the rainbow numbers of cycles of arbitrary length in large wheel graphs, thereby generalizing a result of Lan, Shi, and Song (2019).</description>

      <title>The Hilton-Milner type results of $(k, \ell)$-sum-free sets in $\mathbb F_p^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a prime $p \equiv 2 \pmod 3$, it is well known that the largest sum-free subsets of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ have size $\frac{p+1}{3} p^{n-1}$, and the extremal sets must be a cuboid of the form $\{\frac{p+1}{3}, \frac{p+1}{3}+1, \ldots, \frac{2p-1}{3}\} \times \mathbb{F}_p^{n-1}$ up to isomorphism. Recently, Reiner and Zotova proved a Hilton--Milner type stability result showing that for large $p$, any sum-free set not contained in the extremal cuboid has size at most $\frac{p-2}{3} p^{n-1}$, and all possible structures attaining this bound were classified.
  In this paper, we develop a general Hilton--Milner theory for $(k,\ell)$-sum-free sets in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ for $k &gt; \ell \ge 1$. We determine the maximum size of such sets for all $p \equiv \mu \pmod{k+\ell}$ with $2 \le \mu \le k+\ell-1$, and show that the extremal configurations are precisely $\lceil (\mu-1)/2 \rceil$ non-isomorphic cuboids. Beyond the extremal regime, we prove sharp Hilton--Milner type stability results showing that, for all sufficiently large $p$, a $(k,\ell)$-sum-free set not contained in any of these extremal cuboids is uniformly bounded away from the maximum by a gap of order $p^{n-1}$, and we determine the full structure of all sets achieving this second-best bound in several broad parameter ranges. In particular, when $2 \le \mu \le k+\ell-3$ (which is tight), only two structural types occur for all $k+\ell \ge 5$; and when $\mu = 2$ or $3$, we obtain a complete classification for all $k &gt; \ell \ge 1$.
  Our arguments combine additive combinatorics and Fourier-analytic methods, and make use of recent progress toward the long-standing $3k-4$ conjecture, highlighting new connections between inverse additive number theory and extremal problems over finite vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Improved Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa inequalities for odd cycles in planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an undirected graph, the odd cycle packing number is the maximum number of pairwise vertex-disjoint odd cycles. The odd cycle transversal number is the minimum number of vertices that hit every odd cycle. The maximum ratio between transversal and packing number is called Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa ratio. We show that in planar graphs, this ratio does not exceed 4. This improves on the previously best known bound of 6 by Kr\'al', Sereni and Stacho.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steinitz's theorem states that if a point $a \in \mathrm{int\,conv\,} X$ for a set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, then $X$ contains a subset $Y$ of size at most $2d$ such that $a \in \mathrm{int\,conv\,}Y$. The bound $2d$ is best possible here. We prove the colourful version of this theorem and characterize the cases when exactly $2d$ sets are needed.</description>

      <title>Lov\'asz--Saks--Schrijver Ideals and the Irreducible Components of the Variety of Orthogonal Representations of a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite simple graph $G$ and a positive integer $d$, one can associate to $G$ the Lov\'asz--Saks--Schrijver ideal $L_{G}(d)$, an ideal generated by quadratic polynomials coming from orthogonality conditions. The corresponding variety $\mathbb{V}(L_{G}(d))$, denoted $\mathrm{OR}_{d}(\overline{G})$, is the variety of orthogonal representations of the complement graph $\overline{G}$: its points are maps from the vertex set of $G$ to $\mathbb{K}^{d}$ that send adjacent vertices of $G$ to orthogonal vectors. In this paper we study the irreducible decomposition of $\mathrm{OR}_{d}(\overline{G})$ and the primary decomposition of $L_{G}(d)$. Our main focus is the case in which $G$ is a forest. Under this assumption, we determine the irreducible components of $\mathrm{OR}_{d}(\overline{G})$, compute their dimensions, and describe their defining equations, thereby obtaining the primary decomposition of $L_{G}(d)$. The key ingredient is a matroid-theoretic framework in which we associate to every forest $G$ a paving matroid $\mathcal{M}(G)$.</description>

      <title>A solution to Godsil's conjecture on the edge-connectivity of graphs in association schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is called equiarboreal if the number of spanning trees containing a given edge in $G$ is independent of the choice of edge. In [Combinatorica 1(2) (1981) 163--167], Godsil proved that any graph which is a colour class in an association scheme is equiarboreal, and further conjectured that the edge-connectivity of a connected graph which is a colour class in an association scheme equals its vertex degree. In this paper, we confirm this long-standing conjecture. More generally, we prove an even stronger result that the edge-connectivity of a connected regular equiarboreal graph equals its degree by combinatorial and electrical network approaches. As a consequence, we show that every connected regular equiarboreal graph on an even number of vertices has a perfect matching.</description>

      <title>On subdivisions of the permutahedron and flags of lattice path matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript we study the subdivisions of the permutahedron $\Pi_n$ into two subpolytopes corresponding to flags of positroids, which are in particular flags of lattice path matroids (LPFMs). A subpolytope $P_{[u,v]}$ of $\Pi_n$ is a Bruhat Interval Polytope (BIP) if $P_{[u,v]}$ is the convex hull of all the permutations (viewed as points in $\RR^n$) in the interval $[u,v]$ in the Bruhat order of $\S_n$. We show that the coarsest subdivisions we obtain into LPFMs are the only subdivisions of $\Pi_n$ via hyperplane splits, into subpolytopes corresponding to BIPs. More specifically, we describe the hyperplanes whose intersection with $\Pi_n$ give rise to BIPs. Hence, these subdivisions are polytopes coming from points in the complete nonnegative flag variety.</description>

      <title>The codegree Tur\'an density of tight cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The codegree Tur\'an density $\gamma(F)$ of a $k$-uniform hypergraph $F$ is the minimum real number $\gamma \ge 0$ such that every $k$-uniform hypergraph on sufficiently many $n$ vertices, in which every set of $k-1$ vertices is contained in at least $(\gamma+o(1))n$ edges, contains a copy of $F$. A recent result of Piga, Sanhueza-Matamala, and Schacht determines that $\gamma(C_{\ell}^3)=\frac13$ for every $3$-uniform tight cycle $C_\ell^3$ of length $\ell$, where $\ell \ge \ell_0$ and $\ell$ is not divisible by $3$. In this paper, we investigate the codegree Tur\'an density of $k$-uniform tight cycles $C_\ell^k$. We establish improved upper and lower bounds on $\gamma(C_{\ell}^k)$ for general $\ell$ not divisible by $k$. These results yield the following consequences:
  1). For any prime $k \ge 3$, we show that $\gamma(C_{\ell}^k)=\frac13$ for all sufficiently large $\ell$ not divisible by $k$, generalizing the above theorem of Piga et al.
  2). For all $k \ge 3$, we determine the exact value of $\gamma(C_{\ell}^k)$ for integers $\ell$ not divisible by $k$ in a set of (natural) density at least $\frac{\varphi(k)}{k}$, where $\varphi(\cdot)$ denotes Euler's totient function.
  3). We give a complete answer to a question of Han, Lo, and Sanhueza-Matamala concerning the tightness of their construction for $\gamma(C_{\ell}^k)$.
  Moreover, our results also determine the codegree Tur\'an density of $C_\ell^{k-}$, that is, the $k$-uniform tight cycle of length $\ell$ with one edge removed, for a new set of integers $\ell$ of positive density for every $k \ge 3$. Our upper bound result is based on a structural characterization of $C_{\ell}^k$-free $k$-uniform hypergraphs with high minimum codegree, while the lower bounds are derived from a novel construction model, coupled with the arithmetic properties of the integers $k$ and $\ell$.</description>

      <title>Singular Meanders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of enumerating meanders -- pairs of simple plane curves with transverse intersections -- was formulated about forty years ago and is still far from solved. Recently, it was discovered that meanders admit a factorization into prime components. This factorization naturally leads to a broader class of objects, which we call singular meanders, in which tangential intersections between the curves are also allowed. In the present paper we initiate a systematic study of singular meanders: we develop a basic combinatorial framework, point out connections with other combinatorial objects and known integer sequences, and completely enumerate several natural families of singular meanders.</description>

Moreover, they are minimal $T$-avoiding spherical designs and maximal $T$-avoiding codes for appropriate choices of $T$.</description>

      <title>Graph Limits via Quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new notion of limits of weighted directed graphs of growing size based on convergence of their random quotients. These limits are specified in terms of random exchangeable measures on the unit square. We call our limits grapheurs and show that these are dual to graphons in a precise sense. Grapheurs are well-suited to modeling hubs and connections between them in large graphs; previous notions of graph limits based on subgraph densities fail to adequately model such global structures as subgraphs are inherently local. Using our framework, we present an edge-based sampling approach for testing properties pertaining to hubs in large graphs. This method relies on an edge-based analog of the Szemer\'edi regularity lemma, whereby we show that sampling a small number of edges from a large graph approximately preserves its quotients. Finally, we observe that the random quotients of a graph are related to each other by equipartitions, and we conclude with a characterization of such random graph models.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Ali et al. posed several open problems concerning extremal graphs with respect to the ABS index. These problems involve characterizing graphs that attain the maximum ABS index within specific graph classes, including: connected graphs with n vertices and p cut-vertices; (ii) connected graphs of order n with vertex k-partiteness; and (iii) connected bipartite graphs of order n with a fixed vertex connectivity \kappa. In this paper, we provide complete solutions to all of these problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ABS spectral radius of a graph G is defined as the largest eigenvalue of its $ABS$ matrix. Motivated by recent studies on this parameter, in this paper, we determine the bipartite unicyclic graphs that attain the largest $ABS$ spectral radius. Furthermore, we characterize the bicyclic graphs that attain the largest and the second largest $ABS$ spectral radii.</description>

      <title>Two-colorings of finite grids: variations on a theorem of Tibor Gallai</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A celebrated but non-effective theorem of Tibor Gallai states that for any finite set $A$ of $\Z^n$ and for any finite number of colors $c$ there is a minimal $m$ such that no coloring of the finite $m^n$-grid can avoid that a homothetic image of $A$ is monochromatic. We find (or confirm) $m$ for equilateral triangles, squares, and various types of rectangles. Also, we extend the problem from homothety to general similarity, or to similarity generated using some special rotations. In particular, we compute Gallai similarity numbers for lattice rectangles similar to $1\times k$ (in all orientations) for $k=2,3,4$. The solutions have been found in the framework of the Satisfiability Problem in Propositional Logic (SAT). While some questions were solved using managed brute force, for the more computationally intensive questions we used modern SAT solvers together with symmetry breaking techniques. Some other minor questions are solved for triangles and squares, and new lower bounds are found for regular hexagons on the triangular lattice and for three-dimensional cubes in $\Z^3$.</description>

      <title>Tur\'an number of disjoint Berge paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $F$, an $r$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ is a $\text{Berge-} F$ if there is a bijection $\phi: E(F)\to E(\mathcal{H})$ such that $e\subseteq \phi(e)$ for each $e\in E(F)$. When $F$ is a path, we call $\text{Berge-} F$ as Berge path. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of $r$-graphs. An $r$-graph $\mathcal{H}$ is called $\mathcal{F}$-free if $\mathcal{H}$ does not contain any member in $\mathcal{F}$ as a subhypergraph. The Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex}_{r}(n,\mathcal{F})$ is the maximum number of hyperedges in an $\mathcal{F}$-free $r$-graph on $n$ vertices. The Tur\'an number of Berge paths has received widespread attention. In this paper, we determine the exact value of $\mathrm{ex}_r(n,\text{Berge-} kP_{\ell})$ when $n$ is large enough for $k\geq 2$, $r\ge 3$, $\ell'\geq r$ and $2\ell'\geq r+7$, where $\ell'=\left\lfloor\frac{\ell+1}{2}\right\rfloor$.</description>

      <title>Extremal orthogonal arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that a Delsarte $t$-design in a $Q$-polynomial association scheme has degree at least $\left \lceil{\frac{t}{2}}\right \rceil $. Following Ionin and Shrikhande who studied combinatorial $(2s-1)$-designs (i.e., Delsarte designs in Johnson association schemes) having exactly $s$ block intersection numbers, we call a Delsarte $(2s-1)$-design with degree $s$ extremal and study extremal orthogonal arrays, which are Delsarte designs in Hamming association schemes.
  It was shown by Delsarte that a $t$-design with degree $s$ and $t\geq 2s-2$ in a Hamming association scheme induces an $s$-class association scheme. We prove that an extremal orthogonal array gives rise to a fission scheme of the latter one, which has $2s-1$ or $2s$ classes. As a corollary, a new necessary condition for the existence of tight orthogonal arrays of strength $3$ is obtained.
  Furthermore, as a counterpart to a result of Ionin and Shrikhande, we prove an inequality for Hamming distances in extremal orthogonal arrays. The inequality is tight as shown by examples related to the Golay codes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Grood's tableau construction of irreducible representations of the rook monoid and Steinberg's analogous result for the full transformation monoid. Our approach is characteristic-free and applies to any submonoid $\mathcal{M}(n)$ of the partial transformation monoid on an $n$-element set that contains the symmetric group. To achieve this, we introduce and study a functor from the category of rational representations of the monoid of $n \times n$ matrices to the category of finite dimensional representations of $\mathcal{M}(n)$. We establish two branching rules. Our main results describe graded module structures of orbit harmonics quotients for the rook, partial transformation, and full transformation monoids. This yields analogs of the Cauchy decomposition for polynomial rings in $n\times n$ variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group. For a prime $p$ and an integer $e \geq 0$, we denote by $\Gamma_{p,e}(G)$ the set of all pairs $(H, \varphi)$, where $H$ is a $p$-subgroup of $G$ of order greater than $p^e$ and $\varphi$ is a complex irreducible character of $H$. In this paper, we investigate the connected components of the poset $\Gamma_{p,e}(G)$. For the case $e = 0$, we prove that $\Gamma_{p,0}(G)$ is disconnected if and only if either $G$ has a strongly $p$-embedded subgroup, or every Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ contains a unique subgroup of order $p$. Furthermore, for $e = 1$ and $G$ a $p$-group, we show that the number of connected components of $\Gamma_{p,1}(G)$ equals the order of the intersection of all subgroups of $G$ of order $p^2$.</description>

Abstract: A Roman dominating function for a (non-weighted) graph $G=(V,E)$, is a function $f:V\rightarrow \{0,1,2\}$ such that every vertex $u\in V$ with $f(u)=0$ has at least {one} neighbor $v\in V$ such that $f(v)=2$. The minimum weight $\sum_{v\in V}f(v)$ of a Roman {dominating function} $f$ on $G$ is called the Roman domination number of $G$ and is denoted by $\gamma_{R}(G)$. A graph {$G= (V,E)$} together with a positive real-valued weight-function $w:V\rightarrow \mathbf{R}^{&gt;0}$ is called a {\it weighted graph} and is denoted by $(G;w)$. The minimum weight $\sum_{v\in V}f(v)w(v)$ of a Roman {dominating function} $f$ on $G$ is called the weighted Roman domination number of $G$ and is denoted by $\gamma_{wR}(G)$. The domination and Roman domination numbers of unweighted graphs have been extensively studied, particularly for their applications in bioinformatics and computational biology. However, graphs used to model biomolecular structures often require weights to be biologically meaningful. In this paper, we initiate the study of the weighted Roman domination number in weighted graphs. We first establish several bounds for this parameter and present various realizability results. Furthermore, we determine the exact values for several well-known graph families and demonstrate an equivalence between the weighted Roman domination number and the differential of a weighted graph.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal moments in free and c-free probability and Motzkin paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infinitesimal moments associated with infinitesimal freeness and infinitesimal conditional freeness are studied. For free random variables, we consider continuous deformations of moment functionals associated with Motzkin paths $w$, which provide a decomposition of their moments, and we compute their derivatives at zero. We show that the first-order derivative of each functional vanishes unless the path has exactly one local maximum. Geometrically, this means that $w$ is a pyramid path, which is consistent with the characteristic formula for alternating moments of infinitesimally free centered random variables. In this framework, infinitesimal Boolean independence is also obtained and it corresponds to flat paths. A similar approach is developed for infinitesimal conditional freeness, for which we show that the only moment functionals that have a non-zero first-order derivative are associated with concatenations of a pyramid path and a flat path. This charaterization leads to a Leibniz-type definition of infinitesimal conditional freeness at the level of moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2017, Cooper et al. proposed a conjecture providing a lower bound for the Waldschmidt constant of monomial ideals. We confirm this conjecture for some classes of monomial ideals. Recently, M\'endez, Pinto, and Villarreal formulated a conjecture stating that if $I$ is a monomial ideal without embedded associated primes, whose irreducible decomposition is minimal and which is a Simis ideal, then there exist a Simis squarefree monomial ideal $J$ and a standard linear weighting $w$ such that $I = J_{w}.$ In this work, we verify this conjecture for some classes of monomial ideals.</description>

      <title>Computing parameters that generalize interval graphs using restricted modular partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Lafond and Luo [MFCS 2023] defined the $\mathcal{G}$-modular cardinality of a graph $G$ as the minimum size of a partition of $V(G)$ into modules that belong to a graph class $\mathcal{G}$. We analyze the complexity of calculating parameters that generalize interval graphs when parameterized by the $\mathcal{G}$-modular cardinality, where $\mathcal{G}$ corresponds either to the class of interval graphs or to the union of complete graphs. Namely, we analyze the complexity of computing the thinness and the simultaneous interval number of a graph.
  We present a linear kernel for the Thinness problem parameterized by the interval-modular cardinality and an FPT algorithm for Simultaneous Interval Number when parameterized by the cluster-modular cardinality plus the solution size. The interval-modular cardinality of a graph is not greater than the cluster-modular cardinality, which in turn generalizes the neighborhood diversity and the twin-cover number. Thus, our results imply a linear kernel for Thinness when parameterized by the neighborhood diversity of the input graph, FPT algorithms for Thinness when parameterized by the twin-cover number and vertex cover number, and FPT algorithms for Simultaneous Interval Number when parameterized by the neighborhood diversity plus the solution size, twin-cover number, and vertex cover number. To the best of our knowledge, prior to our work no parameterized algorithms (FPT or XP) for computing the thinness or the simultaneous interval number were known.
  On the negative side, we observe that Thinness and Simultaneous Interval Number parameterized by treewidth, pathwidth, bandwidth, (linear) mim-width, clique-width, modular-width, or even the thinness or simultaneous interval number themselves, admit no polynomial kernels assuming NP $\not\subseteq$ coNP/poly.</description>

      <title>An exceptional set of uniformly spread Kakutani tilings of the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The {\alpha}-Kakutani substitution rule splits the unit interval into two subintervals of lengths alpha and 1 - {\alpha}, for a fixed {\alpha} in (0,1). A simple inflation-substitution procedure produces tilings of the real line and their associated Delone sets. We show that there are precisely five distinct values of min({\alpha}, 1 - {\alpha}) for which these sets are uniformly spread, meaning that they are a bounded displacement of a lattice. The proof of this surprising fact combines the construction and analysis of a related family of primitive substitution tilings, Solomon's criterion for uniform spreadness, and a classification of Pisot-Vijayaraghavan polynomials.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides a brief write-up showing that for any finite state game, a disjunctive number $x$ will eventually win that game. The proof techniques here are well known and this result follows immediately from folklore results in graph theory and cellular automata. This short paper primarily serves as an expositional piece to collect this proof with the fun context of $\pi$ Plays Pok\'emon serving as motivation.</description>

      <title>Quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations for type $C$ flag manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study relations of $\lambda_{y}$-classes associated to tautological bundles over the flag manifold of type $C$ in the quantum $K$-ring. These relations are called the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations. The strategy of the proof of the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations is based on the method of semi-infinite flag manifolds and the Borel-type presentation. In addition, we observe that the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations give a complete set of the defining relations of the quantum $K$-ring. This gives a presentation of the quantum $K$-ring of the flag manifold of type $C$, called the Whitney-type presentation, as a quotient of a polynomial ring, different from the Borel-type presentation.</description>

      <title>Chamber zeta function and closed galleries in the standard non-uniform complex from $\operatorname{PGL}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the \emph{chamber zeta function} for a complex of groups, defined via an Euler product over primitive tailless chamber galleries, extending the Ihara--Bass framework from weighted graphs to higher-rank settings. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the Bruhat--Tits building of $\mathrm{PGL}_{3}(F)$ for a non-archimedean local field $F$ with residue field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. For the standard arithmetic quotient $\Gamma\backslash\mathcal{B}$ with $\Gamma=\mathrm{PGL}_{3}(\mathbb{F}_{q}[t])$, we prove an Ihara--Bass type \emph{determinant formula} expressing the chamber zeta function as the reciprocal of a characteristic polynomial of a naturally defined chamber transfer operator. In particular, the chamber zeta function is \emph{rational} in its complex parameter. As an application of the determinant formula, we obtain explicit counting results for closed gallery classes arising from tailless galleries in $\mathcal{B}$, including exact identities and spectral asymptotics governed by the chamber operator.</description>

Abstract: We show how the tools of modern algebraic combinatorics -- representation theory, Murphy elements, and particularly Schur--Weyl duality -- can be used to give an explicit orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions for a "curiously slowly mixing Markov chain" on the space of binary $n$-tuples. The basis is used to give sharp rates of convergence to stationarity.</description>

      <title>Identifying faulty edges in resistive electrical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a resistive electrical network, we would like to determine whether all the resistances (edges) in the network are working, and if not, identify which edge (or edges) are faulty. To make this determination, we are allowed to measure the effective resistance between certain pairs of nodes (which can be done by measuring the amount of current when one unit of voltage difference is applied at the chosen pair of nodes). The goal is to determine which edge, if any, is not working in the network using the smallest number of measurements. We prove rigorous upper and lower bounds on this optimal number of measurements for different classes of graphs. These bounds are tight for several of these classes showing that our measurement strategies are optimal.</description>

      <title>Coloring Hardness on Low Twin-Width Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the class $\mathcal T_4$ of graphs of twin-width at most 4 contains every finite subgraph of the infinite grid and every graph obtained by subdividing each edge of an $n$-vertex graph at least $2 \log n$ times, most NP-hard graph problems, like Max Independent Set, Dominating Set, Hamiltonian Cycle, remain so on $\mathcal T_4$. However, Min Coloring and k-Coloring are easy on both families because they are 2-colorable and 3-colorable, respectively.
  We show that Min Coloring is NP-hard on the class $\mathcal T_3$ of graphs of twin-width at most 3. This is the first hardness result on $\mathcal T_3$ for a problem that is easy on cographs (twin-width 0), on trees (whose twin-width is at most 2), and on unit circular-arc graphs (whose twin-width is at most 3). We also show that for every $k \geqslant 3$, k-Coloring is NP-hard on $\mathcal T_4$. We finally make two observations: (1) there are currently very few problems known to be in P on $\mathcal T_d$ (graphs of twin-width at most $d$) and NP-hard on $\mathcal T_{d+1}$ for some nonnegative integer $d$, and (2) unlike $\mathcal T_4$, which contains every graph as an induced minor, the class $\mathcal T_3$ excludes a fixed planar graph as an induced minor; thus it may be viewed as a special case (or potential counterexample) for conjectures about classes excluding a (planar) induced minor. These observations are accompanied by several open questions.</description>

      <title>The Minimum Subgraph Complementation Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subgraph complementation is an operation that toggles all adjacencies inside a selected vertex set. Given a graph \(G\) and a target class \(\mathcal{C}\), the Minimum Subgraph Complementation problem asks for a minimum-size vertex set \(S\) such that complementing the subgraph induced by \(S\) transforms \(G\) into a graph belonging to \(\mathcal{C}\). While the decision version of Subgraph Complementation has been extensively studied and is NP-complete for many graph classes, the algorithmic complexity of its optimization variant has remained largely unexplored.
  In this paper, we study MSC from an algorithmic perspective. We present polynomial-time algorithms for MSC in several nontrivial settings. Our results include polynomial-time solvability for transforming graphs between bipartite, co-bipartite, and split graphs, as well as for complementing bipartite regular graphs into chordal graphs. We also show that MSC to the class of graphs of fixed degeneracy can be solved in polynomial time when the input graph is a forest. Moreover, we investigate MSC with respect to connectivity and prove that MSC to the class of disconnected graphs and to the class of 2-connected graphs can be solved in polynomial time for arbitrary inputs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a prime factorization of open meanders, articulated through the framework of 2-colored operads. We demonstrate that each open meander can be canonically constructed from building blocks of two types: iterated snakes and irreducible meanders. We find out that iterated snakes allow efficient enumeration, and thus the problem of enumerating meanders reduces to the problem of enumerating irreducible meanders. Additionally, we present some results concerning the asymptotic of meanders of both classes.</description>

      <title>The Containment Game in the plane: between the Firefighter Problem and Conway's Angel Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The containment game is a full information game for two players, initialised with a set of occupied vertices in an infinite connected graph $G$. On the $t$-th turn, the first player, called Spreader, extends the occupied set to $g(t)$ adjacent vertices, and then the second player, called Container, removes $q$ unoccupied vertices from the graph. If the spreading process continues perpetually -- Spreader wins, and otherwise -- Container wins. For $g=\infty$ this game reduces to a solitaire game for Container, known as the Firefighter Problem. On $\mathbb{Z}^2$, for $q=1/k$ and $g\equiv 1$ it is equivalent to Conway's Angel Problem.
  We introduce the game, and writing $q(G,g)$ for the set of $q$ values for which Container wins against a given $g(t)$, we study the minimal asymptotics of $g(t)$ such that $q(G,g)=q(G,\infty)$, i.e. for which defeating Spreader is as hard as winning the Firefighter Problem solitaire. We show, by providing explicit winning strategies, a sub-linear upper bound $g(t)=O(t^{6/7})$ and a lower bound of $g(t)=\Omega(t^{1/2})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider structural properties of $\mathcal{L}$-polymatroids, especially those defined on a finite complemented modular lattice $\mathcal{L}$. We introduce a set of cover-weight axioms and establish a cryptomorphism between these axioms and the rank axioms of an $\mathcal{L}$-polymatroid. We introduce the notion of a cyclic flat of an $\mathcal{L}$-polymatroid and study properties of its lattice of cyclic flats. We show that the weighted lattice of cyclic flats of an $\mathcal{L}$-polymatroid $\mathcal{P}$, along with the atomic weights of $\mathcal{P}$, is sufficient to define its rank function on $\mathcal{L}$. In our main result, we characterize those weighted lattices $(\mathcal{Z},\lambda)$ such that $\mathcal{Z}\subseteq\mathcal{L}$ is the collection of cyclic flats of an $\mathcal{L}$-polymatroid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, and a nonnegative integer $g$, let $a_g(G)$ be the number of $2$-cell embeddings of $G$ in an orientable surface of genus $g$ (counted up to the combinatorial homeomorphism equivalence). In 1989, Gross, Robbins, and Tucker [Genus distributions for bouquets of circles, J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 47 (1989), 292-306] proposed a conjecture that the sequence $a_0(G),a_1(G),a_2(G),\dots$ is log-concave for every graph $G$. This conjecture is reminiscent to the Heron-Rota-Welsh Log Concavity Conjecture that was recently resolved in the affirmative by June Huh et al., except that it is closer to the notion of $\Delta$-matroids than to the usual matroids. In this short paper, we disprove the Log Concavity Conjecture of Gross, Robbins, and Tucker by providing examples that show strong deviation from log-concavity at multiple terms of their genus sequences.</description>

      <title>Graphs with positive Lin-Lu-Yau curvature without quadrilaterals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The definition of Ricci curvature on graphs was given in Lin-Lu-Yau, Tohoku Math., 2011, which is a variation of Ollivier, J. Funct. Math., 2009. Recently, a powerful limit-free formulation of Lin-Lu-Yau curvature using the graph Laplacian has been given in M\"{u}nch-Wojciechowski, Adv. Math., 2019. Let $F_k$ be the friendship graph obtained from $k$ triangles by sharing a common vertex and $T$ be the graph obtained from a triangle and $K_{1,3}$ by adding a matching between every leaf of $K_{1,3}$ and a vertex of the triangle. In this paper, we classify all the simple connected $C_4$-free graphs with positive Lin-Lu-Yau curvature for minimum degree at least 2: the cycles $C_3,C_5$, the friendship graphs $F_2,F_3$, the line graph of Peterson graph, and $T$.</description>

      <title>Equitable list coloring of sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A proper vertex coloring of a graph is equitable if the sizes of all color classes differ by at most $1$. For a list assignment $L$ of $k$ colors to each vertex of an $n$-vertex graph $G$, an equitable $L$-coloring of $G$ is a proper coloring of vertices of $G$ from their lists such that no color is used more than $\lceil n/k\rceil$ times. Call a graph equitably $k$-choosable if it has an equitable $L$-coloring for every $k$-list assignment $L$. A graph $G$ is $(a,b)$-sparse if for every $A\subseteq V(G)$, the number of edges in the subgraph $G[A]$ of $G$ induced by $A$ is at most $a|A|+b$.
  Our first main result is that every $(\frac{7}{6},\frac{1}{3})$-sparse graph with minimum degree at least $2$ is equitably $3$-colorable and equitably $3$-choosable. This is sharp. Our second main result is that every $(\frac{5}{4},\frac{1}{2})$-sparse graph with minimum degree at least $2$ is equitably $4$-colorable and equitably $4$-choosable. This is also sharp.
  One of the tools in the proof is the new notion of strongly equitable (SE) list coloring. This notion is both stronger and more natural than equitable list coloring; and our upper bounds are for SE list coloring.</description>

      <title>The strong hull property for affine irreducible Coxeter groups of rank 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A conjecture proposed by Gaetz and Gao asserts that the Cayley graph of any Coxeter group possesses the strong hull property. In this paper, we prove this conjecture for all affine irreducible Coxeter groups of rank 3. Our approach exploits the geometry of affine buildings to reduce the analysis of convex hulls to finitely many manageable configurations. These geometric reduction techniques offer a novel framework that may be applicable to higher-rank cases.</description>

Abstract: Two-sort species yield differential equations for functional digraphs of Cayley permutations. From these we obtain an explicit formula for fixed-point-free Cayley permutations and conjecture that their proportion tends to $1/e$, as for permutations and endofunctions. Our approach also yields counting formulas when the functional digraph is a tree, forest, or connected.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically optimal Ramsey goodness of sparse graphs versus odd cycles and paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11835v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in graph Ramsey theory is to determine, for sparse graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices, the minimal $n$ such that $G$ is Ramsey-good for odd cycles $C_k$ and paths $P_k$. Burr, Erd\H{o}s, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp (Trans. AMS 1982) addressed this problem, establishing bounds requiring $n = \Omega(k^{10})$ for odd cycles and $n = \Omega(k^{12})$ for paths. We settle the asymptotic version of this problem, proving that these bounds are essentially tight: $n = \Omega(k)$ suffices for odd cycles and $n = \Omega(k^2)$ (or $n = \Omega(k)$ under additional conditions) for paths. Specifically, we prove:
  (1) For odd cycles $C_k$ ($k\ge3$), we prove $r(G, C_k) = 2n-1$ for any connected $n$-vertex graph $G$ satisfying the relaxed conditions $n = \Omega(k)$ and $e(G) \le (1 + O(1/k^2)) n$.
  (2) For paths $P_k$ ($k\ge2$), we prove $r(G, P_k) = \max\{ n + \lfloor k/2\rfloor - 1, n + k - 2 - \alpha' - \gamma \}$ for any connected $n$-vertex graph $G$ satisfying one of the following:
  (i) $n = \Omega(k^2)$ and $e(G) \le (1 + O(1/k^2)) n$;
  (ii) $n = \Omega(k)$, $\delta(G)\ge2$, $\alpha'\geq k/2$, and $e(G) \le (1 + O(1/k)) n$.
  In the above, $\alpha'$ is the independence number of an appropriate subgraph of $G$ and $\gamma=0$ if $k-1$ divides $n+k-3-\alpha'$, and $\gamma=1$ otherwise.
  Consequently, our results unify and generalize classical theorems on odd cycles due to Bondy and Erd\H{o}s (1973), Faudree and Schelp (1974), and Rosta (1973), and on paths due to Gerencs\'er and Gy\'arf\'as (1967), Faudree, Lawrence, Parsons and Schelp (1974), and Parsons (1974). The proofs feature two key innovations: a novel reconstruction of the end-edge matching and an enhancement of Burr et al.'s dichotomy lemma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate conditions under which positions in combinatorial games admit simple values. We introduce a unified diamond framework, the $\Diamond_A$-property ($A\in\{\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{D}$), for sets of positions closed under options. Under certain conditions, this framework guarantees that all values are integers, dyadic rationals, or pairs $\{m|n\}$ (on $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{D}$). As an application, we establish that every position in \textsc{Yashima} game on bipartite graphs has an integer pair value.</description>

      <title>Localization of spectral Tur\'{a}n-type theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph, and let $v$ and $e$ be a vertex and an edge of $G$, respectively. Define $c(v)$ (resp. $c(e)$) to be the order of the largest clique in $G$ containing $v$ (resp. $e$). Denote the adjacency eigenvalues of $G$ by $\lambda_1 \ge \cdots \ge \lambda_n$. We study localized refinements of spectral Tur\'{a}n-type theorems by replacing global parameters such as the clique number $\omega(G)$, size $m$ and order $n$ of $G$ with local quantities $c(v)$ and $c(e)$.
  Motivated by a conjecture of Elphick, Linz and Wocjan (2024), we first propose a vertex-localized strengthening of Wilf's inequality: \[ \sqrt{s^{+}(G)} \le \sum_{v\in V(G)}\left(1-\frac{1}{c(v)}\right), \] where $s^+(G) = \sum_{\lambda_i &gt; 0}\lambda_i^2$. Inspired by the Bollob\'{a}s-Nikiforov conjecture (2007) on the first two eigenvalues, we then introduce an edge-localized analogue: \[\lambda_1^2(G) + \lambda_2^2(G) \le \sum_{e\in E(G)} 2\left(1-\frac{1}{c(e)}\right).\] As evidence of their validity, we verify the above conjectures for diamond-free graphs and random graphs. We also propose strengthening of the spectral versions of the Erd\H{o}s, Stone and Simonovits Theorem by replacing the spectral radius with $\sqrt{s^{+}(G)}$ and establish it for all $F$-free graphs with $\chi(F)=3$. A key ingredient in our proofs is a general upper bound relating $\sqrt{s^{+}(G)}$ to the triangle count $t(G)$. Finally, we prove a localized version of Nikiforov's walk inequality and conjecture a stronger localized version. These results contribute to the broader program of localizing spectral extremal inequalities.</description>

      <title>Magic Gems: A Polyhedral Framework for Magic Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09170v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Magic Gems, a geometric representation of magic squares as three-dimensional polyhedra. By mapping an n times n magic square onto a centered coordinate grid with cell values as vertical displacements, we construct a point cloud whose convex hull defines the Magic Gem. Building on prior work connecting magic squares to physical properties such as moment of inertia, this construction reveals an explicit statistical structure: we show that magic squares have vanishing covariances between position and value. We develop a covariance energy functional (the sum of squared covariances with individual row, column, and diagonal indicator variables) and prove that for all orders of n greater than or equal to three, an arrangement is a magic square if and only if this complete energy vanishes. This characterization transforms the classical line-sum definition into a statistical orthogonality condition. We also study a simpler low-mode relaxation using only four aggregate position indicators; this coincides with the complete characterization for n equals three (verified exhaustively) but defines a strictly larger class for n greater than or equal to four (explicit counterexamples computed). Perturbation analysis demonstrates that magic squares are isolated local minima in the energy landscape. The representation is invariant under dihedral symmetry D4, yielding canonical geometric objects for equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>A complete dichotomy theorem on the sparse $t$-Uniform Hypergraphicality Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a complete dichotomy theorem for the parameterized sparse $t$-uniform hypergraphic degree sequence problem, $\mathrm{sparse}\text{-}t\text{-}\mathrm{uni}\text{-}\mathrm{HDS}_{\alpha',\alpha}$. For any fixed $t \ge 3$, given parameters $0 \le \alpha' \le \alpha &lt; t-1$, the input consists of degree sequences $D$ of length $n$ with degrees between $n^{\alpha'}$ and $6n^{\alpha}$. We show that the problem is NP-complete whenever $\alpha' \le \frac{t(\alpha - 1) + 1}{t - 1}$, and solvable in linear time when $\alpha' &gt; \frac{t(\alpha - 1) + 1}{t - 1}$. This establishes a sharp boundary between polynomial-time solvable and NP-complete instances, thereby characterizing the computational complexity across all degree exponent regimes. The result extends the earlier NP-completeness of dense hypergraphicality to a unified framework covering both sparse and dense regimes, revealing that even extremely sparse instances (with maximum degree $o(n)$ but $\Omega(n^{\frac{t-1}{t}})$) remain NP-complete. On the other hand, the $t$-uniform hypergraphicality solvable in linear time when the maximum degree is $o(n^{\frac{t-1}{t}})$. This dichotomy provides a comprehensive classification of the complexity landscape for hypergraphic degree sequences.</description>

      <title>A Short Note on Disjointness Conditions for Triples of Group Subsets Satisfying the Triple Product Property</title>

      <description>arXiv:0908.3671v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract:   We deduce some elementary pairwise disjointness and semi-disjointness conditions on triples of subsets in arbitrary groups satisfying the so-called triple product property (TPP) as originally defined by H. Cohn and C. Umans in 2003. This property TPP for a triple of group subsets, called a TPP triple, allows the group to "realize" matrix multiplication of dimensions the sizes of the subsets, with the subsets acting as indexing sets for input matrices which are embedded into the regular algebra of the group. We derive nine different disjointness casetypes for an arbitrary TPP triple, and classify these into four different disjointness classes based on an integer measure of the degree of pairwise disjointness among the subsets. Finally, we derive lower and upper bounds for the sum of sizes of the subsets forming a TPP triple, which is the additive equivalent of the multiplicative bounds originally derived by Cohn and Umans for the product of sizes of subsets forming a TPP triple.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NP-complete problems Colouring and k-Colouring $(k\geq 3$) are well studied on $H$-free graphs, i.e., graphs that do not contain some fixed graph $H$ as an induced subgraph. We research to what extent the known polynomial-time algorithms for $H$-free graphs can be generalized if we only know some of the edges of the input graph. We do this by considering the classical probe graph model introduced in the early nineties. For a graph $H$, a partitioned probe $H$-free graph $(G,P,N)$ consists of a graph $G=(V,E)$, together with a set $P\subseteq V$ of probes and an independent set $N=V\setminus P$ of non-probes, such that $G+F$ is $H$-free for some edge set $F\subseteq \binom{N}{2}$. We first fully classify the complexity of Colouring on partitioned probe $H$-free graphs and show that this dichotomy is different from the known dichotomy of Colouring for $H$-free graphs. Our main result is a dichotomy of $3$-Colouring for partitioned probe $P_t$-free graphs: we prove that the problem is polynomial-time solvable if $t\leq 5$ but NP-complete if $t\geq 6$. In contrast, $3$-Colouring on $P_t$-free graphs is known to be polynomial-time solvable if $t\leq 7$ and quasi polynomial-time solvable for $t\geq 8$.</description>

      <title>On the cross-correlation properties of large-size families of Costas arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Costas arrays have been an interesting combinatorial object for decades because of their optimal aperiodic auto-correlation properties. Meanwhile, it is interesting to find families of Costas arrays or extended arrays with small maximal cross-correlation values, since for applications in multi-user systems, the cross-interferences between different signals should also be small. The objective of this paper is to study several large-size families of Costas arrays or extended arrays, and their values of maximal crosscorrelation are partially bounded for some cases of horizontal shifts $u$ and vertical shifts $v$. Given a prime $p \geq 5$, a large-size family of Costas arrays over $\{1, \ldots, p-1\}$ is investigated, including both the exponential and logarithmic Welch Costas arrays. An upper bound on the maximal cross-correlation of this family for arbitrary $u$ and $v$ is given. We also show that the maximal cross-correlation of the family of power permutations over $\{1, \ldots, p-1\}$ for $u=0$ and $v \neq 0$ is bounded by $\frac{1}{2}+\sqrt{p-1}$. Furthermore, we give the first nontrivial upper bound on the maximal cross-correlation of the larger family including both exponential Welch Costas arrays and power permutations over $\{1, \ldots, p-1\}$ for arbitrary $u$ and $v=0$ that it equals $(p-1) / t$ where $t$ is the smallest prime divisor of $(p-1) / 2$ if p is not a safe prime and is at most $(p-1)^{\frac{1}{2}}+(p-1)^{\frac{1}{4}}+\frac{1}{2}$ otherwise.</description>

      <title>Non-exchangeable mean-field theory for adaptive weights: propagation of dissociatedness and graphon sampling lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mean-field theory for large, non-exchangeable particle (agent) systems where the states and interaction weights co-evolve in a coupled system of SDEs. A first main result is the establishment of the propagation of dissociatedness, a conceptual generalization of the classical propagation of chaos that accommodates the intrinsic local correlations between particles and their weights. The limiting McKean-Vlasov process is characterized by an Aldous-Hoover representation on a filtered probability space, beyond the standard one-particle law (or a family thereof). Paralleling the classical equivalence between propagation of chaos and the convergence of empirical measures to the one-particle law, we show that the propagation of dissociatedness corresponds to the convergence of the empirical structure under a distance unifying the Wasserstein distance for particles and the cut distance for weights. This quantitative stability is grounded in an adaptation of the sampling lemma from dense graph theory, analogous to the classical concentration results for empirical measures in the Wasserstein distance.</description>

      <title>Detection and Reconstruction of a Random Hypergraph from Noisy Graph Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a $d$-uniform random hypergraph on $n$ vertices in which hyperedges are included i.i.d.\ so that the average degree in the hypergraph is $n^{\delta+o(1)}$, the projection of such a hypergraph is a graph on the same $n$ vertices where an edge connects two vertices if and only if they belong to a same hyperedge. In this work, we study the inference problem where the observation is a \emph{noisy} version of the graph projection where each edge in the projection is kept with probability $p=n^{-1+\alpha+o(1)}$ and each edge not in the projection is added with probability $q=n^{-1+\beta+o(1)}$. For all constant $d$, we establish sharp thresholds for both detection (distinguishing the noisy projection from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph with edge density $q$) and reconstruction (estimating the original hypergraph). Notably, our results reveal a \emph{detection-reconstruction gap} phenomenon in this problem. Our work also answers a problem raised in \cite{BGPY25+}.</description>

      <title>On a magneto-spectral invariant on finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03754v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a magneto-spectral invariant for finite graphs. This invariant vanishes on trees and is maximized by complete graphs. We compute this invariant for cycles, complete graphs, wheel graphs, hypercubes, complete bipartite graphs and suspensions of trees and derive various lower and upper bounds. In particular, we provide a sharp upper bound for regular bipartite graphs and derive a direct relation between the class of graphs assuming this upper bound and the class of unit weighing matrices, which are generalizations of complex Hadamard matrices. Moreover, this class of bipartite graphs has non-negative magnetic Bakry-\'Emery curvature and is preserved under both the Cartesian product and a partial tensor product for bipartite graphs. The study of our invariant for certain pairs of cospectral graphs indicates also that this invariant allows us to distinguish between them. Finally, we discuss the behaviour of this invariant under various graph operations and investigate relations to the spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Approximating mixed volumes to arbitrary accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of approximating the mixed volume $V(P_1^{(\alpha_1)}, \dots, P_k^{(\alpha_k)})$ of an $k$-tuple of convex polytopes $(P_1, \dots, P_k)$, each of which is defined as the convex hull of at most $m_0$ points in $\mathbb{Z}^n$. We design an algorithm that produces an estimate that is within a multiplicative $1 \pm \epsilon$ factor of the true mixed volume with a probability greater than $1 - \delta.$ Let the constant $ \prod_{i=2}^{k} \frac{(\alpha_{i}+1)^{\alpha_{i}+1}}{\alpha_{i}^{\,\alpha_{i}}}$ be denoted by $\tilde{A}$. When each $P_i \subseteq B_\infty(2^L)$, we show in this paper that the time complexity of the algorithm is bounded above by a polynomial in $n, m_0, L, \tilde{A}, \epsilon^{-1}$ and $\log \delta^{-1}$. In fact, a stronger result is proved in this paper, with slightly more involved terminology.
  In particular, we provide the first randomized polynomial time algorithm for computing mixed volumes of such polytopes when $k$ is an absolute constant, but $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_k$ are arbitrary. Our approach synthesizes tools from convex optimization, the theory of Lorentzian polynomials, and polytope subdivision.</description>

      <title>Two-color partitions and overpartitions: a combinatorial proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: George Andrews and Mohamed El Bachraoui recently explored identities for two-color partitions. In particular, they studied the connection between two-colored partitions and overpartitions. Their proofs were analytical, but they conjectured combinatorial proofs of their results. In this paper we use two-modular diagrams to give a combinatorial proof of their main result.</description>

      <title>A curiously slowly mixing Markov chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a Markov chain with very different mixing rates depending on how mixing is measured. The chain is the "Burnside process on the hypercube $C_2^n$." Started at the all-zeros state, it mixes in a bounded number of steps, no matter how large $n$ is, in $\ell^1$ and in $\ell^2$. And started at general $x$, it mixes in at most $\log n$ steps in $\ell^1$. But, in $\ell^2$, it takes $\frac{n}{\log n}$ steps for most starting $x$. The $\ell^2$ mixing results follow from an explicit diagonalization of the Markov chain into binomial-coefficient-valued eigenvectors.</description>
