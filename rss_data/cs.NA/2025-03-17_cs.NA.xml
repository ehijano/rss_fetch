      <title>Analysis and numerical analysis of the Helmholtz-Korteweg equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the Helmholtz--Korteweg and nematic Helmholtz--Korteweg equations, variants of the classical Helmholtz equation for time-harmonic wave propagation for Korteweg and nematic Korteweg fluids. Korteweg fluids are ones where the stress tensor depends on density gradients; nematic Korteweg fluids further depend on a nematic director describing the orientation of the (anisotropic) molecules. We prove existence and uniqueness of solutions to these equations for suitable (nonresonant) wave numbers and propose convergent discretizations for their numerical solution. The discretization of these equations is nontrivial as they demand high regularity and involve unfamiliar boundary conditions; we address these challenges by using high-order conforming finite elements, and enforcing the boundary conditions with Nitsche's method. We illustrate our analysis with numerical simulations in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Isoparametric finite element methods for mean curvature flow and surface diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose higher-order isoparametric finite element approximations for mean curvature flow and surface diffusion. The methods are natural extensions of the piecewise linear finite element methods introduced by Barrett, Garcke, and N\"urnberg (BGN) in a series of papers in 2007 and 2008. The proposed schemes exhibit unconditional energy stability and inherit the favorable mesh quality of the original BGN methods. Moreover, in the case of surface diffusion we present structure-preserving higher-order isoparametric finite element methods. In addition to being unconditionally stable, these also conserve the enclosed volume. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the higher-order spatial accuracy, the unconditional energy stability, the volume preservation for surface diffusion, and the good mesh quality.</description>

      <title>Understanding Contrastive Learning through Variational Analysis and Neural Network Optimization Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SimCLR method for contrastive learning of invariant visual representations has become extensively used in supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised settings, due to its ability to uncover patterns and structures in image data that are not directly present in the pixel representations. However, the reason for this success is not well-explained, since it is not guaranteed by invariance alone. In this paper, we conduct a mathematical analysis of the SimCLR method with the goal of better understanding the geometric properties of the learned latent distribution. Our findings reveal two things: (1) the SimCLR loss alone is not sufficient to select a good minimizer -- there are minimizers that give trivial latent distributions, even when the original data is highly clustered -- and (2) in order to understand the success of contrastive learning methods like SimCLR, it is necessary to analyze the neural network training dynamics induced by minimizing a contrastive learning loss. Our preliminary analysis for a one-hidden layer neural network shows that clustering structure can present itself for a substantial period of time during training, even if it eventually converges to a trivial minimizer. To substantiate our theoretical insights, we present numerical results that confirm our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>On the representation of energy-preserving quadratic operators with application to Operator Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a skew-symmetric parameterization for energy-preserving quadratic operators. Earlier, [Goyal et al., 2023] proposed this parameterization to enforce energy-preservation for quadratic terms in the context of dynamical system data-driven inference. We here prove that every energy-preserving quadratic term can be equivalently formulated using a parameterization of the corresponding operator via skew-symmetric matrix blocks. Based on this main finding, we develop an algorithm to compute an equivalent quadratic operator with skew-symmetric sub-matrices, given an arbitrary energy-preserving operator. Consequently, we employ the skew-symmetric sub-matrix representation in the framework of non-intrusive reduced-order modeling (ROM) via Operator Inference (OpInf) for systems with an energy-preserving nonlinearity. To this end, we propose a sequential, linear least-squares (LS) problems formulation for the inference task, to ensure energy-preservation of the data-driven quadratic operator. The potential of this approach is indicated by the numerical results for a 2D Burgers' equation benchmark, compared to classical OpInf. The inferred system dynamics are accurate, while the corresponding operators are faithful to the underlying physical properties of the system.</description>

      <title>Inverse scattering for Schr\"{o}dinger equation in the frequency domain via data-driven reduced order modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a numerical method for solving an inverse scattering problem of estimating the scattering potential in a Schr\"{o}dinger equation from frequency domain measurements based on reduced order models (ROM). The ROM is a projection of Schr\"{o}dinger operator onto a subspace spanned by its solution snapshots at certain wavenumbers. Provided the measurements are performed at these wavenumbers, the ROM can be constructed in a data-driven manner from the measurements on a surface surrounding the scatterers. Once the ROM is computed, the scattering potential can be estimated using non-linear optimization that minimizes the ROM misfit. Such an approach typically outperforms the conventional methods based on data misfit minimization. We develop two variants of ROM-based algorithms for inverse scattering and test them on a synthetic example in two spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Space-time discretization of the wave equation in a second-order-in-time formulation: a conforming, unconditionally stable method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze a new conforming space-time Galerkin discretization of the wave equation, which is based on a second-order-in-time variational formulation. Our method requires at least $C^1$-regularity in time, and it is shown to be unconditionally stable for all choices of discrete spaces that satisfy standard approximation properties and inverse inequalities, such as spline spaces. In particular, the variational formulation of the associated ordinary differential equation is coercive. The proposed method yields error estimates with respect to the mesh size that are suboptimal by one order in standard Sobolev norms. However, for certain choices of approximation spaces, it achieves quasi-optimal estimates. In particular, we prove this for $C^1$-regular splines of even polynomial degree, and provide numerical evidence suggesting that the same behavior holds for splines with maximal regularity, irrespective of the degree. Numerical results are provided to support the theoretical findings and demonstrate the sharpness of the estimates.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Diffuse Interface Method for Multiphase Flow Simulations Across All Mach Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper enhances the Diffuse Interface Method (DIM) for simulating compressible multiphase flows across all Mach numbers by addressing the accuracy challenges posed at low Mach regimes. A correction to the Riemann solver is introduced, designed to mitigate excessive numerical diffusion while maintaining simplicity and efficiency. The validity of this correction is established through rigorous asymptotic analysis of the governing equations and their discrete counterparts. The proposed correction is implemented within a six-equation model framework with instantaneous relaxation using an HLLC-type solver. Numerical test cases demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of the approach in capturing multiphase flow dynamics across a wide range of Mach numbers.</description>

      <title>Numerical Solution and Errors Analysis of Iterative Method for a Nonlinear Plate Bending Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper uses the HCT finite element method and mesh adaptation technology to solve the nonlinear plate bending problem and conducts error analysis on the iterative method, including a priori and a posteriori error estimates. Our investigation exploits Hermite finite elements such as BELL and HSIEH-CLOUGH-TOCHER (HCT) triangles for conforming finite element discretization. Then, the existence and uniqueness of the approximation solution are proven by using a variant of the Brezzi-Rappaz-Raviart theorem. We solve the approximation problem through a fixed-point strategy and an iterative algorithm, and study the convergence of the iterative algorithm, and provide the convergence conditions. An optimal a priori error estimation has been established. We construct a posteriori error indicators by distinguishing between discretization and linearization errors and prove their reliability and optimality. A numerical test is carried out and the results obtained confirm those established theoreticall.</description>

      <title>Accuracy Boost in Ensemble Kalman Inversion via Ensemble Control Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) method is widely used for solving inverse problems, leveraging ensemble-based techniques to iteratively refine parameter estimates. Despite its versatility, the accuracy of EKI is constrained by the subspace spanned by the initial ensemble, which may poorly represent the solution in cases of limited prior knowledge. This work addresses these limitations by optimising the subspace in which EKI operates, improving accuracy and computational efficiency. We derive a theoretical framework for constructing optimal subspaces in linear settings and extend these insights to nonlinear cases. A novel greedy strategy for selecting initial ensemble members is proposed, incorporating prior, data, and model information to enhance performance. Numerical experiments on both linear and nonlinear problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, offering a significant advancement in the accuracy and scalability of EKI for high-dimensional and ill-posed problems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Regularisation for PDE-Constrained Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PDE-constrained optimal control problems require regularisation to ensure well-posedness, introducing small perturbations that make the solutions challenging to approximate accurately. We propose a finite element approach that couples both regularisation and discretisation adaptivity, varying both the regularisation parameter and mesh-size locally based on rigorous a posteriori error estimates aiming to dynamically balance induced regularisation and discretisation errors, offering a robust and efficient method for solving these problems. We demonstrate the efficacy of our analysis with several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Unfitted hybrid high-order methods stabilized by polynomial extension for elliptic interface problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose the design and the analysis of a novel hybrid high-order (HHO) method on unfitted meshes. HHO methods rely on a pair of unknowns, combining polynomials attached to the mesh faces and the mesh cells. In the unfitted framework, the interface can cut through the mesh cells in a very general fashion, and the polynomial unknowns are doubled in the cut cells and the cut faces. In order to avoid the ill-conditioning issues caused by the presence of small cut cells, the novel approach introduced herein is to use polynomial extensions in the definition of the gradient reconstruction operator. Stability and consistency results are established, leading to optimally decaying error estimates. The theory is illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Linear, decoupled and positivity-preserving staggered mesh schemes for general dissipative systems with arbitrary energy distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel staggered mesh (SM) approach for general nonlinear dissipative systems with arbitrary energy distributions (including cases with known or unknown energy lower bounds). Based on this framework, we propose several second-order semi-discrete schemes that maintain linearity, computational decoupling, and unconditional energy stability. Firstly, for dissipative systems with known energy lower bounds, we introduce a positive auxiliary variable $V(t)$ to substitute the total energy functional, subsequently discretizing it on staggered temporal meshes to ensure that the energy remains non-increasing regardless of the size of time step. The newly developed schemes achieve full computational decoupling, maintaining essentially the same computational expense as conventional implicit-explicit methods while demonstrating significantly improved accuracy. Furthermore, we rigorously establish the positivity preservation of the discrete variable $V^{n+1/2}$ which is a crucial property ensuring numerical stability and accuracy. Theoretical analysis confirms second-order temporal convergence for the proposed SM schemes. Secondly, for dissipative systems lacking well-defined energy lower bounds, we devise an alternative auxiliary variable formulation and extend the SM framework to maintain unconditional energy stability while preserving numerical effectiveness and accuracy. Finally, comprehensive numerical experiments, including benchmark problem simulations, validate the proposed schemes' efficacy and demonstrate their superior performance characteristics.</description>

      <title>Efficient stochastic asymptotic-preserving scheme for tumor growth models with uncertain parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a class of tumor growth models governed by porous medium-type equations with uncertainties arisen from the growth function, initial condition, tumor support radius or other parameters in the model. We develop a stochastic asymptotic preservation (s-AP) scheme in the generalized polynomial chaos-stochastic Galerkin (gPC-SG) framework, which remains robust for all index parameters $m\geq 2$. The regularity of the solution to porous medium equations in the random space is studied, and we show the s-AP property, ensuring the convergence of SG system on the continuous level to that of Hele-Shaw dynamics as $m \to \infty$. Our numerical experiments, including capturing the behaviours such as finger-like projection, proliferating, quiescent and dead cell's evolution, validate the accuracy and efficiency of our designed scheme. The numerical results can describe the impact of stochastic parameters on tumor interface evolutions and pattern formations.</description>

      <title>Normal-normal continuous symmetric stresses in mixed finite element elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical continuous mixed formulation of linear elasticity with pointwise symmetric stresses allows for a conforming finite element discretization with piecewise polynomials of degree at least three. Symmetric stress approximations of lower polynomial order are only possible when their div-conformity is weakened to the continuity of normal-normal components. In two dimensions, this condition is meant pointwise along edges for piecewise polynomials, but a corresponding characterization for general piecewise H(div) tensors has been elusive. We introduce such a space and establish a continuous mixed formulation of linear planar elasticity with pointwise symmetric stresses that have, in a distributional sense, continuous normal-normal components across the edges of a shape-regular triangulation. The displacement is split into an $L_2$ field and a tangential trace on the skeleton of the mesh. The well-posedness of the new mixed formulation follows with a duality lemma relating the normal-normal continuous stresses with the tangential traces of displacements. For this new formulation we present a lowest-order conforming discretization. Stresses are approximated by piecewise quadratic symmetric tensors, whereas displacements are discretized by piecewise linear polynomials. The tangential displacement trace acts as a Lagrange multiplier and guarantees global div-conformity in the limit as the mesh-size tends to zero. We prove locking-free, quasi-optimal convergence of our scheme and illustrate this with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Sinc-collocation methods for Volterra-Fredholm integral equations of the second kind and their theoretical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sinc-collocation methods for Volterra-Fredholm integral equations of the second kind were proposed in 2012 and 2013 by multiple authors independently. Their theoretical analyses and numerical experiments suggest that the presented methods can attain root-exponential convergence. However, convergence of those methods was not strictly proved. This study first improves their methods to be easy to implement, and provides a convergence theorem of the improved method. For the same equations, another Sinc-collocation method was proposed in 2016. The method is regarded as improvement of the variable transformation in the method proposed in 2012. The method in 2016 may attain a higher rate than that of the previous methods, but its convergence was not strictly proved. For the method in 2016 as well, this study improves it to be easy to implement, and provides a convergence theorem.</description>

      <title>Numerical and statistical analysis of NeuralODE with Runge-Kutta time integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NeuralODE is one example for generative machine learning based on the push forward of a simple source measure with a bijective mapping, which in the case of NeuralODE is given by the flow of a ordinary differential equation. Using Liouville's formula, the log-density of the push forward measure is easy to compute and thus NeuralODE can be trained based on the maximum Likelihood method such that the Kulback-Leibler divergence between the push forward through the flow map and the target measure generating the data becomes small. In this work, we give a detailed account on the consistency of Maximum Likelihood based empirical risk minimization for a generic class of target measures. In contrast to prior work, we do not only consider the statistical learning theory, but also give a detailed numerical analysis of the NeuralODE algorithm based on the 2nd order Runge-Kutta (RK) time integration. Using the universal approximation theory for deep ReQU networks, the stability and convergence rated for the RK scheme as well as metric entropy and concentration inequalities, we are able to prove that NeuralODE is a probably approximately correct (PAC) learning algorithm.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Detection For Early Term Fault-Tolerant Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error detection (QED) offers a promising pathway to fault tolerance in near-term quantum devices by balancing error suppression with minimal resource overhead. However, its practical utility hinges on optimizing design parameters-such as syndrome measurement frequency-to avoid diminishing returns from detection overhead. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for fault-tolerant compilation and simulation of quantum algorithms using [[n, n-2, 2]] codes, which enable low-qubit-overhead error detection and a simple nearly fault-tolerant universal set of operations. We demonstrate and analyze our pipeline with a purely statistical interpretation and through the implementation of Grover's search algorithm. Our results are used to answer the question is quantum error detection a worthwhile avenue for early-term fault tolerance, and if so how can we get the most out of it? Simulations under the circuit-level noise model reveal that finding optimal syndrome schedules improves algorithm success probabilities by an average of 6.7x but eventual statistical limits from post-selection in noisy/resource-limited regimes constrain scalability. Furthermore, we propose a simple data-driven approach to predict fault tolerant compilation parameters, such as optimal syndrome schedules, and expected fault tolerant performance gains based on circuit and noise features. These results provide actionable guidelines for implementing QED in early-term quantum experiments and underscore its role as a pragmatic, constant-overhead error mitigation layer for shallow algorithms. To aid in further research, we release all simulation data computed for this work and provide an experimental QED compiler at https://codeqraft.xyz/qed.</description>

      <title>Superconvergent Discontinuous Galerkin Method for the Scalar Teukolsky Equation on Hyperboloidal Domains: Efficient Waveform and Self-Force Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long-time evolution of extreme mass-ratio inspiral systems requires minimal phase and dispersion errors to accurately compute far-field waveforms, while high accuracy is essential near the smaller black hole (modeled as a Dirac delta distribution) for self-force computations. Spectrally accurate methods, such as nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, are well suited for these tasks. Their numerical errors typically decrease as $\propto (\Delta x)^{N+1}$, where $\Delta x$ is the subdomain size and $N$ is the polynomial degree of the approximation. However, certain DG schemes exhibit superconvergence, where truncation, phase, and dispersion errors can decrease as fast as $\propto (\Delta x)^{2N+1}$. Superconvergent numerical solvers are, by construction, extremely efficient and accurate. We theoretically demonstrate that our DG scheme for the scalar Teukolsky equation with a distributional source is superconvergent, and this property is retained when combined with the hyperboloidal layer compactification technique. This ensures that waveforms, total energy and angular-momentum fluxes, and self-force computations benefit from superconvergence. We empirically verify this behavior across a family of hyperboloidal layer compactifications with varying degrees of smoothness. Additionally, we show that self-force quantities for circular orbits, computed at the point particle's location, also exhibit a certain degree of superconvergence. Our results underscore the potential benefits of numerical superconvergence for efficient and accurate gravitational waveform simulations based on DG methods.</description>

      <title>A regional implementation of a mixed finite-element, semi-implicit dynamical core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores how to adapt a new dynamical core to enable its use in one-way nested regional weather and climate models, where lateral boundary conditions (LBCs) are provided by a lower-resolution driving model. The dynamical core has recently been developed by the Met Office and uses an iterated-semi-implicit time discretisation and mixed finite-element spatial discretisation.
  The essential part of the adaptation is the addition of the LBCs to the right-hand-side of the linear system which solves for pressure and momentum simultaneously. The impacts on the associated Helmholtz preconditioner and multigrid techniques are also described.
  The regional version of the dynamical core is validated through big-brother experiments based on idealised dynamical core tests. These experiments demonstrate that the subdomain results are consistent with those from the full domain, confirming the correct application of LBCs. Inconsistencies arise in cases where the LBCs are not perfect, but it is shown that the application of blending can be used to overcome these problems.</description>

      <title>A hybrid SIAC -- data-driven post-processing filter for discontinuities in solutions to numerical PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a hybrid filter that is only applied to the approximation at the final time and allows for reducing errors away from a shock as well as near a shock. It is designed for discontinuous Galerkin approximations to PDEs and combines a rigorous moment-based Smoothness-Increasing Accuracy-Conserving (SIAC) filter with a data-driven CNN filter. While SIAC improves accuracy in smooth regions, it fails to reduce the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ errors near discontinuities, particularly in inviscid compressible flows with shocks. Our hybrid SIAC-CNN filter, trained exclusively on top-hat functions, enforces consistency constraints globally and higher-order moment conditions in smooth regions, reducing both $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ errors near discontinuities and preserving theoretical accuracy in smooth regions. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the Euler equations for the Lax, Sod, and Shu-Osher shock-tube problems.</description>

      <title>The eigenvalue decomposition of normal matrices by the skew-symmetric part</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method for computing the eigenvalue decomposition of a dense real normal matrix $A$ through the decomposition of its skew-symmetric part. The method relies on algorithms that are known to be efficiently implemented, such as the bidiagonal singular value decomposition and the symmetric eigenvalue decomposition. The advantages of this method stand for general normal matrices which include orthogonal matrices. We provide a stability and a complexity analysis of the method. The numerical performance is compared with existing algorithms. In most cases, the method has the same operation count as the Hessenberg factorization of a dense matrix. Finally, we provide experiments for the application of a Karcher mean on the special orthogonal group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a class of non-oscillatory, entropy-stable discontinuous Galerkin (NOES-DG) schemes for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. By incorporating a specific form of artificial viscosity, our new scheme directly controls entropy production and suppresses spurious oscillations. To address the stiffness introduced by the artificial terms, which can restrict severely time step sizes, we employ the integration factor strong stability-preserving Runge-Kutta method for time discretization. Furthermore, our method remains compatible with positivity-preserving limiters under suitable CFL conditions in extreme cases. Various numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme, showing that it maintains high-order accuracy in smooth regions and avoids spurious oscillations near discontinuities.</description>

      <title>Compatible finite element interpolated neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the finite element interpolated neural network (FEINN) framework from partial differential equations (PDEs) with weak solutions in $H^1$ to PDEs with weak solutions in $H(\textbf{curl})$ or $H(\textbf{div})$. To this end, we consider interpolation trial spaces that satisfy the de Rham Hilbert subcomplex, providing stable and structure-preserving neural network discretisations for a wide variety of PDEs. This approach, coined compatible FEINNs, has been used to accurately approximate the $H(\textbf{curl})$ inner product. We numerically observe that the trained network outperforms finite element solutions by several orders of magnitude for smooth analytical solutions. Furthermore, to showcase the versatility of the method, we demonstrate that compatible FEINNs achieve high accuracy in solving surface PDEs such as the Darcy equation on a sphere. Additionally, the framework can integrate adaptive mesh refinements to effectively solve problems with localised features. We use an adaptive training strategy to train the network on a sequence of progressively adapted meshes. Finally, we compare compatible FEINNs with the adjoint neural network method for solving inverse problems. We consider a one-loop algorithm that trains the neural networks for unknowns and missing parameters using a loss function that includes PDE residual and data misfit terms. The algorithm is applied to identify space-varying physical parameters for the $H(\textbf{curl})$ model problem from partial or noisy observations. We find that compatible FEINNs achieve accuracy and robustness comparable to, if not exceeding, the adjoint method in these scenarios.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error estimates for the Lindblad master equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09607v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in the simulation of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. To simulate the solution of this equation, the standard approach involves two sequential approximations: first, we truncate the Hilbert space to derive a differential equation in a finite-dimensional subspace. Then, we use discrete time-step to obtain a numerical solution to the finite-dimensional evolution.
  In this paper, we establish bounds for these two approximations that can be explicitely computed to guarantee the accuracy of the numerical results. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate the efficiency of our method, empirically highlighting the tightness of the upper bound. While adaptive time-stepping is already a common practice in the time discretization of the Lindblad equation, we extend this approach by showing how to dynamically adjust the truncation of the Hilbert space. This enables fully adaptive simulations of the density matrix. For large-scale simulations, this approach significantly reduces computational time and relieves users of the challenge of selecting an appropriate truncation.</description>

      <title>Localization of tumor through a non-conventional numerical shape optimization technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method for estimating the shape and location of an embedded tumor. The approach utilizes shape optimization techniques, applying the coupled complex boundary method. By rewriting the problem--characterized by a measured temperature profile and corresponding flux (e.g., from infrared thermography)--into a complex boundary value problem with a complex Robin boundary condition, the method simplifies the over-specified nature of the problem. The size and location of the tumor are identified by optimizing a cost function based on the imaginary part of the solution across the domain. Shape sensitivity analysis is conducted to compute the shape derivative of the functional. An iterative algorithm, which uses the Riesz representative of the gradient, is developed to numerically determine the geometry of the tumor via the finite element method. Additionally, we analyze the mesh sensitivity of the finite element solution of the associated state problem and derive a bound on its variation in terms of mesh deformation and its gradient. The result, valid in any dimension, applies to arbitrary unstructured simplicial meshes and finite element approximations. Numerical examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A mesh-constrained discrete point method for incompressible flows with moving boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17542v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle-based methods are a practical tool in computational fluid dynamics, and novel types of methods have been proposed. However, widely developed Lagrangian-type formulations suffer from the nonuniform distribution of particles, which is enhanced over time and result in problems in computational efficiency and parallel computations. To mitigate these problems, a mesh-constrained discrete point (MCD) method was developed for stationary boundary problems (Matsuda et al., 2022). Although the MCD method is a meshless method that uses moving least-squares approximation, the arrangement of particles (or discrete points (DPs)) is specialized so that their positions are constrained in background meshes to obtain a closely uniform distribution. This achieves a reasonable approximation for spatial derivatives with compact stencils without encountering any ill-posed condition and leads to good performance in terms of computational efficiency. In this study, a novel meshless method based on the MCD method for incompressible flows with moving boundaries is proposed. To ensure the mesh constraint of each DP in moving boundary problems, a novel updating algorithm for the DP arrangement is developed so that the position of DPs is not only rearranged but the DPs are also reassigned the role of being on the boundary or not. The proposed method achieved reasonable results in numerical experiments for well-known moving boundary problems.</description>

Abstract: Estimating parameters of a diffusion process given continuous-time observations of the process via maximum likelihood approaches or, online, via stochastic gradient descent or Kalman filter formulations constitutes a well-established research area. It has also been established previously that these techniques are, in general, not robust to perturbations in the data in the form of temporal correlations of the driving noise. While the subject is relatively well understood and appropriate modifications have been suggested in the context of multi-scale diffusion processes and their reduced model equations, we consider here an alternative but related setting where a diffusion process in positions and velocities is only observed via its positions. In this note, we propose a simple modification to standard stochastic gradient descent and Kalman filter formulations, which eliminates the arising systematic estimation biases. The modification can be extended to standard maximum likelihood approaches and avoids computation of previously proposed correction terms.</description>

      <title>A Heterogeneous Multiscale Method for Efficient Simulation of Power Systems with Inverter-Based Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As inverter-based resources (IBRs) penetrate power systems, the dynamics become more complex, exhibiting multiple timescales, including electromagnetic transient (EMT) dynamics of power electronic controllers and electromechanical dynamics of synchronous generators. Consequently, the power system model becomes highly stiff, posing a challenge for efficient simulation using existing methods that focus on dynamics within a single timescale. This paper proposes a Heterogeneous Multiscale Method for highly efficient multi-timescale simulation of a power system represented by its EMT model. The new method alternates between the microscopic EMT model of the system and an automatically reduced macroscopic model, varying the step size accordingly to achieve significant acceleration while maintaining accuracy in both fast and slow dynamics of interests. It also incorporates a semi-analytical solution method to enable a more adaptive variable-step mechanism. The new simulation method is illustrated using a two-area system and is then tested on a detailed EMT model of the IEEE 39-bus system.</description>
