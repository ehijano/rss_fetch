      <title>Machine and Deep Learning Regression for Compact Object Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central open problem in nuclear physics is the determination of a physically robust equation of state (EoS) for dense nuclear matter, which directly informs our understanding of the internal composition and macroscopic properties of compact objects such as neutron stars and quark stars. Traditional efforts have relied primarily on theoretical modeling grounded in nuclear and particle physics, with subsequent validation against empirical constraints from heavy ion collisions and, increasingly, multimessenger astrophysical observations. Recent developments, however, have introduced complementary analytical strategies that merge theoretical modeling with advanced data driven methodologies. In particular, Bayesian inference, machine learning, and deep learning have emerged as powerful tools for constraining the EoS and extracting physical insight from complex observational datasets. In this work, we employ state of the art machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze mass radius relations of compact objects with the aim of reconstructing or inferring their underlying equations of state. The analysis is based on an extensive library of physically consistent, multimodal EoSs for neutron stars and a corresponding set for quark stars, each constructed to satisfy established theoretical and observational constraints. By leveraging the predictive capacity of these computational frameworks, we demonstrate the potential of data-driven approaches to provide refined insights into the behavior of matter at supranuclear densities and to contribute to a more unified understanding of the dense matter EoS.</description>

      <title>Topical issue on the intersection of low-energy nuclear structure and high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy heavy-ion physics and low-energy nuclear structure physics have historically been disconnected fields. The hydrodynamic description of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) requires input from nuclear structure to model the initial states of the colliding nuclei. Advances in both theory and experiment now show that the hydrodynamic evolution of the QGP is sensitive to the detailed features of the colliding nuclei, with remarkable consequences for experimental observables.
  The topical collection represents a joint effort between the low- and high-energy nuclear communities, reflecting the growing recognition that precision modeling of nuclear structure is essential for interpreting high-energy collision data. This new experimental approach opens outstanding opportunities to deepen our understanding of strong-interaction matter. Indeed, by probing many-body correlations of nucleons directly in the nuclear ground state, high-energy collisions provide a unique way to "image" nuclei, fully complementary to the techniques of low-energy experiments, where nuclear collectivity is usually inferred from spectroscopic information on excited states.
  Do emergent many-body QCD phenomena in nuclei manifest consistently across experiments and energy scales? Addressing this question requires synergy between collider data and state-of-the-art nuclear structure calculations. In view of the rapid progress of ab initio methods based on low-energy effective field theories of QCD, the implications are far-reaching: heavy-ion collisions can probe nuclear forces, while nuclear structure insights refine our understanding of QGP dynamics.</description>

      <title>Jet Charge with Global Event Shapes: Probing Quark Flavor Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose measuring the jet electric charge of jet regions, defined within the framework of global event shapes, as a probe of quark flavor dynamics within the nucleon and the hadronization process. In particular, we consider a measurement of the jet region charge while simultaneously keeping track of the energy flow throughout the event, as characterized by the global event shape. As a concrete example, we focus on the measurement of the 1-Jettiness jet charge ($Q$), the jet charge of the jet region ($J$) defined within the framework of the 1-Jettiness global event shape ($\tau_1$) for the Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) process, $e^- + p \to e^- + J + X$, with unpolarized or longitudinally polarized protons. The 1-Jettiness distribution, binned according to jet charge, allows for enhanced quark flavor separation of the initial state unpolarized or polarized PDFs. On the other hand, the jet charge distribution binned by 1-Jettiness can serve as a probe of quark flavor dynamics in the final state hadronization process. We derive a factorization theorem for simultaneous measurements of $\tau_1$ and $Q$ in the resummation region, $\tau_1 \ll P_{J_T}$, where $P_{J_T}$ denotes the transverse momentum of the jet region. The factorization theorem contains a new universal charged jet function, generalizing the standard jet function to include a jet charge measurement. Therefore these universal functions can be extracted from a global analysis of N-jettiness and thrust at $e^+e^-$ colliders. We provide simulation studies to demonstrate the sensitivity of the 1-Jettiness jet charge observable to quark flavor dynamics in nucleon structure and explore the possibility of probing the final state hadronization process. This observable is well-suited for applications in existing HERA data and the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).</description>

      <title>A Framework for Quantum Simulations of Energy-Loss and Hadronization in Non-Abelian Gauge Theories: SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory in 1+1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of energy loss and hadronization are essential for understanding a range of phenomena in non-equilibrium strongly-interacting matter. We establish a framework for performing such simulations on a quantum computer and apply it to a heavy quark moving across a modest-sized 1+1D SU(2) lattice of light quarks. Conceptual advances with regard to simulations of non-Abelian versus Abelian theories are developed, allowing for the evolution of the energy in light quarks, of their local non-Abelian charge densities, and of their multi-partite entanglement to be computed. The non-trivial action of non-Abelian charge operators on arbitrary states suggests mapping the heavy quarks to qubits alongside the light quarks, and limits the heavy-quark motion to discrete steps among spatial lattice sites. Further, the color entanglement among the heavy quarks and light quarks is implemented using hadronic operators, and Domain Decomposition is shown to be effective in quantum state preparation. Scalable quantum circuits that account for the heterogeneity of non-Abelian charge sectors across the lattice are used to prepare the interacting ground-state wavefunction in the presence of heavy quarks. The discrete motion of heavy quarks between adjacent spatial sites is implemented using fermionic SWAP operations. Quantum simulations of the dynamics of a system on $L=3$ spatial sites are performed using IBM's ${\tt ibm\_pittsburgh}$ quantum computer using 18 qubits, for which the circuits for state preparation, motion, and one second-order Trotter step of time evolution have a two-qubit depth of 398. A suite of error mitigation techniques are used to extract the observables from the simulations, providing results that are in good agreement with classical simulations. The framework presented here generalizes straightforwardly to other non-Abelian groups, including SU(3) for quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Production of Light Nuclei in Au+Au Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 7.7-27$ GeV from STAR BES-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The studies of the production of light nuclei, such as deuteron and helium nuclei, in heavy-ion collisions are essential for understanding the dynamics of nuclear matter under extreme conditions. The yields and ratios of light nuclei serve as an effective method to distinguish between the thermal and coalescence models of light nuclei formation. Within the coalescence framework, the energy dependence of the coalescence parameters reflects the effective volume of the collision system, while in the thermal model yields are governed by chemical freeze-out conditions. The significantly larger datasets from the STAR Beam Energy Scan Phase II (BES-II), combined with enhanced detector capabilities, allow more precise and comprehensive measurements than phase I.
  In these proceedings, we present measurements of light nuclei production, including p, $\rm \bar{p}$, d, $\rm \bar{d}$, $\rm ^3He$, in Au+Au collisions at BES-II energies of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 7.7 - 27$ GeV. The results include centrality-dependent transverse momentum spectra and yields ($\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}y$), along with coalescence parameters $B_\mathrm{A}$ and particle yield ratios. The physics implications of these results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Nuclear parameter inference with semi-agnostic priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio pulsar timing, X-ray pulse profile modeling or gravitational-wave detections of binary mergers involving at least one neutron star offer the opportunity to elucidate the properties of dense and neutron rich matter in thermodynamic regimes inaccessible to nuclear laboratories. Such inference relies on building appropriate equation-of-state priors, such as the recently introduced semi-agnostic constructions that incorporate nuclear theory and experimental information available in low to intermediate density regimes, while offering the necessary flexibility at high density. In this paper, we assess how detections of mass, radius, and tidal deformability for low-mass ($\sim 1$M$_{\odot}$) or high-mass ($\sim 1.9$M$_{\odot}$) neutron stars would contribute to constraining nuclear empirical parameters in an inference based on semi-agnostic equation-of-state priors. We first assessed the correlation factors between nuclear empirical parameters and the zero-temperature and $\beta$-equilibrated pressure in different regimes of density. We then simulate observations for three nucleonic equations of state to test the recovery of the corresponding nuclear empirical parameters. We show that not all nuclear empirical parameters significantly correlate with the pressure and find a competition between them in the high-density regime that challenges their inference. We also find that using semi-agnostic constructions instead of assuming a nucleonic content up to the highest densities in the neutron-star core can help recover more accurately the true nuclear empirical parameters. Parameterizing the high-density regime of the equation of state with the nucleonic meta-model can pollute the inference of nuclear empirical parameters; semi-agnostic constructions are a solution to that. However, many nuclear matter empirical parameters contribute in a similar way to the building of baryonic pressure.</description>

      <title>Lattice field theory for superconducting circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large superconducting quantum circuits have a number of important applications in quantum computing. Accurately predicting the performance of these devices from first principles is challenging, as it requires solving the many-body Schr\"odinger equation. This work introduces a new, general ab-initio method for analyzing large quantum circuits based on lattice field theory, a tool commonly applied in nuclear and particle physics. This method is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques such as tensor networks, but avoids introducing systematic errors due to truncation of the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space associated with superconducting phases. The approach is applied to fluxonium, a specific many-component superconducting qubit with favorable qualities for quantum computation. A systematic study of the influence of impedance on fluxonium is conducted that parallels previous experimental studies, and ground capacitance effects are explored. The qubit frequency and charge noise dephasing rate are extracted from statistical analyses of charge noise, where thousands of instantiations of charge disorder in the Josephson junction array of a fixed fluxonium qubit are explicitly averaged over at the microscopic level. This is difficult to achieve with any other existing method.</description>

      <title>Differentially rotating neutron stars with dark matter cores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter is expected to accumulate inside neutron stars, modifying the structure of isolated stars and influencing both the dynamics of binary mergers and the evolution of the resulting hypermassive remnants. Since differential rotation is the primary mechanism delaying the collapse of these remnants, understanding its behavior is crucial when assessing the impact of an embedded dark component. In this work, we extend the numerical code RNS to describe two gravitationally coupled fluids in differential rotation, with baryonic matter modeled by a realistic nuclear equation of state and dark matter represented as a self-interacting bosonic condensate. Within this framework, we construct equilibrium sequences for a representative differential rotation law, providing a basis to explore how dark matter may influence the global properties and rotational dynamics of binary neutron star remnants.</description>

      <title>Exploratory study on the masses of odd-$Z$ nuclei and $r$-process simulation based on the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear masses of exotic nuclei are important for both nuclear physics and astrophysics. The deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) is capable of providing proper descriptions for exotic nuclei by simultaneously including deformation, pairing correlation and continuum effects, and a mass table of even-$Z$ nuclei with $8 \leqslant Z \leqslant 120$ has been developed based on the DRHBc theory. This work employs a methodology to estimate the masses of odd nuclei using neighboring even nuclei's masses and microscopic pairing gaps, and the performance of microscopic pairing gaps are validated by comparing with empirical ones. Combining the DRHBc masses of even-$Z$ nuclei and the estimated masses of odd-$Z$ nuclei, a pseudo DRHBc mass table is developed, with the root-mean-square (rms) deviation from available mass data $\sigma=1.47$ MeV. Then this mass table is employed in the $r$-process simulation; results show that the differences in the details of pairing gaps do not yield qualitative discrepancy in $r$-process abundances, while the deformation effects can influence the $r$-process path and thus affect the $r$-process abundance. In particular, the nuclear shape transitions can even lead to the discontinuity of the $r$-process path, suggesting that incorporating triaxiality or beyond-mean-field effects would be valuable for further improvement.</description>

      <title>Rapidity spectra in high-energy collisions and longitudinal nuclear suppression from nonadditive statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the longitudinal nuclear suppression factor defined by a scaled ratio of rapidity distributions. To study this experimental observable, we describe three approaches involving numerical and analytical calculations. We first approach this problem by conducting model studies using EPOS, FTFP$_{BERT}$, and HIJING, and notice that while EPOS shows a decreasing trend of this ratio at forward/backward rapidities, the latter two model calculations display an increment of the ratio. The analytical approaches involve, first, the quasi-exponential distribution obtained from the Tsallis statistics, and second, the nonadditive Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation time approximation. We notice that our analytical results satisfactorily describe NA61 experimental data (for $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=6.3, 7.6, 8.8, 12.3, and 17.3 GeV) for the negatively charged pions.</description>

      <title>Modifications in clusterization procedures for heavy-ion collisions: minimum spanning tree, simulated annealing, coalescence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new open-source cluster finding library ''Common Clusterization Library'' (CCL) is proposed to describe the clusters production when applied to the transport codes. The new library was applied to the Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics approach to be comparable with the established and well known MST and SACA implementations on the exactly same set of the events. The presented procedures were tested with rapidity density distributions and complex observables like $\langle M_{imf} \rangle$ and $\langle Z_{\text{max}} \rangle$ vs $Z_{bound}2$ at the energies of ALADiN and NA49 experiments. An improvement to the simulated annealing chain is proposed to reduce the computational time. The new stable clusters tracking algorithm for the ''lost'' cluster recovering is presented. The results of the ''box-like'' coalescence procedure and a mixed method which incorporates the coalescence algorithm steps and the negative binding energy criteria are presented. The difference between the Helium-3 found by the MST-based cluster finding procedure and the coalescence algorithm applied on the exactly same set of events and baryons is shown for the first time.</description>
