      <title>On the smoothing theory delooping of disc diffeomorphism and embedding spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Morlet-Burghelea-Lashof-Kirby-Siebenmann smoothing theory theorem states that the group $\mathrm{Diff}_\partial(D^n)$ of diffeomorphisms of a disc $D^n$ relative to the boundary is equivalent to $\Omega^{n+1}\left(\mathrm{PL}_n/\mathrm{O}_n\right)$ for any $n\geq 1$ and to $\Omega^{n+1}\left(\mathrm{TOP}_n/\mathrm{O}_n\right)$ for $n\neq 4$. We revise smoothing theory results to show that the delooping generalizes to different versions of disc smooth embedding spaces relative to the boundary, namely the usual embeddings, those modulo immersions, and framed embeddings. The latter spaces deloop as $\mathrm{Emb}_\partial^{fr}(D^m,D^n)\simeq\Omega^{m+1}\left(\mathrm{O}_n\backslash\!\!\backslash\mathrm{PL}_n/\mathrm{PL}_{n,m}\right)\simeq \Omega^{m+1}\left(\mathrm{O}_n\backslash\!\!\backslash\mathrm{TOP}_n/\mathrm{TOP}_{n,m}\right)$ for any $n\geq m\geq 1$ ($n\neq 4$ for the second equivalence), where the left-hand side in the case $n-m=2$ or $(n,m)=(4,3)$ should be replaced by the union of the path-components of $\mathrm{PL}$-trivial knots (framing being disregarded). Moreover, we show that for $n\neq 4$, the delooping is compatible with the Budney $E_{m+1}$-action. We use this delooping to combine the Hatcher $\mathrm{O}_{m+1}$-action and the Budney $E_{m+1}$-action into a framed little discs operad $E_{m+1}^{\mathrm{O}_{m+1}}$-action on $\mathrm{Emb}_\partial^{fr}(D^m,D^n)$.</description>

      <title>Squared Distance Function on the Configuration Space of a planar Spider with Applications to Hooke Energy and Voronoi Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spider mechanisms are the simplest examples of arachnoid mechanisms, they are one step more complicated than polygonal linkages. Their configuration spaces have been studied intensively, but are yet not completely understood. In the paper we study them using the Morse theory of the squared distance function from the "body" of the spider to some fixed point in the plane. Generically, it is a Morse-Bott function. We list its critical manifolds, describe them as products of polygon spaces, and derive a formula for their Morse-Bott indices. We apply the obtained results to Hooke energy and Voronoi distance.</description>

      <title>An iterable surgery formula on involutive knot lattice homotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ``Knots in lattice homology", Ozsv\'ath, Stipsicz, and Szab\'o showed that knot lattice homology satisfies a surgery formula similar to the one relating knot Floer homology and Heegaard Floer homology, and in previous work, I showed that knot lattice homology is the persistent homology of a doubly filtered space. Here I provide an iterable version of the surgery formula that, provided the initial knot lattice space with flip map, produces a space isomorphic as a doubly-filtered space to the corresponding knot lattice space for the dual knot with the corresponding flip map. If we include the involutive data for the original knot and ambient three-manifold, we can also produce the corresponding involutive data on the new knot lattice space without assuming that the original three-manifold is an $L$-space. I construct $\infty$-categories where these operations are functorial. Finally, I use the surgery formula to compute some examples of knot lattice spaces including for the regular fiber of $\Sigma(2,3,7)$ and for a knot in a three-manifold that is not given by an almost rational graph.</description>

      <title>The classification of links up to clasp-pass moves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a complete classification of links up to clasp-pass moves, which coincides with Habiro's $C_3$-equivalence. We also classify links up to band-pass and band-# moves, which are versions of the usual pass- and #-move, respectively, where each pair of parallel strands belong to the same component. This recovers and generalizes widely a number of partial results in the study of these local moves. The proofs make use of clasper theory.</description>

      <title>Mapping classes of Real Rational Surface Automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\{F_n, n\ge 8\}$ be a family of diffeomorphisms on real rational surfaces that are birationally equivalent to birational maps on $\mathbf{P}^2(\mathbb{R})$. In this article, we investigate the mapping classes of the diffeomorphisms $F_n, n\ge 8$. These diffeomorphisms are reducible with unique invariant irreducible curves, and we determine the mapping classes of their restrictions, $\hat F_n, n \ge 8$, on the cut surfaces, showing that they are pseudo-Anosov and do not arise from Penner's construction. For $n=8$, Lehmer's number is realized as the stretch factor of $\hat F_8$, a pseudo-Anosov map on a once-punctured genus $5$ orientable surface. The diffeomorphism $\hat F_8$ is a new geometric realization of a Lehmer's number.</description>

      <title>Non-semisimple $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ quantum invariants of fibred links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Akutsu-Deguchi-Ohtsuki (ADO) invariants are the most studied quantum link invariants coming from a non-semisimple tensor category. We show that, for fibered links in $S^3$, the degree of the ADO invariant is determined by the genus and the top coefficient is a root of unity. More precisely, we prove that the top coefficient is determined by the Hopf invariant of the plane field of $S^3$ associated to the fiber surface. Our proof is based on the genus bounds established in our previous work, together with a theorem of Giroux-Goodman stating that fiber surfaces in the three-sphere can be obtained from a disk by plumbing/deplumbing Hopf bands.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:1502.04470v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a smooth manifold $N$ denote by $E^m(N)$ the set of smooth isotopy classes of smooth embeddings $N\to\mathbb R^m$. A description of the set $E^m(S^p\times S^q)$ was known only for $p=q=0$ or for $p=0$, $m\ne q+2$ or for $2m\ge 2(p+q)+\max\{p,q\}+4$. (The description was given in terms of homotopy groups of spheres and of Stiefel manifolds.) For $m\ge2p+q+3$ we introduce an abelian group structure on $E^m(S^p\times S^q)$ and describe this group `up to an extension problem'. This result has corollaries which, under stronger dimension restrictions, more explicitly describe $E^m(S^p\times S^q)$. The proof is based on relations between sets $E^m(N)$ for different $N$ and $m$, in particular, on a recent exact sequence of M. Skopenkov.</description>

      <title>Universal invariants, the Conway polynomial and the Casson-Walker-Lescop invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.05527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a general surgery formula for the Casson-Walker-Lescop invariant of closed 3-manifolds, seen as the leading term of the LMO invariant, in a purely diagrammatic and combinatorial way. This provides a new viewpoint on a formula established by C. Lescop for her extension of the Walker invariant. A central ingredient in our proof is an explicit identification of the coefficients of the Conway polynomial as combinations of coefficients in the Kontsevich integral. This latter result relies on general \lq factorization formulas\rq\, for the Kontsevich integral coefficients.</description>

      <title>The band connected sum and the second Kirby move for higher-dimensional links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f:S^q\sqcup S^q\to S^m$ be a link (i.e. an embedding).
  How does (the isotopy class of) the knot $S^q\to S^m$ obtained by embedded connected sum of the components of $f$ depend on $f$?
  Define a link $\sigma f:S^q\sqcup S^q\to S^m$ as follows. The first component of $\sigma f$ is the `standardly shifted' first component of $f$. The second component of $\sigma f$ is the embedded connected sum of the components of $f$. How does (the isotopy class of) $\sigma f$ depend on $f$?
  How does (the isotopy class of) the link $S^q\sqcup S^q\to S^m$ obtained by embedded connected sum of the last two components of a link $g:S^q_1\sqcup S^q_2\sqcup S^q_3\to S^m$ depend on $g$?
  We give the answers for the `first non-trivial case' $q=4k-1$ and $m=6k$. The first answer was used by S. Avvakumov for classification of linked 3-manifolds in $S^6$.</description>

      <title>Spherical volume and spherical Plateau problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.10636v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a closed oriented manifold or more generally a group homology class, we introduce the spherical Plateau problem, which is a variational problem corresponding to a topological invariant called the spherical volume. In principle, its solutions should be realized by minimal surfaces in quotients of spheres. We explain that in many geometrically interesting cases, those solutions are essentially unique. We start with a review of the Ambrosio-Kirchheim theory of metric currents, and the barycenter map method developed by Besson-Courtois-Gallot. Then, we outline the following applications: (1) the intrinsic uniqueness of spherical Plateau solutions for negatively curved, locally symmetric, closed oriented manifolds, (2) the intrinsic uniqueness of spherical Plateau solutions for all 3-dimensional closed oriented manifolds, (3) the construction of higher-dimensional analogues of hyperbolic Dehn fillings. We also propose some open questions.</description>

      <title>The Kervaire conjecture and the minimal complexity of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kervaire conjecture asserts that adding a generator and then a relator to a nontrivial group always results in a nontrivial group. We introduce new methods from stable commutator length to study this type of problems about nontriviality of one-relator quotients. Roughly, we show that surfaces in certain HNN extensions bounding a given word have complexity no less than the complexity of its boundary. A consequence of this is a Freiheitssatz theorem for HNN extensions, which in particular implies and gives a new proof of Klyachko's theorem that confirms the Kervaire conjecture for torsion-free groups. As another application, we also generalize the following theorem of Klyachko-Lurye to HNN extensions: For any group $G$ and the quotient $Q$ of $G\star\mathbb{Z}$ by any proper power $w^m$ with $w\in G\star\mathbb{Z}$ projecting to $1\in\mathbb{Z}$, the natural map $G\to Q$ is injective.</description>
