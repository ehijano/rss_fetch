      <title>On two problems about order sequences of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The order sequence of a finite group $G$ is a non-decreasing finite sequence formed of the element orders of $G$. Several properties of order sequences were studied by P. J. Cameron and H. K. Dey in a recent paper that concludes with a list of open problems. In this paper we solve two of these problems by showing the following facts: 1) if there is a non-supersolvable/non-solvable group of order $n$, it is not always true that its order sequence is properly dominated by the order sequence of any supersolvable/solvable group of order $n$; 2) the supersolvability of a finite group cannot be described by its order sequence.</description>

      <title>A Lie group corresponding to the free Lie algebra and its universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the real free Lie algebra $\mathfrak{fr}_n$ with generators $\omega_1$, \dots, $\omega_n$. Since it is positively graded, it has acompletion $\overline{\mathfrak{fr}}_n$ consisting of formal series. By the Campbell-Hausdorff formula, we have a corresponding Lie group $\overline{\mathrm{Fr}}_n$. It is the set $\exp\bigl(\overline{\mathfrak{fr}}_n\bigr)$ in the completed universal enveloping algebra of $\mathfrak{fr}_n$. Also, the group $\overline{\mathrm{Fr}}_n$ is a 'submanifold' in the algebra of formal associative noncommutative series in $\omega_1$, \dots, $\omega_n$, the 'submanifold' is determined by a certain system of quadratic equations. In this note, we consider a certain dense subgroup $\mathrm{Fr}_n^\infty\subset \overline{\mathrm{Fr}}_n$ with a stronger topology and show that any surjective homomorphism from $\mathfrak{fr}_n$ to a real finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ lifts to a surjective homomorphism from $\mathrm{Fr}_n^\infty$ to the corresponding simply connected Lie group $G$. Note that Pestov (1993) constructed a separable Banach-Lie group such that any separable Banach-Lie group is its quotient.</description>

      <title>Classifying finite groups G with three Aut(G)-orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a complete and irredundant list of the finite groups $G$ for which Aut$(G)$, acting naturally on $G$, has precisely $3$ orbits. There are 7 infinite families: one abelian, one non-nilpotent, three families of non-abelian $2$-groups and two families of non-abelian $p$-groups with $p$ odd. The non-abelian $2$-group examples were first classified by Bors and Glasby in 2020 and non-abelian $p$-group examples with $p$ odd were classified independently by Li and Zhu, and by the author, in March 2024.</description>

      <title>A CFSG-free explicit Jordan's theorem over arbitrary fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a version of Jordan's classification theorem for finite subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}_{n}(K)$ that is at the same time quantitatively explicit, CFSG-free, and valid for arbitrary $K$. This is the first proof to satisfy all three properties at once. Our overall strategy follows Larsen and Pink [24], with explicit computations based on techniques developed by the authors and Helfgott [2, 3], particularly in relation to dimensional estimates.</description>

      <title>Cyclicity, hypercyclicity and randomness in self-similar groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of cyclicity and hypercyclicity in self-similar groups as an analogue of cyclic and hypercyclic vectors for an operator on a Banach space. We derive a sufficient condition for cyclicity of non-finitary automorphisms in contracting discrete automata groups. In the profinite setting we prove that fractal profinite groups may be regarded as measure-preserving dynamical systems and derive a sufficient condition for the ergodicity and the mixing properties of these dynamical systems. Furthermore, we show that a Haar-random element in a super strongly fractal profinite group is hypercyclic almost surely as an application of Birkhoff's ergodic theorem for free semigroup actions.</description>

      <title>Coprime extensions of indecomposable solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a method to extend involutive nondegenerate set-theoretic solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation by means of equivariant mappings to graded modules, thus leading to the notion of a \emph{twisted extension}. Furthermore, we define coprime extensions of solutions and prove that each coprime extension of indecomposable solutions can be obtained as a suitable twisted extension. We then apply our results to obtain a full description of indecomposable solutions of size $pqr$, where $p,q,r$ are different primes, from a structure theorem of Ced\'o and Okni\'nski. We close with some remarks on a cohomology theory for solutions developed by Lebed and Vendramin. We express our results in the language of cycle sets.</description>

      <title>Artinian groups of large cardinality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A group is Artinian if there is no infinite strictly descending chain of subgroups. Ol'shanskii has asked whether there are Artinian groups of arbitrarily large cardinality. We show that this problem is essentially the same as an analogous question, regarding universal algebras, asked by J\'onsson in the 1960s. We further show that these problems are the same as the so-called free subset problem. As a result, one can have a consistent strong negative answer (from a large cardinal assumption) as well as a consistent positive answer.</description>

      <title>Infinite systems of equations in abelian and nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every abelian (and even every nilpotent) group contains a solution of any finite unimodular system of equations over itself. However, this is not true for infinite systems. We deduced a criterion for a periodic abelian group to contain a solution of any infinite unimodular system of equations over itself. Using this criterion, we show that nilpotent groups of bounded period also contain solutions of all infinite unimodular systems of equations over themselves. Solvability of every nonsingular infinite system of equations in each divisible nilpotent group is shown as well.</description>

      <title>Infinite stationary measures of co-compact group actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a finitely generated group, and let $\mu$ be a nondegenerate, finitely supported probability measure on $\Gamma$. We show that every co-compact $\Gamma$ action on a locally compact Hausdorff space admits a nonzero $\mu$-stationary Radon measure. The main ingredient of the proof is a stationary analogue of Tarski's theorem: we show that for every nonempty subset $A \subseteq \Gamma$ there is a $\mu$-stationary, finitely additive measure on $\Gamma$ that assigns unit mass to $A$.</description>

      <title>Thurston norm for coherent right-angled Artin groups via $L^2$-invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a new notion of splitting complexity for a group $G$ along a non-trivial integral character $\phi \in H^1(G; \mathbb{Z})$. If $G$ is a one-ended coherent right-angled Artin group, we show that the splitting complexity along an epimorphism $\phi \colon G \to \mathbb{Z}$ equals the $L^2$-Euler characteristic of the kernel of $\phi$. This allows us to define a Thurston-type semi-norm $\| \cdot \|_T \colon H^1(G ; \mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{R}$ that measures the splitting complexity of integral characters. Our main tool is Friedl--L\"{u}ck's $L^2$-polytope.</description>

      <title>Marked Length Spectrum Rigidity for Surface Amalgams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that simple, thick negatively curved two-dimensional P-manifolds, a large class of surface amalgams, are marked length spectrum rigid. That is, if two piecewise negatively curved Riemannian metrics (satisfying certain smoothness conditions) on a simple, thick two-dimensional P-manifold assign the same lengths to all closed geodesics, then they differ by an isometry up to isotopy. Our main theorem is a natural generalization of Croke and Otal's celebrated results about marked length spectrum rigidity of negatively curved surfaces.</description>

      <title>Representations of braid groups via cyclic covers of the sphere: Zariski closure and arithmeticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $d \geq 2$ and $n\geq 3$ be two natural numbers. Given any sequence $\kappa=(k_1,\dots,k_n) \in \mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $\gcd(k_1,\dots,k_n,d)=1$, we consider the family of Riemann surfaces obtained from the plane curves defined by $y^d=\prod_{i=1}^n(x-b_i)^{k_i}$, where $\{b_1,\dots,b_n\}$ are $n$ distinct points in $\mathbb{C}$. The monodromy of the cohomology of the fibers of this family provides us with a representation of the pure braid group $\mathrm{PB}_n$ into some symplectic group. By restricting to a specific subspace in the cohomology of the fibers, we obtain a representation $\rho_d$ of $\mathrm{PB}_n$ into a linear algebraic group defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. In a sense, $\rho_d$ is primitive with respect to the parameters $d$ and $\kappa$. The first main result of this paper is a criterion for the Zariski closure of the image of $\rho_d$ to be maximal, and the second main result is a criterion for the image to be an arithmetic lattice in the target group. The latter generalizes previous results of Venkataramana and gives an answer to a question by McMullen.</description>

      <title>Bridging Classical and Quantum: Group-Theoretic Approach to Quantum Circuit Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently simulating quantum circuits on classical computers is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. This paper presents a novel theoretical approach that achieves exponential speedups (polynomial runtime) over existing simulators for a wide class of quantum circuits. The technique leverages advanced group theory and symmetry considerations to map quantum circuits to equivalent forms amenable to efficient classical simulation. Several fundamental theorems are proven that establish the mathematical foundations of this approach, including a generalized Gottesman-Knill theorem. The potential of this method is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and preliminary benchmarks. This work contributes to the understanding of the boundary between classical and quantum computation, provides new tools for quantum circuit analysis and optimization, and opens up avenues for further research at the intersection of group theory and quantum computation. The findings may have implications for quantum algorithm design, error correction, and the development of more efficient quantum simulators.</description>
