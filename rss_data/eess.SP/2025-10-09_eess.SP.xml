      <title>Distributed Detection and Bandwidth Allocation with Hybrid Quantized and Full-Precision Observations over Multiplicative Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hybrid detector that fuses both quantized and full-precision observations is proposed for weak signal detection under additive and multiplicative Gaussian noise. We first derive a locally most powerful test (LMPT)--based hybrid detector from the composite probability distribution of the compound observations received by the fusion center, and then analyze its asymptotic detection performance. Subsequently, we optimize the sensor-wise quantization thresholds to achieve near-optimal asymptotic performance at the local sensor level. Moreover, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming approach to solve the optimization problem of transmission bandwidth allocation accounting for bandwidth constraints and error-prone channels. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed hybrid detector and the bandwidth allocation strategy, especially in challenging error-prone channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Optimized SVR Framework for Electric Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Load forecasting has always been a challenge for grid operators due to the growing complexity of power systems. The increase in extreme weather and the need for energy from customers has led to load forecasting sometimes failing. This research presents a Support Vector Regression (SVR) framework for electric load forecasting that outperforms the industry standard. The SVR model demonstrates better accuracy across all evaluation metrics that are important for power system operations. The model has a 54.2\% reduction in Mean Squared Error (31.91 vs. 69.63), a 33.5\% improvement in Mean Absolute Error, and performance benefits across other metrics. These improvements show significant benefits when integrated with power forecasting tools and show that the approach provides an additional tool for accuracy checking for system planning and resource allocation in times of need for resource allocation in electric power systems.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Multi-Static ISAC Networks: A Unified Design Framework for Active and Passive Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-static cooperative sensing emerges as a promising technology for advancing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), enhancing sensing accuracy and range. In this paper, we develop a unified design framework for joint active and passive sensing (JAPS). In particular, we consider a JAPSbased cooperative multi-static ISAC system for coexisting downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) communications. An optimization problem is formulated for maximizing the sum rate of both the DL and UL transmissions via jointly optimizing beamforming, receive filters and power allocation, while guaranteeing the sensing requirements and transmission power constraints. However, the formulated problem is a non-convex optimization problem that is challenging to solve directly due to the tight coupling among optimization variables. To tackle this complicated issue, we employ an efficient algorithm architecture leveraging alternating optimization (AO). Specifically, with the given receive filters and transmission power for UL communication, the transmit beamforming subproblem is addressed by successive convex approximation (SCA)-based and penalty-based algorithms. A fractional programming (FP)-based algorithm is developed to tackle the receive filters and transmission power for UL communication optimization subproblem. Extensive numerical results validate the performance improvement of our proposed JAPS scheme and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Personalized Federated Learning-Driven Beamforming Optimization for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an Expectation-Maximization-based (EM) Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) framework for multi-objective optimization (MOO) in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems. In contrast to standard federated learning (FL) methods that handle all clients uniformly, the proposed approach enables each base station (BS) to adaptively determine its aggregation weight with the EM algorithm. Specifically, an EM posterior is computed at each BS to quantify the relative suitability between the global and each local model, based on the losses of models on their respective datasets. The proposed method is especially valuable in scenarios with competing communication and sensing objectives, as it enables BSs to dynamically adapt to application-specific trade-offs. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct simulation studies under both objective-wise homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing PFL baselines, such as FedPer and pFedMe, achieving faster convergence and better multi-objective performance.</description>

      <title>Low Complexity Weight Flexible Decoding Schemes of Linear Block Code for 6G xURLLC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low complexity error correction code is a key enabler for next generation ultra-reliable low-latency communications (xURLLC) in six generation (6G). Against this background, this paper proposes a decoding scheme for linear block code by leveraging certain interesting properties of dual codewords. It is found that dual codewords with flexible weights can provide useful decoding information for the locations and magnitudes of error bits, which yielding higher reliability performance. In addition, two decoding schemes are proposed, in which one directly utilizes intrinsic information for iterative decoding, and the other combines prior channel information with intrinsic information for decoding. Both schemes are implemented using vector multiplication and real-number comparisons, making them easy to implement in hardware. Simulation results demonstrate the validness of our study.</description>

      <title>Mobility-Aware Localization in mmWave Channel: Adaptive Hybrid Filtering Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise user localization and tracking enhances energy-efficient and ultra-reliable low latency applications in the next generation wireless networks. In addition to computational complexity and data association challenges with Kalman-filter localization techniques, estimation errors tend to grow as the user's trajectory speed increases. By exploiting mmWave signals for joint sensing and communication, our approach dispenses with additional sensors adopted in most techniques while retaining high resolution spatial cues. We present a hybrid mobility-aware adaptive framework that selects the Extended Kalman filter at pedestrian speed and the Unscented Kalman filter at vehicular speed. The scheme mitigates data-association problem and estimation errors through adaptive noise scaling, chi-square gating, Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoothing. Evaluations using Absolute Trajectory Error, Relative Pose Error, Normalized Estimated Error Squared and Root Mean Square Error metrics demonstrate roughly 30-60% improvement in their respective regimes indicating a clear advantage over existing approaches tailored to either indoor or static settings.</description>

      <title>Memory-Augmented Generative AI for Real-time Wireless Prediction in Dynamic Industrial Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and real-time prediction of wireless channel conditions, particularly the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), is a foundational requirement for enabling Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) in highly dynamic Industry 4.0 environments. Traditional physics-based or statistical models fail to cope with the spatio-temporal complexities introduced by mobile obstacles and transient interference inherent to smart warehouses. To address this, we introduce Evo-WISVA (Evolutionary Wireless Infrastructure for Smart Warehouse using VAE), a novel synergistic deep learning architecture that functions as a lightweight 2D predictive digital twin of the radio environment. Evo-WISVA integrates a memory-augmented Variational Autoencoder (VAE) featuring an Attention-driven Latent Memory Module (LMM) for robust, context-aware spatial feature extraction, with a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network for precise temporal forecasting and sequential refinement. The entire pipeline is optimized end-to-end via a joint loss function, ensuring optimal feature alignment between the generative and predictive components. Rigorous experimental evaluation conducted on a high-fidelity ns-3-generated industrial warehouse dataset demonstrates that Evo-WISVA significantly surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 47.6\% reduction in average reconstruction error. Crucially, the model exhibits exceptional generalization capacity to unseen environments with vastly increased dynamic complexity (up to ten simultaneously moving obstacles) while maintaining amortized computational efficiency essential for real-time deployment. Evo-WISVA establishes a foundational technology for proactive wireless resource management, enabling autonomous optimization and advancing the realization of predictive digital twins in industrial communication networks.</description>

      <title>Sensing Management for Pilot-Free Predictive Beamforming in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a sensing management method for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Conventional communication systems employ channel estimation procedures that impose significant overhead during data transmission, consuming resources that could otherwise be utilized for data. To address this challenge, we propose a state-based approach that leverages sensing capabilities to track the user when there is no communication request. Upon receiving a communication request, predictive beamforming is employed based on the tracked user position, thereby reducing the need for channel estimation. Our framework incorporates an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based tracking algorithm with adaptive sensing management to perform sensing operations only when necessary to maintain high tracking accuracy. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed sensing management approach provides uniform downlink communication rates that are higher than with existing methods by achieving overhead-free predictive beamforming.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel cooperative vehicular communication algorithm tailored for future 6G ultra-massive vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks leveraging integrated space-air-ground communication systems. Specifically, we address the challenge of real-time information exchange among rapidly moving vehicles. We demonstrate the existence of an upper bound on channel capacity given a fixed number of relays, and propose a low-complexity relay selection heuristic algorithm. Simulation results verify that our proposed algorithm achieves superior channel capacities compared to existing cooperative vehicular communication approaches.</description>

      <title>Maritime Communication in Evaporation Duct Environment with Ship Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In maritime wireless networks, the evaporation duct effect has been known as a preferable condition for long-range transmissions. However, how to effectively utilize the duct effect for efficient communication design is still open for investigation. In this paper, we consider a typical scenario of ship-to-shore data transmission, where a ship collects data from multiple oceanographic buoys, sails from one to another, and transmits the collected data back to a terrestrial base station during its voyage. A novel framework, which exploits priori information of the channel gain map in the presence of evaporation duct, is proposed to minimize the data transmission time and the sailing time by optimizing the ship's trajectory. To this end, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated and is further solved by a dynamic population PSO-integrated NSGA-II algorithm. Through simulations, it is demonstrated that, compared to the benchmark scheme which ignores useful information of the evaporation duct, the proposed scheme can effectively reduce both the data transmission time and the sailing time.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Emergency Wireless Communications over SAGINs: A Composite Fading and QoS-Centric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In emergency wireless communications (EWC) scenarios, ensuring reliable, flexible, and high-rate transmission while simultaneously maintaining seamless coverage and rapid response capabilities presents a critical technical challenge. To this end, satellite-aerial-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has emerged as a promising solution due to its comprehensive three-dimensional coverage and capability to meet stringent, multi-faceted quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. Nevertheless, most existing studies either neglected the inherent characteristics of the complex channel conditions due to the terrain changes or analyzed the performance in the absence of QoS constraints, resulting in a mismatch between theoretical analysis and practical performance. To remedy such deficiencies, in this paper we establish a performance modeling framework for SAGIN employing the Fisher-Snedecor $\mathcal{F}$ composite fading model to characterize the air-ground link. In specific, the proposed $\mathcal{F}$ composite fading channel is adopted to accurately describe both multipath fading and shadowing in harsh ground environments. The exact distribution of end-to-end signal-to-noise (SNR) statistics for space-air and air-ground links is developed, enabling theoretical analysis of cascaded channels with fixed-gain amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying protocols, respectively. Furthermore, asymptotic expressions of the derived results are provided to offer concise representations and demonstrate close alignment with theoretical predictions in the high-SNR regime. Finally, the insightful closed-form and asymptotic expressions of effective capacity with QoS provisioning, outage probability, and $\epsilon$-outage capacity are investigated, respectively, followed by both field measurements and Monte Carlo simulations to verify the effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Moments Matter: Posterior Recovery in Poisson Denoising via Log-Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poisson denoising plays a central role in photon-limited imaging applications such as microscopy, astronomy, and medical imaging. It is common to train deep learning models for denoising using the mean-squared error (MSE) loss, which corresponds to computing the posterior mean $\mathbb{E}[x \mid y]$. When the noise is Gaussian, Tweedie's formula enables approximation of the posterior distribution through its higher-order moments. However, this connection no longer holds for Poisson denoising: while $ \mathbb{E}[x \mid y] $ still minimizes MSE, it fails to capture posterior uncertainty. We propose a new strategy for Poisson denoising based on training a log-network. Instead of predicting the posterior mean $ \mathbb{E}[x \mid y] $, the log-network is trained to learn $\mathbb{E}[\log x \mid y]$, leveraging the logarithm as a convenient parameterization for the Poisson distribution. We provide a theoretical proof that the proposed log-network enables recovery of higher-order posterior moments and thus supports posterior approximation. Experiments on simulated data show that our method matches the denoising performance of standard MMSE models while providing access to the posterior.</description>

      <title>PIKAN: Physics-Inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Explainable UAV Channel Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications demand accurate yet interpretable air-to-ground (A2G) channel models that can adapt to nonstationary propagation environments. While deterministic models offer interpretability and deep learning (DL) models provide accuracy, both approaches suffer from either rigidity or a lack of explainability. To bridge this gap, we propose the Physics-Inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PIKAN) that embeds physical principles (e.g., free-space path loss, two-ray reflections) into the learning process. Unlike physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), PIKAN is more flexible for applying physical information because it introduces them as flexible inductive biases. Thus, it enables a more flexible training process. Experiments on UAV A2G measurement data show that PIKAN achieves comparable accuracy to DL models while providing symbolic and explainable expressions aligned with propagation laws. Remarkably, PIKAN achieves this performance with only 232 parameters, making it up to 37 times lighter than multilayer perceptron (MLP) baselines with thousands of parameters, without sacrificing correlation with measurements and also providing symbolic expressions. These results highlight PIKAN as an efficient, interpretable, and scalable solution for UAV channel modelling in beyond-5G and 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Chem-NMF: Multi-layer $\alpha$-divergence Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for Cardiorespiratory Disease Clustering, with Improved Convergence Inspired by Chemical Catalysts and Rigorous Asymptotic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an unsupervised learning method offering low-rank representations across various domains such as audio processing, biomedical signal analysis, and image recognition. The incorporation of $\alpha$-divergence in NMF formulations enhances flexibility in optimization, yet extending these methods to multi-layer architectures presents challenges in ensuring convergence. To address this, we introduce a novel approach inspired by the Boltzmann probability of the energy barriers in chemical reactions to theoretically perform convergence analysis. We introduce a novel method, called Chem-NMF, with a bounding factor which stabilizes convergence. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a physical chemistry perspective to rigorously analyze the convergence behaviour of the NMF algorithm. We start from mathematically proven asymptotic convergence results and then show how they apply to real data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves clustering accuracy by 5.6% $\pm$ 2.7% on biomedical signals and 11.1% $\pm$ 7.2% on face images (mean $\pm$ std).</description>

      <title>Optimizing Fronthaul Quantization for Flexible User Load in Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the physical layer (PHY) spectral efficiency and fronthaul network load of a scalable user-centric cell-free massive MIMO system. Each user-centric cluster processor responsible for cluster-level signal processing is located at one of multiple decentralized units (DUs). Thus, the radio units in the cluster must exchange data with the corresponding DU over the fronthaul. Because the fronthaul links have limited capacity, this data must be quantized before it is sent over the fronthaul. We consider a routed fronthaul network, where the cluster processor placement and fronthaul traffic routing are jointly optimized with a mixed-integer linear program. For different numbers of users in the network, we investigate the effect of fronthaul quantization rates, a system parameter computed based on rate-distortion theory. Our results show that with optimized quantization rates, the fronthaul load is quite stable for a wide range of user loads without significant PHY performance loss. This demonstrates that the cell-free massive MIMO PHY and fronthaul network are resilient to varying user densities.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted Cross-Layer Authentication for Secure and Efficient Vehicular Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems increasingly depend on wireless communication for broadcasting traffic messages and facilitating real-time vehicular communication. In this context, message authentication is crucial for establishing secure and reliable communication. However, security solutions must consider the dynamic nature of vehicular communication links, which fluctuate between line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) due to obstructions. This paper proposes a lightweight cross-layer authentication scheme that employs public-key infrastructure (PKI)-based authentication for initial legitimacy detection/handshaking while using key-based physical-layer re-authentication for message verification. This approach reduces signature generation and signaling overheads associated with each transmission, thereby enhancing network scalability. However, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC; Pd: detection vs. PFA: false alarm probabilities) of the latter decreases with lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To address this, we investigate the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) to strengthen the SNR directed toward the designated vehicle in shadowed areas (i.e., NLoS scenarios), thereby improving the ROC. Theoretical analysis and practical implementation are conducted using a 1-bit RIS consisting of 64 x 64 reflective meta-surfaces. Experimental results show a significant improvement in Pd, increasing from 0.82 to 0.96 at SNR = -6 dB for an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system with 128 subcarriers. We also conducted informal and formal security analyses using Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic to prove the scheme's ability to resist passive and active attacks.</description>

      <title>Lossy Neural Compression for Geospatial Analytics: A Review</title>

Abstract: Over the past decades, there has been an explosion in the amount of available Earth Observation (EO) data. The unprecedented coverage of the Earth's surface and atmosphere by satellite imagery has resulted in large volumes of data that must be transmitted to ground stations, stored in data centers, and distributed to end users. Modern Earth System Models (ESMs) face similar challenges, operating at high spatial and temporal resolutions, producing petabytes of data per simulated day. Data compression has gained relevance over the past decade, with neural compression (NC) emerging from deep learning and information theory, making EO data and ESM outputs ideal candidates due to their abundance of unlabeled data. In this review, we outline recent developments in NC applied to geospatial data. We introduce the fundamental concepts of NC including seminal works in its traditional applications to image and video compression domains with focus on lossy compression. We discuss the unique characteristics of EO and ESM data, contrasting them with "natural images", and explain the additional challenges and opportunities they present. Moreover, we review current applications of NC across various EO modalities and explore the limited efforts in ESM compression to date. The advent of self-supervised learning (SSL) and foundation models (FM) has advanced methods to efficiently distill representations from vast unlabeled data. We connect these developments to NC for EO, highlighting the similarities between the two fields and elaborate on the potential of transferring compressed feature representations for machine--to--machine communication. Based on insights drawn from this review, we devise future directions relevant to applications in EO and ESM.</description>

      <title>Distributed Activity Detection for Cell-Free Hybrid Near-Far Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A great amount of endeavor has recently been devoted to activity detection for massive machine-type communications in cell-free massive MIMO. However, in practice, as the number of antennas at the access points (APs) increases, the Rayleigh distance that separates the near-field and far-field regions also expands, rendering the conventional assumption of far-field propagation alone impractical. To address this challenge, this paper considers a hybrid near-far field activity detection in cell-free massive MIMO, and establishes a covariance-based formulation, which facilitates the development of a distributed algorithm to alleviate the computational burden at the central processing unit (CPU). Specifically, each AP performs local activity detection for the devices and then transmits the detection result to the CPU for further processing. In particular, a novel coordinate descent algorithm based on the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury update with Taylor expansion is proposed to handle the local detection problem at each AP. Moreover, we theoretically analyze how the hybrid near-far field channels affect the detection performance. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Sustainable LSTM-Based Precoding for RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Systems with Implicit CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a sustainable long short-term memory (LSTM)-based precoding framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems. Instead of explicit channel state information (CSI) estimation, the framework exploits uplink pilot sequences to implicitly learn channel characteristics, reducing both pilot overhead and inference complexity. Practical hardware constraints are addressed by incorporating the phase-dependent amplitude model of RIS elements, while a multi-label training strategy improves robustness when multiple near-optimal codewords yield comparable performance. Simulations show that the proposed design achieves over 90% of the spectral efficiency of exhaustive search (ES) with only 2.2% of its computation time, cutting energy consumption by nearly two orders of magnitude. The method also demonstrates resilience under distribution mismatch and scalability to larger RIS arrays, making it a practical and energy-efficient solution for sustainable 6G wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Model-based Deep Learning for Joint RIS Phase Shift Compression and WMMSE Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A model-based deep learning (DL) architecture is proposed for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multi-user communications to reduce the overhead of transmitting phase shift information from the access point (AP) to the RIS controller. The phase shifts are computed at the AP, which has access to the channel state information, and then encoded into a compressed binary control message that is sent to the RIS controller for element configuration. To help reduce beamformer mismatches due to phase shift compression errors, the beamformer is updated using weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) based on the effective channel resulting from the actual (decompressed) RIS reflection coefficients. By unrolling the iterative WMMSE algorithm as part of the wireless communication informed DL architecture, joint phase shift compression and WMMSE beamforming can be trained end-to-end. Simulations show that accounting for phase shift compression errors during beamforming significantly improves the sum-rate performance, even when the number of control bits is lower than the number of RIS elements.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Bellman Mappings for Value Iteration in Distributed Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces novel Bellman mappings (B-Maps) for value iteration (VI) in distributed reinforcement learning (DRL), where agents are deployed over an undirected, connected graph/network with arbitrary topology -- but without a centralized node, that is, a node capable of aggregating all data and performing computations. Each agent constructs a nonparametric B-Map from its private data, operating on Q-functions represented in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, with flexibility in choosing the basis for their representation. Agents exchange their Q-function estimates only with direct neighbors, and unlike existing DRL approaches that restrict communication to Q-functions, the proposed framework also enables the transmission of basis information in the form of covariance matrices, thereby conveying additional structural details. Linear convergence rates are established for both Q-function and covariance-matrix estimates toward their consensus values, regardless of the network topology, with optimal learning rates determined by the ratio of the smallest positive eigenvalue (the graph's Fiedler value) to the largest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian matrix. A detailed performance analysis further shows that the proposed DRL framework effectively approximates the performance of a centralized node, had such a node existed. Numerical tests on two benchmark control problems confirm the effectiveness of the proposed nonparametric B-Maps relative to prior methods. Notably, the tests reveal a counter-intuitive outcome: although the framework involves richer information exchange -- specifically through transmitting covariance matrices as basis information -- it achieves the desired performance at a lower cumulative communication cost than existing DRL schemes, underscoring the critical role of sharing basis information in accelerating the learning process.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian-Constrained Holographic Beamforming Optimization in Multi-user Networks with Dynamic Metasurface Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are promising alternatives to fully digital (FD) architectures, enabling hybrid beamforming via low-cost reconfigurable metasurfaces. In DMAs, holographic beamforming is achieved through tunable elements by Lorentzian-constrained holography (LCH), significantly reducing the need for radio-frequency (RF) chains and analog circuitry. However, the Lorentzian constraints and limited RF chains introduce a trade-off between reduced system complexity and beamforming performance, especially in dense network scenarios. This paper addresses resource allocation in multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MISO) networks under the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) constraints, aiming to minimize total transmit power. We propose a holographic beamforming algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Lorentzian-Constrained Holography (GMLCH), which optimizes DMA weights, yielding flexibility for using various LCH techniques to tackle the aforementioned trade-offs. Building upon GMLCH, we further propose a new algorithm i.e., Adaptive Radius Lorentzian Constrained Holography (ARLCH), which achieves optimization of DMA weights with additional degree of freedom in a greater optimization space, and provides lower transmitted power, while improving scalability for higher number of users. Numerical results show that ARLCH reduces power consumption by over 20\% compared to benchmarks, with increasing effectiveness as the number of users grows.</description>

      <title>DWTGS: Rethinking Frequency Regularization for Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents significant challenges in reconstructing high-quality novel views, as it often overfits to the widely-varying high-frequency (HF) details of the sparse training views. While frequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on Fourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards detrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency regularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional spatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL subbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband in a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS consistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric strategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.</description>
