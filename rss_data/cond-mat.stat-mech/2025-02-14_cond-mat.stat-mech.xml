      <title>Absorbing state transitions with discrete symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in interactive quantum dynamics has inspired the study of fundamentally out-of-equilibrium dynamical phase transitions of quantum and classical many-body systems. Motivated by these developments, we study nonequilibrium phase transitions to absorbing states in one-dimensional systems that can model certain quantum circuits. Specifically, we consider dynamics for which the absorbing states are not unique due to a discrete symmetry: Z2 for two-state models and S3 or Z3 for three-state models. Under time evolution, domain walls in these models perform random walks and coarsen under local feedback, which, if perfect, reduces their number over time, driving the system to an absorbing state in polynomial time. Imperfect feedback, however, introduces domain wall multiplication (branching), potentially leading to an active phase. For Z2-symmetric two-state models, starting from a single domain wall, we find distinct absorbing and active phases as in previous studies. Extending this analysis to local three-state models shows that any nonzero branching rate drives the system into the active phase. However, we demonstrate that incorporating nonlocal classical information into the feedback can stabilize the absorbing phase against branching. By tuning the level of nonlocality, we observe a transition from the active to the absorbing phase, which belongs to a new universality class.</description>

      <title>Critical Motility-Induced Phase Separation in Three Dimensions is Consistent with Ising Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical investigations aiming to determine the universality class of critical motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) in two dimensions (2D) have resulted in inconclusive findings. Here, using finite-size scaling results obtained from large-scale computer simulations, we find that the static and dynamic critical exponents associated with 3D MIPS all closely match those of the 3D Ising universality class with a conserved scalar order parameter. This finding is corroborated by fluctuating hydrodynamic description of the critical dynamics of the order parameter field which precisely matching model B in three dimensions. Our work suggests that 3D MIPS and indeed the entire phase diagram of active Brownian spheres is remarkably similar to that of molecular passive fluids despite the absence of Boltzmann statistics.</description>

      <title>Universal criterion for selective outcomes under stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resetting plays a pivotal role in optimizing the completion time of complex first passage processes with single or multiple outcomes/exit possibilities. While it is well established that the coefficient of variation -- a statistical dispersion defined as a ratio of the fluctuations over the mean of the first passage time -- must be larger than unity for resetting to be beneficial for any outcome averaged over all the possibilities, the same can not be said while conditioned on a particular outcome. The purpose of this letter is to derive a universal condition which reveals that two statistical metric -- the mean and coefficient of variation of the conditional times -- come together to determine when resetting can expedite the completion of a selective outcome, and furthermore can govern the biasing between preferential and non-preferential outcomes. The universality of this result is demonstrated for a one dimensional diffusion process subjected to resetting with two absorbing boundaries.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Detection of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition is a typical topological phase transition defined between binding and unbinding states of vortices and antivortices, which is not accompanied by spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is known that the BKT transition is difficult to detect from thermodynamic quantities such as specific heat and magnetic susceptibility because of the absence of anomaly in free energy and significant finite-size effects. Therefore, methods based on statistical mechanics which are commonly used to discuss phase transitions cannot be easily applied to the BKT transition. In recent years, several attempts to detect the BKT transition using machine-learning methods based on image recognition techniques have been reported. However, it has turned out that the detection is difficult even for machine learning methods because of the absence of trivial order parameters and symmetry breaking. Most of the methods proposed so far require prior knowledge about the models and/or preprocessing of input data for feature engineering, which is problematic in terms of the general applicability. In this article, we introduce recent development of the machine-learning methods to detect the BKT transitions in several spin models. Specifically, we demonstrate the success of two new methods named temperature-identification method and phase-classification method for detecting the BKT transitions in the q-state clock model and the XXZ model. This progress is expected to sublimate the machine-learning-based study of spin models for exploring new physics beyond simple benchmark test.</description>

      <title>Phase space contraction rate for classical mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical systems with non-reciprocal or dissipative forces evolve according to a generalization of Liouville's equation that accounts for the expansion and contraction of phase space volume. Here, we connect geometric descriptions of these non-Hamiltonian dynamics to a recently established classical density matrix theory. In this theory, the evolution of a "maximally mixed" classical density matrix is related to the well-known phase space contraction rate that, when ensemble averaged, is the rate of entropy exchange with the surroundings. Here, we extend the definition of mixed states to include statistical and mechanical components, describing both the deformations of local phase space regions and the evolution of ensembles within them. As a result, the equation of motion for this mixed state represents the rate of contraction for an ensemble of dissipative trajectories. Recognizing this density matrix as a covariance matrix, its contraction rate is another measure of entropy flow characterizing nonequilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Run-and-tumble particles with 1D Coulomb interaction: the active jellium model and the non-reciprocal self-gravitating gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently we studied $N$ run-and-tumble particles in one dimension - which switch with rate $\gamma$ between driving velocities $\pm v_0$ - interacting via the long range 1D Coulomb potential (also called rank interaction), both in the attractive and in the repulsive case, with and without a confining potential. We extend this study in two directions. First we consider the same system, but inside a harmonic confining potential, which we call "active jellium". We obtain a parametric representation of the particle density in the stationary state at large $N$, which we analyze in detail. Contrary to the linear potential, there is always a steady-state where the density has a bounded support. However, we find that the model still exhibits transitions between phases with different behaviors of the density at the edges, ranging from a continuous decay to a jump, or even a shock (i.e. a cluster of particles, which manifests as a delta peak in the density). Notably, the interactions forbid a divergent density at the edges, which may occur in the non-interacting case. In the second part, we consider a non-reciprocal version of the rank interaction: the $+$ particles (of velocity $+v_0$) are attracted towards the $-$ particles (of velocity $-v_0$) with a constant force $b/N$, while the $-$ particles are repelled by the $+$ particles with a force of same amplitude. In order for a stationary state to exist we add a linear confining potential. We derive an explicit expression for the stationary density at large $N$, which exhibits an explicit breaking of the mirror symmetry with respect to $x=0$. This again shows the existence of several phases, which differ by the presence or absence of a shock at $x=0$, with one phase even exhibiting a vanishing density on the whole region $x&gt;0$. Our analytical results are complemented by numerical simulations for finite $N$.</description>

      <title>Extinction and Metastability of Pheromone-Roads in Stochastic Models for Foraging Walks of Ants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macroscopic changes of group behavior of eusocial insects are studied from the viewpoint of non-equilibrium phase transitions. Recent combined study of experiments and mathematical modeling by the group led by the third author suggests that a species of garden ant switches the individual foraging walk from pheromone-mediated to visual-cues-mediated depending on situation. If an initial pheromone-road between the nest and food sources is a detour, ants using visual cues can pioneer shorter paths. These shorter paths are reinforced by pheromone secreted by following ants, and then the detour ceases to exist. Once the old pheromone-road extincts, there will be almost no chance to reconstruct it. Hence the extinction of pheromone-road is expected to be regarded as a phase transition to an absorbing state. We propose a discrete-time model on a square lattice consisting of switching random walks interacting though time-dependent pheromone field. The numerical study shows that the critical phenomena of the present extinction transitions of pheromone-roads do not seem to belong to the directed percolation universality class associated with the usual absorbing-state transition. The new aspects are cased by the coexistence and competition with newly creating pheromone-roads. In a regime in the extinction phase, the annihilating road shows metastability and takes long time-period to be replaced by a new road.</description>

      <title>Journey from the Wilson exact RG towards the Wegner-Morris Fokker-Planck RG and the Carosso field-coarsening via Langevin stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the Wilson RG of 'incomplete integration' as a function of the RG-time $t$, the non-linear differential RG flow for the energy $E_t[\phi(.)]$ translates for the probability distribution $P_t[\phi(.)] \sim e^{- E_t[\phi(.)]} $ into the linear Fokker-Planck RG flow associated to independent non-identical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes for the Fourier modes. The corresponding Langevin stochastic differential equation for the real-space field $\phi_t(\vec x)$ can be then interpreted within the Carosso perspective as genuine infinitesimal coarsening-transformations that are the analog of spin-blocking, and whose irreversible character is essential to overcome the paradox of the naive description of the Wegner-Morris RG flow as a mere infinitesimal change of variables in the partition function integral. This interpretation suggests to consider new RG-schemes, in particular the Carosso RG where the Langevin SDE corresponds to the well known stochastic heat equation or the Edwards-Wilkinson dynamics. We stress the advantages of this stochastic formulation of exact RG flows. While statistical field theory is usually written in infinite space, we focus here on the formulation on a large volume $L^d$ with periodic boundary conditions, in order to distinguish between extensive and intensives observables while keeping the translation-invariance. Since the empirical magnetization $m_e \equiv \frac{1}{L^d} \int_{L^d} d^d \vec x \ \phi(\vec x) $ is an intensive variable corresponding to the zero-momentum Fourier coefficient of the field, its probability distribution $p_L(m_e)$ can be obtained from the gradual integration over all the other Fourier coefficients associated to non-vanishing-momenta via exact differential RG, in order to obtain the large deviation properties with respect to the volume $L^d$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of multi-colored loop models in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study order-disorder transitions in three-dimensional \textsl{multi-colored} loop models using Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the nature of the transition is intimately related to the nature of the loops. The symmetric loops undergo a first order phase transition, while the non-symmetric loops show a second-order transition. The critical exponents for the non-symmetric loops are calculated. In three dimensions, the regular loop model with no interactions is dual to the XY model. We argue that, due to interactions among the colors, the specific heat exponent is found to be different from that of the regular loop model. The continuous nature of the transition is altered to a discontinuous one due to the strong inter-color interactions.</description>

      <title>Scalable Discrete Diffusion Samplers: Combinatorial Optimization and Statistical Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning to sample from complex unnormalized distributions over discrete domains emerged as a promising research direction with applications in statistical physics, variational inference, and combinatorial optimization. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in this domain. However, existing methods face limitations in memory scaling and thus the number of attainable diffusion steps since they require backpropagation through the entire generative process. To overcome these limitations we introduce two novel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the policy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural Importance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization. Numerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased sampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte Carlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion models to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and find that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches. Our work opens new avenues for applying diffusion models to a wide range of scientific applications in discrete domains that were hitherto restricted to exact likelihood models.</description>

      <title>The quest for new materials: the network theory and machine learning perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the emergence of novel materials is a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, materials science and technology. With the rapid growth of materials databases in both size and reliability, the challenge shifts from data collection to efficient exploration of this vast and complex space. A key strategy lies in a smart use of descriptors at multiple scales, ranging from atomic arrangements to macroscopic properties, to represent materials in high-dimensional abstract spaces. Network theory provides a powerful framework to structure and analyze these relationships, capturing hidden patterns and guiding discovery. Machine Learning complements this approach by enabling predictive modeling, dimensionality reduction, and the identification of promising material candidates. By integrating network-based methods with Machine Learning techniques, researchers can construct, analyze, and efficiently navigate the material space, uncovering novel materials with tailored properties. This review explores the synergy between network theory and ML, highlighting their role in accelerating materials discovery through a systematic and interpretable approach.</description>

      <title>Analog charged black hole formation via percolation: Exploring cosmic censorship and Hoop conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an analog model of charged black hole (BH) formation using the framework of classical percolation. By analyzing the scaling behavior of key quantities, including surface gravity and Komar mass, we establish a robust correspondence between this analog system and gravitational collapse in general relativity. Our numerical simulations of the lattice model show excellent agreement with analytical predictions for the continuum limit, highlighting the potential of analog systems to capture essential features of BH physics. Interestingly, we find that while geometric criteria related to the hoop conjecture are necessary, they are not sufficient for BH formation in our model. Instead, the exponential growth of energy and cluster size emerges as the key indicator, suggesting a novel interpretation of the hoop conjecture and providing further support for cosmic censorship within our analog framework by ensuring horizon formation. This work offers a fresh perspective on the organization of matter within BH event horizons and lays the groundwork for future quantum extensions that could shed light on Hawking radiation and the BH information paradox by linking entanglement entropy in quantum percolation models to BH entropy.</description>

      <title>Frustration-driven topological textures on the honeycomb lattice: antiferromagnetic meron-antimeron and skyrmion crystals emerging from spiral spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skyrmions -topologically nontrivial magnetic quasi-particles- can emerge in two-dimensional chiral magnets due to moderate or high strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. In this work, we show that the inclusion of weak next-nearest-neighbor DM interaction in the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ honeycomb-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet leads to the emergence of field-induced incommensurate antiferromagnetic meron-antimeron pairs and antiferromagnetic skyrmion structures. Using the Luttinger-Tisza approximation and large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, we report that for lower frustration values, antiferromagnetic meron-antimeron pair crystal and gas phases emerge within a small magnetic field window. In these meron phases, the fundamental unit consists of a meron-antimeron pair residing on different sublattices of the honeycomb lattice, even in the gas phase, where they exhibit greater mobility. For larger frustration, a two-layer-like three-sublattice antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystal phase is stabilized over a wider magnetic field range. At lower temperatures, this region splits into two distinct antiferromagnetic skyrmion phases with skyrmions of different sizes, reflecting the influence of frustration and thermal effects on the stabilization of these topological textures. Interestingly, both meron and skyrmion low-temperature phases connect to spiral spin liquid phases of the honeycomb lattice at higher temperatures. Additionally, we analyze the emergent single-$q$ and double-$q$ phases at low temperatures, constructing a comprehensive phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Collective migration and topological phase transitions in confluent epithelia</title>

Abstract: Collective epithelial migration leverages on topological rearrangements of the intercellular junctions, which allow cells to intercalate without loosing confluency. In silico studies have provided a clear indication that this process could occur via a two-step phase transition, where a hierarchy of topological excitations progressively transforms an epithelial layer from a crystalline solid to an isotropic liquid, via an intermediate hexatic liquid crystal phase. Yet, the fundamental mechanism behind this process and its implications for collective cell behavior are presently unknown. In this article, we show that the onset of collective cell migration in cell-resolved models of epithelial layers takes place via an activity-driven melting transition, characterized by an exponentially-divergent correlation length across the solid/hexatic phase boundary. Using a combination of numerical simulations and Renormalization Group analysis, we show that the availability of topologically distinct rearrangements - known as T1 and T2 processes - and of a non-thermal route to melting, renders the transition significantly more versatile and tunable than in two-dimensional passive matter. Specifically, the relative frequency of T1 and T2 processes and of the "bare" stiffness of the cell layer affect the divergence of positional correlations within a well-defined spectrum of critical behaviors. Suppressing T1 processes, changes the nature of the transition by preventing collective migration in favor of a cellular analog of surface sublimation.</description>

      <title>Helicity modulus and chiral symmetry breaking for boundary conditions with finite twist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04468v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the response of a two-dimensional classical XY model to a finite (non-infinitesimal) twist of the boundary conditions. We use Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the free energy difference between periodic and twisted-periodic boundary conditions and find deviations from the expected quadratic dependence on the twist angle. Consequently, the helicity modulus (spin-stiffness) shows a non-trivial dependence on the twist angle. We show that the deviation from the expected behavior arises because of the mixing of states with opposite chirality which leads to an additional entropy contribution in the quasi-long-range ordered phase. We give an improved prescription for the numerical evaluation of the helicity modulus for a finite twist, and we discuss the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry for the anti-periodic boundary conditions. We also discuss applications to discrete spin systems and some experimental scenarios where boundary conditions with finite twist are necessary.</description>

Abstract: We reconsider the classical problem of a freely joined chain of Brownian particles connected by elastic springs and study its conformational probability distribution function in the overdamped regime in the limit of infinite stiffness of constraints. We show that the well-known solution by Fixman [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 71, 3050 (1974)] is missing a shape-related term, later alluded to but not computed by Helfand [J. Chem. Phys 71, 5000 (1979)]. In our approach, the shape term, also termed zero-point energy, arises explicitly from a careful treatment of the distributional limit. We present a computationally feasible method for the calculation of the shape term and demonstrate its validity in a couple of examples.</description>

      <title>Physical meaning of principal component analysis for classical lattice systems with translational invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the physical implications of applying principal component analysis (PCA) to translationally invariant classical systems defined on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice. Using Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory, we demonstrate that the principal components are related to the reciprocal lattice vectors of the hypercubic lattice, and the corresponding eigenvalues are connected to the discrete Fourier transform of the sampled configurations. From a different perspective, we show that the PCA in question can be viewed as a numerical method for computing the ensemble average of the squared moduli of the Fourier transform of physical quantities. Our results also provide a way to determine approximately the principal components of a classical system with translational invariance without the need for matrix diagonalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relaxation of a diffusive particle confined in an arbitrary external potential and subject to a non-Markovian resetting protocol. With a constant rate $r$, a previous time $\tau$ between the initial time and the present time $t$ is chosen from a given probability distribution $K(\tau,t)$, and the particle is reset to the position that it occupied at time $\tau$. Depending on the shape of $K(\tau,t)$, the particle either relaxes toward the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution or toward a non-trivial stationary distribution that breaks ergodicity and depends on the initial position and the resetting protocol. From a general asymptotic theory, we find that if the kernel $K(\tau,t)$ is sufficiently localized near $\tau=0$, i.e., mostly the initial part of the trajectory is remembered and revisited, the steady state is non-Gibbs-Boltzmann. Conversely, if $K(\tau,t)$ decays slowly enough or increases with $\tau$, i.e., recent positions are more likely to be revisited, the probability distribution of the particle tends toward the Gibbs-Boltzmann state at large times. In the latter case, however, the temporal approach to the stationary state is generally anomalously slow, following for instance an inverse power law or a stretched exponential, if $K(\tau,t)$ is not too strongly peaked at the current time $t$. These findings are verified by the analysis of several exactly solvable cases and by numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by previous studies in statistical physics [see, in particular, Kozitsky at al., A phase transition in a Curie-Weiss system with binary interactions, Condens. Matter Phys. 23, 23502 (2020)] we introduce a discrete Gauss-Poisson probability distribution function \begin{equation}\label{GPD}\tag{A1} p_{GP}(n ;z,r)=\left[R(r;z)\right]^{-1}\frac{\mbox{e}^{zn}}{n!}\,\mbox{e}^{-\frac 12\,rn^2} \end{equation} with support on $\mathbb N_0$ and parameters $z\in\mathbb R$ and $r\in\mathbb R_+$. The probability mass function $p_{GP}(n ;z,r)$ is normalized by the special function $R(r;z)$, given by the infinite sum \begin{equation}\label{R}\tag{A2} R(r;z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{\mbox{e}^{zn}}{n!}\,\mbox{e}^{-\frac 12\,rn^2}, \end{equation} possessing extremely intersting mathematical properties. We present an asymptotic estimate $R^{(\rm as)}(r;z\gg1)$ for the function $R(r;z)$ with large arguments $z$, along with similar formulas for its logarithm and logarithmic derivative. These functions exhibit very interesting oscillatory behavior around their asymptotics, for parameters $r$ above some threshold value $r^*$. Some implications of our findings are discussed in the context of the Curie-Weiss cell model of simple fluids.</description>

      <title>Influence of coupling symmetries and noise on the critical dynamics of synchronizing oscillator lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that the synchronization process in lattices of self-sustained (phase and limit-cycle) oscillators displays universal scale-invariant behavior previously studied in the physics of surface kinetic roughening. The type of dynamic scaling ansatz which is verified depends on the randomness that occurs in the system, whether it is columnar disorder (quenched noise given by the random assignment of natural frequencies), leading to anomalous scaling, or else time-dependent noise, inducing the more standard Family-Vicsek dynamic scaling ansatz, as in equilibrium critical dynamics. The specific universality class also depends on the coupling function: for a sine function (as in the celebrated Kuramoto model) the critical behavior is that of the Edwards-Wilkinson equation for the corresponding type of randomness, with Gaussian fluctuations around the average growth. In all the other cases investigated, Tracy-Widom fluctuations ensue, associated with the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation for rough interfaces. Two questions remain to be addressed in order to complete the picture, however: 1) Is the atypical scaling displayed by the sine coupling preserved if other coupling functions satisfying the same (odd) symmetry are employed (as suggested by continuum approximations and symmetry arguments)? and 2) how does the competition between both types of randomness (which are expected to coexist in experimental settings) affect the nonequilibrium behavior? We address the latter question by numerically characterizing the crossover between thermal-noise and columnar-disorder criticality, and the former by providing evidence confirming that it is the symmetry of the coupling function that sets apart the sine coupling, among other odd-symmetric couplings, due to the absence of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: A mobile Coulomb gas permeating a fixed background crystalline lattice of charged colloidal crystals is subject to an electrostatic-elastic coupling, which we study on the continuum level by introducing a minimal coupling between electrostatic and displacement fields. We derive linearized, Debye-H\"uckel-like mean-field equations that can be analytically solved, incorporating the minimal coupling between electrostatic and displacement fields leading to an additional effective attractive interaction between mobile charges that depends in general on the strength of the coupling between the electrostatic and displacement fields. By analyzing the Gaussian fluctuations around the mean-field solution we also identify and quantify the region of its stability in terms of the electrostatic-elastic screening length. This detailed continuum theory incorporating the standard lattice elasticity and electrostatics of mobile charges provides a baseline to investigate the electrostatic-elastic coupling for microscopic models in colloid science and materials science.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional quantum breakdown model with Krylov subspace many-body localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-dimensional (2d) quantum breakdown model of hardcore bosons interacting with disordered spins which would be classical without the bosons. It resembles particles incident into supersaturated vapor. The model exhibits a set of subsystem symmetries, and has a strong fragmentation into Krylov subspaces in each symmetry sector. The Hamiltonian in each Krylov subspace maps to a single-particle problem in a Cayley tree-like graph. At zero disorder, the Krylov subspaces exhibit either (possible) integrable features, or quantum chaos with quantum scar states showing irregular energy and degeneracy patterns. At nonzero disorders, they enter a 2d many-body localization (MBL) phase beyond certain disorder strength $W_*$, as indicated by Poisson level spacing statistics and entanglement entropy growing as $\log t$ with time $t$. Our theoretical arguments suggest $W_*$ is finite or zero for boson number $N_b\lesssim L^\gamma/\log L$ ($1/2\le \gamma \le 1$) as system size $L\rightarrow\infty$. This gives a more stringent condition for MBL than that in the 1d quantum breakdown models. This model reveals the possibility of MBL in systems of quantum particles interacting with classical degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Gaussian approximation of dynamic cavity equations for linearly-coupled stochastic dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs and disordered systems often lead to complex behaviors characterized by heterogeneity in time and spatial scales, slow relaxation, localization, and aging phenomena. The mathematical tools and approximation techniques required to analyze these complex systems are still under development, posing significant technical challenges and resulting in a reliance on numerical simulations. We introduce a novel computational framework for investigating the dynamics of sparse disordered systems with continuous degrees of freedom. Starting with a graphical model representation of the dynamic partition function for a system of linearly-coupled stochastic differential equations, we use dynamic cavity equations on locally tree-like factor graphs to approximate the stochastic measure. Here, cavity marginals are identified with local functionals of single-site trajectories. Our primary approximation involves a second-order truncation of a small-coupling expansion, leading to a Gaussian form for the cavity marginals. For linear dynamics with additive noise, this method yields a closed set of causal integro-differential equations for cavity versions of one-time and two-time averages. These equations provide an exact dynamical description within the local tree-like approximation, retrieving classical results for the spectral density of sparse random matrices. Global constraints, non-linear forces, and state-dependent noise terms can be addressed using a self-consistent perturbative closure technique. The resulting equations resemble those of dynamical mean-field theory in the mode-coupling approximation used for fully-connected models. However, due to their cavity formulation, the present method can also be applied to ensembles of sparse random graphs and employed as a message-passing algorithm on specific graph instances.</description>

Abstract: Work extraction is one of the most central processes in quantum thermodynamics. However, the prior analysis of optimal extractable work has been restricted to a limited operational scenario where complete information about the initial state is given. Here, we introduce a general framework of black box work extraction, which addresses the inaccessibility of information on the initial state. We show that the optimal extractable work in the black box setting is completely characterized by the performance of a composite hypothesis testing task, a fundamental problem in information theory. We employ this general relation to reduce the asymptotic black box work extraction to the quantum Stein's lemma in composite hypothesis testing, allowing us to provide their exact characterization in terms of the Helmholtz free energy. We also show a new quantum Stein's lemma motivated in this physical setting, where a composite hypothesis contains a certain correlation. Our work exhibits the importance of information about the initial state and gives a new interpretation of the quantities in the composite quantum hypothesis testing, encouraging the interplay between the physical settings and the information theory.</description>

Abstract: We consider random walks in the form of nearest-neighbor hopping on Erdos-Renyi random graphs of finite fixed mean degree c as the number of vertices N tends to infinity. In this regime, using statistical field theory methods, we develop an analytic theory of the first return time probability distribution. The problem turns out closely related to finding the spectrum of the normalized graph Laplacian that controls the continuum time version of the nearest-neighbor-hopping random walk. In the infinite graph limit, where loops are highly improbable, the returns operate in a manner qualitatively similar to c-regular trees, and the expressions for probabilities resemble those on random c-regular graphs. Because the vertex degrees are not exactly constant, however, the way c enters the formulas differs from the dependence on the graph degree of first return probabilities on random regular graphs.</description>

Abstract: Radiative forcing drives warming in the Earth system, leading to changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and associated radiative feedbacks. The link between changes in the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) net radiative flux and SST patterns, known as the "pattern effect", is typically diagnosed by studying the response of atmosphere-only models to SST perturbations. In this work, we diagnose the pattern effect through response theory, by performing idealized warming perturbation experiments from unperturbed data alone. First, by studying the response at short time scales, where the response is dominated by atmospheric variability, we recover results that agree with the literature. Second, by extending the framework to longer time scales, we capture coupled interactions between the slow ocean component and the atmosphere, yielding a novel "sensitivity map" quantifying the response of the net radiative flux to SST perturbations in the coupled system. Here, feedbacks are captured by a spatiotemporal response operator, rather than time-independent maps as in traditional studies. Both formulations skillfully reconstruct changes in externally forced simulations and provide practical strategies for climate studies. The key distinction lies in their perspectives on climate feedbacks. The first formulation, closely aligned with prediction tasks, follows the traditional view in which slow variables, such as SSTs, exert a one-way influence on fast variables. The second formulation broadens this perspective by incorporating spatiotemporal interactions across state variables. This alternative approach explores how localized SST perturbations can alter the coupled dynamics, leading to temperature changes in remote areas and further impacting the radiative fluxes at later times.</description>

Identifying such aftershocks is an important step in seismic hazard assessment but has remained challenging, especially in cases involving natural fluid migration or anthropogenic fluid injections, which can occur with varying time scales and/or episodically, leading to strong temporal variations in earthquake occurrences. Here, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that earthquake catalogs without triggering can lead to spurious Omori-Utsu and productivity relations for the commonly used nearest-neighbor declustering method. However, we show that the robustness of the Omori-Utsu exponent on newly introduced parameters of the method allows one to determine whether indeed aftershocks are present. For a natural swarm catalog, which lacks a clear distinction between triggered and background events, we find that the catalog is dominated by aftershocks.</description>

      <title>Memory of rotation in residual stress of paste</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stress distribution in pastes after horizontal rotation by using an elasto-plastic model. Residual stress remains as a memory of rotation. The stress in the circumferential direction increases after the rotation, whereas that in the radial direction decreases. The residual stress is analytically related to the plastic deformation induced by the rotation. Based on the time evolution of plastic deformation, we theoretically describe the mechanism of the changes in the stress distribution.</description>

      <title>Testing the RG-flow $M(3,10)+\phi_{1,7}\to M(3,8)$ with Hamiltonian Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) methods provide a powerful numerical approach for investigating strongly coupled QFTs. In this work, we develop HT techniques to analyse a specific Renormalization Group (RG) flow recently proposed in Refs. [1, 3]. These studies put forward Ginzburg-Landau descriptions for the conformal minimal models $M(3,10)$ and $M(3,8)$, as well as the RG flow connecting them. Specifically, the RG-flow is defined by deforming the $M(3,10)$ with the relevant primary operator $\phi_{1,7}$ (whose indices denote its position in the Kac table), yielding $M(3,10)+ \phi_{1,7}$. From the perspective of HT, realising such an RG-flow presents significant challenges, as the $\phi_{1,7}$ deformation requires renormalizing the UV theory up to third order in the coupling constant of the deformation. In this study, we carry out the necessary calculations to formulate HT for this theory and numerically investigate the spectrum of $M(3,10)+ \phi_{1,7}$ in the large coupling regime, finding strong evidence in favour of the proposed flow.</description>

      <title>Reactive path ensembles within nonequilibrium steady-states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The modern theory of rare events is grounded in near equilibrium ideas, however many systems of modern interest are sufficiently far from equilibrium that traditional approaches do not apply. Using the recently developed variational path sampling methodology, we study systems evolving within nonequilibrium steady states to elucidate how reactive processes are altered away from equilibrium. Variational path sampling provides access to ensembles of reactive events, and a means of quantifying the relative importance of each dynamical degree of freedom in such processes. With it, we have studied the conformational change of a solute in an active bath. We illustrate how energy injection generically enhances the rates of rare events, even when energy is not directed into specific reactive modes. By studying the folding and unfolding transitions of a grafted polymer under shear, we illustrate how nonequilibrium reactive processes do not follow gradient paths due to the emergence of persistent currents. The breaking of detailed balance allows for the mechanisms of forward and backward reactions to be distinct, enabling novel pathways to be explored and designed, and states unstable in equilibrium to become stabilized kinetically away from it. The analysis presented in this work establishes some basic principles for nonequilibrium reactive events, and is made possible by the use of a numerical method that does not invoke proximity to equilibrium or requires strong prior assumptions about the mechanism of reaction.</description>

      <title>A universal route from avalanches in mean-field models with random fields to stochastic Poisson branching events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Avalanches in mean-field models can be mapped to memoryless branching processes defining a universality class. We present a reduced expression mapping a broad family of critical and subcriticial avalanches in mean-field models at the thermodynamic limit to rooted trees in a memoryless Poisson branching processes with random occurrence times. We derive the exact mapping for the athermal random field Ising model and the democratic fiber bundle model, where avalanche statistics progress towards criticality, and as an approximation for the self-organized criticality in slip mean-field theory. Avalanche dynamics and statistics in the three models differ only on the evolution of the field density, interaction strength, and the product of both terms determining the branching number.</description>
