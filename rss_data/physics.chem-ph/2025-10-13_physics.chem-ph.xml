      <title>Revealing Light-Driven Dynamics at Nanostructured Solid-Liquid Interfaces with In-Situ SHG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light and heat are key drivers of interfacial chemistry at solid-liquid boundaries, governing fundamental processes in sustainable energy conversion systems such as photoelectrochemical and hydrovoltaic devices. However, non-invasive probing of light-induced surface potential dynamics at these interfaces remains challenging due to limited surface sensitivity. Here, we introduce a nanophotonic approach that amplifies second harmonic generation (SHG) from nanostructured solid-liquid interfaces by over two orders of magnitude, providing real-time, all-optical access to light-driven interfacial phenomena. Using in-situ SHG at silicon-oxide-electrolyte interfaces, we uncover two concurrent pathways for light-mediated modulation: (i) low-intensity illumination induces photocharging via carrier generation and trapping, while (ii) high-intensity excitation leads to photothermal heating that modifies surface group dissociation through temperature-dependent reaction equilibria. We further show that nanostructured semiconductor interfaces deviate markedly from the monotonic electrolyte-concentration dependence predicted by Gouy-Chapman theory. Instead, the surface potential exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic behavior governed by interfacial geometry, consistent with prior device-level observations. Importantly, SHG measurements reveal that this concentration-dependent modulation of surface potential directly alters the electronic polarizability of silicon, exposing the underlying ion-electronic coupling at the solid-liquid boundary. By combining nanophotonic design, in-situ SHG probing, and quantitative modeling, this work establishes an experimentally validated framework for actively manipulating interfacial charge distributions to advance the performance of solid-liquid energy conversion technologies.</description>

      <title>Control of chemical reactions in radiofrequency ion traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past years, radiofrequency ion traps have become an attractive platform for studying chemical reactions as they enable a high degree of control over ion-molecule dynamics. In this review, we summarize techniques for the trapping and cooling of atomic and molecular ions in radiofrequency traps including Doppler and resolved-sideband laser cooling, sympathetic cooling, and cryogenic buffer-gas methods. We discuss strategies for controlling key reaction parameters: the preparation of specific internal quantum states by internal cooling, optical pumping, state-selective photoionization and quantum-logic spectroscopy; the manipulation of collision energies through micromotion control, dynamic trapping and combination with molecular beams; and the selection of molecular structure via isotopic substitution, conformational separation and isomer-specific ion generation. We illustrate applications of these approaches by discussing studies on quantum-state-dependent kinetics, quantum-resonance effects and structure-sensitive reactivity in ion-neutral collisions. We conclude by outlining future challenges, including full state-to-state reaction mapping, reaching the ultracold quantum regime free of micromotion, and the exploration of complex and chiral systems.</description>

      <title>Understanding How Synthetic Impurities Affect Glyphosate Solubility and Crystal Growth Using Free Energy Calculations and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide worldwide, crystallizes through complex intermolecular interactions that are strongly influenced by synthesis-derived impurities. Understanding this process at the molecular scale is critical for optimizing production, ensuring product quality, and assessing environmental impact. Here, we employ direct coexistence molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations to elucidate how glycine-a prevalent synthesis byproduct-modulates glyphosate solubility and crystal growth in aqueous solutions. Our simulations identify two major mechanisms by which glycine hinders crystallization. First, direct coexistence simulations show that glycine preferentially adsorbs at crystal surfaces, hindering glyphosate attachment and slowing growth. Second, free energy calculations demonstrate that glycine enhances glyphosate solubility, reducing the supersaturation driving force to incorporate into the crystal phase. Experimental measurements corroborate our predictions, confirming both enhanced solubility and reduced crystallization kinetics in glycine-bearing systems. These findings establish that glycine-typically considered an inert impurity-actively disrupts glyphosate crystallization by promoting its dissolution. More broadly, this integrated computational-experimental approach highlights the power of molecular simulations to disentangle impurity effects, interfacial phenomena, and solution thermodynamics in crystallization, providing molecular-level insights for optimizing industrial protocols and predicting agrochemical behavior under relevant environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Multiconfigurational Trials for Accurate Phaseless Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo on 3d Transition Metal Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we evaluate multi-configurational trial wave function protocols for phaseless auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) on transition metal containing systems. First, we benchmark vertical ionization potentials for 22 3d transition metal complexes against published high-accuracy ph-AFQMC values in a double zeta basis set. We then compute the vertical ionization potential for a set of six metallocenes using our best-performing protocol, alongside ph-AFQMC using a configuration interaction singles and doubles (CISD) trial state. We also analyze the performance of canonical coupled-cluster theory with singles, doubles and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)), as well as its local approximation using domain-based local pair natural orbitals (DLPNO-CCSD(T1)) using different reference orbitals. To reach the complete-basis-set (CBS) limit, we examine several extrapolation schemes and report CBS-limit ph-AFQMC and CCSD(T) values alongside experimental results. We find that ph-AFQMC with the best-performing trial in a triple zeta basis, followed by CBS correction from DLPNO-CCSD(T1) with unrestricted B3LYP reference orbitals, yields small deviations from experiment at modest cost. Using a CISD trial state in ph-AFQMC gives the closest agreement with experiment (errors &lt; 2 kcal/mol), albeit with lower scalability.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Guided Furthest Point Sampling for Robust Training Set Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart training set selections procedures enable the reduction of data needs and improves predictive robustness in machine learning problems relevant to chemistry. We introduce Gradient Guided Furthest Point Sampling (GGFPS), a simple extension of Furthest Point Sampling (FPS) that leverages molecular force norms to guide efficient sampling of configurational spaces of molecules. Numerical evidence is presented for a toy-system (Styblinski-Tang function) as well as for molecular dynamics trajectories from the MD17 dataset. Compared to FPS and uniform sampling, our numerical results indicate superior data efficiency and robustness when using GGFPS. Distribution analysis of the MD17 data suggests that FPS systematically under-samples equilibrium geometries, resulting in large test errors for relaxed structures. GGFPS cures this artifact and (i) enables up to two fold reductions in training cost without sacrificing predictive accuracy compared to FPS in the 2-dimensional Styblinksi-Tang system, (ii) systematically lowers prediction errors for equilibrium as well as strained structures in MD17, and (iii) systematically decreases prediction error variances across all of the MD17 configuration spaces. These results suggest that gradient-aware sampling methods hold great promise as effective training set selection tools, and that naive use of FPS may result in imbalanced training and inconsistent prediction outcomes.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature magnetic semiconductor with superhigh hole mobility and ferrotoroidicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design and fabrication of room-temperature magnetic semiconductors are recognized worldwide as a great challenge, and of both theoretical and practical importance in the field of spintronics. Compared with diluted magnetic semiconductors, intrinsic room-temperature magnetic semiconductors have rarely been developed. Reported herein is a magnetic semiconductor film formed by supramolecular self-assembly based on uranyl and cyclodextrin, with the Curie temperature above room temperature. The electrical measurements show that the film exhibits typical p-type semiconductor characteristics with a superhigh carrier mobility of 3200 cm2V-1s-1, which can help achieve an excellent match with the n-type semiconductor. The room-temperature magnetic semiconductor with superhigh hole mobility can be attributed to the formation of ferrotoroidicity and the highly ordered transport channel. This work paves the way for the application of ferrotoroidic materials in sensing, information storage as well as flexible electronics.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Assisted Separation of Weakly Magnetic Metal Ions in Porous Media.Part 1: Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report experiments on the magnetophoresis of paramagnetic (MnCl2) and diamagnetic (ZnCl2) metal ions in porous media under the influence of a non-uniform magnetic field generated by a permanent magnet. Experiments were carried out in a range of initial ion concentrations (1-100 mM), porous media particle sizes (63 um and 500 um), and varying mixture ratios of metal ion concentrations. For single-ion magnetophoresis, paramagnetic MnCl2 migrated toward the magnet surface, with an enrichment of approximately 2-4 percent near regions of high magnetic field. Conversely, diamagnetic ZnCl2 moved away from regions of highest magnetic field gradients, with depletion levels of 0.5-1.8 percent relative to the initial concentration. Our results demonstrate that magnetophoresis is directly proportional to porous media particle size, increasing with larger particle sizes, a trend attributed to the reduced drag forces experienced by the ions in media with larger particles. Interestingly, in binary mixtures, both MnCl2 and ZnCl2 migrated toward regions of highest magnetic field, contrary to their individual behaviors. The magnetophoretic effect of MnCl2 was diminished with increasing concentrations of ZnCl2, indicating interactions between the two ions. These findings suggest that both metal ions undergo field-induced cluster formation, with cluster sizes in the micrometer range, in both single and binary ion systems. In binary mixtures, the two ions appear to interact, potentially forming mixed clusters containing both MnCl2 and ZnCl2.</description>
