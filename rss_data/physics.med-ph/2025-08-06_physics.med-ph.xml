      <title>Fast Magnetic Resonance Simulation Using Combined Update with Grouped Isochromats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to overcome an assumption of conventional MR simulators: Individual isochromats should be simulated individually. To reduce the computational times of MR simulation, a new simulation method using grouped isochromats is proposed. When multiple isochromats are grouped before simulations, some parts of the simulation can be shared in each group. For a certain gradient type, the isochromats in the group can be easily chosen for ensuring that they behave the same. For example, the group can be defined as the isochromats whose locations along x-axis, T1, T2 and magnetic field inhomogeneity values are the same values. In such groups, simulations can be combined when a pulse sequence with the magnetic field gradient along x-axis only are processed. The processing times of the conventional and proposed methods were evaluated with several sequences including fast spin echo (FSE) and echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences. The simulation times of the proposed method were 3 to 72 times faster than those of the conventional methods. In the cases of 27.5 million isochromats using single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions and multi-threading, the conventional method simulated FSE and EPI sequences in 208.4 and 66.4 seconds, respectively. In the same cases, the proposed method simulated these sequences in 38.1 and 7.1 seconds, respectively.</description>

      <title>3D Mapping of Static Magnetic Field Magnitude and AxialComponents around a total body 3T MRI clinical scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective. The technology employed in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems has evolved continuously, resulting in MRI scanners with stronger static magnetic fields (SMF) B0, faster and stronger gradient magnetic fields, and more powerful radiofrequency transmission coils. The most well-known hazard associated with an MRI environment is the projectile effect due to Spatial Field Gradient (SFG). Furthermore, movement through the SFG generates a time-varying magnetic field, which in turn induces a voltage in body tissues. This has the potential to result in a range of physiological symptoms, including headache, nausea, vertigo, phosphenes, numbness, tingling, loss of proprioception, and balance disturbances.
  Approach. The methodology outlined in this study provides a comprehensive and reliable approach to creating a 3D map of the SMF (fringe field) around a clinical MRI facility. The methodology involves measuring the unperturbed B field, including magnitude and axial components, in specific points and subsequently performing a mathematical procedure involving fitting and interpolation.
  Main results. Fringe field magnitude and axial components 3D maps are presented for a 3T whole-body MRI scanner for clinical application located in a hospital facility.
  Significance. The map obtained could be used for a number of purposes, including the evaluation of hazard. This could be achieved by using digital tools to create a simulation of all types of MRI workers movements within the facility. The map could also be used for the training and education of MRI operators, with a view to establishing best practices. The estimation of magnetic field axial components represents a valuable enhancement, as these data can be used to calculate induced electric fields during rotational movements, such as those of the head or torso.</description>

      <title>Phase-Pole-Free Images and Smooth Coil Sensitivity Maps by Regularized Nonlinear Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Phase singularities are a common problem in image reconstruction with auto-calibrated sensitivities due to an inherent ambiguity of the estimation problem. The purpose of this work is to develop a method for detecting and correcting phase poles in non-linear inverse (NLINV) reconstruction of MR images and coil sensitivity maps. Methods: Phase poles are detected in individual coil sensitivity maps by computing the curl in each pixel. A weighted average of the curl in each coil is computed to detect phase poles. Phase pole detection and correction is then integrated into the iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton method of the NLINV algorithm, which then avoid phase singularities in the reconstructed images. The method is evaluated for reconstruction of accelerated Cartesian MPRAGE data of the brain and interactive radial real-time MRI of the human heart. Results: Phase poles are reliably removed in NLINV reconstructions for both applications. NLINV with phase pole correction can reliably and efficiently estimate coil sensitivity profiles free from singularities even from very small ($7\times7$) auto-calibration (AC) regions. Conclusion: NLINV emerges as an efficient and reliable tool for image reconstruction and coil sensitivity estimation in challenging MRI applications.</description>

      <title>A high-order deterministic dynamical low-rank method for proton transport in heterogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dose calculations in proton therapy require the fast and accurate solution of a high-dimensional transport equation for a large number of (pencil) beams with different energies and directions. Deterministically solving this transport problem at a sufficient resolution can however be prohibitively expensive, especially due to highly forward peaked scattering of the protons. We propose using a model order reduction approach, the dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA), which evolves the solution on the manifold of low-rank matrices in (pseudo-)time. For this, we compare a collided-uncollided split of the linear Boltzmann equation and its Fokker-Planck approximation. We treat the uncollided part using a ray-tracer and combine high-order phase space discretizations and a mixture model for materials with DLRA for the collided equation. Our method reproduces the results of a full-rank reference code at significantly lower rank, and thus computational cost and memory, and further makes computations feasible at much higher resolutions. At higher resolutions, we also achieve good accuracy with respect to TOPAS MC in homogeneous as well as heterogeneous materials. Finally, we demonstrate that several beam sources with different angles can be computed with little cost increase compared to individual beams.</description>

      <title>BlurryScope enables compact, cost-effective scanning microscopy for HER2 scoring using deep learning on blurry images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We developed a rapid scanning optical microscope, termed "BlurryScope", that leverages continuous image acquisition and deep learning to provide a cost-effective and compact solution for automated inspection and analysis of tissue sections. This device offers comparable speed to commercial digital pathology scanners, but at a significantly lower price point and smaller size/weight. Using BlurryScope, we implemented automated classification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) scores on motion-blurred images of immunohistochemically (IHC) stained breast tissue sections, achieving concordant results with those obtained from a high-end digital scanning microscope. Using a test set of 284 unique patient cores, we achieved testing accuracies of 79.3% and 89.7% for 4-class (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) and 2-class (0/1+, 2+/3+) HER2 classification, respectively. BlurryScope automates the entire workflow, from image scanning to stitching and cropping, as well as HER2 score classification.</description>
