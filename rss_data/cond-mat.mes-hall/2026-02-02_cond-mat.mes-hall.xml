      <title>Andreev spin qubits based on the helical edge states of magnetically doped two-dimensional topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Andreev spin qubits can be realized in a Josephson junction based on the helical edge states of a two-dimensional topological insulator (quantum spin Hall system) proximized by superconducting films, in the presence of magnetic doping. We demonstrate that the electrical dipole transitions between the Andreev spin states induced by the magnetic doping can be harnessed to optically manipulate the Andreev spin qubit by microwave radiation pulses. We numerically simulate the realization of NOT and Hadamard quantum logic gates, and discuss implementations in realistic setups.</description>

      <title>Magnon Kerr effect in a magnetic thin film strongly coupled to a microwave resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity magnonics investigates hybrid systems where magnons interact coherently with photons, providing a platform to harness light-matter interaction in magnetic materials. Progress in this field hinges on achieving stronger and tunable nonlinear effects, which are essential for controlling magnon dynamics and frequency conversion. Here, we demonstrate the magnon Kerr effect in an anisotropic magnonic system comprising a 200~nm-thick yttrium iron garnet film strongly coupled to a three-dimensional microwave resonator. The strong shape anisotropy significantly enhances the magnon Kerr effect compared to a sphere of equivalent volume, while the cavity enables sensitive probing of magnetization dynamics. We demonstrate continuous tunability of the magnitude and sign of the Kerr shift by controlling the static orientation of the magnetization. Input-output modeling of the magnon-photon interaction provides a consistent description of our system and Kerr coefficients matching the experimental results. Our findings demonstrate a scalable approach to enhancing Kerr anharmonicity in hybrid magnon-photon systems while preserving strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Moire folded helical states at the interfaces of heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A minimal model of a graphene topological insulator heterostructure is considered, where a moire superlattice modulates the Rashba spin orbit interaction. In the spin degenerate, spin orbit free limit, the reduced Brillouin zone contains flat, spin degenerate moire minibands, with periodicity determined by superlattice folding. The inclusion of spin orbit interaction lifts the spin degeneracy and reduces the effective spectral periodicity by a factor of two. Through spin orbit interaction, the moire potential entangles spin, sublattice, and leg degrees of freedom, reshaping the miniband structure in momentum space and generating emergent helicity spectral functions. As the Rashba coupling is renormalized by the moire pattern, it induces helicity fragmentation, in which the helicity weight is distributed across a dense manifold of moire minibands, forming an extended network of helicity carrying states and significantly enhancing helicity fluctuations at the bare response level. The emergence of Dirac like miniband crossings at finite spin orbit interaction demonstrates that moire heterostructures can support relativistic quasiparticles through band reconstruction. This model provides a microscopic mechanism by which proximity induced spin orbit coupling can be amplified via moire engineering.</description>

      <title>Spin quantum Hall transition on random networks: exact critical exponents via quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the problem of the spin quantum Hall transition on random networks using a mapping to classical percolation that focuses on the boundary of percolating clusters. Using tools of two-dimensional quantum gravity, we compute critical exponents that characterize this transition and confirm that these are related to the exponents for the regular (square) network through the KPZ relation. Our results demonstrate the relevance of the geometric randomness of the networks and support conclusions of numerical simulations of random networks for the integer quantum Hall transition.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Flow Spectroscopy of a Polariton Condensate: Kibble-Zurek and Kolmogorov-Like Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantized vortices are fundamental topological excitations of quantum fluids. We report single-shot interferometric measurements of spontaneous vortex nucleation in a room-temperature organic exciton-polariton condensate. From hundreds of independent realizations we find random vortex-core positions and unbiased circulation, consistent with intrinsically stochastic, unpinned defect formation. The mean vortex number scales with pump power above threshold with an exponent consistent with Kibble-Zurek freeze-out in a driven-dissipative condensate. Using reconstructed phase maps we obtain single-shot flow fields, compute the incompressible component, and extract kinetic-energy spectra. Vortex-containing realizations develop a robust Kolmogorov-like segment with Einc(k) proportional to k^(-5/3) over a finite k range, indicating the onset of turbulent spectral scaling in a quantum fluid of light. These results establish single-shot access to phase and flow as a direct route to quantifying stochastic defect formation and emerging turbulence in polariton condensates.</description>

      <title>Gate-tuneable single-photon emitters in WSe2 monolayer created via AFM nanoindentation on rigid SiO2/Si substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters (SPEs) hosted by two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting materials are envisioned for next-generation quantum applications. However, SPE creation in 2D semiconductors on rigid substrates like SiO2/Si via nanoindentation is a technological gap, critical for interfacing SPEs with photonic circuits and cavities. Here, we report a protocol for deterministically creating SPEs in monolayer WSe2 on SiO2/Si substrates using a sharp diamond AFM (atomic force microscope) tip. A displacement-controlled indentation process is developed, allowing indent depths &gt; 150 nm necessary for creating SPEs. Sharp defect peaks (~200 {\mu}eV) are observed in cryogenic (4K) photoluminescence (PL) spectrum at nanoindented sites and are stable upto ~ 120K. 76% of sites exhibit sharp defect-bound peaks confirmed by power-dependent, temperature-dependent, and time-resolved PL (TRPL). AFM and PL mapping link these peaks to indent periphery. The peaks show sub-linewidth spectral jitter, no blinking, and single-photon nature in second-order autocorrelation measurements. SPEs can be switched on/off, and background emissions suppressed using electrical gating. Gate-voltage dependent TRPL indicate that SPE dynamics can be tuned, depending on nature of SPE, pointing the way to higher-purity SPEs. Our work is directly applicable to other 2D materials and photonic circuit/cavity compatible rigid substrates and is a significant step for scalable SPE technologies.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of antiskyrmion shrinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiskyrmions are unstable in ferromagnetic systems with isotropic bulk or interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). We develop a continuum model for the shrinking dynamics of antiskyrmions in bulk DMI systems, using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for the time derivative of the magnetization field. Owing to the structure of their azimuthal angle, or helicity, elliptic antiskyrmions are energetically favored over circular ones. To capture this feature, we parametrize the magnetization field with a triangular radial profile and an elliptic in-plane shape. This ansatz yields four coupled dynamical equations governing time evolution of the semi-axes, helicities, and rotation angles. In the absence of the DMI, circular antiskyrmions shrink isotropically, exhibiting a crossover from exponential decay to square-root collapse. Initially elliptic antiskyrmions are driven towards circularity. For finite DMI, the semi-axes dynamics couples to the helicity and rotation, where the theory predicts a rotation angle following by half of the slope of the helicity evolution which is linear in time. Only at small semi-axes a cross-over to a logarithmic divergence occurs. The shrinking dynamics of the antiskyrmion size is found to be accompanied by quadrupole-like oscillations. Numerical simulations on the lattice support the predictions from the continuum model.</description>

      <title>Probing Interfacial Spin Dynamics and Temperature Dependent Asymmetry in Spin Pumping Across Ni80Fe20/Cu/Cr1.12Te2 Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin transfers in magnetic multilayers offers a promising pathway toward ultrafast, energy-efficient spintronic devices. In this study, we investigate the interfacial spin pumping and temperature-dependent spin current exchange in a Cr1.12Te2/Cu/Ni80Fe20 (Py)(FM1/NM/FM2) trilayer structure. Using broadband and cryogenic ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements, we investigate key magnetization dynamical parameters, including the effective Gilbert damping factor, effective magnetic fields, interfacial spin mixing conductance, and spin current density. Efficient spin angular momentum transfers from Py to Cr1.12Te2 are observed at room temperature. At lower temperatures, the enhanced linewidth reflects temperature dependent spin pumping effects occurring at distinct precession frequencies of the ferromagnetic layers. Notably, the absence of interfacial Damping indicates that spin pumping can be modulated by controlling the net spin current flow. These findings offer critical insight into temperature-dependent tunable spin transport mechanisms in magnetic multilayers, highlighting their potential for next-generation spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodic Skin Criticality in an Exactly Solvable Non-Hermitian Quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical states in quasiperiodic systems defy the conventional dichotomy between extended and localized states. In this work, we demonstrate that non-Hermiticity fundamentally reshapes this paradigm by giving rise to an exactly solvable quasiperiodic critical phase with no energy selectivity. We introduce a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattice based on a modulated Hatano-Nelson model and uncover a new universality class of quasiperiodic skin criticality, in which all eigenstates share an identical multifractal spatial structure. Through a nonunitary gauge transformation, the system is mapped onto a disorder-free lattice, enabling exact analytical solutions for the full spectrum and eigenstates. As a consequence, the inverse participation ratio is strictly energy-independent and controlled solely by a global phase. We further show that this criticality persists in multiband lattices, establishing a general and analytically controlled framework for non-Hermitian quasiperiodic critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Charging energy effects on a single-edge anyon braiding detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of capacitive coupling on the detection of anyon braiding in a single-edge interferometer realized in the fractional quantum Hall regime. In this setup, a quantum point contact bends a single edge into a loop, where tunneling occurs at the open end and is controlled by the QPC voltage. In contrast with previously studied two-edge geometries, the weak backscattering regime is dominated by the first-order perturbative term, allowing quantum transport quantities to factorize into a non-universal prefactor and a braiding-induced contribution that provides direct access to the universal statistical angle $\pi\lambda$. While previous analyses neglected edge-to-edge capacitance, we show that capacitive effects, which are known to play a crucial role in mesoscopic capacitors, modify both the current and the current cross-correlations. Using a two-point Green's function formalism augmented by Dyson's equation to include the charging energy, we quantify how the fluctuations of the cross-correlations depend simultaneously on $\lambda$ and on the capacitance of the loop. Our results indicate that a reliable extraction of the statistical angle requires a parallel measurement of the loop capacitance, which can be implemented via a charged gate coupled to the junction.</description>

      <title>Andreev bound states in a superconducting qubit at odd parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum mechanics of the Josephson effect is the core ingredient for quantum technologies with superconducting circuits. A new avenue was recently opened in this field by predicting that the Josephson quantum mechanics in the odd parity sector, when a quasiparticle in trapped in an Andreev bound state, is fundamentally different from the conventional one in the even sector. The focus was then on a Josephson junction surrounded by an electromagnetic environment formed of a collection of bosonic modes, including the case of an ohmic environment. Here we consider the distinct case of a superconducting qubit made of a single Josephson junction whose environment reduces to a capacitance. We find a novel structure for the low-lying discrete states in the odd sector, which is altogether different from the one that appears in the even sector. Our study of the bound-state spectrum ranges from the Coulomb-dominated (Cooper pair box) to the Josephson-dominated (transmon) regime. Our prediction could be tested in forthcoming experiments with superconductor/semiconductor/superconductor junctions, which have been studied intensively in recent years, both using nanowires as well as two-dimensional electron gases.</description>

      <title>Loop-gap resonators achieving strong magnon-photon coupling in magnetic insulator thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnon-photon hybrid systems consisting of a three-dimensional electromagnetic resonator and a bulk magnetic insulator constitute the standard experimental platform in cavity magnonics. Here, we demonstrate a modular loop-gap resonator design optimized to couple with thin films of magnetic insulators. We achieve the strong-coupling regime using this loop-gap resonator coupled to a 75~nm-thick epitaxial film of yttrium iron garnet at room temperature. We further show how to perform field-differential spectroscopy of the hybrid magnon-photon system, which eliminates the unwanted signal from other loop-gap modes uncoupled to the magnetic film. In addition to the uniform ferromagnetic resonance mode, the loop-gap resonator enables an hybridization with the standing spin-wave modes forming across the thickness of the film. Our approach unlocks the use of epitaxial films and multilayers of magnetic insulators to tune the magnon band structure in cavity magnonics experiments.</description>

      <title>In-situ Straining of Epitaxial Freestanding Ferroic Films through a MEMS Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical strain can be used to control physical properties in materials. The experimental investigation of strain-induced effects at the nanoscale is of importance not only for its fundamental aspect, but also for the development of device applications. Transmission X-ray microscopy is a particularly well-suited technique for the nanoscale imaging of magnetic materials, but its compatibility with in-situ mechanical straining of samples is limited. In this work, we present a setup for applying tailored in-situ mechanical strains to freestanding thin films by means of a micro electromechanical system (MEMS) actuator. We then present a proof-of-concept experiment where a freestanding 80 nm thick (001) BiFeO$_3$ multiferroic thin film is strained with the MEMS device, allowing us to control the coupled ferroelectric/spin cycloidal configuration.</description>

      <title>SpinWaveToolkit: Python package for (semi-)analytical calculations in the field of spin-wave physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open-source Python package, SpinWaveToolkit (SWT), for (semi-)analytical modeling of spin-wave dynamics in thin ferromagnetic films and exchange-coupled magnetic bilayers. SWT combines analytical models based on the Kalinikos-Slavin theory with a semi-analytical dynamic-matrix approach, enabling the calculation of dispersion relations, group velocities, decay lengths, mode profiles, and static equilibrium magnetization states. In addition, SWT implements a quantitative model of micro-focused Brillouin light scattering (BLS) that incorporates vectorial optical focusing, spin-wave Bloch functions, magneto-optical coupling, and Green-function propagation to simulate experimentally measured BLS spectra. The package is validated against finite-element dynamic-matrix simulations performed with TetraX for Damon-Eshbach, backward-volume, forward-volume, and oblique-field geometries, showing excellent agreement while reducing computation times by nearly two orders of magnitude in comparison to the numerical simulations. Thanks to the easiness of the use and fast calculation times, SWT can be used not only for exploratory mapping of the parameter space, but also for the fitting of the measured dispersion relations and related parameters. Thus, it provides a versatile and efficient framework for experiment design, interpretation, and parameter optimization for magnonics research.</description>

      <title>Weight-four parity checks with silicon spin qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in coherent spin shuttling have made sparse semiconductor spin qubit arrays an appealing solid-state platform to realize quantum processors. The dynamic and long-range connectivity enabled by shuttling is also essential for many quantum error-correction (QEC) schemes. Here, we demonstrate a silicon spin-qubit device that comprises a shuttling bus for coherently transporting qubits that can interact at four isolated locations we call bus stops. We dynamically populate the array and tune all single- and two-qubit operations using shuttling and quantum non-demolition (QND) spin measurements, without access to charge sensing in most of the device. We achieve universal control of the effective five-qubit processor and select the connectivity required to form a surface-code stabilizer plaquette that supports X- and Z-type parity checks up to weight-four. We use the parity checks to generate multi-qubit entanglement between all qubit combinations in the array and report the genuine entanglement of a five-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, constituting the largest such state ever constructed with gate-defined semiconductor spins. This work opens immediate opportunities to pursue QEC experiments with spin qubits, and the protocols developed here lay the groundwork for the modular calibration and operation of sparse spin qubit arrays.</description>

      <title>Analytical topological invariants for 2D non-Hermitian phases using Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As energy dissipation and gain are ubiquitous in the real world, such phenomena demand the generalization of Hermitian methods such as the analysis of topological properties for non-Hermitian systems. However, as non-Hermitian systems typically contain more degrees of freedom, this poses a challenge for analytical approaches to understand their topology and invariants. In this work, we analytically calculate the 2D Zak phase for a 2D non-Hermitian SSH-type Hamiltonian that supports a rich structure and edge currents. Closed-form expressions for eigenstates and divisions of the phase diagram are obtained, including for regions in the phase diagram where different types of exceptional points exist. We use Morse theory to determine the topology of exceptional points in momentum space. Although the band structure breaks down at exceptional points, we show that a specific phase-based topological invariant remains well-defined. Furthermore, our work yields an analytic derivation for counting edge states in the Hermitian limit. These results provide new conceptual and analytical tools for the study of complex topological systems.</description>

      <title>Interaction induced topological magnon in electron-magnon coupled systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the emergence of topological magnons in electron-magnon coupled systems. The magnon dispersion in a ferromagnet usually possesses an effective time reversal symmetry in the absence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, preventing the appearance of topological magnons. When a spin system is coupled to itinerant electrons, we find that the magnon band structure of the spin system experiences time-reversal symmetry breaking with the electron-magnon interaction via the exchange coupling, where topological magnons arise without requiring strong DM. Specifically, we consider a heterostructure consisting of a ferromagnetic insulator and a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayer and investigate topological gap opening in magnon bands. Our findings reveal that even trivial ferromagnets can host topological magnons via coupling to itinerant electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Theory of Little-Parks oscillations by vortices in two-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Little-Parks (LP) effect is a quantum phenomenon in which the superconducting transition temperature of a superconducting cylinder (or ring) oscillates periodically as a function of the magnetic flux threading the loop. Recently, multiple experiments have observed half-quantum flux shifts in measurements of LP oscillations, where the oscillations are globally shifted by half a flux quantum compared to conventional cases, a behavior referred to as a $\pi$-ring. Such observations are commonly linked to unconventional pairing symmetries. In this work, we demonstrate that half-quantum flux shifts can arise in two-dimensional (2D) superconducting rings without invoking unconventional pairing symmetry, provided that vortices near the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition are taken into account. Specifically, based on the vortex-charge duality theory near the BKT transition, we map the problem onto a Coulomb gas model, in which the magnetic flux is represented as a pair of opposite boundary charges (or vortices) at the two edges. The screening of these boundary charges by thermally excited vortex-antivortex pairs is investigated through explicit Monte Carlo simulations. Importantly, we demonstrate that the oscillation of the free-vortex density as a function of magnetic flux can exhibit an anomalous half-quantum flux shift, depending on the geometry of the sample. Our work thus predicts the LP oscillations induced by vortices in 2D superconducting rings near the BKT transition, which provides a new mechanism for generating $\pi$-rings.</description>

      <title>Singular flat bands in three dimensions: Landau level spreading, quantum geometry, and Weyl reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate three-dimensional singular flat band systems, focusing on their quantum geometric properties and response to external magnetic fields. As a representative example, we study the pyrochlore lattice, which hosts a pair of degenerate flat bands touching a dispersive band. We derive a three-orbital effective continuum model that captures the essential features near the band-touching point. Within this framework, we identify the point-like topological singularity on a planar manifold defined by the degenerate flat band eigenvectors. This singularity strongly influences the quantum geometry and results in a characteristic Landau level structure, where the levels spread over a finite energy range. We show that this structure reflects the underlying band reconstruction due to the orbital Zeeman effect, which lifts the flat band degeneracy and induces the Weyl-semimetal-like dispersion near the singularity. Our analysis reveals that the range of Landau level spreading is proportional to the quantum metric of each Zeeman-split band. We further demonstrate that adding a small dispersion via longer-range . Finally, we show that our approach extends naturally to systems with higher orbital angular momentum, indicating the robustness of these features in a broad class of three-dimensional flat band models.</description>

      <title>Spin Current Generation Controlled by the N\'{e}el State in a Compensated Ferrimagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compensated ferrimagnets, which break sublattice and time-reversal symmetries in the ground state, exhibit an isotropic ferromagnet-like spin splitting despite a vanishing net magnetization, in contrast to altermagnets with momentum-dependent spin splitting. We investigate how isotropic spin splitting manifests in spin transport by analyzing the spin Seebeck effect and spin pumping in a junction between a compensated ferrimagnet and a normal metal. We show that compensated ferrimagnets generate a sizable spin Seebeck signal, with a sign that can be reversed by switching between the two N\'{e}el states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that spin pumping exhibits a N\'{e}el-state-dependent resonance splitting, which is absent in conventional antiferromagnets. These results identify spin pumping as a natural readout mechanism for compensated ferrimagnets and establish them as promising magnetization-free building blocks for spintronic memory devices.</description>

      <title>Alignment behavior of 2D diopsides (d-silicates) under the influence of an AC electric field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling the alignment of two dimensional (2D) materials is crucial for optimizing their electronic and mechanical properties in next generation devices. This study explores how electric fields can manipulate the orientation of 2D diopside (CaMgSi2O6) flakes, a flexible silicate material, through a phenomenon called flexoelectricity, where applied voltage generates mechanical strain. We exfoliated diopside crystals into ultrathin flakes, placed them on microelectrodes, and used AC electric fields to induce alignment via acoustic strain. Raman spectroscopy showed that the flakes reoriented/realigned under the field, with vibrational peaks weakening most at high frequencies (10 MHz). Electrical tests revealed this alignment improves conductivity by 20-30%, as straightened flakes create better pathways for current flow. Fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations further explained how these flakes naturally align on surfaces within picoseconds, matching our experimental observations. Together, these findings demonstrate a practical way to tune diopside properties using electric fields, opening doors for its use in flexible electronics, sensors, and energy devices.</description>

      <title>Dirac quantum criticality in twisted double bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of moir\'e double bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides with ABBA stacking as a function of twist angle and applied pressure. At hole filling $\nu = 2$ per moir\'e unit cell, the noninteracting system hosts a Dirac semimetal with graphene-like low-energy bands in the moir\'e Brillouin zone. At small twist angles, the Fermi velocity is reduced and interactions dominate the low-temperature behavior. A strong-coupling analysis identifies insulating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground-state candidates, characterized by spin-density modulations set by the moir\'e scale. Using a realistic continuum model with long-range Coulomb interactions, we perform self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations to study the competition between these states. Varying the twist angle or pressure drives a transition from a Dirac semimetal to an antiferromagnetic insulator, which breaks SU(2) spin rotation and two-fold lattice rotation symmetries. Within a renormalization group analysis of the most general symmetry-allowed low-energy field theory, we show that this semimetal-to-insulator transition is continuous and belongs to the (2+1)D relativistic Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality class with $N = 2$ four-component Dirac fermions. Finite heterostrain, relevant in realistic samples, induces a crossover from Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality at intermediate temperatures to conventional (2+1)D Heisenberg criticality at the lowest temperatures. Further decreasing the twist angle can cause a level crossing from the antiferromagnetic insulator into a ferromagnetic insulator with spin-split bands. Our results provide a comprehensive theoretical framework that complements and elucidates recent experiments in twisted double bilayer WSe$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When focusing on a few essential bands in an effective description of a material to calculate observable quantities, the respective operators have to be adjusted accordingly. Ignoring contributions arising from integrating out remote bands can lead to qualitatively wrong results. We present a detailed analysis of the interband mixing effects on spin currents. Specifically, we calculate the intrinsic spin current in a time-reversal invariant noncentrosymmetric crystal in the presence of electron-lattice spin-orbit coupling. Starting from formally exact microscopic expressions, we derive the spin current operator restricted to one or more essential bands by iterative elimination of the contributions from distant bands. We show that the standard definition of the spin current operator in terms of the group velocity obtained from an effective band Hamiltonian cannot be justified using a microscopic theory. The modified expression for the spin current operator contains additional terms, which dominate the equilibrium spin current in a uniform crystal. We show that the magnitude of these additional terms can considerably exceed the spin current obtained using the standard definition.</description>

      <title>Dipolar Interfacial Excitons in Lateral Semiconductor Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) quantum systems are a cornerstone of many-body physics. However, their realization in solids has traditionally relied on top-down methods, which are limited by structural disorder and coarse confinement. Here, we demonstrate a fundamentally distinct route: the emergence of 1D quantum matter at the atomically sharp interface between monolayer semiconductors. Using lateral MoSe2-WSe2 heterostructures, we identify interfacial excitonic quasiparticles that are bound to the crystal junction. Photoluminescence spectroscopy resolves these excitons into a ladder of discrete states, establishing nanoscopic 1D confinement at length scales of 3 nm. These excitons possess exceptional large permanent in-plane electric dipole moments exceeding e x 2 nm, and exhibit micron-scale, highly anisotropic diffusion confined to the interface. Crucially, the lateral geometry enables dynamic, in-situ reconfiguration of the exciton's internal structure. By introducing electrostatic doping, we demonstrate a collapse of the dipole moment and a 20-fold reduction in radiative lifetime. This structural tunability establishes lateral interfaces as a uniquely powerful platform for the 'bottom-up' engineering of 1D quantum matter. By enabling the dynamic tuning of wavefunctions within a single atomic monolayer, this work opens a scalable route toward 1D excitonic circuits and strongly correlated 1D bosonic phases.</description>

      <title>Interface effects and dielectric mismatch in ultrathin silicon on insulator films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of interface states and dielectric mismatch is studied in ultrathin P-doped silicon-on-insulator (SOI) films with thickness of the device layer ($H_{SOI}$) varying from 30 to 8 nm and dopant concentration ($n_{D}$) ranging from 10$^{18}$ to nearly 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$. P concentration is determined by Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Sample resistivity ($\rho$), carrier concentration ($n_e$), and mobility ($\mu_e$) are extracted by combining sheet resistance and Hall measurements in van der Pauw configuration. When $H_{SOI}$ = 30 nm, transport properties at room temperature are fully compatible with those of a similarly doped bulk Si. Progressive 2D confinement by reduction of $H_{SOI}$ below 30 nm results in a reduction of the carrier concentration and a concomitant degradation of $\mu_e$. These effects, which are steadily enhanced decreasing $n_D$, are attributed to non-passivated interface states at the SiO$_2$/Si interface and can be significantly mitigated by high temperature rapid thermal oxidation (RTO). The effectiveness of this approach was verified by electron-paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra and capacitance-voltage (CV) measurements, which allowed the assessment of the quality of the RTO-SiO$_2$/Si interface and the correlation with observed electrical properties. After effective interface engineering, low temperature electrical characterization revealed a significant increase in P ionization energy in samples with $H_{SOI}$ &lt;= 15 nm, a result directly related to the dielectric mismatch.</description>

      <title>Diffusive and hydrodynamic magnetotransport around a density perturbation in a two-dimensional electron gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study current flow around a density inhomogeneity in a two-dimensional electron gas in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The inhomogeneity is parametrized by a power-law tail with an exponent $\beta &gt; 2$. We show that current and electrochemical potential are exponentially suppressed inside a surrounding area much larger than the geometric size of the perturbation. The corresponding ``no-go'' radius grows as a certain power of the magnetic field. Residual current and potential exhibit spiraling patterns inside the no-go region. Outside of it, they acquire corrections inversely proportional to the distance, which is known as the Landauer resistivity dipole. The Landauer dipole is rotated by the angle $\pi (1 - 1 / \beta)$ with respect to the average electric field. The rotation direction depends on whether the local density is raised or lowered. We also consider the effect of electron viscosity and show that the variation of the no-go radius with magnetic field becomes more rapid if viscosity is large enough. The Landauer dipole size is set by the Gurzhi length, which is much larger than the no-go radius, which is in turn much larger than the geometric size of the perturbation. Our results may be useful for interpreting nanoimaging of current distribution in graphene and other two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven Floquet quantum many-body systems have revealed new insights into the rich interplay of thermalization, and growth of entanglement. The phenomenology of dynamical freezing, whereby a translationally invariant many-body system exhibits emergent conservation laws and a slow growth of entanglement entropy at certain fixed ratios of a drive amplitude and frequency, presents a novel paradigm for retaining memory of an initial state upto late times. Previous studies of dynamical freezing have largely been restricted to a high-frequency Floquet-Magnus expansion, and numerical exact diagonalization, which are unable to capture the slow approach to thermalization (or lack thereof) in a systematic fashion. By employing Floquet flow-renormalization, where the time-dependent part of the Hamiltonian is gradually decoupled from the effective Hamiltonian using a sequence of unitary transformations, we unveil the universal approach to dynamical freezing and beyond, at asymptotically late times. We analyze the fixed-point behavior associated with the flow-renormalization at and near freezing using both exact-diagonalization and tensor-network based methods, and contrast the results with conventional prethermal phenomenon. For a generic non-integrable spin Hamiltonian with a periodic cosine wave drive, the flow approaches an unstable fixed point with an approximate emergent symmetry. We observe that at freezing the thermalization timescales are delayed compared to away from freezing, and the flow trajectory undergoes a series of instanton events. Our numerical results are supported by analytical solutions to the flow equations.</description>

      <title>Digital Quantum Simulation of the Lindblad Master Equation and Its Nonlinear Extensions via Quantum Trajectory Averaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since precisely controlling dissipation in realistic environments is challenging, digital simulation of the Lindblad master equation (LME) is of great significance for understanding nonequilibrium dynamics in open quantum systems. However, achieving long-time simulations for complex systems with multiple dissipation channels remains a major challenge, both theoretically and experimentally. Here, we propose a 1-dilation digital scheme for simulating the LME based on quantum trajectory averaging without postselection. By rigorously matching the stochasticity inherent in quantum trajectories with the probabilistic outcomes of quantum measurements, our method effectively translates the classically established quantum jump algorithm into executable quantum circuits. A key advantage of our method is that it overcomes the exponential suppression of success probability seen in some existing postselection-dependent schemes, especially for long-time evolution or systems with numerous jump operators. Moreover, the scheme can be extended to a 2-dilation framework for the nonlinear LME with postselection, bridging the full LME and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian dynamics. This extended scheme provides a digital approach for exploring the interplay between non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and dissipative terms within a monitored quantum dynamics framework.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectrically Switchable Chirality in Topological Superconductivity</title>

Abstract: The interplay between ferroelectricity, magnetism, and superconductivity provides a rich platform for discovering novel quantum phenomena. Here, we develop an effective theory and propose a heterostructure composed of an antiferromagnetic bilayer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ coupled with the s-wave superconductor Fe(Se,Te), enabling the realization of chiral topological superconductivity (CTSC) with switchable chirality. The chirality of the CTSC is controlled by the direction of spontaneous polarization, which arises from interlayer sliding-induced ferroelectricity or charge transfer in the bilayer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$. This sliding mechanism breaks the $\mathcal{M}_{z}\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetries, leading to the anomalous Hall effect in the spin polarized metallic Dirac band and drives the emergence of CTSC when the s-wave superconductivity appears. Our work not only provides a new pathway to achieve and control topological superconductivity but also opens avenues for experimental exploration of Majorana physics and topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic domain walls under spin-orbit torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain walls in antiferromagnets under a spin-polarized current present dynamical behavior that is not observed in ferromagnets, and it is tunable by the current polarization. Precessional dynamics is obtained for perpendicular spin polarization. In-plane polarization gives propagating walls. We obtain the velocity as a function of current by a perturbation method for low velocities, and the wall profile is found to lack a definite parity. For high velocities, a power-law decay develops in the trailing tail of the wall. The main features of the wall profile are manifest in a direct solution of an equation that is valid in a limiting case. Oscillatory motion of domain walls is obtained for a spin polarization that has both perpendicular and in-plane components, and an analytical description is given. We discuss the modifications of the dynamics when a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is present. Finally, we give the magnetization of the dynamical walls and find that this can become large, providing a potential method for observations.</description>

      <title>Accurate and efficient simulation of photoemission spectroscopy via Kohn-Sham scattering states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient first-principles framework for simulating angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) based on the direct computation of photoelectron states as solutions of the Kohn-Sham equation with scattering boundary conditions. While the one-step theory of photoemission has a long and successful history, existing implementations are often tied to specialized electronic-structure formalisms. Our approach is formally equivalent to the Lippmann-Schwinger formulation, and it is directly compatible with standard plane-wave and real-space density functional theory codes, enabling seamless integration with advanced exchange-correlation functionals and modern electronic-structure workflows. By providing explicit photoelectron wave functions, the method allows for a transparent analysis of matrix-element effects, multiple scattering, and experimental geometry. We demonstrate the accuracy and predictive power of the framework through circular-dichroism ARPES simulations for monolayer graphene and bulk $2H$-WSe$_2$, achieving excellent agreement with experimental data over a wide photon-energy range. Our results establish a robust and accessible route toward quantitative ARPES modeling, opening the door to systematic studies of orbital textures, many-body effects, and nonequilibrium phenomena within widely used ab initio platforms.</description>
