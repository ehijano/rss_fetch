      <title>Dynamic spectral tailoring of a 10 GHz laser frequency comb for enhanced calibration of astronomical spectrographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser frequency combs (LFCs) are an important component of Doppler radial velocity (RV) spectroscopy that pushes fractional precision to the $10^{-10}$ level, as required to identify and characterize Earth-like exoplanets. However, large intensity variations across the LFC spectrum that arise in nonlinear broadening limit the range of comb lines that can be used for optimal wavelength calibration with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, temporal spectral-intensity fluctuations of the LFC, that are coupled to flux-dependent detector defects, alter the instrumental point spread function (PSF) and result in spurious RV shifts. To address these issues and improve calibration precision, spectral flattening is crucial for LFCs to maintain a constant photon flux per comb mode. In this work, we demonstrate a dynamic spectral shaping setup using a spatial light modulator (SLM) over the wavelength range of 800nm to 1300nm. The custom shaping compensates for amplitude fluctuations in real time and can also correct for wavelength-dependent spectrograph transmission, achieving a spectral profile that delivers the constant readout necessary for maximizing precision. Importantly, we characterize the out-of-loop properties of the spectral flattener to verify a twofold improvement in spectral stability. This technique, combined with our approach of pumping the waveguide spectral broadener out-of-band at 1550 nm, reduces the required dynamic range. While this spectral region is tailored for the LFC employed at the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) spectrograph, the method is broadly applicable to any LFC used for astronomical spectrograph calibration.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Residual Charge Images in LSST Camera e2v CCDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LSST Camera CCDs produced by the manufacturer e2v exhibit strong and novel residual charge images when exposed to bright sources. These manifest in images following bright exposures both in the same pixel areas as the bright source, and in the pixels trailing between the source and the serial register. Both of these pose systematic challenges to the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time instrument signature removal. The latter trail region is especially impactful as it affects a much larger pixel area in a less well defined position. In our study of this effect at UC Davis, we imaged bright spots to characterize these residual charge effects. We find a strong dependence of the residual charge on the parallel clocking scheme, including the relative levels of the clocking voltages, and the timing of gate phase transition during the parallel transfer. Our study points to independent causes of residual charge in the bright spot region and trail region. We propose potential causes in both regions and suggest methodologies for minimizing residual charge. We consider the trade-offs to these methods including decreasing the camera's full well and dynamic range at the high end. Some of these results and suggestions have been reviewed by the camera commissioning team and may result in changes made to the clocking voltage scheme on the LSST Camera.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After a successful kick-off meeting in 2021. two workshops in 2022 and 2023 on the future Global Cosmic-Ray Observatory (GCOS) focused mainly on a straw man design of the detector and science possibilities for astro- and particle physics. About 100 participants gathered for in-person and hybrid panel discussions. In this report, we summarize these discussions, present a preliminary straw-man design for GCOS and collect short write-ups of the flash talks given during the focus sessions.</description>

      <title>GDL 1.1, a smart and green language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GDL, a free interpreter for the IDL language, continues to develop smoothly, driven by feedback and requests from an increasingly active and growing user base, especially since GDL was made available on GitHub. Among the most notable features introduced in recent years are stable Widgets; extensive testing on M1, M2, and M3 processors; excellent computational performance (including OpenMP support) demonstrated across a comprehensive benchmark; simplified compilation and installation processes; and the availability of SHMMAP and Bridge functions, which enable concurrent GDL runs on shared RAM in HPC environments.
  As developers of GDL, we believe this language holds a valuable place in today's world, where efficiency and low-power computing are essential. GDL (not to mention IDL), written in C/C++, demonstrates exceptional efficiency in "real-world" benchmarks, making it one of the few interpreted languages that can truly be considered "green." Moreover, it is likely the only interpreter accompanied by a vast collection of free, well-tested, and proven astronomical procedures developed by colleagues over the years. GDL also stands out for its suitability for long-term projects, thanks to its stable and reliable syntax.</description>

      <title>Sunrise III: Overview of Observatory and Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In July 2024, Sunrise completed its third successful science flight. The Sunrise III observatory had been upgraded significantly after the two previous successful flights in 2009 and 2013. Three completely new instruments focus on the small-scale physical processes and their complex interaction from the deepest observable layers in the photosphere up to chromospheric heights. Previously poorly explored spectral regions and lines are exploited to paint a three-dimensional picture of the solar atmosphere with unprecedented completeness and level of detail. The full polarimetric information is captured by all three instruments to reveal the interaction between the magnetic fields and the hydrodynamic processes. Two slit- based spectropolarimeters, the Sunrise UV Spectropolarimeter and Imager (SUSI) and the Sunrise Chromospheric Infrared spectro-Polarimeter (SCIP), focus on the near-ultraviolet and the near-infrared regions respectively, and the imaging spectropolarimeter Tunable Magnetograph (TuMag) simultaneously obtains maps of the full field-of-view of $46 \times 46$ Mm$^2$ in the photosphere and the chromosphere in the visible. The instruments are operated in an orchestrated mode, benefiting from a new Image Stabilization and Light Distribution unit (ISLiD), with the Correlating Wavefront Sensor (CWS) providing the autofocus control and an image stability with a root-mean-square value smaller than 0.005''. A new gondola was constructed to significantly improve the telescope pointing stability, required to achieve uninterrupted observations over many hours. Sunrise III was launched successfully on July 10, 2024, from the Esrange Space Center near Kiruna (Sweden). It reached the landing site between the Mackenzie River and the Great Bear Lake in Canada after a flight duration of 6.5 days. In this paper, we give an overview of the Sunrise III observatory and its instruments.</description>

      <title>Expanding the Quantum-Limited Gravitational-Wave Detection Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the potential of new adaptive optical technology to expand the detection horizon of gravitational-wave observatories. Achieving greater quantum-noise-limited sensitivity to spacetime strain hinges on achieving higher circulating laser power, in excess of 1~MW, in conjunction with highly-squeezed quantum states of light. The new technology will enable significantly higher levels of laser power and squeezing in gravitational-wave detectors, by providing high-precision, low-noise correction of limiting sources of thermal distortions directly to the core interferometer optics. In simulated projections for LIGO~A+, assuming an input laser power of 125~W and an effective injected squeezing level of 9~dB entering the interferometer, an initial concept of this technology can reduce the noise floor of the detectors by up to 20\% from 200~Hz to 5~kHz, corresponding to an increment of 4~Mpc in the sky-averaged detection range for binary neutron star mergers. This work lays the foundation for one of the key technology improvements essential to fully utilize the scientific potential of the existing 4-km LIGO facilities, to observe black hole merger events past a redshift of~5, and opens a realistic pathway towards a next-generation 40-km gravitational-wave observatory in the United States, Cosmic~Explorer.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Filamentary Nebula of NGC 1275 with Multiwavelength SITELLE Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The filamentary nebula encompassing the central galaxy of the Perseus Cluster, NGC 1275, is a complex structure extending dozens of kiloparsecs from NGC 1275. Decades of previous works have focused on establishing the primary formation and ionization mechanisms in different filaments. These studies have pointed to a lack of star formation in the majority of the filaments, the importance of magnetic fields and turbulence in several regions, and the role of interactions between the intercluster medium (ICM) and the cool gas in the filaments, as well as the role of interaction between the central radio source, 3C84, and the filaments. In this paper, we present multi-filter observations of the entire filamentary system that cover the optical bandpass, using the SITELLE instrument at the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope. Here, we use the data analysis software, \href{https://crhea93.github.io/LUCI/index.html}{\texttt{LUCI}}, to produce flux maps of the prominent emission lines present in the filters: \oii{}$\lambda$3726/3729, \oiii{}$\lambda$5007, H$\beta$, \nii{}$\lambda$6548, \nii{}$\lambda$6583, and H$\alpha$. We use these maps to produce BPT and WHAN diagrams to study the ionization mechanisms at play in each distinct region of the filamentary nebula. First, we confirm the absence of \oiii{}$\lambda$5007 in the extended filaments, although we detect this line in the central core, revealing a compact region where photoionization by the AGN might affect local conditions. Our findings corroborate previous claims that the ionization in the extended filaments could be caused by the cooling ICM via collisional excitation and/or mixing. Moreover, they support the conclusion that magnetic fields play an important role in the formation and continued existence of the filaments.</description>

      <title>J-PLUS: Spectroscopic validation of H$\alpha$ emission line maps in spatially resolved galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a dedicated automated pipeline to construct spatially resolved emission H$\alpha$+[NII] maps and to derive the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in 12 optical filters (five broad and seven narrow/medium) of H$\alpha$ emission line regions in nearby galaxies (z $&lt;$ 0.0165) observed by the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS). We used the $J0660$ filter of $140${\AA} width centered at $6600${\AA} to trace H$\alpha$ + [NII] emission and $r$ and $i$ broad bands were used to estimate the stellar continuum. We create pure emission line images after the continnum subtraction, where the H$\alpha$ emission line regions were detected. This method was also applied to Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectroscopic data from PHANGS-MUSE, CALIFA and MaNGA surveys by building synthetic narrow-bands based on J-PLUS filters. The studied sample includes the cross-matched catalog of these IFU surveys with J-PLUS third data release (DR3), amounting to $2$ PHANGS-MUSE, $78$ CALIFA, and $78$ MaNGA galaxies at $z &lt; 0.0165$, respectively. We compared the H$\alpha$+[NII] radial profiles from J-PLUS and the IFU surveys, finding good agreement within the expected uncertainties. We also compared the SEDs from the emission line regions detected in J-PLUS images, reproducing the main spectral features present in the spectroscopic data. Finally, we compared the emission fluxes from the J-PLUS and IFU surveys accounting for scale differences, finding a difference of only 2% with a dispersion of 7% in the measurements. The J-PLUS data provides reliable spatially resolved H$\alpha$+[NII] emission maps for nearby galaxies. We provide the J-PLUS DR3 catalog for the $158$ galaxies with IFU data, including emission maps, SEDs of star-forming clumps, and radial profiles.</description>

      <title>Radial velocity homogeneous analysis of M dwarfs observed with HARPS I. Exoplanet detection and candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The census of planets around M dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood meets two challenges: detecting the best targets for the future characterisation of planets with ELTs, and studying the statistics of planet occurrence that are crucial to formation scenarios. The radial velocity (RV) method remains the most appropriate for such a census as it is sensitive to the widest ranges of masses and periods. HARPS, mounted on the 3.6 m telescope at La Silla Observatory (ESO, Chile), has been obtaining velocity measurements since 2003, and can therefore be used to analyse a very large and homogeneous dataset. We performed a homogeneous analysis of the RV time series of 200 M dwarfs observed with HARPS from 2003 to 2019 (gathering more than 15000 spectra), with the aim of understanding detectable signals such as stellar and planetary companions and activity signals. The RVs were computed with a template matching method before carrying out the time series analysis. First, we focused on the systematic analysis of the presence of a dominant long-term pattern in the RV time series (linear or quadratic trend and sine function). Then, we analysed higher-frequency perdiodic signals using periodograms of the residual time series and Keplerian function fitting. We found long-term variability in 57 RV time series (28.5%). This led to the revision of the parameters of the massive planet (GJ9482 b), as well as the detection of four substellar and stellar companions (around GJ3307, GJ4001, GJ4254, andGJ9588), for which we characterised inclinations and masses by combining RV and astrometry. The periodic analysis allowed us to recover 97% of the planetary systems already published in this sample, but also to propose three new planetary candidates orbiting GJ300 (7.3Me), GJ654(5Me), and GJ739 (39Me), which require additional measurements before they can be confirmed.</description>

Abstract: Measurements of radio signals induced by an astroparticle generating a cascade present a challenge because they are always superposed with an irreducible noise contribution. Quantifying these signals constitutes a non-trivial task, especially at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Because of the randomness of the noise phase, the measurements can be either a constructive or a destructive superposition of signal and noise. To recover the electromagnetic energy of the cascade from the radio measurements, the energy fluence, i.e. the time integral of the Poynting vector, has to be estimated. Conventionally, noise subtraction in the time domain has been employed for energy fluence reconstruction, yielding significant biases, including even non-physical and negative values. To mitigate the effect of this bias, usually an SNR threshold cut is imposed, at the expense of excluding valuable data from the analyses. Additionally, the uncertainties derived from the conventional method are underestimated, even for large SNR values. This work tackles these challenges by detailing a method to correctly estimate the uncertainties and lower the reconstruction bias in quantifying radio signals, thereby, ideally, eliminating the need for an SNR cut. The development of the method is based on a robust theoretical and statistical background, and the estimation of the fluence is performed in the frequency domain, allowing for the improvement of further analyses by providing access to frequency-dependent fluence estimation.</description>

      <title>Commissioning An All-Sky Infrared Camera Array for Detection Of Airborne Objects</title>

Abstract: To date there is little publicly available scientific data on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) whose properties and kinematics purportedly reside outside the performance envelope of known phenomena. To address this deficiency, the Galileo Project is designing, building, and commissioning a multi-modal ground-based observatory to continuously monitor the sky and conduct a rigorous long-term aerial census of all aerial phenomena, including natural and human-made. One of the key instruments is an all-sky infrared camera array using eight uncooled long-wave infrared FLIR Boson 640 cameras. Their calibration includes a novel extrinsic calibration method using airplane positions from Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. We establish a first baseline for the system performance over five months of field operation, using a real-world dataset derived from ADS-B data, synthetic 3-D trajectories, and a hand-labelled real-world dataset. We report acceptance rates (e.g. viewable airplanes that are recorded) and detection efficiencies (e.g. recorded airplanes which are successfully detected) for a variety of weather conditions, range and aircraft size. We reconstruct $\sim$500,000 trajectories of aerial objects from this commissioning period. A toy outlier search focused on large sinuosity of the 2-D reconstructed trajectories flags about 16% of trajectories as outliers. After manual review, 144 trajectories remain ambiguous: they are likely mundane objects but cannot be elucidated at this stage of development without distance and kinematics estimation or other sensor modalities. Our observed count of ambiguous outliers combined with systematic uncertainties yields an upper limit of 18,271 outliers count for the five-month interval at a 95% confidence level. This likelihood-based method to evaluate significance is applicable to all of our future outlier searches.</description>

      <title>The Elemental Abundances of Ryugu: Assessment of Chemical Heterogeneities and the Nugget Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hayabusa 2 spacecraft sampled ~5.4 g of asteroid material from the Cb-type asteroid Ryugu. Initial analysis of the Ryugu materials revealed a mineralogical, chemical, and isotopic kinship to the CI chondrites. In this study, we have summarized the elemental abundances of Ryugu samples published to date, and evaluated their compositional variability associated with the CI chondrite data. The abundances of some elements (e.g., P, Ca, Mn, and rare earth elements) in individual Ryugu particles were found to show large relative dispersions compared to the other elements, presumably due to the nugget effect of aqueously formed minor secondary minerals (e.g., dolomite, apatite, magnetite, and pyrrhotite). Consequently, the mean abundances of Ryugu for these elements, calculated using currently available Ryugu data, are accompanied by a certain degree of uncertainties. We suggest establishing a consortium to determine the representative elemental abundances of Ryugu by measuring aliquots from a large homogenized powder sample that can mitigate the nugget effect. Our statistical calculation shows that at least 750 and 400 mg of homogenized samples from Chambers A and C, respectively, are needed to achieve within +/-5% compositional heterogeneity. The data obtained throughout the consortium activity complement the scientific objectives of the Hayabusa2 mission. Moreover, we anticipate that the obtained Ryugu data, coupled with the elemental abundances of CI chondrites, provide new insights into the chemical composition of the Solar System, which will be used by multidisciplinary communities, including Earth and planetary sciences, astronomy, physics, and chemistry.</description>

      <title>Doppler correlation-driven vetoes for the Frequency Hough analysis in continuous gravitational-wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19420v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an improved method for vetoing candidates of continuous gravitational-wave sources during all-sky searches utilizing the Frequency Hough pipeline. This approach leverages linear correlations between source parameters induced by the Earth Doppler effect, which can be effectively identified through the Hough Transform. Candidates that do not align with these patterns are considered spurious and can thus be vetoed, enhancing the depth and statistical significance of follow-up analyses. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the method calibration, which intrinsically linked to the total duration of the observing run. On average, the procedure successfully vetoes $56\%$ of candidates. To assess the method performance, we conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation injecting fake continuous-wave signals into data from the third observing run of the LIGO detectors. This analysis allowed us to infer strain amplitude upper limits at a $90\%$ confidence level. We found that the optimal sensitivity is $h_0^{90\%} = 3.62^{+0.23}_{-0.22}\times 10^{-26}$ in the [128, 200] Hz band, which is within the most sensible frequency band of the LIGO detectors.</description>

      <title>Modeling of optical scattering from topographic surface measurements of high-quality mirrors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit computational methods to obtain an angular profile of optical scattering from a smooth surface, given a two-dimensional map of topographic height errors of the surface. Quick derivations of some traditional equations and relevant references are organized to shorten the search time. A practical data-processing flow of the methods is discussed. As a case study of this flow, the core mirrors of the KAGRA interferometer are examined, and we obtain a representative scattering profile that is easily applicable to ray-tracing simulations.</description>

      <title>Scalable Cosmic AI Inference using Cloud Serverless Computing with FMI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale astronomical image data processing and prediction is essential for astronomers, providing crucial insights into celestial objects, the universe's history, and its evolution. While modern deep learning models offer high predictive accuracy, they often demand substantial computational resources, making them resource-intensive and limiting accessibility. We introduce the Cloud-based Astronomy Inference (CAI) framework to address these challenges. This scalable solution integrates pre-trained foundation models with serverless cloud infrastructure through a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) Message Interface (FMI). CAI enables efficient and scalable inference on astronomical images without extensive hardware. Using a foundation model for redshift prediction as a case study, our extensive experiments cover user devices, HPC (High-Performance Computing) servers, and Cloud. CAI's significant scalability improvement on large data sizes provides an accessible and effective tool for the astronomy community. The code is accessible at https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/AI-for-Astronomy.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Multiple Channels Room Temperature Readout Electronics for Large Transition-Edge Sensor Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition-edge sensor (TES) is a highly sensitive device that is capable of detecting extremely low levels of energy. It is characterised by low noise performance and high energy resolution. A mature method for reading out TES signal is through time-division multiplexing (TDM) direct current superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). In a TDM system, the signal readout chain represents a significant source of noise other than the TES intrinsic noise. The noise generated by TES is in the range of several tens to several hundreds of $pA/\sqrt{Hz}$. In order to ensure the high energy resolution of TES, it is necessary to ensure that the noise contribution from the room temperature readout electronics is less than $10$ $pA/\sqrt{Hz}$ above 100 $Hz$. In this work, we have designed a low-noise, high-resolution room temperature readout circuit for TDM. The equivalent current noise contribution of ADC is about $0.05$ $pA/\sqrt{Hz}$ above 100 $Hz$ and $0.46$ $pA\sqrt{Hz}$ under 30:1 multiplexing. The resolution of the analog to digital converter (ADC) is larger than 11.5 bits, which can reconstruct the TES signal without distortion. The readout board, which has eight channels, has JESD204B serial ports, which has greatly simplified the space of room temperature electronics. The readout chain is based on multi-threaded CPU processing and can transfer data at 2 $Gbps$ for each channel in real time. This readout board can be used in a TDM system with smaller size for large TES arrays.</description>
