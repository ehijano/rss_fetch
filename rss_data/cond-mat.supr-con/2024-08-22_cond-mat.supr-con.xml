      <title>Neel proximity effect in superconductor/antiferromagnet heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the cornerstone of the proximity effect in superconductor/ferromagnet heterostructures is a generation of triplet Cooper pairs from singlet Cooper pairs inherent in a conventional superconductor. This proximity effect brought a lot of new exciting physics and gave a powerful impulse to development of superconducting spintronics. Nowadays a new direction of spintronics is actively developing, which is based on antiferromagnets and their heterostructures. It is called antiferromagnetic spintronics. By analogy with an important role played by triplet Cooper pairs in conventional superconducting spintronics based on ferromagnets the question arises: does the triplet proximity effect exist in superconductor/antiferromagnet heterostructures and, if so, what are the properties of the induced triplet correlations and the prospects for use in superconducting spintronics? Recent theoretical findings predict that despite the absence of a net magnetization, the Neel magnetic order of the antiferromagnet does give rise to specific spin-triplet correlations at superconductor/antiferromagnet interfaces. They were called Neel triplet correlations. The goal of this review is to discuss the current understanding of the fundamental physics of these Neel triplet correlations and their physical manifestations.</description>

      <title>New-record-Tc and three-gap 2D superconductors with electronic and phononic topology: KB2C2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pursuing higher-temperature superconductors under ambient pressure continues to be a prominent topic in materials discovery. Isomorphic structures like MgB2 exhibit potential for conventional BCS-type superconductivity, but their transition temperatures (Tc) have remained below 100 K based on both experimental findings and theoretical predictions. In this study, two new two-dimensional (2D) superconductors with sandwich structures,KB2C2,featuring BC layers in AA and AB stacking configurations,are designed, whose Tc can exceed 112 K,setting a new record in 2D superconductors. The analyses suggest that electrons in {\sigma}-states covalent bonds and high-frequency E phonon modes dominated by the in-plane vibrations of B/C atoms are predominately responsible for electron-phonon coupling (EPC). An exciting robust three-gap superconducting nature stems from the strong and evident three-region distribution characteristic of electronic EPC parameters {\lambda}. When biaxial tensile strain (BTS) is applied, their Tc are boosted above 153 K. The increase in Tc originates from the softening of optical E phonon modes around the {\Gamma} point and acoustic modes around the Q point, rather than an increase of electrons at the Fermi level (EF ) as observed in other similar systems. Thus, phonon plays a more beneficial role in the EPC of BTS cases, highlighting its significance as a medium in BCS superconductors. Moreover, we find KB2C2 exhibits interesting topological properties, spin antivortex, and Ising-type spin splitting. This is the first report of the coexistence of nontrivial topology and superconductivity with such a high Tc. Therefore, KB2C2 may offer promising sandwich structures to explore higher-Tc 2D superconductors, alongside present potential avenues for investigating fundamental quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Exploring van der Waals cuprate superconductors using a hybrid microwave circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of two-dimensional van der Waals materials is a frontier of condensed matter physics and quantum devices. However, characterizing such materials remains challenging due to the limitations of bulk material techniques, necessitating the development of specialized methods. In this study, we investigate the superconducting properties of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x flakes by integrating them with a hybrid superconducting microwave resonator. The hybrid resonator is significantly modified by the interaction with the flake while maintaining a high quality factor. We also observe a significant upshift of the resonator frequency with increasing temperature, as well as a positive nonlinearity. These effects originate from a presently unknown microscopic mechanism within the flake, and can be modeled as a two-level system bath interacting with resonant mode. Our findings open a path for high quality hybrid circuits with van der Waals flakes for exploring novel materials and developing new devices for quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Quantum highway: Observation of minimal and maximal speed limits for few and many-body states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tracking the time evolution of a quantum state allows one to verify the thermalization rate or the propagation speed of correlations in generic quantum systems. Inspired by the energy-time uncertainty principle, bounds have been demonstrated on the maximal speed at which a quantum state can change, resulting in immediate and practical tasks. Based on a programmable superconducting quantum processor, we test the dynamics of various emulated quantum mechanical systems encompassing single- and many-body states. We show that one can test the known quantum speed limits and that modifying a single Hamiltonian parameter allows the observation of the crossover of the different bounds on the dynamics. We also unveil the observation of minimal quantum speed limits in addition to more common maximal ones, i.e., the lowest rate of change of a unitarily evolved quantum state. Our results establish a comprehensive experimental characterization of quantum speed limits and pave the way for their subsequent study in engineered non-unitary conditions.</description>

      <title>Mapping Hydrogen Evolution Activity Trends of V-based A15 Superconducting Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring high-efficiency and low-cost electrocatalysts is valuable for water-splitting technologies. Recently, Si-group compounds have attracted increasing attention in electrocatalysis, considering the abundant Si-group elements on Earth. However, Si-group compounds for HER electrocatalysis have not been systematically studied. In this study, we unveil the activity trends of non-noble metal catalyst A15-type V3M (i.e., V3Si, V3Ge, and V3Sn) superconductors and show that V3Si is the most efficient HER catalyst because of the high electronic conductivity and suitable d-band center. Among them, the V3Si only requires 33.4 mV to reach 10 mA cm-2, and only 57.6 mV and 114.6 mV are required to attain a high current density of 100 mA cm-2 and 500 mA cm-2, respectively. These low overpotentials are close to the 34.3 mV at 10 mA cm-2 of state-of-art Pt/C (20 %) but superior to 168.5 mV of Pt/C (20 %) at 100 mA cm-2. Furthermore, the V3Si illustrates exceptional durability with no obvious decay in the 120 h at the different current densities (i.e., 10 - 250 mA cm-2). The excellent HER activity of V3Si alloy can be ascribed to the synergies of superior electronic conductivity and suitable d-band center. Moreover, DFT calculations reveal that the absolute hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy is decreased after introducing the V to Si. Beyond offering a stable and high-performance electrocatalyst in an acidic medium, this work inspires the rational design of desirable silicide electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>The Critical Metallization of Hydrogen in Pressurized LaBeH8 Hydride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Behaviours of hydrogen, such as fluidity and metallicity, are crucial for our understanding of planetary interiors and the emerging field of high-temperature superconducting hydrides. These behaviours were discovered in complex phase diagrams of hydrogen and hydrides, however, the transition mechanism of behaviours driven by temperature, pressure and chemical compression remain unclear, particularly in the processes of metallization. Until now, a comprehensive theoretical framework to quantify atomization and metallization of hydrogen in phase diagram of hydrides has been lacking. In this study, we address this gap by combining molecular dynamics and electronic structure analysis to propose a theoretical framework, which clarify the content and properties of atomic hydrogen under various temperature and pressure conditions and chemical compression exerted by non-hydrogen elements in hydrides. Applying this framework to the superconducting hydride LaBeH8, we identify three general hydrogen orderings within its phase diagram: molecular, sublattice and warm hydrogens. During the phase transition from molecule to sublattice, hydrogen exhibits different properties from three general hydrogen orderings, such as fast superionicity, metallicity and unusual atomic content response to temperature. These abnormal behaviours were defined as the critical metallization of hydrogen, which not only suggests a potential synthesis route for the metastable phase but also provides valuable insights into the complex synthetic products of superconducting hydrides.</description>

      <title>Electric field control of superconductivity and quantized anomalous Hall effects in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inducing superconducting correlations in chiral edge states is predicted to generate topologically protected zero energy modes with exotic quantum statistics. Experimental efforts to date have focused on engineering interfaces between superconducting materials, typically amorphous metals, and semiconducting quantum Hall or quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) systems. However, the strong interfacial disorder inherent can prevent the formation of isolated topological modes. An appealing alternative is to use low-density flat band materials where the ground state can be tuned between intrinsic superconducting and quantum anomalous Hall states using only the electric field effect. However, quantized transport and superconductivity have not been simultaneously achieved. Here, we show that rhombohedral tetralayer graphene aligned to a hexagonal boron nitride substrate hosts a quantized anomalous Hall state at superlattice filling $\nu = -1$ as well as a superconducting state at $\nu \approx -3.1$ at zero magnetic field. Remarkably, gate voltage can also be used to actuate nonvolatile switching of the chirality in the quantum anomalous Hall state, allowing arbitrarily reconfigurable networks of topological edge modes in locally gated devices. Thermodynamic compressibility measurements further reveal a topologically ordered fractional Chern insulator at $\nu = 2/3$, also stable at zero magnetic field, enabling proximity coupling between superconductivity and fractionally charged edge modes. Finally, we show that integrating an additional transition metal dichalcogenide layer to the heterostructure enhances the maximum superconducting critical temperature and nucleates new superconducting pockets, while leaving the topology of $\nu = -1$ the quantum anomalous Hall state intact. Our results pave the way for hybrid interfaces between superconductors and topological edge states in the low-disorder limit.</description>

Abstract: Superconductivity (SC) was experimentally observed for the first time in antimony polyhydride. The diamond anvil cell combined with laser heating system was used to synthesize the antimony polyhydride sample at high pressure and high temperature conditions. In-situ high pressure transport measurements as function of temperature with applied magnet are performed to study the SC properties. It was found that the antimony polyhydride samples show superconducting transition with critical temperature Tc 116 K at 184 GPa. The investigation of SC at magnetic field revealed that the superconducting coherent length ~40 angstroms based on Ginzburg Landau (GL) equation. Antimony polyhydride superconductor has the second highest Tc in addition to sulfur hydride among the polyhydrides of elements from main group IIIA to VIIA in periodic table.</description>

      <title>Two-component superconductivity and strange metallicity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: A Schwinger boson study of the $t$-$V$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has stimulated intensive investigations concerning its paring mechanism and effective low-energy theory. Here we apply the Schwinger boson approach to the bilayer $t$-$V$-$J$ model and obtain a global phase diagram with both metallic and superconducting ground states separated by a quantum phase transition. We predict a minimal interlayer superexchange $J$ and a minimal $d_{z^2}$-hole concentration necessary for the superconductivity, a right-triangle-like shape for the $T_c$ curve, and a maximum $T_c$ comparable with experiments. The normal state is featured with a pseudogap in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ spectra associated with preformed Cooper pairs and non-Fermi liquid strange metal behavior due to hybridization-induced spinon-holon-electron scattering. Our work clarifies the key difference of the two-component scenario from other pairing mechanisms, and provides a consistent understanding of the high-temperature superconductivity and strange metallic properties of La$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure.</description>

      <title>High-performance multiqubit system with double-transmon couplers: Toward scalable superconducting quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tunable couplers in superconducting quantum computers have enabled fast and accurate two-qubit gates, with reported high fidelities over 99% in various architectures and gate implementation schemes. However, there are few tunable couplers whose performance in multi-qubit systems is clarified, except for the most widely used one: single-transmon coupler (STC). Achieving similar accuracy to isolated two-qubit systems remains challenging due to various undesirable couplings but is necessary for scalability. In this work, we numerically analyze a system of three fixed-frequency qubits coupled via two double-transmon couplers (DTCs) where nearest-neighbor qubits are highly detuned and also next nearest-neighbor ones are nearly resonant. The DTC is a recently proposed tunable coupler, which consists of two fixed-frequency transmons coupled through a common loop with an additional Josephson junction. We find that the DTC can not only reduce undesired residual couplings sufficiently, as well as in isolated two-qubits systems, but also enables implementations of 30-ns CZ gates and individual and simultaneous 10-ns $\pi/2$ pulses with fidelities over 99.99%. For comparison, we also investigate the system where the DTCs are replaced by the STCs. The results show that the DTC outperforms the STC in terms of both residual coupling suppression and gate accuracy in the above systems. From these results, we expect that the DTC architecture is promising for realizing high-performance, scalable superconducting quantum computers.</description>
