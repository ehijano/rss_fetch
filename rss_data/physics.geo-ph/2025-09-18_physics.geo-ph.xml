      <title>Neural Earthquake Forecasting with Minimal Information: Limits, Interpretability, and the Role of Markov Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting earthquake sequences remains a central challenge in seismology, particularly under non-stationary conditions. While deep learning models have shown promise, their ability to generalize across time remains poorly understood. We evaluate neural and hybrid (NN plus Markov) models for short-term earthquake forecasting on a regional catalog using temporally stratified cross-validation. Models are trained on earlier portions of the catalog and evaluated on future unseen events, enabling realistic assessment of temporal generalization. We find that while these models outperform a purely Markovian model on validation data, their test performance degrades substantially in the most recent quintile. A detailed attribution analysis reveals a shift in feature relevance over time, with later data exhibiting simpler, more Markov-consistent behavior. To support interpretability, we apply Integrated Gradients, a type of explainable AI (XAI) to analyze how models rely on different input features. These results highlight the risks of overfitting to early patterns in seismicity and underscore the importance of temporally realistic benchmarks. We conclude that forecasting skill is inherently time-dependent and benefits from combining physical priors with data-driven methods.</description>

      <title>Inspired by machine learning optimization: can gradient-based optimizers solve cycle skipping in full waveform inversion given sufficient iterations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) iteratively updates the velocity model by minimizing the difference between observed and simulated data. Due to the high computational cost and memory requirements associated with global optimization algorithms, FWI is typically implemented using local optimization methods. However, when the initial velocity model is inaccurate and low-frequency seismic data (e.g., below 3 Hz) are absent, the mismatch between simulated and observed data may exceed half a cycle, a phenomenon known as cycle skipping. In such cases, local optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient-based local optimizers) tend to converge to local minima, leading to inaccurate inversion results. In machine learning, neural network training is also an optimization problem prone to local minima. It often employs gradient-based optimizers with a relatively large learning rate (beyond the theoretical limits of local optimization that are usually determined numerically by a line search), which allows the optimization to behave like a quasi-global optimizer. Consequently, after training for several thousand iterations, we can obtain a neural network model with strong generative capability. In this study, we also employ gradient-based optimizers with a relatively large learning rate for FWI. Results from both synthetic and field data experiments show that FWI may initially converge to a local minimum; however, with sufficient additional iterations, the inversion can gradually approach the global minimum, slowly from shallow subsurface to deep, ultimately yielding an accurate velocity model. Furthermore, numerical examples indicate that, given sufficient iterations, reasonable velocity inversion results can still be achieved even when low-frequency data below 5 Hz are missing.</description>

      <title>Agroseismology: unraveling the impact of farming practices on soil hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Farmed landscapes provide a natural laboratory to test how management reshapes near-surface hydrodynamics. Combining distributed acoustic sensing with physics-based hydromechanical modeling, we tracked minute-resolution, meter-scale changes across experimental fields with controlled tillage and compaction histories. We find that dynamic capillary effects, rate-dependent suction stresses during wetting and drying, govern transient stiffness and moisture redistribution in disturbed soils, producing sharp post-rain velocity drops from near-surface saturation and large hysteretic velocity rebounds driven by evapotranspiration. By pairing a seismic rainfall proxy with a drainage closure, we invert velocity changes to estimate evapotranspiration, revealing how disturbance alters flux partitioning and storage. These results establish agroseismology as a non-invasive, extendable tool to uncover soil hydromechanics, explain why conventional farming intensifies variability, and provide new constraints for Earth system models, land management, and hazard resilience.</description>
