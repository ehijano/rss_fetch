      <title>$\mathrm{U}(1)^{n}$ Chern-Simons theory: partition function, reciprocity formula and CS-duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\mathrm{U}(1)$ Chern-Simons theory can be extended to a topological $\mathrm{U}(1)^n$ theory by taking a combination of Chern-Simons and BF actions, the mixing being achieved with the help of a collection of integer coupling constants. Based on the Deligne-Beilinson cohomology, a partition function can then be computed for such a $\mathrm{U}(1)^n$ Chern-Simons theory. This partition function is clearly a topological invariant of the closed oriented $3$-manifold on which the theory is defined. Then, by applying a reciprocity formula a new expression of this invariant is obtained which should be a Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant. Finally, a duality between $\mathrm{U}(1)^n$ Chern-Simons theories is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>An Observer-Based View of Euclidean Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Influence network of events is a view of the universe based on events that may be related to one another via influence. The network of events form a partially-ordered set which, when quantified consistently via a technique called chain projection, results in the emergence of spacetime and the Minkowski metric as well as the Lorentz transformation through changing an observer from one frame to another. Interestingly, using this approach, the motion of a free electron as well as the Dirac equation can be described. Indeed, the same approach can be employed to show how a discrete version of some of the features of Euclidean geometry, including directions, dimensions, subspaces, Pythagorean theorem, and geometric shapes can emerge.
  In this paper, after reviewing the essentials of the influence network formalism, we build on some of our previous works to further develop aspects of Euclidean geometry. Specifically, we present the emergence of geometric shapes, a discrete version of the Parallel postulate, the dot product, and the outer (wedge product) in 2+1 dimensions. Finally, we show that the scalar quantification of two concatenated orthogonal intervals exhibits features that are similar to those of the well-known concept of geometric product in geometric Clifford algebras.</description>

      <title>A review of a work by Raymond: Sturmian Hamiltonians with a large coupling constant -- periodic approximations and gap labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a review of the work L. Raymond from 1995. The review aims at making this work more accessible and offers adaptations of some statements and proofs. In addition, this review forms an applicable framework for the complete solution of the Dry Ten Martini Problem for Sturmian Hamiltonians as appears in the work arXiv:2402.16703 by R. Band, S. Beckus and R. Loewy. A Sturmian Hamiltonian is a one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator whose potential is a Sturmian sequence multiplied by a coupling constant, $V\in\mathbb{R}$. The spectrum of such an operator is commonly approximated by the spectra of designated periodic operators. If $V&gt;4$, then the spectral bands of the periodic operators exhibit a particular combinatorial structure. This structure provides a formula for the integrated density of states. Employing this, it is shown that if $V&gt;4$, then all the gaps, as predicted by the gap labelling theorem, are there.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the divisor for the good Boussinesq equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a third order operator under the three-point Dirichlet condition. Its spectrum is the so-called auxiliary spectrum for the good Boussinesq equation, as well as the Dirichlet spectrum for the Schr\"odinger operator on the unit interval is the auxiliary spectrum for the periodic KdV equation. The auxiliary spectrum is formed by projections of the points of the divisor onto the spectral plane. We estimate the spectrum and the corresponding norming constants in terms of small operator coefficients. This work is the first in a series of papers devoted to solving the inverse problem for the Boussinesq equation.</description>

      <title>Geometric Formula for 2d Ising Zeros: Examples &amp; Numerics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A geometric formula for the zeros of the partition function of the inhomogeneous 2d Ising model was recently proposed in terms of the angles of 2d triangulations embedded in the flat 3d space. Here we proceed to an analytical check of this formula on the cubic graph, dual to a double pyramid, and provide a thorough numerical check by generating random 2d planar triangulations. Our method is to generate Delaunay triangulations of the 2-sphere then performing random local rescalings. For every 2d triangulations, we compute the corresponding Ising couplings from the triangle angles and the dihedral angles, and check directly that the Ising partition function vanishes for these couplings (and grows in modulus in their neighborhood). In particular, we lift an ambiguity of the original formula on the sign of the dihedral angles and establish a convention in terms of convexity/concavity. Finally, we extend our numerical analysis to 2d toroidal triangulations and show that the geometric formula does not work and will need to be generalized, as originally expected, in order to accommodate for non-trivial topologies.</description>

      <title>Deformations in spinor bundles: Lorentz violation and further physical implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into the deformation of spinor structures within nontrivial topologies and their physical implications. The deformation is modeled by introducing real functions that modify the standard spinor dynamics, leading to distinct physical regions characterized by varying degrees of Lorentz symmetry violation. It allows us to investigate the effects in the dynamical equation and a geometrized nonlinear sigma model. The findings suggest significant implications for the spinor fields in regions with nontrivial topologies, providing a robust mathematical approach to studying exotic spinor behavior.</description>

      <title>Principal binets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conjugate line parametrizations of surfaces were first discretized almost a century ago as quad meshes with planar faces. With the recent development of discrete differential geometry, two discretizations of principal curvature line parametrizations were discovered: circular nets and conical nets, both of which are special cases of discrete conjugate nets. Subsequently, circular and conical nets were given a unified description as isotropic line congruences in the Lie quadric. We propose a generalization by considering polar pairs of line congruences in the ambient space of the Lie quadric. These correspond to pairs of discrete conjugate nets with orthogonal edges, which we call principal binets, a new and more general discretization of principal curvature line parametrizations. We also introduce two new discretizations of orthogonal and Gauss-orthogonal parametrizations. All our discretizations are subject to the transformation group principle, which means that they satisfy the corresponding Lie, M\"obius, or Laguerre invariance respectively, in analogy to the smooth theory. Finally, we show that they satisfy the consistency principle, which means that our definitions generalize to higher dimensional square lattices. Our work expands on recent work by Dellinger on checkerboard patterns.</description>

      <title>Two transitions in complex eigenvalue statistics: Hermiticity and integrability breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems have complex energy eigenvalues which are expected to follow non-Hermitian random matrix statistics when chaotic, or 2-dimensional (2d) Poisson statistics when integrable. We investigate the spectral properties of a many-body quantum spin chain, the Hermitian XXZ Heisenberg model with imaginary disorder. Its rich complex eigenvalue statistics is found to separately break both Hermiticity and integrability at different scales of the disorder strength. With no disorder, the system is integrable and Hermitian, with spectral statistics corresponding to 1d Poisson. At very small disorder, we find a transition from 1d Poisson statistics to an effective $D$-dimensional Poisson point process, showing Hermiticity breaking. At intermediate disorder we find integrability breaking, and the statistics agrees with that of non-Hermitian complex symmetric random matrices in class AI$^\dag$. For large disorder, we recover the expected 2d Poisson statistics. Our analysis uses numerically generated nearest and next-to-nearest neighbour spacing distributions of an effective 2d Coulomb gas description at inverse temperature $\beta$, fitting them to the spin chain data. We confirm such an effective description of random matrices in class AI$^\dag$ and AII$^\dag$ up to next-to-nearest neighbour spacings.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Representation of a Weighted Random Vectorial Field: Potential Applications to Turbulence and the Problem of Anomalous Dissipation in the Inviscid Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let ${\mathfrak{G}}\subset\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with $vol(\mathfrak{G})\sim L^{3}$. Let ${\mathscr{T}}(x)$ be a Gaussian random field $\forall~x\in\mathfrak{G}$ with expectation $\mathbf{E}[{\mathscr{T}}(x)]=0$ and correlation $\mathbf{E}[{\mathscr{T}}(x)\otimes{\mathscr{T}}(y)]=K(x,y;\lambda)$, an isotropic and regulated kernel with correlation length $\lambda$. The field has a Karhunen-Loeve spectral representation ${\mathscr{T}}(x)=\sum_{I=1}^{\infty}\mathrm{Z}^{1/2}_{I}f_{I}(x)\otimes\mathscr{Z}_{I}$, with eigenvalues $\lbrace\mathrm{Z}_{I}\rbrace$, eigenfunctions $\lbrace f_{I}(x)\rbrace $ and Gaussian random variables $\mathscr{Z}_{I}$ with $\mathbf{E}[\mathscr{Z}_{I}]=0$ and $\mathbf{E}[\mathscr{Z}_{I}\otimes\mathscr{Z}_{J}]=\delta_{IJ}$. If $\mathfrak{G}$ contains incompressible fluid of viscosity $\nu$ with velocity $u_{a}(x,t)$ that evolves via the Navier-Stokes equations with a high 'Reynolds function' $\mathsf{RE}(x,t)=\tfrac{\|u_{a}(x,t)\|L}{\nu} $ then aspects of a turbulent flow with $\mathsf{RE}(x,t)\gg \mathsf{RE}_{*}$, a critical Reynolds number, might be represented by the 'weighted' random field $\mathscr{U}_{a}(x,t)= u_{a}(x,t)+\mathrm{A}u_{a}(x,t)\big(\mathsf{RE}(x,t)-\mathsf{RE}_{*}\big)^{\beta}\sum_{I=1}^{\infty} \mathrm{Z}^{1/2}_{I}f_{I}(x)\otimes\mathscr{Z}_{I}$ where random fluctuations and amplitude scale nonlinearly with $\mathsf{RE}(x,t)$, with mean $\mathbf{E}[{\mathscr{U}}_{a}(x,t)] =u_{a}(x,t)$. In the inviscid limit one can prove an anomalous dissipation-type law \begin{align} \lim_{\nu\rightarrow 0}\bigg(\lim_{u_{a}(x,t)\rightarrow {u}_{a}}\sup~\nu \int_{\mathfrak{G}}\int_{0}^{T}{\mathbf{E}}\bigg[\bigg|{\nabla}_{a}{\mathscr{U}}_{a}(x,s)\bigg|^{2}\bigg]d\mathcal{V}(x) ds\bigg)&gt;0 \end{align} iff $\beta=\tfrac{1}{2}$ and $\sum_{I=1}^{\infty}\mathrm{Z}_{I}\int_{{\mathfrak{G}}}{\nabla}_{a}f_{I}(x){\nabla}^{a}f_{I}(x)d\mathcal{V}(x)&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>The full electroweak interaction: an autonomous account</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise renormalizable interactions in the bosonic sector of electroweak theory are intrinsically determined in the autonomous approach to perturbation theory. This proceeds directly on the Hilbert-Fock space built on the Wigner unirreps of the physical particles, with their given masses: those of three massive vector bosons, a photon, and a massive scalar (the "higgs"). Neither "gauge choices" nor an unobservable "mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking" are invoked. Instead, to proceed on Hilbert space requires using string-localized fields to describe the vector bosons. In such a framework, the condition of string independence of the S-matrix yields consistency constraints on the coupling coefficients, the unique outcome being the experimentally known one. The analysis can be largely carried out for other configurations of massive and massless vector bosons, paving the way towards consideration of consistent mass patterns beyond those of the electroweak theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of composite mixtures consisting of $n$ constituents is framed within the schema provided by the notion of $n$-groupoid. The point of departure is the analysis of $n$-dimensional hypercubes and their skeletons, to each of whose edges an element (an arrow) of one of $n$ given material groupoids is assigned according to the coordinate class to which it belongs. In this way a $GL(3,{\mathbb R})$-weighted digraph is obtained. It is shown that if the double groupoid associated with each pair of constituents consists of commuting squares, the resulting $n$-groupoid is conservative. The core of this $n$-groupoid is transitive if, and only if, the mixture is materially uniform.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Liouvillians of squeeze-driven parametric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the symmetries of the Liouville superoperator of one dimensional parametric oscillators, especially the so-called squeeze-driven Kerr oscillator, and discover a remarkable quasi-spin symmetry $su(2)$ at integer values of the ratio $\eta =\omega /K$ of the detuning parameter $\omega$ to the Kerr coefficient $K$, which reflects the symmetry previously found for the Hamiltonian operator. We find that the Liouvillian of an $su(2)$ representation $\left\vert j,m_{j}\right\rangle$ has a characteristic double-ellipsoidal structure, and calculate the relaxation time $T_{X}$ for this structure. We then study the phase transitions of the Liouvillian which occur as a function of the parameters $\xi =\varepsilon _{2}/K$ and $\eta=\omega /K$. Finally, we study the temperature dependence of the spectrum of eigenvalues of the Liouvillian. Our findings may have applications in the generation and stabilization of states of interest in quantum computing.</description>

      <title>A gradient flow model for ground state calculations in Wigner formalism based on density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a gradient flow model is proposed for conducting ground state calculations in Wigner formalism of many-body system in the framework of density functional theory. More specifically, an energy functional for the ground state in Wigner formalism is proposed to provide a new perspective for ground state calculations of the Wigner function. Employing density functional theory, a gradient flow model is designed based on the energy functional to obtain the ground state Wigner function representing the whole many-body system. Subsequently, an efficient algorithm is developed using the operator splitting method and the Fourier spectral collocation method, whose numerical complexity of single iteration is $O(n_{\rm DoF}\log n_{\rm DoF})$. Numerical experiments demonstrate the anticipated accuracy, encompassing the one-dimensional system with up to $2^{21}$ particles and the three-dimensional system with defect, showcasing the potential of our approach to large-scale simulations and computations of systems with defect.</description>

Abstract: Fourier analysis on the discrete hypercubes $\{-1,1\}^n$ has found numerous applications in learning theory. A recent breakthrough involves the use of a classical result from Fourier analysis, the Bohnenblust--Hille inequality, in the context of learning low-degree Boolean functions. In these lecture notes, we explore this line of research and discuss recent progress in discrete quantum systems and classical Fourier analysis.</description>

Abstract: We perform an asymptotic evaluation of the Hankel transform, $\int_0^{\infty}J_{\nu}(\lambda x) f(x)\mathrm{d}x$, for arbitrarily large $\lambda$ of an entire exponential type function, $f(x)$, of type $\tau$ by shifting the contour of integration in the complex plane. Under the situation that $J_{\nu}(\lambda x)f(x)$ has an odd parity with respect to $x$ and the condition that the asymptotic parameter $\lambda$ is greater than the type $\tau$, we obtain an exactly terminating Poincar{\'e} expansion without any trailing subdominant exponential terms. That is the Hankel transform evaluates exactly into a polynomial in inverse $\lambda$ as $\lambda$ approaches infinity.</description>

      <title>Foundations on k-contact geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: k-Contact geometry appeared as a generalisation of contact geometry to analyse field theories. This work provides a new insightful approach to k-contact geometry by devising a theory of k-contact forms and proving that the kernel of a k-contact form is locally equivalent to a distribution of corank k that is distributionally maximally non-integrable and admits k commuting Lie symmetries: a so-called k-contact distribution. Compact manifolds admitting a global k-contact form are analysed, we give necessary topological conditions for their existence, k-contact Lie groups are defined and studied, we extend the Weinstein conjecture for the existence of closed orbits of Reeb vector fields in compact manifolds to the k-contact setting after studying compact low-dimensional manifolds endowed with a global k-contact form, and we provide some physical applications of some of our results. Polarisations for k-contact distributions are introduced and it is shown that a polarised k-contact distribution is locally diffeomorphic to the Cartan distribution of the first-order jet bundle over a fibre bundle of order k, which is a globally defined polarised k-contact distribution. Then, we relate k-contact manifolds to presymplectic and k-symplectic manifolds on fibre bundles of larger dimension and define for the first time types of submanifolds in k-contact geometry. We also review the theory of Hamiltonian k-vector fields, studying Hamilton-De Donder-Weyl equations in general and in Lie groups, which are here studied in an unprecedented manner. A theory of k-contact Hamiltonian vector fields is developed, which describes the theory of characteristics for Lie symmetries for first-order partial differential equations in a k-contact Hamiltonian manner. Our new Hamiltonian k-contact techniques are illustrated by analysing Hamilton-Jacobi and Dirac equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the explicit form of the basic monodromy operator for the quantum loop superalgebra $\mathrm{U}_q(\mathcal{L}(\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1}))$. Two significant additional results emerge from this derivation: simple expressions for the generating functions of the the images of the root vectors of $\mathrm{U}_q(\mathcal{L}(\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1}))$ under the Jimbo homomorphism and explicit expressions for certain central elements of the quantum superalgebra $\mathrm{U}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_{2|1})$. Furthermore, we establish the relationship between these central elements and those obtained by using the Drinfeld partial trace method.</description>

      <title>Flatbands in tight-binding lattices with anisotropic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider tight-binding models on Bravais lattices with anisotropic onsite potentials that vary along a given direction and are constant along the transverse one. Inspired by our previous work on flatbands in anti-$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric Hamiltonians [Phys. Rev. A 105, L021305 (2022)], we construct an anti-$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric Hamiltonians with an $E=0$ flatband by tuning the hoppings and the shapes of potentials. This construction is illustrated for the square lattice with bounded and unbounded potentials. Unlike flatbands in short-ranged translationally invariant Hamiltonians, we conjecture that the considered $E=0$ flatbands do not host compact localized states. Instead the flatband eigenstates exhibit a localization transition along the potential direction upon increasing the potential strength for bounded potentials. For unbounded potentials flatband eigenstates are always localized irrespective of the potential strength.</description>

      <title>Edge spectra of Gaussian random symmetric matrices with correlated entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the largest eigenvalue of a Gaussian random symmetric matrix $X_n$, with zero-mean, unit variance entries satisfying the condition $\sup_{(i, j) \ne (i', j')}|\mathbb{E}[X_{ij} X_{i'j'}]| = O(n^{-(1 + \varepsilon)})$, where $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. It follows from Catalano et al. (2024) that the empirical spectral distribution of $n^{-1/2} X_n$ converges weakly almost surely to the standard semi-circle law. Using a F\"{u}redi-Koml\'{o}s-type high moment analysis, we show that the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1(n^{-1/2} X_n)$ of $n^{-1/2} X_n$ converges almost surely to $2$. This result is essentially optimal in the sense that one cannot take $\varepsilon = 0$ and still obtain an almost sure limit of $2$. We also derive Gaussian fluctuation results for the largest eigenvalue in the case where the entries have a common non-zero mean. Let $Y_n = X_n + \frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{n}}\mathbf{1} \mathbf{1}^\top$. When $\varepsilon \ge 1$ and $\lambda \gg n^{1/4}$, we show that \[
  n^{1/2}\bigg(\lambda_1(n^{-1/2} Y_n) - \lambda - \frac{1}{\lambda}\bigg) \xrightarrow{d} \sqrt{2} Z, \] where $Z$ is a standard Gaussian. On the other hand, when $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1$, we have $\mathrm{Var}(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i, j}X_{ij}) = O(n^{1 - \varepsilon})$. Assuming that $\mathrm{Var}(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i, j} X_{ij}) = \sigma^2 n^{1 - \varepsilon} (1 + o(1))$, if $\lambda \gg n^{\varepsilon/4}$, then we have \[
  n^{\varepsilon/2}\bigg(\lambda_1(n^{-1/2} Y_n) - \lambda - \frac{1}{\lambda}\bigg) \xrightarrow{d} \sigma Z. \] While the ranges of $\lambda$ in these fluctuation results are certainly not optimal, a striking aspect is that different scalings are required in the two regimes $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1$ and $\varepsilon \ge 1$.</description>

      <title>Non-Universality from Conserved Superoperators in Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important result in the theory of quantum control is the "universality" of $2$-local unitary gates, i.e. the fact that any global unitary evolution of a system of $L$ qudits can be implemented by composition of $2$-local unitary gates. Surprisingly, recent results have shown that universality can break down in the presence of symmetries: in general, not all globally symmetric unitaries can be constructed using $k$-local symmetric unitary gates. This also restricts the dynamics that can be implemented by symmetric local Hamiltonians. In this paper, we show that obstructions to universality in such settings can in general be understood in terms of superoperator symmetries associated with unitary evolution by restricted sets of gates. These superoperator symmetries lead to block decompositions of the operator Hilbert space, which dictate the connectivity of operator space, and hence the structure of the dynamical Lie algebra. We demonstrate this explicitly in several examples by systematically deriving the superoperator symmetries from the gate structure using the framework of commutant algebras, which has been used to systematically derive symmetries in other quantum many-body systems. We clearly delineate two different types of non-universality, which stem from different structures of the superoperator symmetries, and discuss its signatures in physical observables. In all, our work establishes a comprehensive framework to explore the universality of unitary circuits and derive physical consequences of its absence.</description>

Abstract: In a 1979 paper, Ventevogel and Nijboer showed that classical point particles interacting via the pair potential $\phi(x)=\left(1+x^4\right)^{-1}$ are not equally spaced in their ground states in one dimension when the particle density is high, in contrast with many other potentials such as inverse power laws or Gaussians. In this paper, we explore a broad class of potentials for which this property holds; we prove that under the potentials $f_\alpha(x)=\left(1+x^\alpha\right)^{-1}$, when $\alpha&gt;2$ is an even integer, there is a corresponding $s_\alpha&gt;0$ such that under density $\rho={n}/{s_\alpha}$, the configuration that places $n$ particles at each point of $s_\alpha\mathbb{Z}$ minimises the average potential energy per particle and is therefore the exact ground state. In other words, the particles form clusters, while the clusters do not approach each other as the density increases; instead they maintain a fixed spacing. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first rigorous analysis of such a ground state for a naturally occurring class of potential functions.</description>

Abstract: The quiver Yangians were originally defined for the quiver and superpotential from string theory on general toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, and serve as BPS algebras of these systems. Their characters reproduce the unrefined BPS indices, which correspond to classical Donaldson-Thomas (DT) invariants. We generalize this construction in two directions. First, we show that this definition extends to arbitrary quivers with potentials. Second, we explain how to define the characters to incorporate the refined BPS indices, which correspond to motivic DT invariants. We focus on two main classes of quivers: the BPS quivers of 4D $N=2$ theories and the quivers from the knot-quiver correspondence. The entire construction allows for straightforward generalizations to trigonometric, elliptic, and generalized cohomologies.</description>

      <title>A particle-in-Fourier method with semi-discrete energy conservation for non-periodic boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel particle-in-Fourier (PIF) scheme that extends its applicability to non-periodic boundary conditions. Our method handles free space boundary conditions by replacing the Fourier Laplacian operator in PIF with a mollified Green's function as first introduced by Vico-Greengard-Ferrando. This modification yields highly accurate free space solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson system, while still maintaining energy conservation up to an error bounded by the time step size. We also explain how to extend our scheme to arbitrary Dirichlet boundary conditions via standard potential theory, which we illustrate in detail for Dirichlet boundary conditions on a circular boundary. We support our approach with proof-of-concept numerical results from two-dimensional plasma test cases to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and conservation properties of the scheme. By avoiding grid heating and finite grid instability we are able to show an order of magnitude speedup compared to the standard PIC scheme for a long time integration cyclotron simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit and extend the Durdevic theory of complete calculi on quantum principal bundles. In this setting one naturally obtains a graded Hopf-Galois extension of the higher order calculus and an intrinsic decomposition of degree 1-forms into horizontal and vertical forms. This proposal is appealing, since it is consistently equipped with a canonical braiding and exactness of the Atiyah sequence is guaranteed. Moreover, we provide examples of complete calculi, including the noncommutative 2-torus, the quantum Hopf fibration and differential calculi on crossed product algebras.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly construct zero loss neural network classifiers. We write the weight matrices and bias vectors in terms of cumulative parameters, which determine truncation maps acting recursively on input space. The configurations for the training data considered are (i) sufficiently small, well separated clusters corresponding to each class, and (ii) equivalence classes which are sequentially linearly separable. In the best case, for $Q$ classes of data in $\mathbb{R}^M$, global minimizers can be described with $Q(M+2)$ parameters.</description>

Abstract: We formulate scalar field theories in a curved braided $L_\infty$-algebra formalism and analyse their correlation functions using Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization. We perform detailed calculations in cubic braided scalar field theory up to two-loop order and three-point multiplicity. The divergent tadpole contributions are eliminated by a suitable choice of central curvature for the $L_\infty$-structure, and we confirm the absence of UV/IR mixing. The calculations of higher loop and higher multiplicity correlators in homological perturbation theory are facilitated by the introduction of a novel diagrammatic calculus. We derive an algebraic version of the Schwinger-Dyson equations based on the homological perturbation lemma, and use them to prove the braided Wick theorem.</description>

      <title>Field Theory of Active Brownian Particles with Dry Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a field theoretic approach to capture the motion of a particle with dry friction for one- and two-dimensional diffusive particles, and further expand the framework for two-dimensional active Brownian particles. Starting with the Fokker-Planck equation and introducing the Hermite polynomials as the corresponding eigen-functions, we obtain the actions and propagators. Using a perturbation expansion, we calculate the effective diffusion coefficient in the presence of both wet and dry frictions in a perturbative way via the Green-Kubo relation. We further compare the analytical result with the numerical simulation. Our result can be used to estimate the values of dry friction coefficient in experiments.</description>

      <title>Diffusive hydrodynamics from long-range correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the hydrodynamic theory, the non-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body system is approximated, at large scales of space and time, by irreversible relaxation to local entropy maximisation. This results in a convective equation corrected by viscous or diffusive terms in a gradient expansion, such as the Navier-Stokes equations. Diffusive terms are evaluated using the Kubo formula, and possibly arising from an emergent noise due to discarded microscopic degrees of freedom. In one dimension of space, diffusive scaling is often broken as noise leads to super-diffusion. But in linearly degenerate hydrodynamics, such as that of integrable models, diffusive behaviors are observed, and it has long be thought that the standard diffusive picture remains valid. In this letter, we show that in such systems, the Navier-Stokes equation breaks down beyond linear response. We demonstrate that diffusive-order corrections do not take the form of a gradient expansion. Instead, they are completely determined by ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations, and obtained from the non-local two-point correlations recently predicted by the ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory (BMFT); the resulting hydrodynamic equations are reversible. To do so, we establish a regularised fluctuation theory, putting on a firm basis the recent idea that ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations determines fluctuations and correlations beyond the Euler scale. This extends the idea of ``diffusion from convection'' previously developed to explain the Kubo formula in integrable systems, to generic non-equilibrium settings.</description>

      <title>Phase transition for the bottom singular vector of rectangular random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the rectangular random matrix $X=(x_{ij})\in \mathbb{R}^{N\times n}$ whose entries are iid with tail $\mathbb{P}(|x_{ij}|&gt;t)\sim t^{-\alpha}$ for some $\alpha&gt;0$. We consider the regime $N(n)/n\to \mathsf{a}&gt;1$ as $n$ tends to infinity. Our main interest lies in the right singular vector corresponding to the smallest singular value, which we will refer to as the "bottom singular vector", denoted by $\mathfrak{u}$. In this paper, we prove the following phase transition regarding the localization length of $\mathfrak{u}$: when $\alpha&lt;2$ the localization length is $O(n/\log n)$; when $\alpha&gt;2$ the localization length is of order $n$. Similar results hold for all right singular vectors around the smallest singular value. The variational definition of the bottom singular vector suggests that the mechanism for this localization-delocalization transition when $\alpha$ goes across $2$ is intrinsically different from the one for the top singular vector when $\alpha$ goes across $4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a family of integrable deformations of $\mathbb{Z}_N$-coset models in two dimensions. Our approach uses and generalises the method of auxiliary fields that was recently introduced for the principal chiral model by Ferko and Smith.</description>

      <title>A Second Moment Method for k-Eigenvalue Acceleration with Continuous Diffusion and Discontinuous Transport Discretizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The second moment method is a linear acceleration technique which couples the transport equation to a diffusion equation with transport-dependent additive closures. The resulting low-order diffusion equation can be discretized independent of the transport discretization, unlike diffusion synthetic acceleration, and is symmetric positive definite, unlike quasi-diffusion. While this method has been shown to be comparable to quasi-diffusion in iterative performance for fixed source and time-dependent problems, it is largely unexplored as an eigenvalue problem acceleration scheme due to thought that the resulting inhomogeneous source makes the problem ill-posed. Recently, a preliminary feasibility study was performed on the second moment method for eigenvalue problems. The results suggested comparable performance to quasi-diffusion and more robust performance than diffusion synthetic acceleration. This work extends the initial study to more realistic reactor problems using state-of-the-art discretization techniques. Results in this paper show that the second moment method is more computationally efficient than its alternatives on complex reactor problems with unstructured meshes.</description>
