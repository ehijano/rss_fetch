      <title>Interference Mitigation using U-Net Autoencoder based system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a U-Net-based autoencoder framework for mitigating interference in communication signals corrupted by noise and diverse interference sources. The approach targets scenarios involving both signal-plus-noise and signal-plus-interference-plus-noise mixtures, including sinusoidal interferers, LFM chirps, QPSK interferers with different sampling rates, and modulated interference such as QAM. The U-Net architecture leverages multiscale feature extraction and skip connections to preserve fine-grained temporal structure while suppressing interference components. Performance is evaluated using bit error rate and compared against conventional cancellation methods. Results show that the proposed method consistently outperforms traditional techniques in low- and mid-SIR regimes, while remaining competitive at high SIRs. Additional experiments examine the autoencoder's behavior under model mismatch conditions such as carrier offset and colored noise. The study demonstrates that multiscale neural architectures provide a flexible and effective platform for interference mitigation across a wide range of interference types.</description>

      <title>Pipeline Stage Resolved Timing Characterization of FPGA and ASIC Implementations of a RISC V Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline stage resolved timing characterization of a 32-bit RISC V processor implemented on a 20 nm FPGA and a 7 nm FinFET ASIC platform. A unified analysis framework is introduced that decomposes timing paths into logic, routing, and clocking components and maps them to well-defined pipeline stage transitions. This approach enables systematic comparison of timing behavior across heterogeneous implementation technologies at a microarchitectural level. Using static timing analysis and statistical characterization, the study shows that although both implementations exhibit dominant critical paths in the EX to MEM pipeline transition, their underlying timing mechanisms differ fundamentally. FPGA timing is dominated by routing parasitics and placement dependent variability, resulting in wide slack distributions and sensitivity to routing topology. In contrast, ASIC timing is governed primarily by combinational logic depth and predictable parametric variation across process, voltage, and temperature corners, yielding narrow and stable timing distributions. The results provide quantitative insight into the structural origins of timing divergence between programmable and custom fabrics and demonstrate the effectiveness of pipeline stage resolved analysis for identifying platform specific bottlenecks. Based on these findings, the paper derives design implications for achieving predictable timing closure in processor architectures targeting both FPGA and ASIC implementations.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous and Proportional Finger Motion Decoding Using Spatial Features from High-Density Surface Electromyography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Restoring natural and intuitive hand function requires simultaneous and proportional control (SPC) of multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs). This study systematically evaluated the multichannel linear descriptors-based block field method (MLD-BFM) for continuous decoding of five finger-joint DoFs by leveraging the rich spatial information of high-density surface electromyography (HD sEMG). Twenty-one healthy participants performed dynamic sinusoidal finger movements while HD sEMG signals were recorded from the \textit{extensor digitorum communis} (EDC) and \textit{flexor digitorum superficialis} (FDS) muscles. MLD-BFM extracted region-specific spatial features, including effective field strength ($\Sigma$), field-strength variation rate ($\Phi$), and spatial complexity ($\Omega$). Model performance was optimized (block size: $2 \times 2$; window: 0.15 s) and compared with conventional time-domain features and dimensionality reduction approaches when applied to multi-output regression models. MLD-BFM consistently achieved the highest $\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}}$ values across all models. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) combined with MLD-BFM yielded the best performance ($\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}} = 86.68\% \pm 0.33$). Time-domain features also showed strong predictive capability and were statistically comparable to MLD-BFM in some models, whereas dimensionality reduction techniques exhibited lower accuracy. Decoding accuracy was higher for the middle and ring fingers than for the thumb. Overall, MLD-BFM improved continuous finger movement decoding accuracy, underscoring the importance of taking advantage of the spatial richness of HD sEMG. These findings suggest that spatially structured features enhance SPC and provide practical guidance for designing robust, real-time, and responsive myoelectric interfaces.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Localization with Fluid Antenna Systems: A Fisher Information Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the fundamental limits of localization in fluid antenna systems (FAS) utilizing a Fisher-information-theoretic framework. We develop a unified model to quantify the localization information extractable from time-of-arrival (ToA) and angle-of-arrival (AoA) measurements, explicitly capturing the synthetic aperture effects induced by FAS. Closed-form expressions are derived for the equivalent Fisher information matrix (EFIM) and the corresponding positioning error bound (PEB) in both user-side and base-station (BS)-side FAS configurations. Also, we propose optimal port-selection strategies based on greedy algorithms and convex relaxation to maximize the information gain under a constrained number of activated ports. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed port-selection schemes can substantially tighten the PEB compared with random activation, thereby confirming the strong potential of FAS to enable high-precision localization. These results offer analytical insights and practical design guidelines for FAS-aided positioning in future-generation wireless networks</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robust Access in Cognitive IoT Networks under Smart Jamming Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of dynamic spectrum access in a cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) network where a secondary user (SU) operates under both energy constraints and adversarial interference from a smart jammer. The SU coexists with primary users (PUs) and must ensure that its transmissions do not exceed a predefined interference threshold on licensed channels. At each time slot, the SU must jointly determine whether to transmit or harvest energy, which channel to access, and the appropriate transmit power while satisfying energy and interference constraints. Meanwhile, a smart jammer actively selects a channel to disrupt, aiming to degrade the SU's communication performance. This setting presents a significant challenge due to its multi-level decision structure and hybrid action space, which combines both discrete and continuous decisions. To tackle this, we propose a novel Hierarchical Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (H-DDPG) framework that decomposes the decision-making process into three levels: the high-level policy determines the mode (transmit or harvest), the mid-level policy selects the channel, and the low-level actor outputs a continuous power level. Concurrently, the jammer is modeled as a reinforcement learning agent that learns an adaptive channel jamming strategy using a discrete variant of DDPG. Simulation results show that our H-DDPG approach outperforms conventional flat reinforcement learning baselines.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Caching Towards Efficient Spectrum Utilization in Cognitive-IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) networks, efficient spectrum sharing is essential to address increasing wireless demands. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for joint cooperative caching and spectrum access coordination in CIoT networks, enabling the CIoT agents to collaborate with primary users (PUs) by caching PU content and serving their requests, fostering mutual benefits. The proposed DRL framework jointly optimizes caching policy and spectrum access under challenging conditions. Unlike traditional cognitive radio (CR) methods, where CIoT agents vacate the spectrum for PUs, or relaying techniques, which merely support spectrum sharing, caching brings data closer to the edge, reducing latency by minimizing retrieval distance. Simulations demonstrate that our approach outperforms others in lowering latency, increasing CIoT and PU cache hit rates, and enhancing network throughput. This approach redefines spectrum sharing, offering a fresh perspective on CIoT network design and illustrating the potential of DRL-guided caching to highlight the benefits of collaboration over dynamic spectrum access scenarios, elevating CIoT performance under constrained resources.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Rotatable IRSs for Wireless Communications: Joint Beamforming and Orientation Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotatable intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) introduce a new degree of freedom (DoF) for shaping wireless propagation by adaptively adjusting the orientation of IRSs. This paper considers an angle-dependent reflection model in a wireless communication system aided by two rotatable IRSs. Specifically, we study the joint design of the base station transmit beamforming, as well as the cooperative passive beamforming and orientation of the two IRSs, to maximize the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Under the light-of-sight (LoS) channels, we first develop a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based method to determine the IRS rotation and derive an optimal rotation in a closed-form expression for a two-dimensional IRS deployment. Then, we extend the design to the general Rician fading channels by proposing an efficient alternating optimization and PSO (AO-PSO) algorithm. Numerical results validate the substantial gains achieved by the IRS rotation over fixed-IRS schemes and also demonstrate the superior performance of the double rotatable IRSs over a single rotatable IRS given a sufficient total number of IRS elements.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Iterative Detection for OTFS: Interplay between Local L-MMSE and Global Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a robust solution for high-mobility wireless communications. However, conventional detection algorithms, such as linear equalizers and message passing (MP) methods, either suffer from noise enhancement or fail under complex doubly-selective channels, especially in the presence of fractional delay and Doppler shifts. In this paper, we propose a hybrid low-complexity iterative detection framework that combines linear minimum mean square error (L-MMSE) estimation with MP-based probabilistic inference. The key idea is to apply a new delay-Doppler (DD) commutation precoder (DDCP) to the DD domain signal vector, such that the resulting effective channel matrix exhibits a structured form with several locally dense blocks that are sparsely inter-connected. This precoding structure enables a hybrid iterative detection strategy, where a low-dimensional L-MMSE estimation is applied to the dense blocks, while MP is utilized to exploit the sparse inter-block connections. Furthermore, we provide a detailed complexity analysis, which shows that the proposed scheme incurs lower computational cost compared to the full-size L-MMSE detection. The simulation results of convergence performance confirm that the proposed hybrid MP detection achieves fast and reliable convergence with controlled complexity. In terms of error performance, simulation results demonstrate that our scheme achieves significantly better bit error rate (BER) under various channel conditions. Particularly in multipath scenarios, the BER performance of the proposed method closely approaches the matched filter bound (MFB), indicating its near-optimal error performance.</description>

      <title>Antenna Coding Optimization Based on Pixel Antennas for MIMO Wireless Power Transfer with DC Combining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates antenna coding based on pixel antennas as a new degree of freedom for enhancing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. Antenna coding is closely related to the Fluid Antenna System (FAS) concept and further generalizes the radiation pattern reconfigurability. We first introduce a beamspace channel model to demonstrate reconfigurable radiation patterns enabled by antenna coders. By jointly optimizing the antenna coding and transmit beamforming with perfect channel state information (CSI), we exploit gains from antenna coding, transmit beamforming, and rectenna nonlinearity to maximize the output DC power. We adopt an alternating optimization approach with the quasi-Newton method and Successive Exhaustive Boolean Optimization (SEBO) method with warm-start to handle the transmit beamforming design and antenna coding design respectively. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed MIMO WPT system with pixel antennas achieves up to 15 dB gain in average output DC power compared with a conventional system with fixed antenna configuration, highlighting the potential of pixel antennas for boosting the WPT efficiency.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Gaussian-Windowed Wavelets for Damping Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modal analysis, the prevalent use of Gaussian-based wavelets (such as Morlet and Gabor) for damping estimation is rarely questioned. In this study, we challenge this conventional approach by systematically exploring envelope-based damping estimators and proposing a data-driven framework that optimizes the shape and parameters of the envelope utilizing synthetic impulse responses with known ground-truth envelopes. The performance of the resulting estimators is benchmarked across a range of scenarios and compared against frequency-domain damping estimation methods, including Least Squares Rational Function (LSRF), poly-reference Least Squares Complex Frequency-Domain (pLSCF), peak picking (PP), and the Yoshida method. Our findings indicate that Triangle and Welch windows consistently outperform or are on par with Gaussian wavelet methods in contexts of moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). In contrast, Blackman filtering demonstrates superior robustness under low SNR conditions and scenarios involving closely spaced modes. Among the frequency-domain methods assessed, LSRF shows the most reliability at very low SNR; however, the non-Gaussian optimized envelope estimators perform exceptionally well as the SNR improves.</description>

      <title>Graph Signal Denoising Using Regularization by Denoising and Its Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an interpretable denoising method for graph signals using regularization by denoising (RED). RED is a technique developed for image restoration that uses an efficient (and sometimes black-box) denoiser in the regularization term of the optimization problem. By using RED, optimization problems can be designed with the explicit use of the denoiser, and the gradient of the regularization term can be easily computed under mild conditions. We adapt RED for denoising of graph signals beyond image processing. We show that many graph signal denoisers, including graph neural networks, theoretically or practically satisfy the conditions for RED. We also study the effectiveness of RED from a graph filter perspective. Furthermore, we propose supervised and unsupervised parameter estimation methods based on deep algorithm unrolling. These methods aim to enhance the algorithm applicability, particularly in the unsupervised setting. Denoising experiments for synthetic and real-world datasets show that our proposed method improves signal denoising accuracy in mean squared error compared to existing graph signal denoising methods.</description>

      <title>Robust Design for Multi-Antenna LEO Satellite Communications with Fractional Delay and Doppler Shifts: An RSMA-OTFS Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems face challenges due to high satellite mobility, which hinders the reliable acquisition of instantaneous channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) and subsequently degrades multi-user transmission performance. This paper investigates a downlink multi-user multi-antenna system, and tackles the above challenges by introducing orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) transmission. Specifically, OTFS enables stable characterization of time-varying channels by representing them in the delay-Doppler domain. However, realistic propagation introduces various inter-symbol and inter-user interference due to non-orthogonal yet practical rectangular pulse shaping, fractional delays, Doppler shifts, and imperfect (statistical) CSIT. In this context, RSMA offers promising robustness for interference mitigation and CSIT imperfections, and hence is integrated with OTFS to provide a comprehensive solution. A compact cross-domain input-output relationship for RSMA-OTFS is established, and an ergodic sum-rate maximization problem is formulated and solved using a weighted minimum mean-square-error based alternating optimization algorithm that does not depend on channel sparsity. Simulation results reveal that the considered practical propagation effects significantly degrade performance if unaddressed. Furthermore, the RSMA-OTFS scheme demonstrates improved ergodic sum-rate and robustness against CSIT uncertainty across various user deployments and CSIT qualities.</description>

      <title>User Localization and Channel Estimation for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel user localization and channel estimation framework for pinching-antenna systems (PASS), where pinching antennas are grouped into subarrays on each waveguide to cooperatively estimate user/scatterer locations, thus reconstructing channels. Both single-waveguide (SW) and multi-waveguide (MW) structures are considered. SW consists of multiple alternatingly activated subarrays, while MW deploys one subarray on each waveguide to enable concurrent subarray measurements. For the 2D scenarios with a fixed user/scatter height, an orthogonal matching pursuit-based geometry-consistent localization (OMP-GCL) algorithm is proposed, which leverages inter-subarray geometric relationships and compressed sensing for precise estimation. Theoretical analysis on Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) demonstrates that: 1) The estimation accuracy can be improved by increasing the geometric diversity through multi-subarray deployment; and 2) SW provides a limited geometric diversity within a $180^\circ$ half space and leads to angle ambiguity, while MW enables full-space observations and reduces overheads. The OMP-GCL algorithm is further extended to 3D scenarios, where user and scatter heights are also estimated. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis, and verify that MW achieves centimeter- and decimeter-level localization accuracy in 2D and 3D scenarios with only three waveguides.</description>

      <title>Sparse OFDM Design for Interference and Ambiguity Mitigation in Multi-Static ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks promises the integration of radar-like sensing capabilities into communication infrastructure. In this paper, we investigate a multi-static sensing framework where half-duplex base stations (BSs) are assigned as either transmitter or sensing receiver nodes. We propose a randomized sparse resource allocation scheme based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform design tailored for the multi-static scenario to simultaneously mitigate inter-BS interference (IBI) and sensing ambiguities. The waveform design also ensures robustness against inter-symbol interference (ISI) and intercarrier interference (ICI) via a judicious choice of subcarrier spacing according to the deployment of BSs. The potential ambiguity caused by sparse signaling is addressed through controlled irregularity in both time and frequency domains, with a negligible noise floor elevation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and resilience of the proposed design in the presence of multiple targets and clutter.</description>

      <title>Pragmatic Earth-Fixed Beam Management for 3GPP NTN Common Signaling in LEO Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a pragmatic method for the design of beam footprint layouts and beam hopping illumination patterns to efficiently broadcast 3GPP NTN common signaling to large coverage areas using EIRP-limited LEO satellites. This method minimizes the time resources required to sweep over the whole coverage while ensuring that the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio received by users is above a given threshold. It discusses the design of: (i) an Earth-fixed grid of beam layouts; (ii) beamforming vectors and beam power allocation; (iii) beam hopping patterns and (iv) space, time and frequency resource allocation of 3GPP common signaling. Two main beam layout solutions are proposed to significantly reduce the number of beams required to illuminate the coverage area: one based on phased array beams with low beam crossover levels and the other on widened beams. A numerical evaluation using practical system parameters showed that both solutions perform similarly, but that the best result is obtained with phased arrays beams with optimized beam cross over levels. Indeed, for the system evaluated, they allowed reducing the total number of beams from 1723 to 451, which combined with a proper beam hopping pattern and scheduling scheme allowed obtaining a coverage ratio of 100% and a common signaling efficiency (i.e. number of slots carrying common signaling over total number of slots) up to 80.6% for the most stringent common signaling periodicity of 20 ms considered by 3GPP.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Signal Coverage Enhancement in Hall Scenarios Based on Single-Hop and Dual-Hop Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication offers ultra-high data rates and has emerged as a promising technology for future wireless networks. However, the inherently high free-space path loss of THz waves significantly limits the coverage range of THz communication systems. Therefore, extending the effective coverage area is a key challenge for the practical deployment of THz networks. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), which can dynamically manipulate electromagnetic wave propagation, provide a solution to enhance THz coverage. To investigate multi-RIS deployment scenarios, this work integrates an antenna array-based RIS model into the ray-tracing simulation platform. Using an indoor hall as a representative case study, the enhancement effects of single-hop and dual-hop RIS configurations on indoor signal coverage are evaluated under various deployment schemes. The developed framework offers valuable insights and design references for optimizing RIS-assisted indoor THz communication and coverage estimation.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Kalman Filter for Elliptical Extended Object Tracking based on Decoupling State Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended object tracking involves estimating both the physical extent and kinematic parameters of a target object, where typically multiple measurements are observed per time step. In this article, we propose a deterministic closed-form elliptical extended object tracker, based on decoupling of the kinematics, orientation, and axis lengths. By disregarding potential correlations between these state components, fewer approximations are required for the individual estimators than for an overall joint solution. The resulting algorithm outperforms existing algorithms, reaching the accuracy of sampling-based procedures. Additionally, a batch-based variant is introduced, yielding highly efficient computation while outperforming all comparable state-of-the-art algorithms. This is validated both by a simulation study using common models from literature, as well as an extensive quantitative evaluation on real automotive radar data.</description>

      <title>Chirp Delay-Doppler Domain Modulation Based Joint Communication and Radar for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a sensing-centric joint communication and millimeter-wave radar paradigm to facilitate collaboration among intelligent vehicles.
  We first propose a chirp waveform-based delay-Doppler quadrature amplitude modulation (DD-QAM) that modulates data across delay, Doppler, and amplitude dimensions.
  Building upon this modulation scheme, we derive its achievable rate to quantify the communication performance.
  We then introduce an extended Kalman filter-based scheme for four-dimensional (4D) parameter estimation in dynamic environments, enabling the active vehicles to accurately estimate orientation and tangential-velocity beyond traditional 4D radar systems.
  Furthermore, in terms of communication, we propose a dual-compensation-based demodulation and tracking scheme that allows the passive vehicles to effectively demodulate data without compromising their sensing functions.
  Simulation results underscore the feasibility and superior performance of our proposed methods, marking a significant advancement in the field of autonomous vehicles.

      <title>Relaying Signal When Monitoring Traffic: Double Use of Aerial Vehicles Towards Intelligent Low-Altitude Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In intelligent low-altitude networks, integrating monitoring tasks into communication unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can consume resources and increase handoff latency for communication links. To address this challenge, we propose a strategy that enables a "double use" of UAVs, unifying the monitoring and relay handoff functions into a single, efficient process. Our scheme, guided by an integrated sensing and communication framework, coordinates these multi-role UAVs through a proactive handoff network that fuses multi-view sensory data from aerial and ground vehicles. A lightweight vehicle inspection module and a two-stage training procedure are developed to ensure monitoring accuracy and collaborative efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this integrated approach: it reduces communication outage probability by nearly 10% at a 200 Mbps requirement without compromising monitoring performance and maintains high resilience (86% achievable rate) even in the absence of multiple UAVs, outperforming traditional ground-based handoff schemes. Our code is available at the https://github.com/Jiahui-L/UAP.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Cognitive IoT with Cooperative Caching and SWIPT-EH: A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm for hybrid underlay-overlay cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) networks with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-energy harvesting (EH) and cooperative caching. Unlike prior hierarchical DRL approaches that focus primarily on spectrum access or power control, our work jointly optimizes EH, hybrid access coordination, power allocation, and caching in a unified framework. The joint optimization problem is formulated as a weighted-sum multi-objective task, designed to maximize throughput and cache hit ratio while simultaneously minimizing transmission delay. In the proposed model, CIoT agents jointly optimize EH and data transmission using a learnable time switching (TS) factor. They also coordinate spectrum access under hybrid overlay-underlay paradigms and make power control and cache placement decisions while considering energy, interference, and storage constraints. Specifically, in this work, cooperative caching is used to enable overlay access, while power control is used for underlay access. A novel three-level hierarchical SAC (H-SAC) agent decomposes the mixed discrete-continuous action space into modular subproblems, improving scalability and convergence over flat DRL methods. The high-level policy adjusts the TS factor, the mid-level policy manages spectrum access coordination and cache sharing, and the low-level policy decides transmit power and caching actions for both the CIoT agent and PU content. Simulation results show that the proposed hierarchical SAC approach significantly outperforms benchmark and greedy strategies. It achieves better performance in terms of average sum rate, delay, cache hit ratio, and energy efficiency, even under channel fading and uncertain conditions.</description>

      <title>Fusion of Cellular ISAC and Passive RF Sensing for UAV Detection and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in civilian and critical-infrastructure airspace has created a need for reliable detection and tracking systems that operate under diverse environmental and sensing conditions. This paper presents a UAV detection and tracking system that fuses measurements from a network of passive Keysight N6841A RF sensors and a Ku-band Fortem TrueView R20 radar operating in the FR3 spectrum (16.3 GHz) as an ISAC proxy. Real-world experiments at the NSF AERPAW testbed demonstrate that radar and RF sensing provide complementary strengths under varying geometric, range, and line-of-sight conditions. A Kalman filter using a constant-velocity motion model integrates the asynchronous 2D RF and 3D radar observations, suppressing large standalone errors, improving accuracy over individual modalities, and increasing tracking coverage without degrading performance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-modal, ISAC-oriented sensing for robust UAV tracking in outdoor environments.</description>

      <title>Tunable Gaussian Pulse for Delay-Doppler ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) for next-generation networks targets robust operation under high mobility and high Doppler spread, leading to severe inter-carrier interference (ICI) in systems based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms. Delay--Doppler (DD)-domain ISAC offers a more robust foundation under high mobility, but it requires a suitable DD-domain pulse-shaping filter. The prevailing DD pulse designs are either communication-centric or static, which limits adaptation to non-stationary channels and diverse application demands. To address this limitation, this paper introduces the tunable Gaussian pulse (TGP), a DD-native, analytically tunable pulse shape parameterized by its aspect ratio \( \gamma \), chirp rate \( \alpha_c \), and phase coupling \( \beta_c \). On the sensing side, we derive closed-form Cram\'er--Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) that map \( (\gamma,\alpha_c,\beta_c) \) to fundamental delay and Doppler precision. On the communications side, we show that \( \alpha_c \) and \( \beta_c \) reshape off-diagonal covariance, and thus inter-symbol interference (ISI), without changing received power, isolating capacity effects to interference structure rather than power loss. A comprehensive trade-off analysis demonstrates that the TGP spans a flexible operational region from the high capacity of the Sinc pulse to the high precision of the root raised cosine (RRC) pulse. Notably, TGP attains near-RRC sensing precision while retaining over \( 90\% \) of Sinc's maximum capacity, achieving a balanced operating region that is not attainable by conventional static pulse designs.</description>

      <title>Cryptographic transformations over polyadic rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel cryptographic paradigm based on nonderived polyadic algebraic structures. Traditional cryptosystems rely on binary operations within groups, rings, or fields, whose well-understood properties can be exploited in cryptanalysis. To overcome these vulnerabilities, we propose a shift to polyadic rings, which generalize classical rings by allowing operations of higher arity: an $m$-ary addition and an $n$-ary multiplication. The foundation of our approach is the construction of polyadic integers -- congruence classes of ordinary integers endowed with such $m$-ary and $n$-ary operations. A key innovation is the parameter-to-arity mapping $\Phi(a,b)=(m,n)$, which links the parameters $(a,b)$ defining a congruence class to the specific arities required for algebraic closure. This mapping is mathematically intricate: it is non-injective, non-surjective, and multivalued. This complex, non-unique relationship forms the core of the proposed cryptosystem's security. We present two concrete encryption procedures that leverage this structure by encoding plaintext within the parameters of polyadic rings and transmitting information via polyadically quantized analog signals. In one method, plaintext is linked to the additive arity $m_{i}$ and secured using the summation of such signals; in the other, it is linked to a ring parameter $a_{i}$ and secured using their multiplication. In both cases, the "quantized" nature of polyadic operations generates systems of equations that are straightforward for a legitimate recipient with the correct key but exceptionally difficult for an attacker without it. The resulting framework promises a substantial increase in cryptographic security. This work establishes the theoretical foundation for this new class of encryption schemes and highlights their potential for constructing robust, next-generation cryptographic protocols.</description>

      <title>Symbol Distributions in Semantic Communications: A Source-Channel Equilibrium Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication systems often use an end-to-end neural network to map input data into continuous symbols. These symbols, which are essentially neural network features, usually have fixed dimensions and heavy-tailed distributions. However, due to the end-to-end training nature of the neural network encoder, the underlying reason for the symbol distribution remains underexplored. We propose a new explanation for the semantic symbol distribution: an inherent trade-off between source coding and communications. Specifically, the encoder balances two objectives: allocating power for minimum \emph{effective codelength} (for source coding) and maximizing mutual information (for communications). We formalize this trade-off via an information-theoretic optimization framework, which yields a Student's $t$-distribution as the resulting symbol distribution. Through extensive studies on image-based semantic systems, we find that our formulation models the learned symbols and predicts how the symbol distribution's shape parameter changes with respect to (i) the use of variable-length coding and (ii) the dataset's entropy variability. Furthermore, we demonstrate how introducing a regularizer that enforces a target symbol distribution, which guides the encoder towards a target prior (e.g., Gaussian), improves training convergence and supports our hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Quality-Aware Framework for Video-Derived Respiratory Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video-based respiratory rate (RR) estimation is often unreliable due to inconsistent signal quality across extraction methods. We present a predictive, quality-aware framework that integrates heterogeneous signal sources with dynamic assessment of reliability. Ten signals are extracted from facial remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), upper-body motion, and deep learning pipelines, and analyzed using four spectral estimators: Welch's method, Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and peak detection. Segment-level quality indices are then used to train machine learning models that predict accuracy or select the most reliable signal. This enables adaptive signal fusion and quality-based segment filtering. Experiments on three public datasets (OMuSense-23, COHFACE, MAHNOB-HCI) show that the proposed framework achieves lower RR estimation errors than individual methods in most cases, with performance gains depending on dataset characteristics. These findings highlight the potential of quality-driven predictive modeling to deliver scalable and generalizable video-based respiratory monitoring solutions.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Aperture for High Spatial Resolution Acoustoelectric Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustoelectric (AE) imaging provides electro-anatomical contrast by mapping the distribution of electric fields in biological tissues, by delivering ultrasound waves which spatially modulate the medium resistivity via the AE effect. The conventional method in AE imaging is to transmit focused ultrasound (FUS) beams; however, the depth-of-field (DOF) of FUS-AE is limited to the size of the focal spot, which does not span across the centimeter-scale of organs. Instead of fixing the focal depth on transmission, we propose to dynamically synthesize the AE modulation regions via a Synthetic Aperture approach (SA-AE). SA-AE involves a straightforward pixel-based delay-and-sum reconstruction of AE images from unfocused AE signals. In saline and ex vivo lobster nerve experiments, FUS-AE was shown to perform well only at the focal depth, with poor spatial resolution for out-of-focus electric sources. Meanwhile, SA-AE generally improved spatial resolution throughout the DOF, but introduced strong background noise. The flexibility of uncoupled, single-element induced AE signals in SA-AE was further leveraged to quantify their spatial coherence across the transmit aperture, obtaining maps of the coherence factor (CF) and pulse-length coherence factor (CFPL). Weighting SA-AE images with their derived CF and CFPL maps resulted in further improvement in image resolution and contrast, and notably, boosted the image SNR beyond that of FUS-AE. CFPL exhibited stronger noise suppression over CF. Using unfocused wave transmissions, the proposed coherence-weighted SA-AE strategy offers a high resolution yet noise-robust solution towards the practical imaging of fast biological currents.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming for Multiuser MIMO Systems with Unknown Channel Statistics: A Hybrid Offline-Online Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust beamforming design under imperfect channel state information (CSI) is a fundamental challenge in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems, particularly when the channel estimation error statistics are unknown. Conventional model-driven methods usually rely on prior knowledge of the error covariance matrix and data-driven deep learning approaches suffer from poor generalization capability to unseen channel conditions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a hybrid offline-online framework that achieves effective offline learning and rapid online adaptation. In the offline phase, we propose a shared (among users) deep neural network (DNN) that is able to learn the channel estimation error covariance from observed samples, thus enabling robust beamforming without statistical priors. Meanwhile, to facilitate real-time deployment, we propose a sparse augmented low-rank (SALR) method to reduce complexity while maintaining comparable performance. In the online phase, we show that the proposed network can be rapidly fine-tuned with minimal gradient steps. Furthermore, a multiple basis model-agnostic meta-learning (MB-MAML) strategy is further proposed to maintain multiple meta-initializations and by dynamically selecting the best one online, we can improve the adaptation and generalization capability of the proposed framework under unseen or non-stationary channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed offline-online framework exhibits strong robustness across diverse channel conditions and it is able to significantly outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.</description>

      <title>PADE: A Predictor-Free Sparse Attention Accelerator via Unified Execution and Stage Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention-based models have revolutionized AI, but the quadratic cost of self-attention incurs severe computational and memory overhead. Sparse attention methods alleviate this by skipping low-relevance token pairs. However, current approaches lack practicality due to the heavy expense of added sparsity predictor, which severely drops their hardware efficiency.
  This paper advances the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by proposing a bit-serial enable stage-fusion (BSF) mechanism, which eliminates the need for a separate predictor. However, it faces key challenges: 1) Inaccurate bit-sliced sparsity speculation leads to incorrect pruning; 2) Hardware under-utilization due to fine-grained and imbalanced bit-level workloads. 3) Tiling difficulty caused by the row-wise dependency in sparsity pruning criteria.
  We propose PADE, a predictor-free algorithm-hardware co-design for dynamic sparse attention acceleration. PADE features three key innovations: 1) Bit-wise uncertainty interval-enabled guard filtering (BUI-GF) strategy to accurately identify trivial tokens during each bit round; 2) Bidirectional sparsity-based out-of-order execution (BS-OOE) to improve hardware utilization; 3) Interleaving-based sparsity-tiled attention (ISTA) to reduce both I/O and computational complexity. These techniques, combined with custom accelerator designs, enable practical sparsity acceleration without relying on an added sparsity predictor. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks show that PADE achieves 7.43x speed up and 31.1x higher energy efficiency than Nvidia H100 GPU. Compared to SOTA accelerators, PADE achieves 5.1x, 4.3x and 3.4x energy saving than Sanger, DOTA and SOFA.</description>

      <title>Agile Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing</title>

Abstract: The advancement to 6G calls for waveforms that transcend static robustness to achieve intelligent adaptability. Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM), despite its strength in doubly-dispersive channels, has been confined by chirp parameters optimized for worst-case scenarios. This paper shatters this limitation with Agile-AFDM, a novel framework that endows AFDM with dynamic, data-aware intelligence. By redefining chirp parameters as optimizable variables for each transmission block based on real-time channel and data information, Agile-AFDM transforms into an adaptive platform. It can actively reconfigure its waveform to minimize peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) for power efficiency, suppress inter-carrier interference (ICI) for communication reliability, or reduce Cramer-Rao bound (CRLB) for sensing accuracy. This paradigm shift from a static, one-size-fits-all waveform to a context-aware signal designer is made practical by efficient, tailored optimization algorithms. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that this capability delivers significant performance gains across all metrics, surpassing conventional OFDM and static AFDM. Agile-AFDM, therefore, offers a crucial step forward in the design of agile waveforms for 6G and beyond.</description>

      <title>AnySleep: a channel-agnostic deep learning system for high-resolution sleep staging in multi-center cohorts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sleep is essential for good health throughout our lives, yet studying its dynamics requires manual sleep staging, a labor-intensive step in sleep research and clinical care. Across centers, polysomnography (PSG) recordings are traditionally scored in 30-s epochs for pragmatic, not physiological, reasons and can vary considerably in electrode count, montage, and subject characteristics. These constraints present challenges in conducting harmonized multi-center sleep studies and discovering novel, robust biomarkers on shorter timescales. Here, we present AnySleep, a deep neural network model that uses any electroencephalography (EEG) or electrooculography (EOG) data to score sleep at adjustable temporal resolutions. We trained and validated the model on over 19,000 overnight recordings from 21 datasets collected across multiple clinics, spanning nearly 200,000 hours of EEG and EOG data, to promote robust generalization across sites. The model attains state-of-the-art performance and surpasses or equals established baselines at 30-s epochs. Performance improves as more channels are provided, yet remains strong when EOG is absent or when only EOG or single EEG derivations (frontal, central, or occipital) are available. On sub-30-s timescales, the model captures short wake intrusions consistent with arousals and improves prediction of physiological characteristics (age, sex) and pathophysiological conditions (sleep apnea), relative to standard 30-s scoring. We make the model publicly available to facilitate large-scale studies with heterogeneous electrode setups and to accelerate the discovery of novel biomarkers in sleep.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Consistent, Causal Data-Driven Predictive Control via SSARX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a fundamental-lemma-free data-driven predictive control (DDPC) scheme for synthesizing model predictive control (MPC)-like policies directly from input-output data. Unlike the well-known DeePC approach and other DDPC methods that rely on Willems' fundamental lemma, our method avoids stacked Hankel representations and the DeePC decision variable g. Instead, we develop a closed-loop consistent, causal DDPC scheme based on the multi-step predictor Subspace-ARX (SSARX). The method first (i) estimates predictor/observer Markov parameters via a high-order ARX model to decouple the noise, then (ii) learns a multi-step past-to-future map by regression, optionally with a reduced-rank constraint. The SSARX predictor is strictly causal, which allows it to be integrated naturally into an MPC formulation. Our experimental results show that SSARX performs competitively with other methods when applied to closed-loop data affected by measurement and process noise.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Electrogram Generation with Variational Autoencoders for ECGI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and its clinical assessment requires accurate characterization of atrial electrical activity. Noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) combined with deep learning (DL) approaches for estimating intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) from body surface potentials (BSPMs) has shown promise, but progress is hindered by the limited availability of paired BSPM-EGM datasets. To address this limitation, we investigate variational autoencoders (VAEs) for the generation of synthetic multichannel atrial EGMs. Two models are proposed: a sinus rhythm-specific VAE (VAE-S) and a class-conditioned VAE (VAE-C) trained on both sinus rhythm and AF signals. Generated EGMs are evaluated using morphological, spectral, and distributional similarity metrics. VAE-S achieves higher fidelity with respect to in silico EGMs, while VAE-C enables rhythm-specific generation at the expense of reduced sinus reconstruction quality. As a proof of concept, the generated EGMs are used for data augmentation in a downstream noninvasive EGM reconstruction task, where moderate augmentation improves estimation performance. These results demonstrate the potential of VAE-based generative modeling to alleviate data scarcity and enhance deep learning-based ECGI pipelines.</description>

      <title>Configurable {\gamma} Photon Spectrometer to Enable Precision Radioguided Tumor Resection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surgical tumor resection aims to remove all cancer cells in the tumor margin and at centimeter-scale depths below the tissue surface. During surgery, microscopic clusters of disease are intraoperatively difficult to visualize and are often left behind, significantly increasing the risk of cancer recurrence. Radioguided surgery (RGS) has shown the ability to selectively tag cancer cells with gamma ({\gamma}) photon emitting radioisotopes to identify them, but require a mm-scale {\gamma} photon spectrometer to localize the position of these cells in the tissue margin (i.e., a function of incident {\gamma} photon energy) with high specificity. Here we present a 9.9 mm2 integrated circuit (IC)-based {\gamma} spectrometer implemented in 180 nm CMOS, to enable the measurement of single {\gamma} photons and their incident energy with sub-keV energy resolution. We use small 2 2 um reverse-biased diodes that have low depletion region capacitance, and therefore produce millivolt-scale voltage signals in response to the small charge generated by incident {\gamma} photons. A low-power energy spectrometry method is implemented by measuring the decay time it takes for the generated voltage signal to settle back to DC after a {\gamma} detection event, instead of measuring the voltage drop directly. This spectrometry method is implemented in three different pixel architectures that allow for configurable pixel sensitivity, energy-resolution, and energy dynamic range based on the widely heterogenous surgical and patient presentation in RGS. The spectrometer was tested with three common {\gamma}-emitting radioisotopes (64Cu, 133Ba, 177Lu), and is able to resolve activities down to 1 uCi with sub-keV energy resolution and 1.315 MeV energy dynamic range, using 5-minute acquisitions.</description>

      <title>Spherical Leech Quantization for Visual Tokenization and Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-parametric quantization has received much attention due to its efficiency on parameters and scalability to a large codebook. In this paper, we present a unified formulation of different non-parametric quantization methods through the lens of lattice coding. The geometry of lattice codes explains the necessity of auxiliary loss terms when training auto-encoders with certain existing lookup-free quantization variants such as BSQ. As a step forward, we explore a few possible candidates, including random lattices, generalized Fibonacci lattices, and densest sphere packing lattices. Among all, we find the Leech lattice-based quantization method, which is dubbed as Spherical Leech Quantization ($\Lambda_{24}$-SQ), leads to both a simplified training recipe and an improved reconstruction-compression tradeoff thanks to its high symmetry and even distribution on the hypersphere. In image tokenization and compression tasks, this quantization approach achieves better reconstruction quality across all metrics than BSQ, the best prior art, while consuming slightly fewer bits. The improvement also extends to state-of-the-art auto-regressive image generation frameworks.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the increasingly prominent task of jointly inferring multiple networks from nodal observations. While most joint inference methods assume that observations are available at all nodes, we consider the realistic and more difficult scenario where a subset of nodes are hidden and cannot be measured. Under the assumptions that the partially observed nodal signals are graph stationary and the networks have similar connectivity patterns, we derive structural characteristics of the connectivity between hidden and observed nodes. This allows us to formulate an optimization problem for estimating networks while accounting for the influence of hidden nodes. We identify conditions under which a convex relaxation yields the sparsest solution, and we formalize the performance of our proposed optimization problem with respect to the effect of the hidden nodes. Finally, synthetic and real-world simulations provide evaluations of our method in comparison with other baselines.</description>

Abstract: Recent developments in machine learning (ML) techniques enable users to extract, transmit, and reproduce information semantics via ML-based semantic communication (SemCom). This significantly increases network spectral efficiency and transmission robustness. In the network, the semantic encoders and decoders among various users, based on ML, however, require collaborative updating according to new transmission tasks. The various heterogeneous characteristics of most networks in turn introduce emerging but unique challenges for semantic codec updating that are different from other general ML model updating. In this article, we first overview the key components of the SemCom system. We then discuss the unique challenges associated with semantic codec updates in heterogeneous networks. Accordingly, we point out a potential framework and discuss the pros and cons thereof. Finally, several future research directions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Weighted Covariance Intersection for Range-based Distributed Cooperative Localization of Multi-Vehicle Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative localization is considered a key solution for enabling autonomous navigation of multi-vehicle systems (MVS) in GNSS-denied environments. Among all solutions, distributed cooperative localization (DCL) has garnered widespread attention due to its robustness and scalability, making it well-suited for large-scale MVS. To address the challenge of untrackable state correlations between vehicles in a distributed framework, covariance intersection (CI) has been introduced as a means to fuse relative measurements under unknown correlations. However, existing studies treat CI merely as a plug-in method, applying traditional optimization criteria directly and focusing only on simple two-dimensional (2D) scenarios. When directly extended to three-dimensional (3D) scenarios with more complex state space (higher dimensions, additional state components, and significant disparities in scale and observability among state components), traditional methods fail to achieve balanced state estimation across all state components, leading to a significant degradation in the estimation accuracy of some state components. This highlights the need to design specialized mechanisms to improve the data fusion process. In this paper, we introduce a weighting mechanism, namely the weighted covariance intersection (WCI), to regulate the fusion process of CI. A concurrent fusion strategy for multiple distance measurements and a dedicated weighting matrix based on the error propagation rule of the inertial navigation system (INS) are developed for the data fusion process in DCL. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed WCI significantly enhances cooperative localization performance compared to traditional CI, while the distributed approach outperforms the centralized approach in terms of robustness and scalability.</description>

      <title>Towards Automated EEG-Based Epilepsy Detection Using Deep Convolutional Autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. This disease requires reliable and efficient seizure detection methods. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the gold standard for seizure monitoring, but its manual analysis is a time-consuming task that requires expert knowledge. In addition, there are no well-defined features that allow fully automated analysis. Existing deep learning-based approaches struggle to achieve high sensitivity while maintaining a low false alarm rate per hour (FAR/h) and lack consistency in the optimal EEG input representation, whether in the time or frequency domain. To address these issues, we propose a Deep Convolutional Autoencoder (DCAE) to extract low-dimensional latent representations that preserve essential EEG signal features. The ability of the model to preserve relevant information was evaluated by comparing reconstruction errors based on both time series and frequency-domain representations. Several autoencoders with different loss functions based on time and frequency were trained and evaluated to determine their effectiveness in reconstructing EEG features. Our results show that the DCAE model taking both time series and frequency losses into account achieved the best reconstruction performance. This indicates that Deep Neural Networks with a single representation might not preserve the relevant signal properties. This work provides insight into how deep learning models process EEG data and examines whether frequency information is captured when time series signals are used as input.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measured impulse responses obtained from a dynamic unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) channel sounding system exhibit effects attributable to time-varying carrier frequency offset (CFO) and sampling frequency offset (SFO). To correct the recorded data in post-processing, we extend existing geometry-based drift compensation algorithms by an explicit line-of-sight (LoS) determination, combining a symbol-wise high-resolution parameter estimation (HRPE) in delay with a Kalman filter. This proposed extension facilitates the removal of rapidly varying synchronization mismatches from channel sounding measurements in rich multipath propagation scenarios. Furthermore, we propose using the relative residual power after subtraction of estimated multipath components as a metric for ground-truth-independent comparison of post-processing synchronization methods for recorded channel sounding data. The application of the proposed procedure shows that our approach outperforms existing post-processing compensation algorithms, reducing the relative residual power by more than 5 dB and the delay-Doppler estimate root mean square errors (RMSEs) of a passive UAV target by approximately 60 %.</description>

      <title>WaveC2R: Wavelet-Driven Coarse-to-Refined Hierarchical Learning for Radar Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite-based radar retrieval methods are widely employed to fill coverage gaps in ground-based radar systems, especially in remote areas affected by terrain blockage and limited detection range. Existing methods predominantly rely on overly simplistic spatial-domain architectures constructed from a single data source, limiting their ability to accurately capture complex precipitation patterns and sharply defined meteorological boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose WaveC2R, a novel wavelet-driven coarse-to-refined framework for radar retrieval. WaveC2R integrates complementary multi-source data and leverages frequency-domain decomposition to separately model low-frequency components for capturing precipitation patterns and high-frequency components for delineating sharply defined meteorological boundaries. Specifically, WaveC2R consists of two stages (i)Intensity-Boundary Decoupled Learning, which leverages wavelet decomposition and frequency-specific loss functions to separately optimize low-frequency intensity and high-frequency boundaries; and (ii)Detail-Enhanced Diffusion Refinement, which employs frequency-aware conditional priors and multi-source data to progressively enhance fine-scale precipitation structures while preserving coarse-scale meteorological consistency. Experimental results on the publicly available SEVIR dataset demonstrate that WaveC2R achieves state-of-the-art performance in satellite-based radar retrieval, particularly excelling at preserving high-intensity precipitation features and sharply defined meteorological boundaries.</description>

      <title>Secure Wireless Communication Using Coherent Distributed Transmission and Spatial Signal Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new approach to secure wireless communications using coherent distributed transmission of signals that are spatially decomposed between a two-element distributed antenna array. High-accuracy distributed coordination of microwave wireless systems supports the ability to transmit different parts of a signal from separate transmitters such that they combine coherently at a designated destination. In this paper we explore this concept using a two-element coherent distributed phased array where each of the two transmitters sends a separate component of a communication signal where each symbol is decomposed into a sum of two pseudo-random signal vectors, the coherent summation of which yields the intended symbol. By directing the transmission to an intended receiver using distributed beamforming, the summation of the two vector components is largely confined to a spatial region at the destination receiver. We implement the technique in a 50 wavelength array operating at 3 GHz. We evaluate the symbol error ratio. (SER) in two-dimensional space through simulation and measurement, showing the approach yields a spatially confined secure region where the information is recoverable(i.e., the received signal has low SER), and outside of which the information is unrecoverable (high SER). The proposed system is also compared against a traditional beamforming system where each node sends the same data. We validate experimentally that our approach achieves a low SER of 0.0082 at broadside and a SER above 0.25 at all other locations compared to a traditional beamforming approach that achieves a SER of 0 at all locations measured.</description>

      <title>Wi-CBR: Salient-aware Adaptive WiFi Sensing for Cross-domain Behavior Recognition</title>

Abstract: The challenge in WiFi-based cross-domain Behavior Recognition lies in the significant interference of domain-specific signals on gesture variation. However, previous methods alleviate this interference by mapping the phase from multiple domains into a common feature space. If the Doppler Frequency Shift (DFS) signal is used to dynamically supplement the phase features to achieve better generalization, it enables the model to not only explore a wider feature space but also to avoid potential degradation of gesture semantic information. Specifically, we propose a novel Salient-aware Adaptive WiFi Sensing for Cross-domain Behavior Recognition (Wi-CBR), which constructs a dual-branch self-attention module that captures temporal features from phase information reflecting dynamic path length variations while extracting kinematic features from DFS correlated with motion velocity. Moreover, we design a Saliency Guidance Module that employs group attention mechanisms to mine critical activity features and utilizes gating mechanisms to optimize information entropy, facilitating feature fusion and enabling effective interaction between salient and non-salient behavioral characteristics. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets (Widar3.0 and XRF55) demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.</description>

      <title>Manifold Learning for Personalized and Label-Free Detection of Cardiac Arrhythmias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16494</link>

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) provide direct, non-invasive measurements of heart activity and are well-established tools for detecting and monitoring cardiovascular disease. However, manual ECG analysis can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for automated heartbeat recognition and classification, but substantial variations in ECG signals make it challenging to develop generalizable supervised models. ECG signals vary widely across individuals and leads, while datasets often follow different labeling standards and may be biased, greatly hindering supervised methods. Conventional unsupervised methods, such as principal component analysis, prioritize large (often obvious) variances and typically overlook subtle yet clinically relevant patterns. When labels are missing or variations are small, both approaches fail. Here, we show that nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) algorithms, namely t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), can address these challenges and identify medically relevant features in ECG signals without training or prior information. Using lead II and V1 signals from the MIT-BIH dataset, UMAP and t-SNE generate rich two-dimensional latent spaces with visually separable clusters. Applied to mixed populations of heartbeats, these clusters correspond to different individuals, while for single subjects they reveal distinct arrhythmia patterns. A simple classifier on these embeddings discriminates individual recordings with &gt;= 90% accuracy and identifies arrhythmias in single patients with a median accuracy of 98.96% and median F1-score of 91.02%. The results show that NLDR holds much promise for cardiac monitoring, including the limiting cases of single-lead ECG and the current 12-lead standard of care, and for personalized health care beyond cardiology.</description>

      <title>Standards-Compliant DM-RS Allocation via Temporal Channel Prediction for Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reducing feedback overhead in beyond 5G networks is a critical challenge, as the growing number of antennas in modern massive MIMO systems substantially increases the channel state information (CSI) feedback demand in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. To address this, extensive research has focused on CSI compression and prediction, with neural network-based approaches gaining momentum and being considered for integration into the 3GPP 5G-Advanced standards. While deep learning has been effectively applied to CSI-limited beamforming and handover optimization, reference signal allocation under such constraints remains surprisingly underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of channel prediction-based reference signal allocation (CPRS), which jointly optimizes channel prediction and DM-RS allocation to improve data throughput without requiring CSI feedback. We further propose a standards-compliant ViViT/CNN-based architecture that implements CPRS by treating evolving CSI matrices as sequential image-like data, enabling efficient and adaptive transmission in dynamic environments. Simulation results using ray-tracing channel data generated in NVIDIA Sionna validate the proposed method, showing up to 36.60% throughput improvement over benchmark strategies.</description>
