      <title>Tomography of 1-forms on a gas giant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that on gas giant manifolds the geodesic X-ray transform is solenoidally injective on one-forms that are smooth up to the boundary in an appropriate smooth structure. A gas giant manifold is a conformally blown up Riemannian manifold whose boundary singularity is milder than asymptotically hyperbolic. The proof is based on a Pestov identity and asymptotic analysis of short geodesics.</description>

      <title>Integrals and Rigidity on Manifolds with Nonnegative Ricci Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the general sharp mean value inequality for non-negative superharmonic functions and its corresponding rigidity, which removes the radius restriction of Schoen-Yau's classical result about this inequality. And we obtain an explicit formula of the asymptotic scaling invariant integral of weighted scalar curvature, on three dimensional complete Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature and maximal volume growth. As an application, we use this formula to give another proof of Hamilton's pinching conjecture in this case.</description>

      <title>Prolongations of $(3, 6)$-distributions by singular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subbundle of rank 3 in the tangent bundle over a 6-dimensional manifold is called a (3, 6)-distribution if its local sections generate the whole tangent bundle by taking their Lie brackets once. An integral curve of a distribution, whose velocity vectors belong to the distribution, can be a singular curve or an abnormal extremal in the sense of geometric control theory. In this paper, given a (3, 6)-distribution, we prolong it, using the data of singular curves, to a (3,5,7,8)-distribution, to a (3, 5, 7, 8, 9)-distribution which possesses additional pseudo-product structure respectively. Regarding also another prolongation to a (4, 6, 8)-distribution, we show the equivalence of the classification problems of those four classes of distributions obtained from (3, 6)-distributions, generalising the correspondences of those in B_3-SO(3,4)-homogeneous models.</description>

      <title>Low energy $\varepsilon$-harmonic maps into the round sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we classify the low energy $\varepsilon$-harmonic maps from the surfaces of constant curvature with positive genus into the round sphere. We find that all such maps with degree $\pm1$ are all quantitively close to a bubble configuration with bubbles forming at special points on the domain with bubbling radius proportional to $\varepsilon^{1/4}$.</description>

      <title>The generalised energy identity and length of necks for $\varepsilon$-harmonic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we find analogues for $\varepsilon$-harmonic maps to the generalised energy identity and the existence of geodesic necks result discovered by Yuxiang Li and Youde Wang for $\alpha$-harmonic maps. In particular there exist specific quantities depending only on $\varepsilon$ and the bubbling radius which entirely determine if the full energy identity holds and if a neck forms. In the case these fail we can calculate the energy lost and the length of the geodesic neck based on only these quantities and the biharmonic energy of the bubble.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Riemannian positive mass theorem for asymptotically flat spin manifolds with hypersurface singularities. Unlike earlier results, some components of the singular set may be mean-concave, provided that other components of the singular set are sufficiently mean-convex. Our proof uses initial data sets where a suitably chosen second fundamental form transfers convexity defects between different singularity components.</description>

      <title>Simply connectedness of K\"ahler and Riemannian manifolds via spectral estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,h)$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold. Under a suitable spectral positivity assumption we prove that $M$ is simply connected, projective, uniruled and $h^{p,0}(M)=\{0\}$ for each $p&gt;0$. Then, in the second part of this paper, we focus on Riemannian manifolds and we provide an appropriate spectral positivity assumption which guarantees that a compact and oriented even dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is a simply connected rational homology sphere.</description>

      <title>Solution for the Einstein-Maxwell equations invariant under an $(n - 1)$-dimensional group of dilations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an electrostatic system whose spatial factor is conformal to an $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. We provide a complete characterization of the most general ansatz, thereby reducing the associated electrostatic system of partial differential equations to an ordinary differential equation system. We prove that there are only two possibilities: either the cosmological constant is nonzero, in which case the solutions are necessarily invariant under rotations or translations, or the cosmological constant vanishes, and the solutions belong to the Majumdar-Papapetrou class with a degree of freedom associated with an invariant $(n-1)$-dimensional subgroup. As a result, we introduce a new solution to the electrovacuum system in the Majumdar-Papapetrou class that is invariant under an $(n-1)$-dimensional group of dilations.</description>

      <title>Notes on projective structures with torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that projective structures with torsion are described in terms of affine connections in a parallel way as in the torsion-free case which is done by Kobayashi and Nagano. For this, we make use of a bundle of formal frames, which is a generalization of a bundle of frames. We will also describe projective structures in terms of Thomas--Whitehead connections by following Roberts. In particular, we introduce normal projective connections and show the fundamental theorem for Thomas--Whitehead connections regardless the triviality of the torsion. We will study some examples of projective structures of which the torsion is non-trivial while the curvature is trivial. In this article, projective structures are considered to be the same if they have the same geodesics ignoring parameters and the same torsions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the geometry of compact strong HKT and, more generally, compact BHE manifolds. We prove that any compact BHE manifold with full holonomy must be K\"ahler and we establish a similar result for strong HKT manifolds. Additionally, we demonstrate a rigidity theorem for strong HKT structures on solvmanifolds and we completely classify those with parallel Bismut torsion. Finally, we introduce the Ricci foliation for hypercomplex manifolds and analyze its properties for compact, simply connected, 8-dimensional strong HKT manifolds, proving that they are always Hopf fibrations over a compact $4$-dimensional orbifold.</description>

      <title>1-Lefschetz contact solvmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the contact Lefschetz condition on compact contact solvmanifolds, as introduced by B.\ Cappelletti-Montano, A.\ De Nicola and I.\ Yudin. We seek to fill the gap in the literature concerning Benson-Gordon type results, characterizing $1$-Lefschetz contact solvmanifolds. We prove that the $1$-Lefschetz condition on Lie algebras is preserved via $1$-dimensional central extensions by a symplectic cocycle, thereby establishing that a unimodular symplectic Lie algebra $(\mathfrak{h}, \omega)$ is $1$-Lefschetz if and only if its contactization $(\mathfrak{g}, \eta)$ is $1$-Lefschetz. We achieve this by showing an explicit relation for the relevant cohomology degrees of $\mathfrak{h}$ and $\mathfrak{g}$. Using this, we show how the commutators $[\mathfrak{h},\mathfrak{h}]$ and $[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]$ are related, especially when the $1$-Lefschetz condition holds. By specializing to the nilpotent setting, we prove that $1$-Lefschetz contact nilmanifolds equipped with an invariant contact form are quotients of a Heisenberg group, and deduce that there are many examples of compact $K$-contact solvmanifolds not admitting compatible Sasakian structures. We also construct examples of completely solvable $1$-Lefschetz solvmanifolds, some having the $2$-Lefschetz property and some failing it.</description>

Abstract: We give a lower bound for the delta invariant of the fundamental divisor of a quasi-smooth weighted hypersurface. As a consequence, we prove K-stability of a large class of quasi-smooth Fano hypersurfaces of index 1 and of all smooth Fano weighted hypersurfaces of index 1 and 2. The proofs are based on the Abban--Zhuang method and on the study of linear systems on flags of weighted hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Geometry and the Stability of Minimum Differentiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for horizontal differentiation in which firms compete on a product manifold representing the feasible combinations of characteristics. This approach generalizes both the Hotelling line and Salop circle to any Riemannian space, allowing for a unified analysis of product space. We show that equilibrium existence and stability are governed by intrinsic geometric properties, specifically curvature, symmetry and dimension. We prove that negative curvature and high intrinsic dimension act as stabilizers of minimum differentiation equilibria, moving the analysis beyond the symmetry-induced instabilities found in simpler, fixed domains. By characterizing curvature as a measure of consumer heterogeneity, we demonstrate that intrinsic geometry is a fundamental determinant of competitive outcomes.</description>

      <title>Magnetic spectral inverse problems on compact Anosov manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish positive results for two spectral inverse problems in the presence of a magnetic potential. Exploiting the principal wave trace invariants, we first observe that on closed Anosov manifolds with simple length spectrum, one can recover an electric and a magnetic (up to a natural gauge) potential from the spectrum of the associated magnetic Schr\"odinger operator. This simple observation extends a particular instance of a recent positive result on the spectral inverse problem for the Bochner Laplacian in negative curvature, obtained by M.Ceki\'c and T$.$Lefeuvre (2023)$.$ Similarly, we prove that the spectrum of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (or magnetic Steklov operator) on a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary determines both a magnetic potential (up to gauge) and an electric potential at the boundary, provided the latter is Anosov with simple length spectrum. Under this assumption, one can actually show that the magnetic Steklov spectrum determines the full Taylor series at the boundary of any smooth magnetic field and electric potential. As a simple consequence, in this case, both an analytic magnetic field and an analytic electric potential are uniquely determined by their Steklov spectrum.</description>
