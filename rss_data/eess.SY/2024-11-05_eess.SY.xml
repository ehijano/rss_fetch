      <title>Safe Imitation Learning-based Optimal Energy Storage Systems Dispatch in Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources (DER) has escalated the challenge of voltage magnitude regulation in distribution networks. Traditional model-based approaches, which rely on complex sequential mathematical formulations, struggle to meet real-time operational demands. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative by enabling offline training with distribution network simulators, followed by real-time execution. However, DRL algorithms tend to converge to local optima due to limited exploration efficiency. Additionally, DRL algorithms can not enforce voltage magnitude constraints, leading to potential operational violations when implemented in the distribution network operation. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a novel safe imitation reinforcement learning (IRL) framework that combines IRL and a designed safety layer, aiming to optimize the operation of Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) in active distribution networks. The proposed safe IRL framework comprises two phases: offline training and online execution. During the offline phase, optimal state-action pairs are collected using an NLP solver, guiding the IRL policy iteration. In the online phase, the trained IRL policy's decisions are adjusted by the safety layer to maintain safety and constraint compliance. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of Safe IRL in balancing operational efficiency and safety, eliminating voltage violations, and maintaining low operation cost errors across various network sizes, while meeting real-time execution requirements.</description>

      <title>Combining Physics-based and Data-driven Modeling for Building Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building energy modeling plays a vital role in optimizing the operation of building energy systems by providing accurate predictions of the building's real-world conditions. In this context, various techniques have been explored, ranging from traditional physics-based models to data-driven models. Recently, researchers are combining physics-based and data-driven models into hybrid approaches. This includes using the physics-based model output as additional data-driven input, learning the residual between physics-based model and real data, learning a surrogate of the physics-based model, or fine-tuning a surrogate model with real data. However, a comprehensive comparison of the inherent advantages of these hybrid approaches is still missing. The primary objective of this work is to evaluate four predominant hybrid approaches in building energy modeling through a real-world case study, with focus on indoor temperature dynamics. To achieve this, we devise three scenarios reflecting common levels of building documentation and sensor availability, assess their performance, and analyse their explainability using hierarchical Shapley values. The real-world study reveals three notable findings. First, greater building documentation and sensor availability lead to higher prediction accuracy for hybrid approaches. Second, the performance of hybrid approaches depend on the type of building room, but the residual approach using a Feedforward Neural Network as data-driven sub-model performs best on average across all rooms. This hybrid approach also demonstrates a superior ability to leverage the physics-based simulation from the physics-based sub-model. Third, hierarchical Shapley values prove to be an effective tool for explaining and improving hybrid models while accounting for input correlations.</description>

      <title>Relay Satellite Assisted LEO Constellation NOMA Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a relay satellite assisted low earth orbit (LEO) constellation non-orthogonal multiple access combined beamforming (R-NOMA-BF) communication system, where multiple antenna LEO satellites deliver information to ground non-orthogonal users. To measure the service quality, we formulate a resource allocation problem to minimize the second-order difference between the achievable capacity and user request traffic. Based on the above problem, joint optimization for LEO satellite-cell assignment factor, NOMA power and BF vector is taken into account. The optimization variables are analyzed with respect to feasibility and non-convexity. Additionally, we provide a pair of effective algorithms, i.e., doppler shift LEO satellite-cell assisted monotonic programming of NOMA with BF vector (D-mNOMA-BF) and ant colony pathfinding based NOMA exponential cone programming with BF vector (A-eNOMA-BF). Two compromise algorithms regarding the above are also presented. Numerical results show that: 1) D-mNOMA-BF and A-eNOMA-BF algorithms are superior to that of orthogonal multiple access based BF (OMA-BF) and polarization multiplexing schemes; 2) With the increasing number of antennas and single satellite power, R-NOMA-BF system is able to expand users satisfaction; and 3) By comparing various imperfect successive interference cancellation, the performance of A-mNOMA-BF algorithm exceeds D-mNOMA-BF.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of distributed Kalman filtering algorithm for stochastic regression model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a distributed Kalman filtering (DKF) algorithm is proposed based on a diffusion strategy, which is used to track an unknown signal process in sensor networks cooperatively. Unlike the centralized algorithms, no fusion center is need here, which implies that the DKF algorithm is more robust and scalable. Moreover, the stability of the DKF algorithm is established under non-independent and non-stationary signal conditions. The cooperative information condition used in the paper shows that even if any sensor cannot track the unknown signal individually, the DKF algorithm can be utilized to fulfill the estimation task in a cooperative way. Finally, we illustrate the cooperative property of the DKF algorithm by using a simulation example.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Integer MPC-Based Motion Planning Using Hybrid Zonotopes with Tight Relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicle (AV) motion planning problems often involve non-convex constraints, which present a major barrier to applying model predictive control (MPC) in real time on embedded hardware. This paper presents an approach for efficiently solving mixed-integer MPC motion planning problems using a hybrid zonotope representation of the obstacle-free space. The MPC optimization problem is formulated as a multi-stage mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) using a hybrid zonotope representation of the non-convex constraints. Risk-aware planning is supported by assigning costs to different regions of the obstacle-free space within the MPC cost function. A multi-stage MIQP solver is presented that exploits the structure of the hybrid zonotope constraints. For some hybrid zonotope representations, it is shown that the convex relaxation is tight, i.e., equal to the convex hull. In conjunction with logical constraints derived from the AV motion planning context, this property is leveraged to generate tight quadratic program (QP) sub-problems within a branch-and-bound mixed-integer solver. The hybrid zonotope structure is further leveraged to reduce the number of matrix factorizations that need to be computed within the QP sub-problems. Simulation studies are presented for obstacle-avoidance and risk-aware motion planning problems using polytopic maps and occupancy grids. In most cases, the proposed solver finds the optimal solution an order of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art commercial solver. Processor-in-the-loop studies demonstrate the utility of the solver for real-time implementations on embedded hardware.</description>

      <title>Receding Hamiltonian-Informed Optimal Neural Control and State Estimation for Closed-Loop Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper formalizes Hamiltonian-Informed Optimal Neural (Hion) controllers, a novel class of neural network-based controllers for dynamical systems and explicit non-linear model predictive control. Hion controllers estimate future states and compute optimal control inputs using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. The proposed framework allows for customization of transient behavior, addressing limitations of existing methods. The Taylored Multi-Faceted Approach for Neural ODE and Optimal Control (T-mano) architecture facilitates training and ensures accurate state estimation. Optimal control strategies are demonstrated for both linear and non-linear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Distributed Tracing for Cascading Changes of Objects in the Kubernetes Control Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that employs a declarative configuration management approach. In Kubernetes, each desired and actual state is represented by an ``object'', and multiple controllers autonomously monitor related objects and update their objects towards the desired state in the control plane. Because of this design, changes to one object propagate to other objects in a chain. The cluster operators need to know the time required for these cascading changes to complete, as it directly affects the quality of service of applications running on the cluster. However, there is no practical way to observe this kind of cascading change, including breakdown of the time taken by each change. Distributed tracing techniques are commonly used in the microservices architecture to monitor application performance, but they are not directly applicable to the control plane of Kubernetes; the microservices architecture relies on explicitly calling APIs on other services, but in Kubernetes the controllers just monitor objects to know when to start processing, and never call functions on other controllers directly. In this paper, we propose a system that automatically traces changes to objects in the control plane. Our method adds one identifier, a Change Propagation ID (CPID), to the metadata of an object, and the controller that observes an object change propagates its CPID to the objects that the controller is updated. When multiple changes need to be merged on an object, a new CPID is generated, and the relationship between the original CPID and the new CPID is sent to the external trace server. We confirmed that change propagation can be visualized and the required time measured. We also showed that this system's overhead is not significant.</description>

      <title>Control Node Placement and Structural Controllability of Water Quality Dynamics in Drinking Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chlorine, the most widely used disinfectant, needs to be adequately distributed in water distribution networks (WDNs) to maintain consistent residual levels and ensure water safety. This is performed through control node injections at the treatment plant via booster stations scattered in WDNs. While previous studies have applied various optimization metrics for booster station placement, many have failed to consider the coverage of the station injections and the dynamic nature of WDNs. In particular, variations in hydraulics and demand significantly impact the reachability and efficacy of chlorine injections which then impact optimal placement of booster stations. This study introduces a novel formulation that combines control- and graph-theoretic approaches to solve the booster station placement problem. Unlike traditional methods, our approach emphasizes maximizing the system's ability to control disinfectant levels with minimal energy, taking into account the time-varying hydraulic profiles that lead to different optimal station placements. We propose a simple weighting technique to determine the placements by assessing the structural controllability of each configuration, based on the network's topology and independent of specific parameters like decay rates or pipe roughness. This method ensures effective chlorine coverage across the network. Our approach is validated on different networks, demonstrating its operational effectiveness, scalability, and practicality.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Emission-Aware Online Ride Assignment Algorithm for Peak Demand Hours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ridesharing has experienced significant global growth over the past decade and is becoming integral to future transportation networks. These services offer alternative mobility options in many urban areas, promoting car-light or car-free lifestyles, with their market share rapidly expanding due to the convenience they offer. However, alongside these benefits, concerns have arisen about the environmental impact of ridesharing, particularly its contribution to carbon emissions. A major source of these emissions is deadhead miles that are driven without passengers between trips. This issue is especially pronounced during high-demand periods when the number of ride requests exceeds platform capacity, leading to longer deadhead miles and higher emissions. While reducing these unproductive miles can lower emissions, it may also result in longer wait times for passengers as they wait for a nearby driver, potentially diminishing the overall user experience.
  In this paper, we propose LARA, an online algorithm for rider-to-driver assignment that dynamically adjusts the maximum allowed deadhead miles for drivers and assigns ride requests accordingly. While LARA can be applied under any conditions, it is particularly more effective during high-demand hours, aiming to reduce both carbon emissions and rider wait times. We prove that LARA achieves near-optimal performance in online settings compared to the optimal offline algorithm. Furthermore, we evaluate LARA using both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating up to 34.2% reduction in emissions and up to 42.9% reduction in rider wait times compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. While recent studies have introduced the problem of emission-aware ride assignment, LARA is the first algorithm to provide both theoretical and empirical guarantees on performance.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimizing Inverter Control: Fixed and Adaptive Gain Tuning Strategies for Power System Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents novel methods for tuning inverter controller gains using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). A Simulink-developed inverter model is converted into a dynamic link library (DLL) and integrated with a Python-based RL environment, leveraging the multi-core deployment and accelerated computing to significantly reduce RL training time. A neural network-based mechanism is developed to transform the cascaded PI controller into an actor network, allowing optimized gain tuning by an RL agent to mitigate scenarios such as subsynchronous oscillations (SSO) and initial transients. Two distinct tuning approaches are demonstrated: a fixed gain strategy, where controller gains are represented as RL policy (actor network) weights, and an adaptive gain strategy, where gains are dynamically generated as RL policy (actor network) outputs. A comparative analysis of these methods is provided, showcasing their effectiveness in stabilizing the transient performance of grid-forming and grid-following converters and deployment challenges in hardware. Experimental results are presented, demonstrating the enhanced robustness and practical applicability of the RL-tuned controller gains in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Degradation-Infused Energy Portfolio Allocation Framework: Risk-Averse Fair Storage Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel degradation-infused energy portfolio allocation (DI-EPA) framework for enabling the participation of battery energy storage systems in multi-service electricity markets. The proposed framework attempts to address the challenge of including the rainflow algorithm for cycle counting by directly developing a closed-form of marginal degradation as a function of dispatch decisions. Further, this closed-form degradation profile is embedded into an energy portfolio allocation (EPA) problem designed for making the optimal dispatch decisions for all the batteries together, in a shared economy manner. We term the entity taking these decisions as `facilitator' which works as a link between storage units and market operators. The proposed EPA formulation is quipped with a conditional-value-at-risk (CVaR)-based mechanism to bring risk-averseness against uncertainty in market prices. The proposed DI-EPA problem introduces fairness by dividing the profits into various units using the idea of marginal contribution. Simulation results regarding the accuracy of the closed-form of degradation, effectiveness of CVaR in handling uncertainty within the EPA problem, and fairness in the context of degradation awareness are discussed. Numerical results indicate that the DI-EPA framework improves the net profit of the storage units by considering the effect of degradation in optimal market participation.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Game-Theoretic Control in Socio-Technical Networks: Emerging Design Frameworks and Contemporary Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Socio-technical networks represent emerging cyber-physical infrastructures that are tightly interwoven with human networks. The coupling between human and technical networks presents significant challenges in managing, controlling, and securing these complex, interdependent systems. This paper investigates game-theoretic frameworks for the design and control of socio-technical networks, with a focus on critical applications such as misinformation management, infrastructure optimization, and resilience in socio-cyber-physical systems (SCPS). Core methodologies, including Stackelberg games, mechanism design, and dynamic game theory, are examined as powerful tools for modeling interactions in hierarchical, multi-agent environments. Key challenges addressed include mitigating human-driven vulnerabilities, managing large-scale system dynamics, and countering adversarial threats. By bridging individual agent behaviors with overarching system goals, this work illustrates how the integration of game theory and control theory can lead to robust, resilient, and adaptive socio-technical networks. This paper highlights the potential of these frameworks to dynamically align decentralized agent actions with system-wide objectives of stability, security, and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Decoupled Information Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information metasurface is a type of metasurface device capable of rapidly altering its EM characteristics to generate specific information. Past research presents various strategies for embedding information into ambient EM waves through the superposition of each unit's quantified properties. Despite their capabilities, these approaches alone are insufficient for independently managing the creation of information and the allocation of spatial energy. Here, we propose a general theory of space-time decoupled metasurface (STD-Metasurface) to obtain the completely independent manipulation of information generating and spatial filtering. As proof-of-concept demonstration, we design a single-diode small-signal-modulation based prototype, capable of generating precise arbitrary waveforms while maintaining unaltered beam patterns. We exhibit how the superiority of the STD-Metasurface enhance its practicality and facilitate its application as a reconfigurable backscatter transmitter and an dynamic Doppler-spoofing reflection tag.</description>

      <title>Backstepping Design for Incremental Input-to-State Stabilization of Unknown Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incremental stability of dynamical systems ensures the convergence of trajectories from different initial conditions towards each other rather than a fixed trajectory or equilibrium point. Here, we introduce and characterize a novel class of incremental Lyapunov functions, an incremental stability notion known as Incremental Input-to-State practical Stability ({\delta}-ISpS). Using Gaussian Process, we learn the unknown dynamics of a class of control systems. We then present a backstepping control design scheme that provides state-feedback controllers that render the partially unknown control system {\delta}-ISpS. To show the effectiveness of the proposed controller, we implement it in two case studies.</description>

      <title>Frequency-based Design Method for Model-Free Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-Free Control (MFC) has been applied to a wide variety of systems in which it has shown its performance. MFC offers "model-free operation", but the controller design requires some information from the nominal plant. This paper introduces a new design method for model-free controllers that uses minimal data about the system and retrieves a set of stable controller configurations. This method is specifically developed for first-order model-free controllers, but can be extended to second-order controllers, and it relies in a frequency analysis of the controller and the plant. The main feature of the design method is decoupling the design of the main control parameter alpha from the rest, providing specific values for it. The efficacy of the proposed method will be showcased with some relevant application examples.</description>

      <title>Preemptive Holistic Collaborative System and Its Application in Road Transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous real-world systems, including manufacturing processes, supply chains, and robotic systems, involve multiple independent entities with diverse objectives. The potential for conflicts arises from the inability of these entities to accurately predict and anticipate each other's actions. To address this challenge, we propose the Preemptive Holistic Collaborative System (PHCS) framework. By enabling information sharing and collaborative planning among independent entities, the PHCS facilitates the preemptive resolution of potential conflicts. We apply the PHCS framework to the specific context of road transportation, resulting in the Preemptive Holistic Collaborative Road Transportation System (PHCRTS). This system leverages shared driving intentions and pre-planned trajectories to optimize traffic flow and enhance safety. Simulation experiments in a two-lane merging scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of PHCRTS, reducing vehicle time delays by 90%, increasing traffic capacity by 300%, and eliminating accidents. The PHCS framework offers a promising approach to optimize the performance and safety of complex systems with multiple independent entities.</description>

      <title>Kernel-based predictive control allocation for a class of thrust vectoring systems with singular points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a class of thrust vectoring systems, which are nonlinear, overactuated, and time-invariant. We assume that the system is composed of two subsystems and there exist singular points around which the linearized system is uncontrollable. Furthermore, we assume that the system is stabilizable through a two-level control allocation. In this particular setting, we cannot do much with the linearized system, and a direct nonlinear control approach must be used to analyze the system stability. Under adequate assumptions and a suitable nonlinear continuous control-allocation law, we can prove uniform asymptotic convergence of the points of equilibrium using Lyapunov input-to-state stability and the small gain theorem. This control allocation, however, requires the design of an allocated mapping and introduces two exogenous inputs. In particular, the closed-loop system is cascaded, and the output of one subsystem is the disturbance of the other, and vice versa. In general, it is difficult to find a closed-form solution for the allocated mapping; it needs to satisfy restrictive conditions, among which Lipschitz continuity to ensure that the disturbances eventually vanish. Additionally, this mapping is in general nontrivial and non-unique. In this paper, we propose a new kernel-based predictive control allocation to substitute the need for designing an analytic mapping, and assess if it can produce a meaningful mapping ``on-the-fly" by solving online an optimization problem. The simulations include three examples, which are the manipulation of an object through an unmanned aerial vehicle in two and three dimensions, and the control of a surface vessel actuated by two azimuthal thrusters.</description>

      <title>Bidding and Dispatch Strategies with Flexibility Quantification and Pricing for Electric Vehicle Aggregator in Joint Energy-Regulation Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Managing and unlocking the flexibility hidden in electric vehicles (EVs) has emerged as a critical yet challenging task towards low-carbon power and energy systems. This paper focuses on the online bidding and dispatch strategies for an EV aggregator (EVA) in a joint energy-regulation market, considering EVs' flexibility contributions and compensations. A method for quantifying EV flexibility as a tradable commodity is proposed, allowing the EVA to set flexibility prices based on bid-in supply curves. An EVA bidding model in the joint market incorporate flexibility procurement is formulated. The stochastic model predictive control technique is employed to solve the bidding problem online and address the uncertainties from the electricity markets and the EVs. A power dispatch protocol that ensures a profitable and feasible allocation based on EV flexibility contribution is proposed. An affine mapping control strategy can be derived based on parametric linear programming, enables online indexing of optimal solutions given the regulation signals to avoid repeatedly solving the problem. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, and the solution methodology can be applied in real-time.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Tensors for Multi-Dimensional Markov Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a low-rank tensor model for multi-dimensional Markov chains. A common approach to simplify the dynamical behavior of a Markov chain is to impose low-rankness on the transition probability matrix. Inspired by the success of these matrix techniques, we present low-rank tensors for representing transition probabilities on multi-dimensional state spaces. Through tensor decomposition, we provide a connection between our method and classical probabilistic models. Moreover, our proposed model yields a parsimonious representation with fewer parameters than matrix-based approaches. Unlike these methods, which impose low-rankness uniformly across all states, our tensor method accounts for the multi-dimensionality of the state space. We also propose an optimization-based approach to estimate a Markov model as a low-rank tensor. Our optimization problem can be solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which enjoys convergence to a stationary solution. We empirically demonstrate that our tensor model estimates Markov chains more efficiently than conventional techniques, requiring both fewer samples and parameters. We perform numerical simulations for both a synthetic low-rank Markov chain and a real-world example with New York City taxi data, showcasing the advantages of multi-dimensionality for modeling state spaces.</description>

      <title>AI-Ready Energy Modelling for Next Generation RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent sustainability drives place energy-consumption metrics in centre-stage for the design of future radio access networks (RAN). At the same time, optimising the trade-off between performance and system energy usage by machine-learning (ML) is an approach that requires large amounts of granular RAN data to train models, and to adapt in near realtime. In this paper, we present extensions to the system-level discrete-event AIMM (AI-enabled Massive MIMO) Simulator, generating realistic figures for throughput and energy efficiency (EE) towards digital twin network modelling. We further investigate the trade-off between maximising either EE or spectrum efficiency (SE). To this end, we have run extensive simulations of a typical macrocell network deployment under various transmit power-reduction scenarios with a range of difference of 43 dBm. Our results demonstrate that the EE and SE objectives often require different power settings in different scenarios. Importantly, low mean user CPU execution times of 2.17 $\pm$ 0.05 seconds (2~s.d.) demonstrate that the AIMM Simulator is a powerful tool for quick prototyping of scalable system models which can interface with ML frameworks, and thus support future research in energy-efficient next generation networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Consensus ADMM-based modeling and solving approach for the stochastic ACOPF. The proposed optimization model considers the load forecasting uncertainty and its induced load-shedding cost via Monte Carlo sampling. The sampled scenarios are reduced using a clustering method combined with simultaneous backward reduction techniques to reduce the computational complexity. The proposed approach is tested on two IEEE systems, achieving about 2% cost reduction and more than 15 times lower reliability index in stochastic load settings compared to the baseline approach.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sensing of Momentum Kicks with a Feedback-Controlled Nanomechanical Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: External disturbances exciting a mechanical resonator can be exploited to gain information on the environment. Many of these interactions manifest as momentum kicks, such as the recoil of residual gas, radioactive decay, or even hypothetical interactions with dark matter. These disturbances are often rare enough that they can be resolved as singular events rather than cumulated as force noise. While high-Q resonators with low masses are particularly sensitive to such momentum kicks, they will strongly excite the resonator, leading to nonlinear effects that deteriorate the sensing performance. Hence, this paper utilizes optimal estimation methods to extract individual momentum kicks from measured stochastic trajectories of a mechanical resonator kept in the linear regime through feedback control. The developed scheme is illustrated and tested experimentally using a pre-stressed SiN trampoline resonator. Apart from enhancing a wide range of sensing scenarios mentioned above, our results indicate the feasibility of novel single-molecule mass spectrometry approaches.</description>

      <title>Advancing Cyber-Attack Detection in Power Systems: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning and Graph Neural Network Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the detection and localization of cyber-attacks on time-series measurements data in power systems, focusing on comparing conventional machine learning (ML) like k-means, deep learning method like autoencoder, and graph neural network (GNN)-based techniques. We assess the detection accuracy of these approaches and their potential to pinpoint the locations of specific sensor measurements under attack. Given the demonstrated success of GNNs in other time-series anomaly detection applications, we aim to evaluate their performance within the context of power systems cyber-attacks on sensor measurements. Utilizing the IEEE 68-bus system, we simulated four types of false data attacks, including scaling attacks, additive attacks, and their combinations, to test the selected approaches. Our results indicate that GNN-based methods outperform k-means and autoencoder in detection. Additionally, GNNs show promise in accurately localizing attacks for simple scenarios, although they still face challenges in more complex cases, especially ones that involve combinations of scaling and additive attacks.</description>

      <title>MESS+: Energy-Optimal Inferencing in Language Model Zoos with Service Level Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-weight large language model (LLM) zoos allow users to quickly integrate state-of-the-art models into systems. Despite increasing availability, selecting the most appropriate model for a given task still largely relies on public benchmark leaderboards and educated guesses. This can be unsatisfactory for both inference service providers and end users, where the providers usually prioritize cost efficiency, while the end users usually prioritize model output quality for their inference requests. In commercial settings, these two priorities are often brought together in Service Level Agreements (SLA). We present MESS+, an online stochastic optimization algorithm for energy-optimal model selection from a model zoo, which works on a per-inference-request basis. For a given SLA that requires high accuracy, we are up to 2.5x more energy efficient with MESS+ than with randomly selecting an LLM from the zoo while maintaining SLA quality constraints.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Model-Based Step Adaptation for Push Recovery through Reinforcement Learning of Step Timing and Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to enhance the robustness of humanoid walking under strong perturbations, such as substantial pushes. Effective recovery from external disturbances requires bipedal robots to dynamically adjust their stepping strategies, including footstep positions and timing. Unlike most advanced walking controllers that restrict footstep locations to a predefined convex region, substantially limiting recoverable disturbances, our method leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust the permissible footstep region, expanding it to a larger, effectively non-convex area and allowing cross-over stepping, which is crucial for counteracting large lateral pushes. Additionally, our method adapts footstep timing in real time to further extend the range of recoverable disturbances. Based on these adjustments, feasible footstep positions and DCM trajectory are planned by solving a QP. Finally, we employ a DCM controller and an inverse dynamics whole-body control framework to ensure the robot effectively follows the trajectory.</description>

      <title>Interacting Large Language Model Agents. Interpretable Models and Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops theory and algorithms for interacting large language model agents (LLMAs) using methods from statistical signal processing and microeconomics. While both fields are mature, their application to decision-making by interacting LLMAs remains unexplored. Motivated by Bayesian sentiment analysis on online platforms, we construct interpretable models and stochastic control algorithms that enable LLMAs to interact and perform Bayesian inference. Because interacting LLMAs learn from prior decisions and external inputs, they exhibit bias and herding behavior. Thus, developing interpretable models and stochastic control algorithms is essential to understand and mitigate these behaviors. This paper has three main results. First, we show using Bayesian revealed preferences from microeconomics that an individual LLMA satisfies the sufficient conditions for rationally inattentive (bounded rationality) utility maximization and, given an observation, the LLMA chooses an action that maximizes a regularized utility. Second, we utilize Bayesian social learning to construct interpretable models for LLMAs that interact sequentially with each other and the environment while performing Bayesian inference. Our models capture the herding behavior exhibited by interacting LLMAs. Third, we propose a stochastic control framework to delay herding and improve state estimation accuracy under two settings: (a) centrally controlled LLMAs and (b) autonomous LLMAs with incentives. Throughout the paper, we demonstrate the efficacy of our methods on real datasets for hate speech classification and product quality assessment, using open-source models like Mistral and closed-source models like ChatGPT. The main takeaway of this paper, based on substantial empirical analysis and mathematical formalism, is that LLMAs act as rationally bounded Bayesian agents that exhibit social learning when interacting.</description>

      <title>Control Strategies for Pursuit-Evasion Under Occlusion Using Visibility and Safety Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a control strategy for pursuit-evasion problems in environments with occlusions. We address the challenge of a mobile pursuer keeping a mobile evader within its field of view (FoV) despite line-of-sight obstructions. The signed distance function (SDF) of the FoV is used to formulate visibility as a control barrier function (CBF) constraint on the pursuer's control inputs. Similarly, obstacle avoidance is formulated as a CBF constraint based on the SDF of the obstacle set. While the visibility and safety CBFs are Lipschitz continuous, they are not differentiable everywhere, necessitating the use of generalized gradients. To achieve non-myopic pursuit, we generate reference control trajectories leading to evader visibility using a sampling-based kinodynamic planner. The pursuer then tracks this reference via convex optimization under the CBF constraints. We validate our approach in CARLA simulations and real-world robot experiments, demonstrating successful visibility maintenance using only onboard sensing, even under severe occlusions and dynamic evader movements.</description>

      <title>Signer-Optimal Multiple-Time Post-Quantum Hash-Based Signature for Heterogeneous IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoTs) harboring resource-limited devices like wearable sensors are essential for next-generation networks. Ensuring the authentication and integrity of security-sensitive telemetry in these applications is vital. Digital signatures provide scalable authentication with non-repudiation and public verifiability, making them essential tools for IoTs. However, emerging quantum computers necessitate post-quantum (PQ) secure solutions, yet existing NIST-PQC standards are costlier than their conventional counterparts and unsuitable for resource-limited IoTs. There is a significant need for lightweight PQ-secure digital signatures that respect the resource constraints of low-end IoTs.
  We propose a new multiple-time hash-based signature called Maximum Utilization Multiple HORS (MUM-HORS) that offers PQ security, short signatures, fast signing, and high key utilization for an extended lifespan. MUM-HORS addresses the inefficiency and key loss issues of HORS in offline/online settings by introducing compact key management data structures and optimized resistance to weak-message attacks. We tested MUM-HORS on two embedded platforms (ARM Cortex A-72 and 8-bit AVR ATmega2560) and commodity hardware. Our experiments confirm up to 40x better utilization with the same signing capacity (2^20 messages, 128-bit security) compared to multiple-time HORS while achieving 2x and 156-2463x faster signing than conventional-secure and NIST PQ-secure schemes, respectively, on an ARM Cortex. These features make MUM-HORS ideal multiple-time PQ-secure signature for heterogeneous IoTs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charging station availability is crucial for a thriving electric vehicle market. Due to budget constraints, locating these stations usually proceeds in phases, which calls for careful consideration of the (random) charging demand growth throughout the planning horizon. This paper integrates user choice behavior into two-stage and multi-stage stochastic programming models for intracity charging station planning under demand uncertainty. We derive a second-order conic representation for the nonlinear, nonconvex formulation by taking advantage of the binary nature of location variables and propose subgradient inequalities to accelerate computation. Numerical results demonstrate the value of employing multi-stage models, particularly in scenarios of high demand fluctuations, increased demand dispersion, and high user sensitivity to the distance-to-recharge.</description>

      <title>Learning Hidden Subgoals under Temporal Ordering Constraints in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world applications, the success of completing a task is often determined by multiple key steps which are distant in time steps and have to be achieved in a fixed time order. For example, the key steps listed on the cooking recipe should be achieved one-by-one in the right time order. These key steps can be regarded as subgoals of the task and their time orderings are described as temporal ordering constraints. However, in many real-world problems, subgoals or key states are often hidden in the state space and their temporal ordering constraints are also unknown, which make it challenging for previous RL algorithms to solve this kind of tasks. In order to address this issue, in this work we propose a novel RL algorithm for {\bf l}earning hidden {\bf s}ubgoals under {\bf t}emporal {\bf o}rdering {\bf c}onstraints (LSTOC). We propose a new contrastive learning objective which can effectively learn hidden subgoals (key states) and their temporal orderings at the same time, based on first-occupancy representation and temporal geometric sampling. In addition, we propose a sample-efficient learning strategy to discover subgoals one-by-one following their temporal order constraints by building a subgoal tree to represent discovered subgoals and their temporal ordering relationships. Specifically, this tree can be used to improve the sample efficiency of trajectory collection, fasten the task solving and generalize to unseen tasks. The LSTOC framework is evaluated on several environments with image-based observations, showing its significant improvement over baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Resource Allocation with Trust-aided Parametric Information Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reference information plays an essential role for making decisions under uncertainty, yet may vary across multiple data sources. In this paper, we study resource allocation in stochastic dynamic environments, where we perform information fusion based on trust of different data sources, to design an ambiguity set for attaining distributionally robust resource allocation solutions. We dynamically update the trust parameter to simulate the decision maker's trust change based on losses caused by mis-specified reference information. We show an equivalent tractable linear programming reformulation of the distributionally robust optimization model and demonstrate the performance in a wildfire suppression application, where we use drone and satellite data to estimate the needs of resources in different regions. We demonstrate how our methods can improve trust and decision accuracy. The computational time grows linearly in the number of data sources and problem sizes.</description>

      <title>Linear Quadratic Mean Field Games with Quantile-Dependent Cost Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a class of linear quadratic mean field games where the coefficients of quadratic cost functions depend on both the mean and the variance of the population's state distribution through its quantile function. Such a formulation allows for modelling agents that are sensitive to not only the population average but also the population variance. The corresponding mean field game equilibrium is identified, which involves solving two coupled differential equations: one is a Riccati equation and the other the variance evolution equation. Furthermore, the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the mean field equilibrium are established. Finally, numerical results are presented to illustrate the behavior of two coupled differential equations and the performance of the mean field game solution.</description>

      <title>An online optimization algorithm for tracking a linearly varying optimal point with zero steady-state error</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an online optimization algorithm for solving a class of nonconvex optimization problems with a linearly varying optimal point. The global convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed using the circle criterion for the class of functions whose gradient is bounded within a sector. Also, we show that the corresponding Lur\'e-type nonlinear system involves a double integrator, which demonstrates its ability to track a linearly varying optimal point with zero steady-state error. The algorithm is applied to solving a time-of-arrival based localization problem with constant velocity and the results show that the algorithm is able to estimate the source location with zero steady-state error.</description>

      <title>Risk-sensitive control as inference with R\'enyi divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the risk-sensitive control as inference (RCaI) that extends CaI by using R\'{e}nyi divergence variational inference. RCaI is shown to be equivalent to log-probability regularized risk-sensitive control, which is an extension of the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) control. We also prove that the risk-sensitive optimal policy can be obtained by solving a soft Bellman equation, which reveals several equivalences between RCaI, MaxEnt control, the optimal posterior for CaI, and linearly-solvable control. Moreover, based on RCaI, we derive the risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) methods: the policy gradient and the soft actor-critic. As the risk-sensitivity parameter vanishes, we recover the risk-neutral CaI and RL, which means that RCaI is a unifying framework. Furthermore, we give another risk-sensitive generalization of the MaxEnt control using R\'{e}nyi entropy regularization. We show that in both of our extensions, the optimal policies have the same structure even though the derivations are very different.</description>

      <title>Real-time and Downtime-tolerant Fault Diagnosis for Railway Turnout Machines (RTMs) Empowered with Cloud-Edge Pipeline Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Railway Turnout Machines (RTMs) are mission-critical components of the railway transportation infrastructure, responsible for directing trains onto desired tracks. For safety assurance applications, especially in early-warning scenarios, RTM faults are expected to be detected as early as possible on a continuous 7x24 basis. However, limited emphasis has been placed on distributed model inference frameworks that can meet the inference latency and reliability requirements of such mission critical fault diagnosis systems. In this paper, an edge-cloud collaborative early-warning system is proposed to enable real-time and downtime-tolerant fault diagnosis of RTMs, providing a new paradigm for the deployment of models in safety-critical scenarios. Firstly, a modular fault diagnosis model is designed specifically for distributed deployment, which utilizes a hierarchical architecture consisting of the prior knowledge module, subordinate classifiers, and a fusion layer for enhanced accuracy and parallelism. Then, a cloud-edge collaborative framework leveraging pipeline parallelism, namely CEC-PA, is developed to minimize the overhead resulting from distributed task execution and context exchange by strategically partitioning and offloading model components across cloud and edge. Additionally, an election consensus mechanism is implemented within CEC-PA to ensure system robustness during coordinator node downtime. Comparative experiments and ablation studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed fault diagnosis approach. Our ensemble-based fault diagnosis model achieves a remarkable 97.4% accuracy on a real-world dataset collected by Nanjing Metro in Jiangsu Province, China. Meanwhile, CEC-PA demonstrates superior recovery proficiency during node disruptions and speed-up ranging from 1.98x to 7.93x in total inference time compared to its counterparts.</description>

      <title>Learning Multiple Initial Solutions to Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequentially solving similar optimization problems under strict runtime constraints is essential for many applications, such as robot control, autonomous driving, and portfolio management. The performance of local optimization methods in these settings is sensitive to the initial solution: poor initialization can lead to slow convergence or suboptimal solutions. To address this challenge, we propose learning to predict \emph{multiple} diverse initial solutions given parameters that define the problem instance. We introduce two strategies for utilizing multiple initial solutions: (i) a single-optimizer approach, where the most promising initial solution is chosen using a selection function, and (ii) a multiple-optimizers approach, where several optimizers, potentially run in parallel, are each initialized with a different solution, with the best solution chosen afterward. We validate our method on three optimal control benchmark tasks: cart-pole, reacher, and autonomous driving, using different optimizers: DDP, MPPI, and iLQR. We find significant and consistent improvement with our method across all evaluation settings and demonstrate that it efficiently scales with the number of initial solutions required.

      <title>Limiting Kinetic Energy through Control Barrier Functions: Analysis and Experimental Validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of safety-critical control, we propose and analyse the use of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to limit the kinetic energy of torque-controlled robots. The proposed scheme is able to modify a nominal control action in a minimally invasive manner to achieve the desired kinetic energy limit. We show how this safety condition is achieved by appropriately injecting damping in the underlying robot dynamics independently of the nominal controller structure. We present an extensive experimental validation of the approach on a 7-Degree of Freedom (DoF) Franka Emika Panda robot. The results demonstrate that this approach provides an effective, minimally invasive safety layer that is straightforward to implement and is robust in real experiments.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Coverage Planning for Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a distributed control law for a heterogeneous multi-robot coverage problem, where the robots could have different energy characteristics, such as capacity and depletion rates, due to their varying sizes, speeds, capabilities, and payloads. Existing energy-aware coverage control laws consider capacity differences but assume the battery depletion rate to be the same for all robots. In realistic scenarios, however, some robots can consume energy much faster than other robots; for instance, UAVs hover at different altitudes, and these changes could be dynamically updated based on their assigned tasks. Robots' energy capacities and depletion rates need to be considered to maximize the performance of a multi-robot system. To this end, we propose a new energy-aware controller based on Lloyd's algorithm to adapt the weights of the robots based on their energy dynamics and divide the area of interest among the robots accordingly. The controller is theoretically analyzed and extensively evaluated through simulations and real-world demonstrations in multiple realistic scenarios and compared with three baseline control laws to validate its performance and efficacy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a data-driven strategy for minimizing/maximizing black-box functions based on probabilistic surrogate models. In the presence of safety constraints, the performance of BO crucially relies on tight probabilistic error bounds related to the uncertainty surrounding the surrogate model. For the case of Gaussian Process surrogates and Gaussian measurement noise, we present a novel error bound based on the recently proposed Wiener kernel regression. We prove that under rather mild assumptions, the proposed error bound is tighter than bounds previously documented in the literature which leads to enlarged safety regions. We draw upon a numerical example to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed error bound in safe BO.</description>

      <title>ControlSynth Neural ODEs: Modeling Dynamical Systems with Guaranteed Convergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural ODEs (NODEs) are continuous-time neural networks (NNs) that can process data without the limitation of time intervals. They have advantages in learning and understanding the evolution of complex real dynamics. Many previous works have focused on NODEs in concise forms, while numerous physical systems taking straightforward forms, in fact, belong to their more complex quasi-classes, thus appealing to a class of general NODEs with high scalability and flexibility to model those systems. This, however, may result in intricate nonlinear properties. In this paper, we introduce ControlSynth Neural ODEs (CSODEs). We show that despite their highly nonlinear nature, convergence can be guaranteed via tractable linear inequalities. In the composition of CSODEs, we introduce an extra control term for learning the potential simultaneous capture of dynamics at different scales, which could be particularly useful for partial differential equation-formulated systems. Finally, we compare several representative NNs with CSODEs on important physical dynamics under the inductive biases of CSODEs, and illustrate that CSODEs have better learning and predictive abilities in these settings.</description>

      <title>Kilovolt Pyroelectric Voltage Generation and Electrostatic Actuation With Fluidic Heating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated micro power generators are crucial components for micro robotic platforms to demonstrate untethered operation and to achieve autonomy. Current micro robotic electrostatic actuators typically require hundreds to thousands of voltages to output sufficient work. Pyroelectricity is one such source of high voltages that can be scaled to small form factors. This paper demonstrates a distributed pyroelectric high voltage generation mechanism to power kV actuators using alternating exposure of crystals to hot and cold water (300C to 900C water temperature). Using this fluidic temperature control, a pyroelectrically generated voltage of 2470 V was delivered to a 2 pF storage capacitor yielding a 6.10 {\mu}J stored energy. A maximum energy of 17.46 {\mu}J was delivered to a 47 pF capacitor at 861 V. The recirculating water can be used to heat a distributed array of converters to generate electricity in distant robotic actuator sections. The development of this distributed system would enable untethered micro-robot to be operated with a flexible body and free of battery recharging, which advances its applications in the real world.</description>

      <title>Discrete the solving model of time-variant standard Sylvester-conjugate matrix equations using Euler-forward formula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-variant standard Sylvester-conjugate matrix equations are presented as early time-variant versions of the complex conjugate matrix equations. Current solving methods include Con-CZND1 and Con-CZND2 models, both of which use ode45 for continuous model. Given practical computational considerations, discrete these models is also important. Based on Euler-forward formula discretion, Con-DZND1-2i model and Con-DZND2-2i model are proposed. Numerical experiments using step sizes of 0.1 and 0.001. The above experiments show that Con-DZND1-2i model and Con-DZND2-2i model exhibit different neural dynamics compared to their continuous counterparts, such as trajectory correction in Con-DZND2-2i model and the swallowing phenomenon in Con-DZND1-2i model, with convergence affected by step size. These experiments highlight the differences between optimizing sampling discretion errors and space compressive approximation errors in neural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Safe Feedback Motion Planning in Unknown Environments: An Instantaneous Local Control Barrier Function Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.05341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile robots are desired with resilience to safely interact with prior-unknown environments and finally accomplish given tasks. This paper utilizes instantaneous local sensory data to stimulate the safe feedback motion planning (SFMP) strategy with adaptability to diverse prior-unknown environments without building a global map. This is achieved by the numerical optimization with the constraints, referred to as instantaneous local control barrier functions (IL-CBFs) and goal-driven control Lyapunov functions (GD-CLFs), learned from perceptional signals. In particular, the IL-CBFs reflecting potential collisions and GD-CLFs encoding incrementally discovered subgoals are first online learned from local perceptual data. Then, the learned IL-CBFs are united with GD-CLFs in the context of quadratic programming (QP) to generate the safe feedback motion planning strategy. Rather importantly, an optimization over the admissible control space of IL-CBFs is conducted to enhance the solution feasibility of QP. The SFMP strategy is developed with theoretically guaranteed collision avoidance and convergence to destinations. Numerical simulations are conducted to reveal the effectiveness of the proposed SFMP strategy that drives mobile robots to safely reach the destination incrementally in diverse prior-unknown environments.</description>

      <title>On Neural Network Identification for Low-Speed Ship Maneuvering Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several studies on ship maneuvering models have been conducted using captive model tests or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and physical models, such as the maneuvering modeling group (MMG) model. A new system identification method for generating a low-speed maneuvering model using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and free running model tests is proposed in this study. We especially focus on a low-speed maneuver such as the final phase in berthing to achieve automatic berthing control. Accurate dynamic modeling with minimum modeling error is highly desired to establish a model-based control system. We propose a new loss function that reduces the effect of the noise included in the training data. Besides, we revealed the following facts - an RNN that ignores the memory before a certain time improved the prediction accuracy compared with the "standard" RNN, and the random maneuver test was effective in obtaining an accurate berthing maneuver model. In addition, several low-speed free running model tests were performed for the scale model of the M.V. Esso Osaka. As a result, this paper showed that the proposed method using a neural network model could accurately represent low-speed maneuvering motions.</description>

      <title>Collision probability reduction method for tracking control in automatic docking / berthing using reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06415v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automation of berthing maneuvers in shipping is a pressing issue as the berthing maneuver is one of the most stressful tasks seafarers undertake. Berthing control problems are often tackled via tracking a predefined trajectory or path. Maintaining a tracking error of zero under an uncertain environment is impossible; the tracking controller is nonetheless required to bring vessels close to desired berths. The tracking controller must prioritize the avoidance of tracking errors that may cause collisions with obstacles. This paper proposes a training method based on reinforcement learning for a trajectory tracking controller that reduces the probability of collisions with static obstacles. Via numerical simulations, we show that the proposed method reduces the probability of collisions during berthing maneuvers. Furthermore, this paper shows the tracking performance in a model experiment.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cyber-Resilience in Integrated Energy System Scheduling with Demand Response Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimally scheduling multi-energy flow is an effective method to utilize renewable energy sources (RES) and improve the stability and economy of integrated energy systems (IES). However, the stable demand-supply of IES faces challenges from uncertainties that arise from RES and loads, as well as the increasing impact of cyber-attacks with advanced information and communication technologies adoption. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative model-free resilience scheduling method based on state-adversarial deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for integrated demand response (IDR)-enabled IES. The proposed method designs an IDR program to explore the interaction ability of electricity-gas-heat flexible loads. Additionally, the state-adversarial Markov decision process (SA-MDP) model characterizes the energy scheduling problem of IES under cyber-attack, incorporating cyber-attacks as adversaries directly into the scheduling process. The state-adversarial soft actor-critic (SA-SAC) algorithm is proposed to mitigate the impact of cyber-attacks on the scheduling strategy, integrating adversarial training into the learning process to against cyber-attacks. Simulation results demonstrate that our method is capable of adequately addressing the uncertainties resulting from RES and loads, mitigating the impact of cyber-attacks on the scheduling strategy, and ensuring a stable demand supply for various energy sources. Moreover, the proposed method demonstrates resilience against cyber-attacks. Compared to the original soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, it achieves a 10% improvement in economic performance under cyber-attack scenarios.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a new denial-of-service (DoS) estimator, enabling defenders to identify duration and frequency parameters of any DoS attacker, except for three edge cases, exclusively using real-time data. The key advantage of the estimator lies in its capability to facilitate security control in a wide range of practical scenarios, even when the attacker's information is previously unknown. We demonstrate the advantage and application of our new estimator in the context of two classical control scenarios, namely consensus of multi-agent systems and impulsive stabilization of nonlinear systems, for illustration.</description>

      <title>On Metzler positive systems on hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In graph-theoretical terms, an edge in a graph connects two vertices while a hyperedge of a hypergraph connects any more than one vertices. If the hypergraph's hyperedges further connect the same number of vertices, it is said to be uniform. In algebraic graph theory, a graph can be characterized by an adjacency matrix, and similarly, a uniform hypergraph can be characterized by an adjacency tensor. This similarity enables us to extend existing tools of matrix analysis for studying dynamical systems evolving on graphs to the study of a class of polynomial dynamical systems evolving on hypergraphs utilizing the properties of tensors. To be more precise, in this paper, we first extend the concept of a Metzler matrix to a Metzler tensor and then describe some useful properties of such tensors. Next, we focus on positive systems on hypergraphs associated with Metzler tensors. More importantly, we design control laws to stabilize the origin of this class of Metzler positive systems on hypergraphs. In the end, we apply our findings to two classic dynamical systems: a higher-order Lotka-Volterra population dynamics system and a higher-order SIS epidemic dynamic process. The corresponding novel stability results are accompanied by ample numerical examples.</description>

The paper [13] discussed two frameworks for multitarget trajectory representation--labeled random finite set (LRFS) and set of trajectories (SoT)--and the merging of SoT and PMBM into trajectory PMBM (TPMBM) theory. This paper summarizes and augments the main findings of [12], [13]--specifcally, why SoT, PMBM, and TPMBM are physically and mathematically erroneous.</description>

      <title>A Holistic Power Optimization Approach for Microgrid Control Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global energy landscape is undergoing a transformation towards decarbonization, sustainability, and cost-efficiency. In this transition, microgrid systems integrated with renewable energy sources (RES) and energy storage systems (ESS) have emerged as a crucial component. However, optimizing the operational control of such an integrated energy system lacks a holistic view of multiple environmental, infrastructural and economic considerations, not to mention the need to factor in the uncertainties from both the supply and demand. This paper presents a holistic datadriven power optimization approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for microgrid control considering the multiple needs of decarbonization, sustainability and cost-efficiency. First, two data-driven control schemes, namely the prediction-based (PB) and prediction-free (PF) schemes, are devised to formulate the control problem within a Markov decision process (MDP). Second, a multivariate objective (reward) function is designed to account for the market profits, carbon emissions, peak load, and battery degradation of the microgrid system. Third, we develop a Double Dueling Deep Q Network (D3QN) architecture to optimize the power flows for real-time energy management and determine charging/discharging strategies of ESS. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach through a comparative analysis. The results and analysis also suggest the respective circumstances for using the two control schemes in practical implementations with uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Bounding Stochastic Safety: Leveraging Freedman's Inequality with Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05745v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When deployed in the real world, safe control methods must be robust to unstructured uncertainties such as modeling error and external disturbances. Typical robust safety methods achieve their guarantees by always assuming that the worst-case disturbance will occur. In contrast, this paper utilizes Freedman's inequality in the context of discrete-time control barrier functions (DTCBFs) and c-martingales to provide stronger (less conservative) safety guarantees for stochastic systems. Our approach accounts for the underlying disturbance distribution instead of relying exclusively on its worst-case bound and does not require the barrier function to be upper-bounded, which makes the resulting safety probability bounds more directly useful for intuitive safety constraints such as signed distance. We compare our results with existing safety guarantees, such as input-to-state safety (ISSf) and martingale results that rely on Ville's inequality. When the assumptions for all methods hold, we provide a range of parameters for which our guarantee is stronger. Finally, we present simulation examples, including a bipedal walking robot, that demonstrate the utility and tightness of our safety guarantee.</description>

      <title>Optimal estimation in spatially distributed systems: how far to share measurements from?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the centralized optimal estimation problem in spatially distributed systems. We use the setting of spatially invariant systems as an idealization for which concrete and detailed results are given. Such estimators are known to have a degree of spatial localization in the sense that the estimator gains decay in space, with the spatial decay rates serving as a proxy for how far measurements need to be shared in an optimal distributed estimator. In particular, we examine the dependence of spatial decay rates on problem specifications such as system dynamics, measurement and process noise variances, as well as their spatial autocorrelations. We propose non-dimensional parameters that characterize the decay rates as a function of problem specifications. In particular, we find an interesting matching condition between the characteristic lengthscale of the dynamics and the measurement noise correlation lengthscale for which the optimal centralized estimator is completely decentralized. A new technique - termed the Branch Point Locus - is introduced to quantify spatial decay rates in terms of analyticity regions in the complex spatial frequency plane. Our results are illustrated through two case studies of systems with dynamics modeled by diffusion and the Swift-Hohenberg equation, respectively.</description>

      <title>Piecewise constant tuning gain based singularity-free MRAC with application to aircraft control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative singularity-free output feedback model reference adaptive control (MRAC) method applicable to a wide range of continuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with general relative degrees. Unlike existing solutions such as Nussbaum and multiple-model-based methods, which manage unknown high-frequency gains through persistent switching and repeated parameter estimation, the proposed method circumvents these issues without prior knowledge of the high-frequency gain or additional design conditions. The key innovation of this method lies in transforming the estimation error equation into a linear regression form via a modified MRAC law with a piecewise constant tuning gain developed in this work. This represents a significant departure from existing MRAC systems, where the estimation error equation is typically in a bilinear regression form. The linear regression form facilitates the direct estimation of all unknown parameters, thereby simplifying the adaptive control process. The proposed method preserves closed-loop stability and ensures asymptotic output tracking, overcoming some of the limitations associated with existing methods like Nussbaum and multiple-model based methods. The practical efficacy of the developed MRAC method is demonstrated through detailed simulation results within an aircraft control system scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a safety-critical controller for the problem of stabilization for force-controlled nonholonomic mobile robots. The proposed control law is based on the constructions of control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) and control barrier functions (CBFs) for cascaded systems. To address nonholonomicity, we design the nominal controller that guarantees global asymptotic stability and local exponential stability for the closed-loop system in polar coordinates and construct a strict Lyapunov function valid on any compact sets. Furthermore, we present a procedure for constructing CBFs for cascaded systems, utilizing the CBF of the kinematic model through integrator backstepping. Quadratic programming is employed to combine CLFs and CBFs to integrate both stability and safety in the closed loop. The proposed control law is time-invariant, continuous along trajectories, and easy to implement. Our main results guarantee both safety and local asymptotic stability for the closed-loop system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear observed systems on manifolds are a special class of nonlinear systems whose state spaces are smooth manifolds but possess properties similar to linear systems. Such properties can be characterized by preintegration and exact linearization with Jacobians independent of the linearization point. Non-biased IMU dynamics in navigation can be constructed into linear observed settings, leading to invariant filters with guaranteed behaviors such as local convergence and consistency. In this letter, we establish linear observed property for systems evolving on a smooth manifold through the connection structure endowed upon this space. Our key findings are the existence of linear observed systems on manifolds poses constraints on the curvature of the state space, beyond requiring the dynamics to be compatible with some connection-preserving transformations. Specifically, the flat connection case reproduces the characterization of linear observed systems on Lie groups, showing our theory is a true generalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global stability of the systems has always been vital of importance; however, this concept has not yet been sufficiently developed for the nonlinear systems. This paper extends the Jacobian matrix so that this method be able to seek the criteria to ensure global stability for a special class of nonlinear systems. In this regard, we propose a new analysis method that utilizes the Jacobian matrix concept, integrating with the characteristics of the negative eigenvalues to analyze the global stability of the nonlinear systems with only one equilibrium point. Also, the positive eigenvalue to analyze the global instability of the nonlinear systems with only one equilibrium point. Some theorems such as Hartman-Grobman and Popov criteria can prove this claim. To this end, several examples and a benchmark systems have been intended to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. Results indicate the high potential of the proposed approach in order to develop the global stability analysis. The nonlinear compressor model, categorized in this extensive class, is also investigated as a well-known industrial system besides other several examples. The outcomes demonstrate that extended Jacobian stability analysis can ensure global stability for this class of nonlinear systems under some spatial conditions, discussed in this paper.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the optimized combination of rotor and stator teeth in a three-phase switched reluctance motor featuring a connected C-core topology to attain a larger winding area and, thus, a higher electrical loading capability, leading to a higher torque density. The general formulation is discussed. Additionally, the shorter flux path within the design leads to a reduced core loss. The finite element method is employed in the design and field analysis. A comparison with a conventional motor shows the superiority of the proposed configuration. The optimized design is prototyped and tested. Both static and dynamic torques are extracted. A good correlation between simulation and experimental results is observed.</description>

      <title>Coherent Hierarchical Probabilistic Forecasting of Electric Vehicle Charging Demand</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) significantly changes typical load curves in smart grids. With the development of fast charging technology, the volatility of EV charging demand is increasing, which requires additional flexibility for real-time power balance. The forecasting of EV charging demand involves probabilistic modeling of high dimensional time series dynamics across diverse electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). This paper studies the forecasting problem of multiple EVCS in a hierarchical probabilistic manner. For each charging station, a deep learning model based on a partial input convex neural network (PICNN) is trained to predict the day-ahead charging demand's conditional distribution, preventing the common quantile crossing problem in traditional quantile regression models. Then, differentiable convex optimization layers (DCLs) are used to reconcile the scenarios sampled from the distributions to yield coherent scenarios that satisfy the hierarchical constraint. It learns a better weight matrix for adjusting the forecasting results of different targets in a machine-learning approach compared to traditional optimization-based hierarchical reconciling methods. Numerical experiments based on real-world EV charging data are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Neural-Rendezvous: Provably Robust Guidance and Control to Encounter Interstellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04883v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs) are likely representatives of primitive materials invaluable in understanding exoplanetary star systems. Due to their poorly constrained orbits with generally high inclinations and relative velocities, however, exploring ISOs with conventional human-in-the-loop approaches is significantly challenging. This paper presents Neural-Rendezvous -- a deep learning-based guidance and control framework for encountering fast-moving objects, including ISOs, robustly, accurately, and autonomously in real time. It uses pointwise minimum norm tracking control on top of a guidance policy modeled by a spectrally-normalized deep neural network, where its hyperparameters are tuned with a loss function directly penalizing the MPC state trajectory tracking error. We show that Neural-Rendezvous provides a high probability exponential bound on the expected spacecraft delivery error, the proof of which leverages stochastic incremental stability analysis. In particular, it is used to construct a non-negative function with a supermartingale property, explicitly accounting for the ISO state uncertainty and the local nature of nonlinear state estimation guarantees. In numerical simulations, Neural-Rendezvous is demonstrated to satisfy the expected error bound for 100 ISO candidates. This performance is also empirically validated using our spacecraft simulator and in high-conflict and distributed UAV swarm reconfiguration with up to 20 UAVs.</description>

      <title>Learning Performance-Oriented Control Barrier Functions Under Complex Safety Constraints and Limited Actuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide an elegant framework for constraining nonlinear control system dynamics to remain within an invariant subset of a designated safe set. However, identifying a CBF that balances performance-by maximizing the control invariant set-and accommodates complex safety constraints, especially in systems with high relative degree and actuation limits, poses a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning framework to comprehensively address these challenges. Our method begins with a Boolean composition of multiple state constraints that define the safe set. We first construct a smooth function whose zero superlevel set forms an inner approximation of this safe set. This function is then combined with a smooth neural network to parameterize the CBF candidate. To train the CBF and maximize the volume of the resulting control invariant set, we design a physics-informed loss function based on a Hamilton-Jacobi Partial Differential Equation (PDE). We validate the efficacy of our approach on a 2D double integrator (DI) system and a 7D fixed-wing aircraft system (F16).</description>

      <title>Automatic Tissue Traction Using Miniature Force-Sensing Forceps for Minimally Invasive Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common limitation of autonomous tissue manipulation in robotic minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is the absence of force sensing and control at the tool level. Recently, our team has developed miniature force-sensing forceps that can simultaneously measure the grasping and pulling forces during tissue manipulation. Based on this design, here we further present a method to automate tissue traction that comprises grasping and pulling stages. During this process, the grasping and pulling forces can be controlled either separately or simultaneously through force decoupling. The force controller is built upon a static model of tissue manipulation, considering the interaction between the force-sensing forceps and soft tissue. The efficacy of this force control approach is validated through a series of experiments comparing targeted, estimated, and actual reference forces. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method in surgical applications, various tissue resections are conducted on ex vivo tissues employing a dual-arm robotic setup. Finally, we discuss the benefits of multi-force control in tissue traction, evidenced through comparative analyses of various ex vivo tissue resections with and without the proposed method, and the potential generalization with traction on different tissues. The results affirm the feasibility of implementing automatic tissue traction using miniature forceps with multi-force control, suggesting its potential to promote autonomous MIS. A video demonstrating the experiments can be found at https://youtu.be/f5gXuXe67Ak.</description>

      <title>Qplacer: Frequency-Aware Component Placement for Superconducting Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers face a critical limitation in qubit numbers, hindering their progression towards large-scale and fault-tolerant quantum computing. A significant challenge impeding scaling is crosstalk, characterized by unwanted interactions among neighboring components on quantum chips, including qubits, resonators, and substrate. We motivate a general approach to systematically resolving multifaceted crosstalks in a limited substrate area. We propose Qplacer, a frequency-aware electrostatic-based placement framework tailored for superconducting quantum computers, to alleviate crosstalk by isolating these components in spatial and frequency domains alongside compact substrate design. Qplacer commences with a frequency assigner that ensures frequency domain isolation for qubits and resonators. It then incorporates a padding strategy and resonator partitioning for layout flexibility. Central to our approach is the conceptualization of quantum components as charged particles, enabling strategic spatial isolation through a 'frequency repulsive force' concept. Our results demonstrate that Qplacer carefully crafts the physical component layout in mitigating various crosstalk impacts while maintaining a compact substrate size. On various device topologies and NISQ benchmarks, Qplacer improves fidelity by an average of 36.7x and reduces spatial violations (susceptible to crosstalk) by an average of 12.76x, compared to classical placement engines. Regarding area optimization, compared to manual designs, Qplacer can reduce the required layout area by 2.14x on average</description>

      <title>Aerial Robots Carrying Flexible Cables: Dynamic Shape Optimal Control via Spectral Method Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a model-based optimal boundary control design for an aerial robotic system composed of a quadrotor carrying a flexible cable. The whole system is modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs) combined with boundary conditions described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is adopted to project the original infinite-dimensional system on a finite low-dimensional space spanned by orthogonal basis functions. Based on such a reduced order model, nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is implemented online to realize both position and shape trajectory tracking of the flexible cable in an optimal predictive fashion. The proposed POD-based reduced modeling and optimal control paradigms are verified in simulation using an accurate high-dimensional FDM-based model and experimentally using a real quadrotor and a cable. The results show the viability of the POD-based predictive control approach (allowing closing the control loop on the full system state) and its superior performance compared to an optimally tuned PID controller (allowing closing the control loop on the quadrotor state only).</description>

      <title>Stabilization of a Class of Large-Scale Systems of Linear Hyperbolic PDEs via Continuum Approximation of Exact Backstepping Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish that stabilization of a class of linear, hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with a large (nevertheless finite) number of components, can be achieved via employment of a backstepping-based control law, which is constructed for stabilization of a continuum version (i.e., as the number of components tends to infinity) of the PDE system. This is achieved by proving that the exact backstepping kernels, constructed for stabilization of the large-scale system, can be approximated (in certain sense such that exponential stability is preserved) by the backstepping kernels constructed for stabilization of a continuum version (essentially an infinite ensemble) of the original PDE system. The proof relies on construction of a convergent sequence of backstepping kernels that is defined such that each kernel matches the exact backstepping kernels (derived based on the original, large-scale system), in a piecewise constant manner with respect to an ensemble variable; while showing that they satisfy the continuum backstepping kernel equations. We present a numerical example that reveals that complexity of computation of stabilizing backstepping kernels may not scale with the number of components of the PDE state, when the kernels are constructed on the basis of the continuum version, in contrast to the case in which they are constructed on the basis of the original, large-scale system. In addition, we formally establish the connection between the solutions to the large-scale system and its continuum counterpart. Thus, this approach can be useful for design of computationally tractable, stabilizing backstepping-based control laws for large-scale PDE systems.</description>

      <title>QuITO v.2: Trajectory Optimization with Uniform Error Guarantees under Path Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a new transcription, change point localization, and mesh refinement scheme for direct optimization-based solutions and for uniform approximation of optimal control trajectories associated with a class of nonlinear constrained optimal control problems (OCPs). The base transcription algorithm for which we establish the refinement algorithm is a direct multiple shooting technique -- QuITO v.2 (Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization). The mesh refinement technique consists of two steps -- localization of certain irregular regions in an optimal control trajectory via wavelets, followed by a targeted $h$-refinement approach around such regions of irregularity. Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties, along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy. We also announce, and make freely available, a new software package based on QuITO v.2 along with all its functionalities for completeness. The package is available at: https://github.com/chatterjee-d/QuITOv2.git.</description>

      <title>Minimax problems for ensembles of control-affine systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05782v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider ensembles of control-affine systems in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and we study simultaneous optimal control problems related to the worst-case minimization. After proving that such problems admit solutions, denoting with $(\Theta^N)_N$ a sequence of compact sets that parametrize the ensembles of systems, we first show that the corresponding minimax optimal control problems are $\Gamma$-convergent whenever $(\Theta^N)_N$ has a limit with respect to the Hausdorff distance. Besides its independent interest, the previous result plays a crucial role for establishing the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) when the ensemble is parametrized by a set $\Theta$ consisting of infinitely many points. Namely, we first approximate $\Theta$ by finite and increasing-in-size sets $(\Theta^N)_N$ for which the PMP is known, and then we derive the PMP for the $\Gamma$-limiting problem. The same strategy can be pursued in applications, where we can reduce infinite ensembles to finite ones to compute the minimizers numerically. We bring as a numerical example the Schr\"odinger equation for a qubit with uncertain resonance frequency.</description>

      <title>Aligning Large Language Models with Representation Editing: A Control Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05954v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human objectives is crucial for real-world applications. However, fine-tuning LLMs for alignment often suffers from unstable training and requires substantial computing resources. Test-time alignment techniques, such as prompting and guided decoding, do not modify the underlying model, and their performance remains dependent on the original model's capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose aligning LLMs through representation editing. The core of our method is to view a pre-trained autoregressive LLM as a discrete-time stochastic dynamical system. To achieve alignment for specific objectives, we introduce external control signals into the state space of this language dynamical system. We train a value function directly on the hidden states according to the Bellman equation, enabling gradient-based optimization to obtain the optimal control signals at test time. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing test-time alignment techniques while requiring significantly fewer resources compared to fine-tuning methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lingkai-Kong/RE-Control.</description>

      <title>Robust nonlinear state-feedback control of second-order systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note proposes a novel nonlinear state feedback controller for perturbed second-order systems. In analogy to a linear proportional-derivative (PD) feedback control, the proposed nonlinear scheme uses the output state of interest and its time derivative, while achieving robust control in a finite time. The control has only one free design parameter, and the closed-loop system is shown to be uniformly asymptotically stable in the presence of matched disturbances. We derive a strict Lyapunov function for the closed-loop control system with a bounded exogenous perturbation, and use it for both the control parameter tuning and analysis of the finite-time convergence. Apart from the numerical results, a revealing experimental example is also shown in favor of the proposed control and in comparison with PD and sub-optimal nonlinear damping regulators.</description>

Abstract: Mobile robots, becoming increasingly autonomous, are capable of operating in diverse and unknown environments. This flexibility allows them to fulfill goals independently and adapting their actions dynamically without rigidly predefined control codes. However, their autonomous behavior complicates guaranteeing safety and reliability due to the limited influence of a human operator to accurately supervise and verify each robot's actions. To ensure autonomous mobile robot's safety and reliability, which are aspects of dependability, methods are needed both in the planning and execution of missions for autonomous mobile robots. In this article, a twofold approach is presented that ensures fault removal in the context of mission planning and fault prevention during mission execution for autonomous mobile robots. First, the approach consists of a concept based on formal verification applied during the planning phase of missions. Second, the approach consists of a rule-based concept applied during mission execution. A use case applying the approach is presented, discussing how the two concepts complement each other and what contribution they make to certain aspects of dependability.</description>

      <title>RadioDiff: An Effective Generative Diffusion Model for Sampling-Free Dynamic Radio Map Construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio map (RM) is a promising technology that can obtain pathloss based on only location, which is significant for 6G network applications to reduce the communication costs for pathloss estimation. However, the construction of RM in traditional is either computationally intensive or depends on costly sampling-based pathloss measurements. Although the neural network (NN)-based method can efficiently construct the RM without sampling, its performance is still suboptimal. This is primarily due to the misalignment between the generative characteristics of the RM construction problem and the discrimination modeling exploited by existing NN-based methods. Thus, to enhance RM construction performance, in this paper, the sampling-free RM construction is modeled as a conditional generative problem, where a denoised diffusion-based method, named RadioDiff, is proposed to achieve high-quality RM construction. In addition, to enhance the diffusion model's capability of extracting features from dynamic environments, an attention U-Net with an adaptive fast Fourier transform module is employed as the backbone network to improve the dynamic environmental features extracting capability. Meanwhile, the decoupled diffusion model is utilized to further enhance the construction performance of RMs. Moreover, a comprehensive theoretical analysis of why the RM construction is a generative problem is provided for the first time, from both perspectives of data features and NN training methods. Experimental results show that the proposed RadioDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in all three metrics of accuracy, structural similarity, and peak signal-to-noise ratio.

      <title>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Categories for Compositional Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning, conducting task composition by forming cohesive, executable sequences from multiple tasks remains challenging. However, the ability to (de)compose tasks is a linchpin in developing robotic systems capable of learning complex behaviors. Yet, compositional reinforcement learning is beset with difficulties, including the high dimensionality of the problem space, scarcity of rewards, and absence of system robustness after task composition. To surmount these challenges, we view task composition through the prism of category theory -- a mathematical discipline exploring structures and their compositional relationships. The categorical properties of Markov decision processes untangle complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks, allowing for strategical reduction of dimensionality, facilitating more tractable reward structures, and bolstering system robustness. Experimental results support the categorical theory of reinforcement learning by enabling skill reduction, reuse, and recycling when learning complex robotic arm tasks.</description>

These tasks consist of multiple temporally extended sub-tasks. Due to the sub-task inter-dependencies and sparse reward issue in long-horizon tasks, existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, such as task-conditioned and goal-conditioned policies, continue to struggle with slow convergence and sub-optimal performance in generalizing to compositional tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new hierarchical RL framework that enhances the efficiency and optimality of task generalization. At the high level, we present an implicit planner specifically designed for generalizing compositional tasks. This planner selects the next sub-task and estimates the multi-step return for completing the remaining task to complete from the current state. It learns a latent transition model and performs planning in the latent space by using a graph neural network (GNN). Subsequently, the high-level planner's selected sub-task guides the low-level agent to effectively handle long-horizon tasks, while the multi-step return encourages the low-level policy to account for future sub-task dependencies, enhancing its optimality. We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the framework's advantages over previous methods in terms of both efficiency and optimality.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid development of robotics swarm technology, there are more tasks that require the swarm to pass through complicated environments safely and efficiently. Virtual tube technology is a novel way to achieve this goal. Virtual tubes are free spaces connecting two places that provide safety boundaries and direction of motion for swarm robotics. How to determine the design quality of a virtual tube is a fundamental problem. For such a purpose, this paper presents a degree of flowability (DOF) for two-dimensional virtual tubes according to a minimum energy principle. After that, methods to calculate DOF are proposed with a feasibility analysis. Simulations of swarm robotics in different kinds of two-dimensional virtual tubes are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method of calculating DOF.</description>
