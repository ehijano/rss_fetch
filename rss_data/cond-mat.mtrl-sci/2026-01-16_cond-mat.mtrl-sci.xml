      <title>Ultra-Stable Weyl Topology Driven by Magnetic Textures in the Shandite Compound Co3Sn2S(2-x)Sex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ state-of-the-art first-principles calculations to investigate the shandite compounds Co3Sn2S2, Co3Sn2SeS, and Co3Sn2Se2, which host Weyl fermions and complex magnetic textures. Their magnetic structures are governed primarily by exchange interactions and magnetocrystalline anisotropy, whereas the symmetry-allowed alternating-layer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is found to be negligible. We identify a previously unrecognized spin-chiral interaction (SCI) arising from the kagome lattice topology, which plays a decisive role in stabilizing the experimentally observed magnetic textures. The extracted magnetic parameters reproduce experimental trends, with the SCI emerging as a novel and dominant contribution. The calculated SCI strengths are 0.78 meV, 0.86 meV, and 0.87 meV for Co3Sn2S2, Co3Sn2SeS, and Co3Sn2Se2, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that short-wavelength magnetic textures drive phase transitions of the Weyl nodes, resulting in band flattening and the opening of an emergent gap. This newly identified SCI, together with the associated electronically driven phase transitions, provides a promising route for manipulating transport properties in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Topological textures and emergent altermagnetic signatures in ultrathin BiFeO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric multiferroics, materials with intrinsically coupled electric polarization and magnetic order, promise ultralow-power switching, nonvolatile memory, and energy-efficient signal transduction. Yet practical deployment demands ultrathin films down to the atomic limit, where both orders typically degrade. Maintaining both order parameters at the thinnest scales in complex oxides remains a tremendous challenge, as uncompensated bound charge drives nanoscale depolarization in most ferroelectrics, while off-stoichiometry, reduced anisotropy, and charge transfer can produce magnetic dead layers in ultrathin oxides at substrate interfaces. Here, we realize a multiferroic phase of BiFeO3 that not only sustains both order parameters at room temperature with no dead layer but also exhibits signatures of emergent altermagnetism in the four-unit-cell, ultrathin limit. First-principles calculations, spin symmetry analysis, atomic-resolution imaging, and angle-resolved magnetic imaging reveal that short-circuit electrostatic boundary conditions, together with epitaxial strain, drive a continuous second-order, thickness-driven phase transition that enables the formation of multiferroic topological textures. Moreover, the imposed boundary conditions stabilize a d-wave altermagnetic time-reversal symmetry breaking, with corresponding signatures observed in magnetic circular dichroism. Collectively, these results establish a pathway to stabilize unconventional multiferroicity at device-relevant thicknesses, reframing scaling limits for oxide electronics.</description>

      <title>Performance of AI agents based on reasoning language models on ALD process optimization tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we explore the performance and behavior of reasoning large language models to autonomously optimize atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes. In the ALD process optimization task, an agent built on top of a reasoning LLM has to find optimal dose times for an ALD precursor and a coreactant without any prior knowledge on the process, including whether it is actually self-limited. The agent is meant to interact iteratively with an ALD reactor in a fully unsupervised way. We evaluate this agent using a simple model of an ALD tool that incorporates ALD processes with different self-limited surface reaction pathways as well as a non self-limited component. Our results show that agents based on reasoning models like OpenAI's o3 and GPT5 consistently succeeded at completing this optimization task. However, we observed significant run-to-run variability due to the non deterministic nature of the model's response. In order to understand the logic followed by the reasoning model, the agent uses a two step process in which the model first generates an open response detailing the reasoning process. This response is then transformed into a structured output. An analysis of these reasoning traces showed that the logic of the model was sound and that its reasoning was based on the notions of self-limited process and saturation expected in the case of ALD. However, the agent can sometimes be misled by its own prior choices when exploring the optimization space.</description>

      <title>Density of States of Ru3 and Pt3 Clusters Supported on Sputter-Deposited TiO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, 3-atom clusters, Ru3 and Pt3, were deposited onto radio frequency RF-sputter deposited TiO2, treated with Ar+ ion sputtering. Ru3 was deposited by both solution submersion and chemical vapor deposition of Ru3(CO)12, while Pt3 was deposited under ultra-high vacuum using a laser vaporisation cluster source. The valence electronic density of states (DOS) of the deposited clusters were analysed after heat treatment using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and metastable impact electron spectroscopy (MIES), where UPS measures the top several layers while MIES measures only the top atomic layer. XPS was used to determine the cluster surface coverages. The DOS were found to be very similar between Ru3 deposited by solution submersion and chemical vapor deposition. MIES results for Ru3 had contributions from titania O 2p sites due to encapsulation by a reduced titania overlayer. For Pt3 clusters the UPS and MIES results provided evidence that Pt was present on the topmost layer, and encapsulation did not occur. The proposed reason for the encapsulation of Ru3 but not of Pt3 is the higher surface energy of Ru over Pt. It is concluded that Pt clusters deposited onto TiO2 can modify the outermost layer by adding discrete energy levels on the surface, whereas the Ru clusters being encapsulated just below the surface generate a broad distribution of energy states close to the Fermi level. The outcome of this work is that Pt3-cluster-modified surfaces could be used as catalysts for reactions where the Pt3 energy levels are suitable for the respective reaction. The implication of the DOS found for photocatalytic water splitting are discussed.</description>

      <title>A Neuroevolution Potential for Gallium Oxide: Accurate and Efficient Modeling of Polymorphism and Swift Heavy-Ion Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) is a wide-bandgap semiconductor with promising applications in high-power and high-frequency electronics. However, its complex polymorphic nature poses substantial challenges for fundamental studies, particularly in understanding phase-transformation behaviors under nonequilibrium conditions. Here, we develop a robust, accurate, and computationally efficient machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) for Ga2O3 based on the neuroevolution potential (NEP) framework combined with an energy-dependent weighting strategy. The resulting NEP potential demonstrates clear advantages over the state-of-the-art tabGAP potential with respect to both accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce a physically process-oriented sampling strategy to systematically augment the training dataset, thereby enhancing the MLIP performance for targeted physical phenomena. As a representative application, a dedicated NEP potential is constructed for swift heavy-ion (SHI) irradiation simulations of \b{eta}-Ga2O3. The simulated results are in quantitative agreement with experimental observations and provide a consistent physical explanation for the reported experimental discrepancies regarding phase transformations in the ion track of \b{eta}-Ga2O3.</description>

      <title>Effect of Number of Bilayers on the Anomalous Hall Effect in [Si/Fe]N Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of varying the number of bilayers (N) on the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in sputtered Si/Fe multilayers has been investigated. Both the AHE and magnetisation data reveal the in-plane magnetic anisotropy in the samples. Large enhancement of about 24 times in the saturation anomalous Hall resistance (R_Ahs) and anomalous Hall sensitivity (S) has been observed upon decreasing N from 20 to 1. When compared with the bulk Fe, the values of R_Ahs and anomalous Hall coefficient, Rs obtained for N= 1 were enhanced by about 5 and 3 orders of magnitude, respectively. The Rs follows the longitudinal electrical resistivity Rho as Rs proportional to Rho^2.1, suggesting side jump as the dominant mechanism of the AHE. The S as high as 22 Ohm/T over a wide operational field range of -8 to +8 kOe has been obtained for N = 1.</description>

      <title>Classification and design of two-dimensional altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets -- newly identified collinear antiferromagnets -- carry zero net moment with non-relativistic, spin-polarized bands, distilling the best of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets into a single spintronic platform. Shrunking to the two-dimensional limit, they inherit the tunability of two-dimensional crystals while adding symmetry-protected spin splitting, a combination now driving intense experimental interest. Here, we review the symmetry classification of two-dimensional altermagnets based on spin-group theory and survey the growing list of candidate materials, emphasizing those with large spin splitting for experimental realization. We then examine strategies for engineering two-dimensional altermagnetism. This Review aims to consolidate theoretically proposed candidate materials and realization strategies for two-dimensional altermagnets, providing insights for future experimental efforts in this emerging field.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Molecular-level Understanding of MgO Hydration through Computational Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydration of magnesium oxide (MgO) to magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)$_2$) is a fundamental solid-surface chemical reaction with significant implications for materials science. Yet its molecular-level mechanism from water adsorption to Mg(OH)$_2$ nucleation and growth remains elusive due to its complex and multi-step nature. Here, we elucidate the molecular process of MgO hydration based on structures of the MgO/water interface obtained by a combined computational chemistry approach of potential-scaling molecular dynamics simulations and first-principles calculations without any a priori assumptions about reaction pathways. The result shows that the Mg$^{2+}$ dissolution follows the dissociative water adsorption. We find that this initial dissolution can proceed exothermically even from the defect-free surface with an average activation barrier of $\sim$12 kcal/mol. This exothermicity depends crucially on the stabilization of the resulting surface vacancy, achieved by proton adsorption onto neighboring surface oxygen atoms. Further Mg$^{2+}$ dissolution then occurs in correlation with proton penetration into the solid. Moreover, we find that the Mg(OH)$_2$ nucleation and growth proceeds according to the dissolution-precipitation mechanism, rather than a solid-state reaction mechanism involving a direct topotactic transformation. In this process, Mg$^{2+}$ ions migrate away from the surface and form amorphous Mg-OH chains as precursors for Mg(OH)$_2$ nucleation. We also demonstrate that sufficient water facilitates the formation of more ordered crystalline nuclei. This computational study provides a comprehensive molecular-level understanding of MgO hydration, representing a foundational step toward elucidating the mechanisms of this class of complex and multi-step solid-surface chemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Physically Unclonable Functions Based on Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes: A Scalable and Inexpensive Method toward Unique Identifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A physically un-clonable function (PUF) is a physical system that cannot be reproduced or predicted and therefore is a good basis to build security and anti-counterfeiting applications. The unclonability of PUFs typically stems from the randmoness induced in a system during sophisticated fabrication methods. It is precisely this built-in complexity the bottleneck hindering scalability and increasing costs. Here, we produce in a simple manner PUFs based on arrays of carbon nanotubes junctions simultaneously assembled by dielectrophoresis. We demonstrate that the intrinsic inhomogeneity of carbon nanotubes at the nanoscale, combined with the unpredictability introduced by liquid phase-based fabrication methods results in unique electronic profiles of easily scalable devices. This approach could be extrapolated to generate PUFs based on other nanoscale materials</description>

      <title>Topology-Directed Silicide Formation: An Explanation for the Growth of C49-TiSi$_2$ on the Si(100) Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing metal-semiconductor junctions is essential for optimizing the performance of modern nanoelectronic devices. A widely used material is TiSi$_2$, which combines low electronic resistivity with good endurance. However, its multitude of polymorphs continues to pose a challenge for device fabrication. In particular, the naturally occurring formation of the metastable C49-TiSi$_2$ modification remains poorly understood and is problematic due to its unfavorable electronic properties. Based on extensive DFT calculations, we present a comprehensive model of Ti adsorption on Si(100) that highlights the pivotal role of surface topology for the initial stages of the interfacial TiSi$_2$ formation process. We show that the interplay between Si surface dimers, the symmetry of the Si(100) surface, and the incorporation of Ti adsorbates below the surface drives an adsorption pattern that yields a nucleation template for the C49-TiSi$_2$ phase. Our atomistic model rationalizes experimental observations like the Stranski-Krastanov growth mode, the preferential formation of C49-TiSi$_2$ despite it being less favorable than the competing C54 phase, and why disruption of the surface structure restores thermodynamically driven growth of the latter. Ultimately, this novel perspective on the unique growth of TiSi$_2$ will help to pave the way for next-generation electronic devices.</description>

      <title>The transformation mechanisms among cuboctahedra, Ino's decahedra and icosahedra structures of magic-size gold nanoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gold nanoclusters possess multiple competing structural motifs with small energy differences, enabling structural coexistence and interconversion. Using a high-accuracy machine learned potential trained on some 20'000 density functional theory reference data points, we investigate transformation pathways connecting both high-symmetry and amorphous cuboctahedra, Ino's decahedra and icosahedra for Au55, Au147, Au309 and Au561 nanoclusters. Our saddle point searches reveal that high-symmetry transformations from cuboctahedra and Ino's decahedra to icosahedra proceed through a single barrier and represent soft-mode-driven jitterbug-type and slip-dislocation motions. In addition, we identify lower-barrier asymmetric transformation pathways that drive the system into disordered, Jahn-Teller-stabilized amorphous icosahedra. Minima Hopping sampling further uncovers, in this context, many such low-symmetry minima. Some of the newly identified global minima for Au309 and Au561 have energies that are up to 2.8 eV lower than the previously reported global minima. Hence, both the shapes and the transformation pathways studied in previous investigations are not the physically relevant ones. In contrast to the previously studied pathways, our transformation pathways give reasonable transformation times that are in rough agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>Growth and Morphology of InN Nanowires on Si&lt;111&gt; and Si&lt;100&gt; at Back-End-Of-Line Compatible Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: InN nanowires were grown on Si&lt;111&gt; and Si&lt;100&gt; substrates by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy using a thin AlN buffer layer at temperatures compatible with the thermal budget limitation imposed by Back-End-Of-Line processing. Reflection high-energy electron diffraction reveals different nucleation behaviors on the two substrate orientations, with higher structural disorder in the case of Si&lt;100&gt;. However, vertically aligned nanowires with hexagonal cross section and N polarity are obtained on both substrates. A statistical analysis of nanowire morphology as a function of growth temperature indicates similar trends in diameter, density, and length on Si&lt;111&gt; and Si&lt;100&gt;, which are explained by adatom kinetics during growth. Nanowires on Si&lt;100&gt; exhibit improved uniformity and reduced tapering, attributed to the different nanowire nucleation due to microstructural properties of the AlN buffer layer. The results demonstrate the feasibility of growing high-quality InN nanowires on Si&lt;100&gt;, supporting their potential for monolithic integration of nanowire-based photodetectors on silicon.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While current technology has enabled their widespread use, further improvements are needed for stationary, portable, and mobile applications, for example by the development of novel cathode materials. Digitalization of battery development, combining both experimental and modelling efforts is extremely valuable in this development. This is addressed in the present paper, where the authors present a comprehensive dataset for a graphite/LNMO 1 Ah pouch cell, including material, design, and electrochemical data. The dataset, validated through the BattMo modelling framework, supports physical modelling and aims to benefit the battery modelling community by offering a comprehensive resource for future studies. Both the dataset and the accompanying software for numerical validation is openly available and processed in such a way that it can serve as blueprint for reporting of comparable research data.</description>

      <title>Incipient modulated phase in Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$TiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanometer-scale modulations can spontaneously emerge in complex materials when multiple degrees of freedom interact. Here we demonstrate that ferroelectric Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$TiO$_3$ lies in close proximity to an incipient structurally modulated phase. Using inelastic neutron and X-ray scattering, we show that upon cooling, dipolar fluctuations strongly couple to and soften the $c_{44}$ transverse acoustic mode. We identify the wavevector at which this softening is maximal, thereby defining the characteristic length scale of the modulation. Calcium substitution enhances both the amplitude and the wavevector of the softening by strengthening the ferroelectric and antiferrodistortive instabilities. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear flexoelectric phonon coupling tends to stabilize a modulated state that cooperates with, rather than competes against, the other lattice instabilities in SrTiO$_3$.</description>

      <title>Emergence of unconventional magnetic order in strain-engineered RuO2/TiO2 superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin ordering in RuO2 remains a highly debated topic, owing to its elusive nature, with reports ranging from a nonmagnetic ground state to signatures of unconventional magnetic order. Here we provide the first unambiguous, and direct evidence of unconventional magnetism in epitaxial, fully strained RuO2/TiO2 superlattices on TiO2 (110) substrate grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy. Polarized neutron reflectometry reveals a finite magnetic moment localized within the compressively strained RuO2 layers, consistent with predictions obtained from first-principles calculations. Complementary density functional theory and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy show that epitaxial strain drives the Ru 4d states toward the Fermi level, triggering a Stoner-type instability that stabilizes non-compensated magnetic order. These unique results reveal that RuO2 exhibits unconventional magnetic states under epitaxial strain, which are not accessible in bulk and establish strain engineering as a powerful route to uncover and control magnetic phases in RuO2 and related oxides.</description>

      <title>Viewpoint: On the Emergence of van der Waals Magnets: A Personal Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of magnetism in atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnets (FePS$_3$, NiPS$_3$, and MnPS$_3$) in 2016 marked an important moment in the development of two-dimensional (2D) physics. In this personal reflection, I describe how a simple question, posed in the early 2010s, motivated experimental efforts that culminated in the demonstration of antiferromagnetic order in monolayer FePS$_3$. Alongside subsequent reports of vdW ferromagnets in 2017, these developments helped establish intrinsic magnetism as a viable degree of freedom in atomically thin materials. I close with personal lessons drawn from this period and a perspective on the opportunities that now shape the field's second decade and beyond.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure theory of H$_{3}$S: Plane-wave-like valence states, density-of-states peak and its guaranteed proximity to the Fermi level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in sulfur superhydride H$_{3}$S under extreme pressures has been explained theoretically, but it requires a peaked concentration of the electronic density of states (DOS), which has been found in first-principles calculations. The mechanism of this peak formation, though vital for its high transition temperature, has however remained obscure. We address this problem through detailed analysis of the first-principles electronic wave functions. The valence wave functions are shown to be significantly plane-wave-like. From the Fourier-mode analysis of the self-consistent potential and atomic pseudopotentials, we extract the nearly uniform models that accurately reproduce the first-principles band structure with very few parameters. The DOS peak is shown to be the consequence of the hybridization of specific plane waves. Adjacency of Jones' large zone to the plane-wave spherical Fermi surface is posited to be the root cause of the multiple plane-wave hybridization, the DOS peak formation and its proximity to the Fermi level. The present theory resolves the minimal modeling problem of electronic states in H$_{3}$S, as well as establishes a mechanism that may help to boost the transition temperatures in pressure induced superconductors.</description>

      <title>A Generalizable Framework for Building Executable Domain-Specific LLMs under Data Scarcity: Demonstration on Semiconductor TCAD Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific and engineering verticals often suffer from data scarcity and strict executability requirements: models must generate not only fluent text, but also syntactically valid, tool-compilable scripts. We present a schema-first alignment framework for building compact, executable domain-specific LLMs in low-resource settings. The framework integrates three core components: (i) large-scale synthetic QA data generation from expert documentation to instill foundational domain knowledge; (ii) a code-centric IR-&gt;DPO workflow that converts verified tool decks into interpretable intermediate representations (IR), performs equivalence-preserving diversification, and constructs preference pairs to directly optimize instruction compliance and code executability; and (iii) a controlled evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), showing that while RAG benefits general LLMs, it can marginally degrade the performance of already domain-aligned models.
  We demonstrate the framework by instantiating TcadGPT for semiconductor Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD). Using 1.5M synthetic QA pairs and an IR-driven DPO dataset, TcadGPT attains 85.6% semantic accuracy and an 80.0% syntax pass rate on SDE executability tests, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art general LLMs such as GPT-4o. To probe portability beyond TCAD, we apply the same recipe to the open-source FEM solver Elmer, observing consistent improvements in script-level success rates over general-purpose baselines. All datasets, benchmarks, and code (including P1, P2, and IR-&gt;DPO) are released for reproducibility. Together, these results suggest that the proposed framework provides a robust and reproducible path toward executable LLMs in specialized, data-scarce professional domains.</description>

      <title>Microwave Kerr/Faraday Resonance in Two-dimensional Chiral Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the polar Kerr and Faraday effects in two-dimensional multiband chiral superconductors. We show that the clapping modes--the relative phase and amplitude oscillations between two chiral components of the superconducting order parameter--lie well within the quasiparticle excitation gap in multiband systems and dominate these magneto-optical responses in the microwave regime. The Kerr and Faraday rotation angles exhibit the resonant enhancement with sign reversals in the microwave regime as a function of the light frequency, reaching peak values on the order of 100 nrad--10 $\mu$rad in thin films of candidate chiral superconductors. These resonances are accessible in superconducting atomic layer materials and provide a generic probe of chiral superconductivity in two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Molecular electrostatic potentials from machine learning models for dipole and quadrupole predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) is a key quantity for describing and predicting intermolecular and ion-molecule interactions. Here, we assess the ability of machine-learning (ML) models to infer the MEP, based on the equivariant graph-convolutional neural network architecture PiNet2 and trained on dipole and quadrupole moments. For the established QM9 dataset, we find that including the quadrupole contribution in the ML models substantially improves their ability to recover the MEP compared to dipole-only models. This trend is confirmed on the SPICE dataset, which spans a much broader region of organic chemical space. Together, this study underscores the central role of the quadrupole moment as a fitting target for ML models aiming at rapid access to the MEP.</description>

      <title>A comparison of simulation tools for Muon-Induced X-ray Emission (MIXE) in thin films: a study case with lithium batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of three Monte Carlo simulation frameworks -SRIM, GEANT4, and PHITS- for modeling the transport, stopping, and atomic cascade of negative muons in micrometer-scale, multilayer systems relevant to Muon-Induced X-ray Emission (MIXE) experiments at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). Using a lithium-ion battery as a benchmark target, simulated implantation profiles are compared with experimental data from the GIANT spectrometer. All three codes reproduce the overall muon depth distributions with good consistency, even across sharp density contrasts. SRIM provides reliable implantation estimates for compact geometries, whereas PHITS reproduces GEANT4 results with comparable accuracy and additionally generates muonic X-ray spectra. These spectra, however, exhibit a systematic energy offset in the K-line transitions of medium- and high-Z elements relative to theoretical and experimental values. Despite this bias, PHITS accurately captures relative intensities and spectral shapes, enabling element-specific line identification. The results demonstrate that SRIM and PHITS constitute practical tools for rapid estimation of muon implantation and stopping profiles, and that PHITS holds strong potential for predictive MIXE spectroscopy once its transition-energy bias is corrected.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory and Unusual Dielectric Functions of Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the spatially nonlocal dielectric functions of graphene at any frequency derived starting fromthe first principles of thermal quantum field theory using the formalism of the polarization tensor. After a brief review of this formalism, the longitudinal and transverse dielectric functions are considered at any relationship between the frequency and the wave vector. The analytic properties of their real and imaginary parts are investigated at low and high frequencies. Emphasis is given to the double pole at zero frequency which arises in the transverse dielectric function. The role of this unusual property for solving the problem of disagreement between experiment and theory in the Casimir effect is discussed. We guess that a more complete dielectric response of ordinary metals should also be spatially nonlocal and its transverse part may possess the double pole in the region of evanescent waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmons are collective oscillations of mobile electrons. Using terahertz spacetime metrology, we probe plasmon dynamics of mono- and bi-layer graphene. In both systems, the experimentally measured Drude weight systematically exceeds the prediction based on non-interacting electronic system. This enhancement is most pronounced at ultra-low carrier densities. We attribute the observed deviation to pseudospin dynamics of the Dirac fermions in multi-layer graphene, which leads to a breakdown of Galilean invariance. Our results establish that pseudospin structure of the single-particle electronic wave function can directly govern collective excitations, with implications that extend beyond graphene to a broad class of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum solver for single-impurity Anderson models with particle-hole symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum embedding methods, such as dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), provide a powerful framework for investigating strongly correlated materials. A central computational bottleneck in DMFT is in solving the Anderson impurity model (AIM), whose exact solution is classically intractable for large bath sizes. In this work, we develop and benchmark a quantum-classical hybrid solver tailored for DMFT applications, using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) to prepare the ground state of the AIM with shallow quantum circuits. The solver uses a unified ansatz framework to prepare the particle and hole excitations of the ground-state from parameter-shifted circuits, enabling the reconstruction of the impurity Green's function through a continued-fraction expansion. We evaluate the performance of this approach across a few bath sizes and interaction strengths under noisy, shot-limited conditions. We compare three optimization routines (COBYLA, Adam, and L-BFGS-B) in terms of convergence and fidelity, assess the benefits of estimating a quantum-computed moment (QCM) correction to the variational energies, and benchmark the approach by comparing the reconstructed density of states (DOS) against that obtained using a classical pipeline. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of Green's function reconstruction on near-term devices and establish practical benchmarks for quantum impurity solvers embedded within self-consistent DMFT loops.</description>

      <title>Emergent electric field induced by dissipative sliding dynamics of domain walls in a Weyl magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic motion of topological defects in magnets induces an emergent electric field, as exemplified by the continuous flow of skyrmion vortices. However, the electrodynamics underlying this emergent field remains poorly understood. In this context, magnetic domain walls - one dimensional topological defects with two collective modes, sliding and spin tilt - offer a promising platform for exploration. Here, we demonstrate that the dissipative motion of domain walls under oscillatory current excitation generates an emergent electric field. We image domain patterns and quantify domain wall length under applied magnetic fields in mesoscopic devices based on the magnetic Weyl semimetal NdAlSi. These devices exhibit exceptionally strong domain wall scattering and a pronounced emergent electric field, observed in the imaginary component of the complex impedance. Spin dynamics simulations reveal that domain wall sliding dominates over spin tilting, where the phase delay of the domain wall motion with respect to the driving force impacts the emergent electric field. Our findings establish domain-wall dynamics as a platform for studying emergent electromagnetic fields and motivate further investigations on the coupled motion of magnetic solitons and conduction electrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting the complete quantum geometric and topological character of Bloch wavefunctions from experiments remains a challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we resolve this by introducing the "wavefunction form factor" (WFF) matrix, a quantity directly constructible from intensities in momentum- and energy-resolved spectroscopies like ARPES and INS. We demonstrate that band topology is encoded in "spectral nodes" -- momentum-space points where the WFF determinant vanishes, providing a direct readout of topological invariants via a topological selection rule. Furthermore, when the number of independent probes exceeds the number of the target bands, our framework yields an effective band projector. This enables the determination of Wilson loop spectra and the extraction of an effective quantum geometric tensor, providing a model-independent measurement of the non-Abelian Berry curvature and quantum metric as resolved by the experimental probes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.13502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rare-earth metal oxyhydride compositions are currently attracting increasing attention to develop materials with unusual optical responses. Herein, using computer simulations of the electronic and optical properties, the optical responses of two stable yttrium oxyhydride compounds, Y4H10O and YHO, are studied for the visible light range. The emphasis is on modeling macroscopic optical characteristics, which are numerically derived within a conventional scheme using refractive indices, and absorption, transmittance, and reflection spectra. The main goal is twofold: first, to simulate spectral behavior of different single-phase and two-phase oxyhydride compositions and second, to conduct a comparative analysis that could explain the features of the transmission spectra measured for different samples. Based on the obtained results, models of new optical coatings are proposed in which yttrium oxyhydrides play the key role. In the context of nonlinear optics, the frequency profile of the second-order susceptibility for the noncentrosymmetric cubic structure of Y4H10O is evaluated and it is shown that this system could exhibit large optical nonlinearity.</description>

Abstract: Photocatalytic water splitting has attracted considerable attention for renewable energy production. Since the first reported photocatalytic water splitting by titanium dioxide, this material remains one of the most promising photocatalysts, due to its suitable band gap and band-edge positions. However, predicting both of these properties is a challenging task for existing computational methods. Here we show how Koopmans spectral functionals can accurately predict the band structure and level alignment of rutile, anatase, and brookite TiO$_2$ using a computationally efficient workflow that only requires (a) a DFT calculation of the photocatalyst/vacuum interface and (b) a Koopmans spectral functional calculation of the bulk photocatalyst. The success of this approach for TiO$_2$ suggests that this strategy could be deployed for assessing the suitability of novel photocatalyst candidates.</description>

      <title>Time-domain extreme ultraviolet diffuse scattering spectroscopy of nanoscale surface phonons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18445v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the observation of dynamic fringe patterns in the diffuse scattering of extreme ultraviolet light from surfaces, following femtosecond optical excitation. At each point on the detector, the diffuse scattering intensity exhibits oscillations at well-defined frequencies that correspond to surface phonons with wave vectors determined by the scattering geometry, indicating that the optical excitation generates coherent surface phonons propagating in all directions and spanning a wavelength range from 60 to 300 nm. This phenomenon is observed on a variety of samples, including single-layer and multilayer metal films, as well as bulk semiconductors. The measured surface phonon dispersions show good agreement with theoretical calculations. By comparing signal amplitudes from samples with different surface morphologies, we find that the excitation mechanism is linked to the natural surface roughness of the samples. However, the signal is still detectable on extremely smooth surfaces with sub-nanometer roughness. Our findings demonstrate a simple and effective method for optically exciting coherent surface phonons with nanoscale wavelengths on a wide range of solid samples and establish a foundation for surface phonon spectroscopy in a wave vector range well beyond the limit of conventional surface Brillouin scattering.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Behavior from the Atomic Blueprint: Machine Learning-Guided Design of Spatially Functionalized a-SiO2 Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: a-Quartz surfaces functionalized with hydroxyl and methyl groups provide a versatile platform for controlling interfacial properties critical to applications such as catalysis, protective coatings, and energy conversion. The arrangement of these functional groups strongly influences interfacial interactions at solid-liquid interfaces, highlighting their relevance to colloid and interface science. However, conventional models often treat surface functionalization as spatially homogeneous, overlooking the atomic-scale organization of surface groups. We hypothesize that this spatial distribution, beyond overall composition, plays a decisive role in governing surface stability and interfacial behavior.
  To test this hypothesis, we employ a multi-scale simulation workflow combining density functional theory, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and machine-learned force fields (MLFFs). This approach allows us to explore a range of spatial patterns of OH/CH3 functionalization on the a-quartz (0001) surface. We evaluate the impact of spatial arrangements on mixing energy, hydrogen bonding networks, and vibrational properties with high accuracy and robustness.
  Our results reveal that spatial patterning strongly influences surface stability and interfacial structure. A thermodynamically favored unpaired configuration emerges near 67 % CH3 substitution, where isolated OH groups form secondary hydrogen bonds through reorientation toward subsurface oxygen atoms. This rearrangement induces a characteristic blue shift in OH stretching frequencies, indicating weaker H-bonding. These effects are absent in clustered arrangements. By establishing a clear link between functional group patterning and interfacial behavior, our work uncovers the underlying mechanisms to guide and accelerate the rational design of silica-based materials and coatings, directly relevant to colloid and interface science.</description>

Abstract: Zero- and two-dimensional crystal defects form in open statistical ensembles, such as the grand canonical, that are usually inaccessible with conventional simulation techniques. This longstanding challenge is overcome with a new Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method that samples energy-biased gradual transformations. The method enables free energy calculations for nonideal point defects and the direct prediction of finite-temperature interface structures.</description>

      <title>Scaling High-Performance Nanoribbon Transistors with Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoscale transistors require aggressive reduction of all channel dimensions: length, width, and thickness. While monolayer two-dimensional semiconductors (2DS) offer ultimate thickness scaling, good performance has largely been achieved only in micrometer-wide channels. Here, we demonstrate both $\it{n}$- and $\it{p}$-type nanoribbon transistors based on monolayer 2DS, fabricated using a multi-patterning process, reaching channel widths and lengths down to 25-30 nm. 'Anchored' contacts improve device yield, while nanoscale imaging, including tip-enhanced photoluminescence, reveals minimal edge degradation. The devices reach on-state currents up to 560, 420, and 130 $\mu$A $\mu$m$^{-1}$ at 1 V drain-to-source voltage for $\it{n}$-type MoS$_{2}$, WS$_{2}$, and $\it{p}$-type WSe$_{2}$, respectively, integrated with thin high-$\kappa$ dielectrics. These results surpass prior reports for single-gated nanoribbons, the WS$_{2}$ by over 100 times, even in normally-off (enhancement-mode) transistors. Taken together, these findings suggest that top down patterned 2DS nanoribbons are promising building blocks for future nanosheet transistors.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic H-Atom Scattering Channels on Ge(111) Elucidated by the Hierarchical Equations of Motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic and molecular scattering at semiconductor interfaces plays a central role in surface chemistry and catalysis, yet predictive simulations remain challenging due to strong nonadiabatic effects causing the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Here, we present fully quantum simulations of H-atom scattering from the Ge(111)c(2x8) rest site using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) with matrix product states (MPS). The system is modeled by mapping a density functional theory (DFT) potential energy surface onto a Newns-Anderson Hamiltonian. Our simulations reproduce the experimentally observed bimodal kinetic energy distributions, capturing both elastic and energy-loss channels. By systematically examining atom-surface coupling, incident energy, and isotope substitution, we identify the strong-coupling regime required to recover the experimental energy-loss profile. This regime suppresses the elastic peak, implying additional site-specific scattering channels in the observed elastic peak. Deuterium substitution further produces a subtle shift in the energy-loss peak, consistent with experiment. These results establish HEOM as a rigorous framework for quantum surface scattering, capable of capturing nonadiabatic dynamics beyond electronic friction and perturbative approaches.</description>

      <title>Influence of Exchange-Correlation Functionals and Neural Network Architectures on Li$^+$-Ion Conductivity in Solid-State Electrolyte from Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Machine-Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques for materials simulations, machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) have become a powerful tool that complements first-principles calculations by enabling high-accuracy molecular dynamics simulations over extended timescales. Typically, MLFFs are trained on data generated from density functional theory (DFT) using a specific exchange-correlation (XC) functional, with the goal of reproducing DFT-level properties. However, the uncertainties in MLFF-based simulations--arising from variations in both MLFF model architectures and the choice of XC functionals--remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we construct MLFF models of different architectures trained on DFT data from both semilocal and hybrid functionals to describe Li$^+$ diffusion in the solid-state electrolyte Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl. We systematically investigate how different XC functionals influence the Li$^+$ diffusion coefficient. To reduce statistical uncertainty, the mean squared displacements are averaged over 300 independent molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of 70 ps each, yielding statistical variations below $1\%$. This enables a clear assessment of the respective influences of the functional and the MLFF model. Due to its tendency to underestimate band gaps and migration barriers, the semilocal functional predicts consistently higher Li$^+$ diffusion coefficients, compared to the hybrid functional. Furthermore, comparisons among various neural network methods reveal that the differences in predicted diffusion coefficients arising from different network architectures are of the same order of magnitude as those caused by different functionals, indicating that the choice of the network model itself substantially influences the MLFF predictions. This observation calls from an urgent need for standardized protocols to minimize model-dependent biases in MLFF-based MD.</description>

      <title>A survey of active learning in materials science: Data-driven paradigm for accelerating the research pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of materials composition, structure, and processing spaces is constrained by high dimensionality and the cost of data acquisition. While machine learning has supported property prediction and design, its effectiveness depends on labeled data, which remains expensive to generate via experiments or high-fidelity simulations. Improving data efficiency is thus a central concern in materials informatics.
  Active learning (AL) addresses this by coupling model training with adaptive data acquisition. Instead of static datasets, AL iteratively prioritizes candidates based on uncertainty, diversity, or task-specific objectives. By guiding data collection under limited budgets, AL offers a structured approach to decision-making, complementing physical insight with quantitative measures of informativeness.
  Recently, AL has been applied to computational simulation, structure optimization, and autonomous experimentation. However, the diversity of AL formulations has led to fragmented methodologies and inconsistent assessments. This Review provides a concise overview of AL methods in materials science, focusing on their role in improving data efficiency under realistic constraints. We summarize key methodological principles, representative applications, and persistent challenges, aiming to clarify the scope and limitations of AL as a practical tool within contemporary materials informatics.</description>

      <title>Geometric dependence of exchange bias in tilted three-dimensional CoFe/IrMn microwires</title>

Abstract: The exchange bias (EB) effect, arising from interfacial coupling between ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF) layers, induces a unidirectional magnetic anisotropy and underpins a wide range of spintronic functionalities. Extending the EB effect to three-dimensional (3D) architectures enables investigation of interfacial coupling in non-planar structures, which is a key step toward realizing spintronic functionalities beyond planar systems. Achieving this requires the fabrication of FM/AF bilayers with smooth interfaces and well-defined thicknesses on non-planar scaffolds, together with suitable characterization methods. In this work, we realize exchange-biased 3D FM/AF microwires by combining two-photon lithography with magnetron sputtering. CoFe/IrMn bilayers are deposited on microwire scaffolds with inclination angles of 0 deg, 30 deg, 45 deg relative to the substrate, and their magnetization reversal is probed using dark-field magneto-optical Kerr effect (DF-MOKE) magnetometry. We find that the EB and coercive fields vary in a characteristic way with the inclination angle, consistent with the systematic reduction in film thickness expected from inclined directional deposition. In addition, the EB magnitude is influenced by the combined effects of surface roughness of non-planar geometries and the directional growth of the bilayer, highlighting the importance of 3D scaffold surface quality for integrating magnetic multilayers. These results provide insight into the growth and magnetic behavior of sputter-deposited magnetic multilayers with functional interfaces on 3D geometries.</description>

      <title>An information-matching approach to optimal experimental design and active learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02740v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Odd-parity altermagnetism through sublattice currents: From Haldane-Hubbard model to general bipartite lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the sublattice currents as a feasible route to odd-parity altermagnetism (ALM), where nonrelativistic collinear spin splitting occurs in the bands as an odd function of momentum. In contrast to previously classified ALMs, the sublattice currents break the time-reversal symmetry in the nonmagnetic crystal structure and allow for such odd-parity spin splitting. A representative example is the Haldane-Hubbard model at half filling. Although the compensated collinear magnetic ground state was previously recognized as antiferromagnetism, we show that sublattice currents induce spin splitting in the bands and therefore turn it into an odd-parity ALM. Interestingly, its topological version serves as an example of ALM Chern insulator. We further generalize the Haldane-Hubbard model to common two- and three-dimensional bipartite lattices. With spin splitting from sublattice currents, the compensated collinear magnetic ground states at half filling are generally odd-parity ALM.</description>

Abstract: Olivine comprises approximately 70 $\%$ by volume of the Earth's upper mantle, making it likely that it controls the mechanical, electrical and seismic properties of the upper mantle. All rocks are composed of crystals separated by grain boundaries, which affect their overall conductivity, strength and viscosity. Here, we present a study of forsterite (Mg$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$) polycrystals synthesised between 1150 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C to obtain samples with different grain sizes. The grain boundary plane distributions (GBPD) were analysed by SEM and EBSD. A reversible change in the GBPD is observed between 1290 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C. The GBPD shows that the most commonly occurring grain boundary planes are {0kl}-type at 1290 $^{\circ}$C and below, while at 1390 $^{\circ}$C, (010) grain boundary planes dominate the average crystal habitus. The least common planes at all temperatures are (100). This reversible transition in the dominant grain boundary plane type is evidence for a temperature-dependent complexion transition occurring between 1290 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C. It is well established that different grain boundary crystallographies are related to different grain boundary properties. We relate the observed grain boundary complexion transition to differences in grain boundary properties observed in previous studies and suggest their influence on bulk rock properties.</description>

These amorphous birefringent heterostructures were fabricated through plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of three oxides, effectively breaking the centrosymmetry on the nanoscale. We observe a dependence of the optical nonlinearity on the thickness variation of three constituent materials, SiO$_2$, TiO$_2$, and Al$_2$O$_3$, ranging from tens of nanometers to the atomic scale, and these thin films exhibit second-order susceptibility at their interfaces. Our findings reveal that the enhancement of nonlinear optical properties is strongly correlated with a high density of layers and superior interface quality, where the interface second-order nonlinearity transitions to bulk-like second-harmonic generation. An effective bulk second-order susceptibility of $\chi_{zzz} = 2.0 \pm 0.2$~pm/V at the wavelength of 1032~nm is achieved, comparable to typical values for conventional monocrystalline nonlinear materials.</description>

      <title>Niobium's intrinsic coherence length and penetration depth revisited using low-energy muon spin spectroscopy and secondary-ion mass spectrometry</title>

Abstract: We report direct, simultaneous measurements of the London penetration depth ($\lambda_L$) and Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) coherence length ($\xi_0$) in oxygen-doped niobium, with impurity concentrations spanning the "clean" to "dirty" limits. Two depth-resolved techniques - low-energy muon spin spectroscopy (LE-$\mu$SR) and secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) - were used to quantify the element's Meissner screening profiles, analyzed within a framework that accounts for nonlocal electrodynamics. The analysis indicates intrinsic length scales of $\lambda_L = 29.1(10)$ nm and $\xi_0 = 39.9(25)$ nm, corresponding to a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter of $\kappa = 0.70(5)$. The obtained $\lambda_L$ and $\kappa$ values, accurately quantified at the nanoscale, are smaller than values commonly used in applications and modeling, and indicate that clean niobium lies at the boundary between type-I and type-II superconductivity, supporting the contemporary view that its intrinsic state may be type-I.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Jahn--Teller Transitions in Correlated Oxides with Monte Carlo Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09705</link>

Abstract: Jahn--Teller (JT) distortions are a key driver of physical properties in many correlated oxide materials. Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different materials depending on crystal structure; in LaMnO$_3$ the transition has generally been interpreted as order-disorder, whereas in layered nickelates $A$NiO$_2$ ($A$=Li,Na) there is a displacive transition. Alternatively, recent theoretical work has suggested that previous attributions of order-disorder may in fact be a consequence of phonon anharmonicity, rather than persistence of JT distortions, which would suggest that the displacive transition may be more common than currently believed. In this work, we run Monte Carlo simulations with a simple Hamiltonian which is modified to include terms dependent on the JT amplitude $\rho$, which is allowed to vary within the simulation \textit{via} the Metropolis algorithm. Our simulations yield distributions of JT amplitudes consistent with displacive rather than order-disorder behaviour for both perovskites and layered nickelates, suggesting that displacive-like JT transitions may be more common than previously assumed in both perovskites and layered nickelates. We also find significant differences between the transition observed for perovskites compared with layered nickelates, which we attribute to differing extensivity of configurational entropy on the two lattices, showing the crucial role of lattice geometry in determining behaviour.</description>
