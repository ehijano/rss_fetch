      <title>Giant post-flare loops in active regions with extremely strong coronal magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report for the first time the detection of thermal free-free emission from post-flare loops at 34GHz in images from the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH). We studied 8 loops, 7 of which were from regions with extremely strong coronal magnetic field reported by Fedenev et al. (2023). Loop emission was observed in a wide range of wavelength bands, up to soft X-rays, confirming their multi-temperature structure and was associated with noise storm emission in metric wavelengths. The comparison of the 17GHz emission with that at 34GHz, after a calibration correction of the latter, showed that the emission was optically thin at both frequencies. We describe the structure and evolution of the loops and we computed their density, obtaining values for the top of the loops between 1 and 6 x 10^10 cm^-3, noticeably varying from one loop to another and in the course of the evolution of the same loop system; these values have only a weak dependence on the assumed temperature, 2 x 10^6 K in our case, as we are in the optically thin regime. Our density values are above those reported from EUV observations, which go up to about 10^10 cm^-3. This difference could be due to the fact that different emitting regions are sampled in the two domains and/or due to the more accurate diagnostics in the radio range, which do not suffer from inherent uncertainties arising from abundances and non-LTE excitation/ionization equilibria. We also estimated the magnetic field in the loop tops to be in the range of 10 to 30G.</description>

Abstract: The chemical makeup of our solar system is a reflection of Galactic chemical evolution in the local interstellar medium (ISM) over the past ~9 Ga before the formation of the solar system. Although the incorporated ISM dust was mostly destroyed during the solar system formation, a small fraction of the ISM dust, known as presolar grains, is preserved in pristine extraterrestrial materials and identified through their exotic isotopic compositions, pointing to their formation in gas outflows or explosions of ancient stars. Since their stellar birth at more than 4.6 Ga, presolar grains have borne witness to a diverse array of astrophysical and cosmochemical processes. In this chapter, I will review recent progress in utilizing the isotopic and structural compositions of presolar grains to constrain physical mixing processes and dust formation in stars, stellar nucleosynthesis, ISM processes, and the origin and evolution of the solar system.</description>

      <title>Understanding the variability of helium abundance in the solar corona using three-fluid modeling and UV observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variability of helium abundance in the solar corona and the solar wind is an important signature of solar activity, solar cycle, solar wind sources, as well as coronal heating processes. Motivated by recently reported remote sensing UV imaging observations by Helium Resonance Scattering in the Corona and Heliosphere (HERSCHEL) payload sounding rocket of helium abundance in inner corona on 14-Sep-2009 near solar minimum, we present the results of the first three-dimensional three-fluid (electrons, protons, alpha particles) model of tilted coronal streamer belt and slow solar wind that illustrate the various processes leading to helium abundance differentiation and variability. We find good qualitative agreement between the three-fluid model and the coronal helium abundances variability reported from UV observations of streamers, providing insight on the effects of the physical processes, such as heating, gravitational settling and inter-species Coulomb friction in the out-flowing solar wind that produce the observed features. The study impacts our understanding of the origins of the slow solar wind.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength view of massive binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high luminosity of massive, early-type stars drives strong stellar winds through line scattering of the stars continuum radiation. Their momenta contribute substantially to the dynamics and energetics of the ambient interstellar medium in galaxies. The detailed multi-wavelength study of massive O-type and Wolf-Rayet binaries is essential to explore the hydrodynamics of the shocks formed in the stellar outflows and wind structure. Further, deep analysis of some of the interesting phenomena like particle acceleration and dust formation associated with hot stars winds provides a global view of stellar outflows. In this context, a few massive binaries have been explored using photometric and spectroscopic measurements in different wavebands. This paper highlights important insights gained from investigating massive binaries with several ground and space-based facilities.</description>

      <title>X-raying the zeta Tau binary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Be star zeta Tau was recently reported to be a gamma Cas analog; that is, it displays an atypical (bright and hard) X-ray emission. The origin of these X-rays remains debated.The first X-ray observations indicated a very large absorption of the hot plasma component (N_H~ 10^{23}/cm^2). This is most probably related to the edge-on configuration of the zeta Tau disk. If the X-ray emission arises close to the companion, an orbital modulation of the absorption could be detected as the disk comes in and out of the line of sight. New XMM-Newton data were obtained to characterize the high-energy properties of zeta Tau in more detail. They are complemented by previous Chandra and SRG/eROSITA observations as well as by optical spectroscopy and TESS photometry. The high-quality XMM-Newton data reveal the presence of a faint soft X-ray emission, which appears in line with that recorded for non-gamma Cas Be stars. In addition, zeta Tau exhibits significant short-term variability at all energies, with larger amplitudes at lower frequencies (``red noise''), as is found in X-ray data of other gamma Cas stars. Transient variability (softness dip, low-frequency signal) may also be detected at some epochs. In addition, between X-ray exposures, large variations in the spectra are detected in the 1.5-4.keV energy band. They are due to large changes in absorption toward the hottest (9keV) plasma. These changes are not correlated with either the orbital phase or the depth of the shell absorption of the Halpha line. These observed properties are examined in the light of proposed gamma Cas models.</description>

      <title>Search and Study of the Brightest Stars in the Galaxy IC 342</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have selected candidate massive stars in the galaxy IC 342 based on archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope and images from the 2 m telescope at the Natioal Astronomical Observatory Rozhen, Bulgaria. Spectral observations of 24 out of 27 selected stars are carried out with the 6 m BTA telescope at the SAO RAS and with the 3.5 m Apache Point Observatory telescope (USA) as part of the program for searching bright massive stars in galaxies outside the Local Group. Our analysis reveals that 12 objects have spectra lacking prominent features, except for the emission lines of the surrounding nebulae and are identified as single supergiants of classes O9 to F5 or spatially unresolved young compact clusters. One source with an absorption spectrum probably belongs to our Galaxy. The spectra of seven other objects show features typical of Wolf-Rayet stars or compact clusters containing Wolf-Rayet stars. Another source is a compact supernova remnant. Two other objects are tentatively classified as cold LBV candidates, and one object is classified as a B[e]-supergiant candidate.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of the umbral boundary during sunspot decay. Comparative study of multiple datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of the umbra-penumbra (UP) boundary of sunspots and the boundary of pores at various evolutionary stages have been characterised using datasets from different instruments. We aim to study the differences between the intensity and vector magnetic field properties derived from Hinode/SP and SDO/HMI observations of a decaying sunspot. We analysed the sunspot embedded in AR 12797 during six days in 30 SP/Hinode scans and 704 HMI/SDO for both regular maps and HMI_dcon. We studied the correlation of the magnetic properties and continuum intensity in the datasets within the spot, and at the UP boundary. We examined the decaying process using the full temporal resolution of the HMI_dcon maps. We find a good correspondence between the magnetic properties in the SP and HMI_dcon maps, but the continuum intensity of the spots in the SP maps is 0.04I_qs brighter than in the HMI_dcon maps. The influence of scattered light in the HMI maps makes it the least ideal dataset for studying the boundary of spots without a penumbra. The properties at the UP boundary evolve slowly during the sunspot decay stage, while the penumbra still provides some stability. In contrast, they respond more abruptly to areal changes in the naked-spot stage. During the sunspot decay, we find linear decay in the area and in the magnetic flux. Moreover, the umbra shows two characteristic decaying processes: a slow decay during the first three days, and a sudden fast decay during the final dissipation of the penumbra. We find indications of a 3.5h lag between the dissipation of the vertical fields in the umbral region and the photometric decay of the umbral area. The differences found in the continuum intensity and in the vertical component of the magnetic field, Bver, between the analysed datasets explain the discrepancies among the Bver values found at the boundaries of umbrae in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Optically Quiet, But FUV Loud: Results from comparing the far-ultraviolet predictions of flare models with TESS and HST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The far-ultraviolet (FUV) flare activity of low-mass stars has become a focus in our understanding of the exoplanet atmospheres and how they evolve. However, direct detection of FUV flares and measurements of their energies and rates are limited by the need for space-based observations. The difficulty of obtaining such observations may push some works to use widely available optical data to calibrate multi-wavelength spectral models that describe UV and optical flare emission. These models either use single temperature blackbody curves to describe this emission, or combine a blackbody curve with archival spectra. These calibrated models would then be used to predict the FUV flare rates of low-mass stars of interest. To aid these works, we used TESS optical photometry and archival HST FUV spectroscopy to test the FUV predictions of literature flare models. We tested models for partially (M0-M2) and fully convective (M4-M5) stars, 40 Myr and field age stars, and optically quiet stars. We calculated FUV energy correction factors that can be used to bring the FUV predictions of tested models in line with observations. A flare model combining optical and NUV blackbody emission with FUV emission based on HST observations provided the best estimate of FUV flare activity, where others underestimated the emission at all ages, masses and activity levels, by up to a factor of 104 for combined FUV continuum and line emission and greater for individual emission lines. We also confirmed previous findings that showed optically quiet low-mass stars exhibit regular FUV flares.</description>

      <title>The earliest phases of CNO enrichment in galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The recent detection of nitrogen-enhanced, metal-poor galaxies at high redshift by the James Webb Space Telescope has sparked renewed interest in exploring the chemical evolution of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (the CNO elements) at early times, prompting fresh inquiries into their origins. Aims. The main goal of this paper is to shed light onto the early evolution of the main CNO isotopes in our Galaxy and in young distant systems, such as GN-z11 at z=10.6. Methods. To this aim, we incorporate a stochastic star-formation component into a chemical evolution model calibrated with high-quality Milky Way (MW) data, focusing on the contribution of Population III (Pop III) stars to the early chemical enrichment. Results. By comparing the model predictions with CNO abundance measurements from high-resolution spectroscopy of an homogeneous sample of Galactic halo stars, we first demonstrate that the scatter observed in the metallicity range -4.5 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt;-1.5 can be explained by pre-enrichment from Pop III stars that explode as supernovae (SNe) with different initial masses and energies. Then, by exploiting the chemical evolution model, we provide testable predictions for log(C/N), log(N/O), and log(C/O) vs. log(O/H)+12 in MW-like galaxies observed at different cosmic epochs/redshifts. Finally, by calibrating the chemical evolution model to replicate the observed properties of GN-z11, we provide an alternative interpretation of its log(N/O) abundance ratio, demonstrating that its high N content can be reproduced through enrichment from high-mass faint Pop III SNe. Conclusions. Stochastic chemical enrichment from primordial stars explains both the observed scatter in CNO abundances in MW halo stars and the exceptionally high N/O ratios in some distant galaxies. These findings emphasize the critical role of Pop III stars in shaping early chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>Inner walls or vortices? Crescent-shaped asymmetries in ALMA observations of protoplanetary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crescent-shaped asymmetries are common in millimetre observations of protoplanetary discs and are usually attributed to vortices or dust overdensities. However, they often appear on a single side of the major axis and roughly symmetric about the minor axis, suggesting a geometric origin. In this work, we interpret such asymmetries as emission from the exposed inner cavity walls of inclined discs and use them to characterise their vertical extent. Here we focus on the discs around CIDA 9 and RY Tau, first modelling their observations in visibility space with a simple geometric prescription for the walls, and then exploring more detailed radiative transfer models. Accounting for the wall emission yields significantly better residuals than purely axisymmetric models, and we estimate the dust scale height of these systems to be 0.4 au at 37 au for CIDA 9 and 0.2 au at 12 au for RY Tau. Finally, we identify crescent-shaped asymmetries in twelve discs, nine of which have constraints on their orientation - in all cases, the asymmetry appears on the far-side of the disc, lending support to the hypothesis that they are due to their inner rims. Modelling this effect in larger samples of discs will help to build a statistical view of their vertical structure.</description>

      <title>MagMar III -- Resisting the Pressure, Is the Magnetic Field Overwhelmed in NGC6334I?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on ALMA observations of polarized dust emission at 1.2 mm from NGC6334I, a source known for its significant flux outbursts. Between five months, our data show no substantial change in total intensity and a modest 8\% variation in linear polarization, suggesting a phase of stability or the conclusion of the outburst. The magnetic field, inferred from this polarized emission, displays a predominantly radial pattern from North-West to South-East with intricate disturbances across major cores, hinting at spiral structures. Energy analysis of CS$(J=5 \rightarrow 4)$ emission yields an outflow energy of approximately $3.5\times10^{45}$ ergs, aligning with previous interferometric studies. Utilizing the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, we determined magnetic field strengths ranging from 1 to 11 mG, averaging at 1.9 mG. This average increases to 4 $\pm 1$ mG when incorporating Zeeman measurements. Comparative analyses using gravitational, thermal, and kinetic energy maps reveal that magnetic energy is significantly weaker, possibly explaining the observed field morphology.
  We also find that the energy in the outflows and the expanding cometary {\HII} region is also larger than the magnetic energy, suggesting that protostellar feedback maybe the dominant driver behind the injection of turbulence in NGC6334I at the scales sampled by our data. The gas in NGC6334I predominantly exhibits supersonic and trans-Alfvenic conditions, transitioning towards a super-Alfvenic regime, underscoring a diminished influence of the magnetic field with increasing gas density. These observations are in agreement with prior polarization studies at 220 GHz, enriching our understanding of the dynamic processes in high-mass star-forming regions.</description>

Abstract: Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will revolutionize our understanding of the Galactic Bulge with its Galactic Bulge Time Domain survey. At the same time, Rubin Observatories's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will monitor billions of stars in the Milky Way. The proposed Roman survey of the Galactic Plane, with its NIR passbands and exquisite spacial resolution, promises groundbreaking insights for a wide range of time-domain galactic astrophysics. In this white paper, we describe the scientific returns possible from the combination of the Roman Galactic Plane Survey with the data from LSST.</description>

      <title>Cross-scale energy transfer from fluid-scale Alfv\'en waves to kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves in the Earth's magnetopause boundary layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In space plasmas, large-amplitude Alfv\'en waves can drive compressive perturbations, accelerate ion beams, and lead to plasma heating and the excitation of ion acoustic waves at kinetic scales. This energy channelling from fluid to kinetic scales represents a complementary path to the classical turbulent cascade. Here, we present observational and computational evidence to validate this hypothesis by simultaneously resolving the fluid-scale Alfv\'en waves, kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves, and their imprints on ion velocity distributions in the Earth's magnetopause boundary layer. We show that two coexisting compressive modes, driven by the magnetic pressure gradients of Alfv\'en waves, not only accelerate the ion tail population to the Alfv\'en velocity, but also heat the ion core population near the ion acoustic velocity and generate Debye-scale ion acoustic waves. Thus, Alfv\'en-acoustic energy channeling emerges as a viable mechanism for plasma heating near plasma boundaries where large-amplitude Alfv\'en waves are present.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is something about inverse-square laws that makes them fail at extremities. The inverse-square law, which is used commonly in studying the irradiance on exoplanets fails at the extreme case of planets closer than 0.01 AU. Therefore, in order to correctly predict possible climate states of such systems, we need a new model which accurately calculates angles subtended by various surface elements and integrate the generalized equation. A direct consequence of such a model is the shift of the terminator about 20 degrees beyond the poles. The irradiance at the poles is about 100-200 kW/m2 higher than what is predicted by the inverse-square law. This work therefore becomes crucial because it underscores the need to modify the current GCM models. The error in the numerical integration values of irradiance is less than one percent making our estimate very reliable.</description>

Abstract: We analyse photometric data of nine supernovae (SNe) in filters V, R and I obtained during observational campaigns at the OAUNI site in 2016, 2017 and 2023. The calibrated magnitudes of the observed SNe were compared with their respective light curves available in the literature to study their evolution after their maximum brightness. In some cases, the supernova color-color diagnostic diagram was used to determine our observation date and correctly locate our magnitudes on the light curves. For this purpose, the use of supernova light curve templates, as well as reference supernovae, was also helpful. This work allowed us to verify the feasibility of performing precision astronomical photometry at the OAUNI.</description>

      <title>Magnetometry: solving the fundamental ambiguity from line pair inversion</title>

Abstract: All magnetic field vector measurements lead to ambiguous results. We show that observations in two different lines belonging to the same multiplet but having different absorption coefficients so that they are formed at two different depths like Fe I 6302.5 A and 6301.5 A, enable the resolution of the azimuth ambiguity remaining from the Zeeman signal interpretation. What is measured by interpretation of the Zeeman effect is the magnetic field H, and not the divergence-free magnetic induction B. We analyze how the anisotropy of the photosphere, which is strongly stratified due to gravity and density at the star surface, affects divH and how the ambiguity resolution has to be performed in these conditions. As a consequence, two ambiguity-resolved field vector maps are obtained at two different but close altitudes, which enable the derivation of the current density full vector via curlH=J. This reveals the horizontal component of the current density, which is generally found markedly larger than the better known vertical one. We observe some systematical trends, of which we present examples in the paper, like circular currents wrapping spots clockwise about a positive polarity spot and anticlockwise about a negative polarity spot and strong horizontal current components crossing active region neutral lines. We finally remark that the Na I D1 and D2 lines form another such line pair. We propose them as an access to the low chromosphere where they are formed. However, a better spatial resolution for both observations and analysis would probably be necessary in such a medium.</description>

      <title>The Santa Barbara Binary-Disk Code Comparison</title>

Abstract: We have performed numerical calculations of a binary interacting with a gas disk, using eleven different numerical methods and a standard binary-disk setup. The goal of this study is to determine whether all codes agree on a numerically converged solution, and to determine the necessary resolution for convergence and the number of binary orbits that must be computed to reach an agreed-upon relaxed state of the binary-disk system. We find that all codes can agree on a converged solution (depending on the diagnostic being measured). The zone spacing required for most codes to reach a converged measurement of the torques applied to the binary by the disk is roughly 1% of the binary separation in the vicinity of the binary components. For our disk model to reach a relaxed state, codes must be run for at least 200 binary orbits, corresponding to about a viscous time for our parameters, $0.2 (a^2 \Omega_B /\nu)$ binary orbits, where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity. We did not investigate dependence on binary mass ratio, eccentricity, disk temperature, or disk viscosity; therefore, these benchmarks may act as guides towards expanding converged solutions to the wider parameter space but might need to be updated in a future study that investigates dependence on system parameters. We find the most major discrepancies between codes resulted from the dimensionality of the setup (3D vs 2D disks). Beyond this, we find good agreement in the total torque on the binary between codes, although the partition of this torque between the gravitational torque, orbital accretion torque, and spin accretion torque depends sensitively on the sink prescriptions employed. In agreement with previous studies, we find a modest difference in torques and accretion variability between 2D and 3D disk models. We find cavity precession rates to be appreciably faster in 3D than in 2D.</description>

      <title>Extreme Solar Flare Prediction Using Residual Networks with HMI Magnetograms and Intensitygrams</title>

Abstract: Solar flares, especially C, M, and X class, pose significant risks to satellite operations, communication systems, and power grids. We present a novel approach for predicting extreme solar flares using HMI intensitygrams and magnetograms. By detecting sunspots from intensitygrams and extracting magnetic field patches from magnetograms, we train a Residual Network (ResNet) to classify extreme class flares. Our model demonstrates high accuracy, offering a robust tool for predicting extreme solar flares and improving space weather forecasting. Additionally, we show that HMI magnetograms provide more useful data for deep learning compared to other SDO AIA images by better capturing features critical for predicting flare magnitudes. This study underscores the importance of identifying magnetic fields in solar flare prediction, marking a significant advancement in solar activity prediction with practical implications for mitigating space weather impacts.</description>

      <title>Observations and detectability of young Suns' flaring and CME activity in optical spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sun's history is still a subject of interest to modern astrophysics. Observationally constrained CME rates of young solar analogues are still lacking, as those require dedicated monitoring. We present medium resolution optical spectroscopic monitoring of a small sample of bright and prominent solar analogues over a period of three years using the 0.5m telescope at observatory Lustb\"uhel Graz (OLG) of the University of Graz, Austria. The aim is the detection of flares and CMEs from those spectra. In more than 1700 hours of spectroscopic monitoring we found signatures of four flares and one filament eruption on EK Dra which has been reported in previous literature, but we complementarily extended the data to cover the latter phase. The other stars did not reveal detectable signatures of activity. For these non-detections we derive upper limits of occurrence rates of very massive CMEs, which are detectable with our observational setup, ranging from 0.1 to 2.2 per day , but these may be even smaller than the given rates considering observational biases. Furthermore, we investigate the detectability of flares/CMEs in OLG spectra by utilizing solar 2D H{\alpha} spectra from MEES solar observatory. We find that solar-sized events are not detectable within our observations. By scaling up the size of the solar event, we show that with a fractional active region area of 18% in residual spectra and 24% in equivalent width time series derived from the same residuals that solar events are detectable if they had hypothetically occurred on HN Peg.</description>
