      <title>Global Bounds for the Error in Solutions of Linear Hyperbolic Systems due to Inaccurate Boundary Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive global estimates for the error in solutions of linear hyperbolic systems due to inaccurate boundary geometry. We show that the error is bounded by data and bounded in time when the solutions in the true and approximate domains are bounded. We show that boundary data evaluation errors due to the incorrect locations of the boundaries are secondary effects, whereas the primary errors are from the Jacobian and metric terms. In two space dimensions, specifically, we show that to lowest order the errors are proportional to the errors in the boundary curves and their derivatives. The results illustrate the importance of accurately approximating boundaries, and they should be helpful for high-order mesh generation and the design of optimization algorithms for boundary approximations.</description>

      <title>The Geometric Refinement Transform: A Novel Uncountably Infinite Transform Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel and general class of continuous transforms based on hierarchical Voronoi based refinement schemes. The resulting transform space generalizes classical approaches such as wavelets and Radon transforms by incorporating parameters of refinement multiplicity, dispersion, and rotation. We rigorously establish key properties of the transform including completeness, uniqueness, invertibility, closure, and stability using frame bounds over functions of bounded variation and define a natural inner product structure emerging in L2. We identify regions of parameter space that recover known transforms, including multiscale wavelet decompositions and the generalized Radon transform. Applications are discussed across a range of disciplines, with particular emphasis on entropy formulations. Notably, the transform remains well behaved on geometrically complex and even non convex domains, where traditional methods may struggle. Despite the complexity of the underlying geometry, the coefficient spectrum reveals structure, offering insight even in highly irregular settings.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Lagrangian scheme for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the numerical approximation of time-dependent, possibly degenerate, second-order Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations in bounded domains with nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. It is well known that convergence towards the exact solution of the equation, considered here in the viscosity sense, holds if the scheme is monotone, consistent, and stable. While standard finite difference schemes are, in general, not monotone, the so-called semi-Lagrangian schemes are monotone by construction. On the other hand, these schemes make use of a wide stencil and, when the equation is set in a bounded domain, this typically causes an overstepping of the boundary and hence the loss of consistency. We propose here a semi-Lagrangian scheme defined on an unstructured mesh, with a suitable treatment at grid points near the boundary to preserve consistency, and show its convergence for problems where the viscosity solution can even be discontinuous. We illustrate the numerical convergence in several tests, including degenerate and first-order equations.</description>

      <title>Second order divergence constraint preserving schemes for two-fluid relativistic plasma flow equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-fluid relativistic plasma flow equations combine the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics with Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic fields, which involve divergence constraints for the magnetic and electric fields. When developing numerical schemes for the model, the divergence constraints are ignored, or Maxwell's equations are reformulated as Perfectly Hyperbolic Maxwell's (PHM) equations by introducing additional equations for correction potentials. In the latter case, the divergence constraints are preserved only as the limiting case.
  In this article, we present second-order numerical schemes that preserve the divergence constraint for electric and magnetic fields at the discrete level. The schemes are based on using a multidimensional Riemann solver at the vertices of the cells to define the numerical fluxes on the edges. The second-order accuracy is obtained by reconstructing the electromagnetic fields at the corners using a MinMod limiter. The discretization of Maxwell's equations can be combined with any consistent and stable discretization of the fluid parts. In particular, we consider entropy-stable schemes for the fluid part. The resulting schemes are second-order accurate, entropy stable, and preserve the divergence constraints of the electromagnetic fields. We use explicit and IMEX-based time discretizations. We then test these schemes using several one- and two-dimensional test cases. We also compare the divergence constraint errors of the proposed schemes with schemes having no divergence constraints treatment and schemes based on the PHM-based divergence cleaning.</description>

      <title>Which variables of a numerical problem cause ill-conditioning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a broad class of numerical problems that can be defined as the solution of a system of (nonlinear) equations for a subset of the dependent variables. Given a system of the form $F(x,y,z) = c$ with multivariate input $x$ and dependent variables $y$ and $z$, we define and give concrete expressions for the condition number of solving for a value of $y$ such that $F(x,y,z) = c$ for some unspecified $z$. This condition number can be used to determine which of the dependent variables of a numerical problem are the most ill-conditioned. We show how this can be used to explain the condition number of the problem of solving for all dependent variables, even if the solution is not unique. The concepts are illustrated with Tucker decomposition of tensors as an example problem.</description>

      <title>Consistent splitting SAV schemes for finite element approximations of incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consistent splitting schemes are among the most accurate pressure segregation methods, incurring no splitting errors or spurious boundary conditions. Nevertheless, their theoretical properties are not yet fully understood, especially when finite elements are used for the spatial discretisation. This work proposes a simple scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) technique that, when combined with standard finite elements in space, guarantees unconditional stability for first- and second-order consistent splitting schemes. The framework is implicit-explicit (IMEX) and only requires solving linear transport equations and a pressure Poisson problem per time step. Furthermore, pressure stability is attained with respect to a stronger norm than in classical projection schemes, which allows eliminating the inf-sup compatibility requirement on the velocity-pressure pairs. The accuracy of the new framework is assessed through numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of local sensitivity analysis, also referred to as the perturbation approach for uncertainty quantification, to Bayesian inverse problems. More precisely, we show how moments of random variables with respect to the posterior distribution can be approximated efficiently by asymptotic expansions. This is under the assumption that the measurement operators and prediction functions are sufficiently smooth and their corresponding stochastic moments with respect to the prior distribution exist. Numerical experiments are presented to the illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On computing the zeros of a class of Sobolev orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fast and weakly stable method for computing the zeros of a particular class of hypergeometric polynomials is presented. The studied hypergeometric polynomials satisfy a higher order differential equation and generalize Laguerre polynomials. The theoretical study of the asymptotic distribution of the spectrum of these polynomials is an active research topic. In this article we do not contribute to the theory, but provide a practical method to contribute to further and better understanding of the asymptotic behavior. The polynomials under consideration fit into the class of Sobolev orthogonal polynomials, satisfying a four--term recurrence relation. This allows computing the roots via a generalized eigenvalue problem. After condition enhancing similarity transformations, the problem is transformed into the computation of the eigenvalues of a comrade matrix, which is a symmetric tridiagonal modified by a rank--one matrix. The eigenvalues are then retrieved by relying on an existing structured rank based fast algorithm. Numerical examples are reported studying the accuracy, stability and conforming the efficiency for various parameter settings of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Quantum Neural Network Restatement of Markov Jump Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the many challenges in exploratory data analysis, artificial neural networks have motivated strong interests in scientists and researchers both in theoretical as well as practical applications. Among sources of such popularity of artificial neural networks the ability of modeling non-linear dynamical systems, generalization, and adaptation possibilities should be mentioned. Despite this, there is still significant debate about the role of various underlying stochastic processes in stabilizing a unique structure for data learning and prediction. One of such obstacles to the theoretical and numerical study of machine intelligent systems is the curse of dimensionality and the sampling from high-dimensional probability distributions. In general, this curse prevents efficient description of states, providing a significant complexity barrier for the system to be efficiently described and studied. In this strand of research, direct treatment and description of such abstract notions of learning theory in terms of quantum information be one of the most favorable candidates. Hence, the subject matter of these articles is devoted to problems of design, adaptation and the formulations of computationally hard problems in terms of quantum mechanical systems. In order to characterize the microscopic description of such dynamics in the language of inferential statistics, covariance matrix estimation of d-dimensional Gaussian densities and Bayesian interpretation of eigenvalue problem for dynamical systems is assessed.</description>

      <title>A normalized gradient flow method for computing ground states of spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze an efficient and accurate numerical method for computing ground states of spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) by using the normalized gradient flow (NGF). In order to successfully extend the NGF to spin-2 BECs which has five components in the vector wave function but with only two physical constraints on total mass conservation and magnetization conservation, two important techniques are introduced for designing the proposed numerical method. The first one is to systematically investigate the ground state structure and property of spin-2 BECs within a spatially uniform system, which can be used on how to properly choose initial data in the NGF for computing ground states of spin-2 BECs. The second one is to introduce three additional projection conditions based on the relations between the chemical potentials, together with the two existing physical constraints, such that the five projection parameters used in the projection step of the NGF can be uniquely determined. Then a backward-forward Euler finite difference method is adapted to discretize the NGF. We prove rigorously that there exists a unique solution of the nonlinear system for determining the five projection parameters in the full discretization of the NGF under a mild condition on the time step size. Extensive numerical results on ground states of spin-2 BECs with different types of phases and under different potentials are reported to show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed numerical method and to demonstrate several interesting physical phenomena on ground states of spin-2 BECs.</description>

      <title>A theoretical study on the effect of mass lumping on the discrete frequencies in immersogeometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In structural dynamics, mass lumping techniques are commonly employed for improving the efficiency of explicit time integration schemes and increasing their critical time step constrained by the largest discrete frequency of the system. For immersogeometric methods, Leidinger \cite{leidinger2020explicit} first showed in 2020 that for sufficiently smooth spline discretizations, the largest frequency was not affected by small trimmed elements if the mass matrix was lumped, a finding later supported by several independent numerical studies. This article provides a rigorous theoretical analysis aimed at unraveling this property. By combining linear algebra with functional analysis, we derive sharp analytical estimates capturing the behavior of the largest discrete frequency for lumped mass approximations and various trimming configurations. Additionally, we also provide estimates for the smallest discrete frequency, which has lately drawn closer scrutiny. Our estimates are then confirmed numerically for 1D and 2D problems.</description>

      <title>A Linear-complexity Tensor Butterfly Algorithm for Compressing High-dimensional Oscillatory Integral Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a multilevel tensor compression algorithm called tensor butterfly algorithm for efficiently representing large-scale and high-dimensional oscillatory integral operators, including Green's functions for wave equations and integral transforms such as Radon transforms and Fourier transforms. The proposed algorithm leverages a tensor extension of the so-called complementary low-rank property of existing matrix butterfly algorithms. The algorithm partitions the discretized integral operator tensor into subtensors of multiple levels, and factorizes each subtensor at the middle level as a Tucker-type interpolative decomposition, whose factor matrices are formed in a multilevel fashion. For a $d$-dimensional integral operator discretized into a $2d$-mode tensor with $n^{2d}$ entries, the overall CPU time and memory requirement scale as $O(n^d)$, in stark contrast to the $O(n^d\log n)$ requirement of existing matrix algorithms such as matrix butterfly algorithm and fast Fourier transforms (FFT), where $n$ is the number of points per direction. When comparing with other tensor algorithms such as quantized tensor train (QTT), the proposed algorithm also shows superior CPU and memory performance for tensor contraction. Remarkably, the tensor butterfly algorithm can efficiently model high-frequency Green's function interactions between two unit cubes, each spanning 512 wavelengths per direction, which represents over $512\times$ larger problem sizes than existing butterfly algorithms. On the other hand, for a problem representing 64 wavelengths per direction, which is the largest size existing algorithms can handle, our tensor butterfly algorithm exhibits 200x speedups and $30\times$ memory reduction comparing with existing ones. Moreover, the tensor butterfly algorithm also permits $O(n^d)$-complexity FFTs and Radon transforms up to $d=6$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>A numerical algorithm for computing the zeros of parabolic cylinder functions in the complex plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A numerical algorithm (implemented in Matlab) for computing the zeros of the parabolic cylinder function $U(a,z)$ in domains of the complex plane is presented. The algorithm uses accurate approximations to the first zero plus a highly efficient method based on a fourth-order fixed point method with the parabolic cylinder functions computed by Taylor series and carefully selected steps, to compute the rest of the zeros. For $|a|$ small, the asymptotic approximations are complemented with a few fixed point iterations requiring the evaluation of $U(a,z)$ and $U'(a,z)$ in the region where the complex zeros are located. Liouville-Green expansions are derived to enhance the performance of a computational scheme to evaluate $U(a,z)$ and $U'(a,z)$ in that region. Several tests show the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical algorithm.</description>

      <title>The Numerical Approximation of Caputo Fractional Derivative of Higher Orders Using A Shifted Gegenbauer Pseudospectral Method: Two-Point Boundary Value Problems of the Bagley Torvik Type Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a new framework for approximating Caputo fractional derivatives (FDs) of any positive order using a shifted Gegenbauer pseudospectral (SGPS) method. By transforming the Caputo FD into a scaled integral of the $m$th-derivative of the Lagrange interpolating polynomial (with $m$ being the ceiling of the fractional order $\alpha$), we mitigate the singularity near zero, improving stability and accuracy. The method links $m$th-derivatives of shifted Gegenbauer (SG) polynomials with SG polynomials of lower degrees, allowing for precise integration using SG quadratures. We employ orthogonal collocation and SG quadratures in barycentric form to obtain an accurate and efficient approach for solving fractional differential equations. We provide error analysis showing that the SGPS method is convergent in a semi-analytic framework and conditionally convergent with exponential rate for smooth functions in finite-precision arithmetic. This exponential convergence improves accuracy compared to wavelet-based, operational matrix, and finite difference methods. The SGPS method is flexible, with adjustable SG parameters for optimal performance. A key contribution is the fractional SG integration matrix (FSGIM), which enables efficient computation of Caputo FDs via matrix-vector multiplications and accelerates the SGPS method through pre-computation and storage. The method remains within double-precision limits, making it computationally efficient. It handles any positive fractional order $\alpha$ and outperforms existing schemes in solving Caputo fractional two-point boundary value problems (TPBVPs) of the Bagley-Torvik type.</description>

      <title>A Neural Network Enhanced Born Approximation for Inverse Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-harmonic, acoustic inverse scattering concerns the ill-posed and nonlinear problem of determining the refractive index of an inaccessible, penetrable scatterer based on far field wave scattering data. When the scattering is weak, the Born approximation provides a linearized model for recovering the shape and material properties of a scatterer. We develop two neural network algorithms--Born-CNN (BCNN) and CNN-Born (CNNB)--to correct the Born approximation when the scattering is not weak. BCNN applies a post-correction to the Born reconstruction, while CNNB pre-corrects the data. Both methods leverage the Born approximation's excellent fidelity in weak scattering, while extending its applicability beyond its theoretical limits. CNNB particularly exhibits a strong generalization to noisy and absorbing scatterers. Based on numerical tests, our approach provides alternative data-driven methods for obtaining the refractive index, extending the utility of the Born approximation to regimes where the traditional method fails.</description>

      <title>Control, Optimal Transport and Neural Differential Equations in Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the perspective of control theory, neural differential equations (neural ODEs) have become an important tool for supervised learning. In the fundamental work of Ruiz-Balet and Zuazua (SIAM REVIEW 2023), the authors pose an open problem regarding the connection between control theory, optimal transport theory, and neural differential equations. More precisely, they inquire how one can quantify the closeness of the optimal flows in neural transport equations to the true dynamic optimal transport. In this work, we propose a construction of neural differential equations that converge to the true dynamic optimal transport in the limit, providing a significant step in solving the formerly mentioned open problem.</description>

      <title>The mathematics of adversarial attacks in AI -- Why deep learning is unstable despite the existence of stable neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.06098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unprecedented success of deep learning (DL) makes it unchallenged when it comes to classification problems. However, it is well established that the current DL methodology produces universally unstable neural networks (NNs). The instability problem has caused an enormous research effort -- with a vast literature on so-called adversarial attacks -- yet there has been no solution to the problem. Our paper addresses why there has been no solution to the problem, as we prove the following mathematical paradox: any training procedure based on training neural networks for classification problems with a fixed architecture will yield neural networks that are either inaccurate or unstable (if accurate) -- despite the provable existence of both accurate and stable neural networks for the same classification problems. The key is that the stable and accurate neural networks must have variable dimensions depending on the input, in particular, variable dimensions is a necessary condition for stability.
  Our result points towards the paradox that accurate and stable neural networks exist, however, modern algorithms do not compute them. This yields the question: if the existence of neural networks with desirable properties can be proven, can one also find algorithms that compute them? There are cases in mathematics where provable existence implies computability, but will this be the case for neural networks? The contrary is true, as we demonstrate how neural networks can provably exist as approximate minimisers to standard optimisation problems with standard cost functions, however, no randomised algorithm can compute them with probability better than 1/2.</description>

      <title>Cutting Voxel Projector a New Approach to Construct 3D Cone Beam CT Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.09841v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel class of projectors for 3D cone beam tomographic reconstruction. Analytical formulas are derived to compute the relationship between the volume of a voxel projected onto a detector pixel and its contribution to the line integral of attenuation recorded by that pixel. Based on these formulas, we construct a near-exact projector and backprojector, particularly suited for algebraic reconstruction techniques and hierarchical reconstruction approaches with nonuniform voxel grids. Unlike traditional projectors, which assume a uniform grid with fixed voxel sizes, our method enables local refinement of voxels, allowing for adaptive grid resolution and improved reconstruction quality in regions of interest. We have implemented this cutting voxel projector along with a relaxed, speed-optimized version and compared them to two established projectors: a ray-tracing projector based on Siddon's algorithm and a TT footprint projector. Our results demonstrate that the cutting voxel projector achieves higher accuracy than the TT projector, especially for large cone beam angles. Furthermore, the relaxed version of the cutting voxel projector offers a significant speed advantage, while maintaining comparable accuracy. In contrast, Siddon's algorithm, tuned to achieve the same accuracy, is considerably slower than the cutting voxel projector. All algorithms are implemented in a GPU optimized open-source framework for algebraic reconstruction. GitHub repository of the project https://github.com/kulvait/KCT_cbct.</description>

      <title>Graph-Instructed Neural Networks for Sparse Grid-Based Discontinuity Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13652v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting the discontinuity interfaces of a discontinuous function. This approach leverages Graph-Instructed Neural Networks (GINNs) and sparse grids to address discontinuity detection also in domains of dimension larger than 3. GINNs, trained to identify troubled points on sparse grids, exploit graph structures built on the grids to achieve efficient and accurate discontinuity detection performances. We also introduce a recursive algorithm for general sparse grid-based detectors, characterized by convergence properties and easy applicability. Numerical experiments on functions with dimensions n = 2 and n = 4 demonstrate the efficiency and robust generalization properties of GINNs in detecting discontinuity interfaces. Notably, the trained GINNs offer portability and versatility, allowing integration into various algorithms and sharing among users.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Positive Definite Matrices over Symmetrized Tropical Algebras and Valued Ordered fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of positive definite and positive semi-definite symmetric matrices within the framework of symmetrized tropical algebra, an extension of tropical algebra adapted to ordered valued fields.
  We focus on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices. We
  prove that the eigenvalues of a positive (semi)-definite matrix in the tropical symmetrized setting coincide with its diagonal entries. Then, we show that the images by the valuation of the eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix over a valued nonarchimedean ordered field coincide with the eigenvalues of an associated matrix in the symmetrized tropical algebra. Moreover, under a genericity condition, we characterize the images of the eigenvectors under the map keeping track both of the nonarchimedean valuation and sign, showing that they coincide with tropical eigenvectors in the symmetrized algebra. These results offer new insights into the spectral theory of matrices over tropical semirings, and provide combinatorial formul\ae\ for log-limits of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of parametric families of real positive definite matrices.</description>

      <title>Code-Verification Techniques for an Arbitrary-Depth Electromagnetic Slot Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic slot models are employed to efficiently simulate electromagnetic penetration through openings in an otherwise closed electromagnetic scatterer. Such models, which incorporate varying assumptions about the geometry of the openings, are typically coupled with electromagnetic surface integral equations that model electromagnetic scattering. In this paper, we introduce novel code-verification approaches and build upon our previously developed methodologies to assess the correctness of the numerical implementation of an arbitrary-depth slot model. Through these approaches, we measure the convergence rates of the different interacting sources of numerical error and demonstrate the impact of various factors on these rates for several cases.</description>
