      <title>Differential Effects of Sequence-Local versus Nonlocal Charge Patterns on Phase Separation and Conformational Dimensions of Polyampholytes as Model Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformational properties of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are governed by a sequence-ensemble relationship. To differentiate the impact of sequence-local versus sequence-nonlocal features of an IDP's charge pattern on its conformational dimensions and its phase-separation propensity, the charge "blockiness'' $\kappa$ and the nonlocality-weighted sequence charge decoration (SCD) parameters are compared for their correlations with isolated-chain radii of gyration ($R_{\rm g}$s) and upper critical solution temperatures (UCSTs) of polyampholytes modeled by random phase approximation, field-theoretic simulation, and coarse-grained molecular dynamics. SCD is superior to $\kappa$ in predicting $R_{\rm g}$ because SCD accounts for effects of contact order, i.e., nonlocality, on dimensions of isolated chains. In contrast, $\kappa$ and SCD are comparably good, though nonideal, predictors of UCST because frequencies of interchain contacts in the multiple-chain condensed phase are less sensitive to sequence positions than frequencies of intrachain contacts of an isolated chain, as reflected by $\kappa$ correlating better with condensed-phase interaction energy than SCD.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-perplexity in One Fell Swoop for Protein Fitness Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein language models trained on the masked language modeling objective learn to predict the identity of hidden amino acid residues within a sequence using the remaining observable sequence as context. They do so by embedding the residues into a high dimensional space that encapsulates the relevant contextual cues. These embedding vectors serve as an informative context-sensitive representation that not only aids with the defined training objective, but can also be used for other tasks by downstream models. We propose a scheme to use the embeddings of an unmasked sequence to estimate the corresponding masked probability vectors for all the positions in a single forward pass through the language model. This One Fell Swoop (OFS) approach allows us to efficiently estimate the pseudo-perplexity of the sequence, a measure of the model's uncertainty in its predictions, that can also serve as a fitness estimate. We find that ESM2 OFS pseudo-perplexity performs nearly as well as the true pseudo-perplexity at fitness estimation, and more notably it defines a new state of the art on the ProteinGym Indels benchmark. The strong performance of the fitness measure prompted us to investigate if it could be used to detect the elevated stability reported in reconstructed ancestral sequences. We find that this measure ranks ancestral reconstructions as more fit than extant sequences. Finally, we show that the computational efficiency of the technique allows for the use of Monte Carlo methods that can rapidly explore functional sequence space.</description>

      <title>Constrained hidden Markov models reveal further Hsp90 protein states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series of conformational dynamics in proteins are usually evaluated with hidden Markov models (HMMs). This approach works well if the number of states and their connectivity is known. However, for the multi-domain protein Hsp90, a standard HMM analysis with optimization of the BIC (Bayesian information criterion) cannot explain long-lived states well. Therefore, here we employ constrained hidden Markov models, which neglect transitions between states by including assumptions. Gradually tuning a model with justified and focused changes allows us to improve its effectiveness and the score of the BIC. This became possible by analyzing time traces with several thousand observable transitions and, therefore, superb statistics. In this scheme, we also monitor the residences in the states reconstructed by the model, aiming to find exponentially distributed dwell times. We show how introducing new states can achieve these statistics but also point out limitations, e.g., for substantial similarity of two states connected to a common neighbor. One of the states displays the lowest free energy and could be the idle open "waiting state", in which Hsp90 waits for the binding of nucleotides, cochaperones, or clients.</description>
