      <title>Thermodynamics and transport in molten chloride salts and their mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molten salts are important in a number of energy applications, but the fundamental mechanisms operating in ionic liquids are poorly understood, particularly at higher temperatures. This is despite their candidacy for deployment in solar cells, next-generation nuclear reactors, and nuclear pyroprocessing. We perform extensive molecular dynamics simulations over a variety of molten chloride salt compositions at varying temperature and pressures to calculate the thermodynamic and transport properties of these liquids. Using recent developments in the theory of liquid thermophysical properties, we interpret our results on the basis of collective atomistic dynamics (phonons). We find that the properties of ionic liquids well explained by their collective dynamics, as in simple liquids. In particular, we relate the decrease of heat capacity, viscosity, and thermal conductivity to the loss of transverse phonons from the liquid spectrum. We observe the singular dependence of the isochoric heat capacity on the mean free path of phonons, and the obeyance of the Stokes-Einstein equation relating the viscosity to the mass diffusion. The transport properties of mixtures are more complicated compared to simple liquids, however viscosity and thermal conductivity are well guided by fundamental bounds proposed recently. The kinematic viscosity and thermal diffusivity lie very close to one another and obey the theoretical fundamental bounds determined solely by fundamental physical constants. Our results show that recent advances in the theoretical physics of liquids are applicable to molten salts mixtures, and therefore that the evolution and interplay of properties common to all liquids may act as a guide to a deeper understanding of these mixtures.</description>

      <title>Coherent signal detection in the statistical polarization regime enables high-resolution nanoscale NMR spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as quantum sensors capable of detecting nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals at unprecedented length scales, ranging from picoliter sample volumes down to single spins at the diamond surface. While high-resolution (few hertz) NV-NMR spectroscopy has been demonstrated at the micrometer scale, it has remained elusive at the nanometer scale. In this regime, only the detection of statistical polarization has been achieved, limiting spectral resolution due to molecular diffusion in liquid samples. Here, we demonstrate that detecting coherent signals from a uniformly polarized nanoscale sample, where polarization is enhanced beyond thermal levels, successfully overcomes this limitation, enabling single-digit hertz spectral resolution and the capacity to resolve scalar couplings. These results pave the way for high-resolution nanoscale NMR spectroscopy at interfaces, surfaces, and potentially even single molecules.</description>

      <title>Nuclear quantum effects slow down the energy transfer in biological light-harvesting complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess how quantum-mechanical effects associated with high-frequency chromophore vibrations influence excitation energy transfer in biological light-harvesting complexes. We begin with a mixed quantum-classical theory that combines a quantum description of the electronic motion with a classical description of the nuclear motion in a way that is consistent with the quantum-classical equilibrium distribution. We then include nuclear quantum effects in this theory with a variational polaron transformation of the high frequency vibrational modes. This approach is validated by comparison with fully quantum mechanical benchmark calculations and then applied to three prototypical biological light-harvesting complexes. We find that high-frequency vibrations delay the energy transfer in the quantum treatment, but accelerate it in the classical treatment. For the inter-ring transfer in the light-harvesting complex 2 of purple bacteria, the transfer rate is a factor of 1.5 times slower in the quantum treatment than the classical. The transfer timescale in the Fenna--Matthews--Olson complex is essentially the same in both cases, whereas the transfer in light-harvesting complex II of spinach is 1.7 times slower in the quantum treatment. In all cases, the quantum mechanical long-time equilibrium populations of the chromophores are well reproduced by the classical treatment, suggesting that nuclear quantum effects are generally unimportant for the directionality of energy transfer. Nuclear quantum effects do however reduce the transfer rate in systems with large excitonic energy gaps and strong vibronic coupling to high-frequency vibrational modes.</description>

      <title>Analysis of intramolecular modes of liquid water in two-dimensional spectroscopy: a classical hierarchical equations of motion approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) vibrational spectroscopy is a powerful means of investigating the structure and dynamics of complex molecules in condensed phases. However, even in theory, analysis of 2D spectra resulting from complex inter- and intra-molecular motions using only molecular dynamics methods is not easy. This is because molecular motions comprise complex multiple modes, and peaks broaden and overlap owing to various relaxation processes and inhomogeneous broadening. On the basis of an anharmonic multimode Brownian oscillator model with nonlinear system-bath coupling, we have developed an approach that simulates 2D spectra, taking into account arbitrary modes of intermolecular and intramolecular vibrations simultaneously. Although only two-mode quantum calculations are feasible with this model, owing to high computational costs, here we restrict ourselves to the classical case and perform three-mode calculations. We demonstrate the applicability of our method by calculating 2D correlation infrared spectra of water for symmetric stretching, antisymmetric stretching, and bending modes. The quantum effects of these results are deduced by comparing 2D quantum spectra previously obtained for two intramolecular modes with those obtained using our classical approach under the same physical conditions. The results show that the 2D spectra calculated by separating the stretching modes into symmetric and asymmetric modes provide better descriptions of peak profiles, such as the splitting of cross-peaks.</description>

      <title>Observations and Theoretical Calculations of 11-Year Cyclic Variations in Lower-Stratospheric Ozone Depletion and Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations and quantitative understanding of spatio-temporary variations in lower-stratospheric ozone and temperature can provide fingerprints for the mechanisms of ozone depletion and play an important role in testing the impact of non-halogen greenhouse gases on the ozone layer in climate models. Here we report from ground-based ozonesonde and satellite-based measurements since the 1960s and 1979 respectively that both lower-stratospheric ozone and temperature display pronounced 11-year cyclic variations over Antarctica and mid-latitudes, while no apparent cyclic variations over the tropics. These observations were unexpected from the chemistry-climate models (CCMs) but predicted by the cosmic-ray-driven electron-induced-reaction (CRE) model of ozone depletion. Remarkably, no-parameter CRE theoretical calculations give the ozone loss vertical profile in perfect agreement with observations at the Antarctic Syowa station and excellently reproduce time-series variations of both lower-stratospheric ozone and temperature in all global regions. Furthermore, the large lower-stratospheric ozone depletion over the tropics in the 1980s and 1990s is also reproduced by CRE calculations. Moreover, CRE calculations exhibit complex phenomena in future trends of lower-stratospheric ozone and temperature, which are strongly affected by the future trends of cosmic-ray fluxes. The latter might even lead to almost no recovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica and no returning to the 1980 level over the tropics by 2100. The results also strikingly demonstrate that both lower-stratospheric ozone and temperature are controlled by cosmic rays and ozone-depleting substances only. This study greatly improves quantitative understanding of ozone depletion and climate in the global lower stratosphere and offers new predictions on future trends.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Cation-Polyanion Coupling in Solid Electrolytes: Which Anion Motion Dominates Cation Transport?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium and sodium solid electrolytes feature polyanion frameworks and highly mobile cations. Understanding and quantifying the impact of polyanion dynamics on cations will help us to unravel the complex role that anion play in superionic conductors. However, no experimental or computational method can directly extract this information, as polyanion dynamics are always coupled with other factors that affect ion mobility. Here, we present the pioneering study that combines constraint algorithm and machine-learning molecular dynamics to quantitatively reveal the effects of polyanion translation, rotation, and vibration on cation mobility across a diverse material class. Ultralong-time, large-scale machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations with selective constraints on each anion motion mode unequivocally yield results at near room and elevated temperatures. In sharp contrast to the previous understanding that facile anion rotation primarily facilitates cation transport, the strong coupling between anion translation and vibration with cation diffusion has been unraveled for the first time; we find that translation, rotation, and vibration can each directly drive superionicity, with one typically dominant in each class of materials. Anion rotation dominates cation transport when the rotation frequency matches the cation hopping frequency, whereas anion translation prevails at higher and vibration at lower rotation frequencies. The impact of anion dynamics on cation diffusion becomes more prominent at lower temperatures.</description>

      <title>Mapping Transient Structures of Cyclo[18]Carbon by Computational X-Ray Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of cyclo[18]carbon (C$_{18}$), whether in its polyynic form with bond length alternation (BLA) or its cumulenic form without BLA, has long fascinated researchers, even prior to its successful synthesis. Recent studies suggest a polyynic ground state and a cumulenic transient state; however, the dynamics remain unclear and lack experimental validation. This study presents a first-principles theoretical investigation of the bond lengths ($R_1$ and $R_2$) dependent two-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) of C$_{18}$, concentrating on the ground state and carbon 1s ionized and excited states. We examine the potential of X-ray spectra for determining bond lengths and monitoring transient structures, finding that both X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and absorption (XAS) spectra are sensitive to these variations. Utilizing a library of ground-state minimum structures optimized with 14 different functionals, we observe that core binding energies predicted with the $\omega$B97XD functional can vary by 0.9 eV (290.3--291.2 eV). Unlike the ground state PES, which predicts minima at alternating bond lengths, the C1s ionized state PES predicts minima with equivalent bond lengths. In the XAS spectra, peaks 1$\pi^*$ and 2$\pi^*$ show a redshift with increasing bond lengths along the line where $R_1 = R_2$. Additionally, increasing $R_2$ (with $R_1$ fixed) results in an initial redshift followed by a blueshift, minimizing at $R_1 = R_2$. Major peaks indicate that both 1$\pi^*$ and 2$\pi^*$ arise from two channels: C1s$\rightarrow\pi^*_{z}$ (out-of-plane) and C1s$\rightarrow\pi^*_{xy}$ (in-plane) transitions at coinciding energies.</description>

      <title>Magnteically Induced Current Density from Numerical Positional Derivatives of Nucleus Independent Chemical Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instead of computing magneticallly induced (MI) current densities (CD) via the wave function and their quatum mechanical definition one can also use the differential form of the Ampere-Maxwell law to obtain them from spatial derivatives of the induced magnetic field. In magnetic molecular response calculations, the latter can be done by by numerical derivativation of the so called ``nucleus-independent chemical shifts'' (NICS) which are avaialable to many standard quantum chemical programs. The resulting numerical MICD data is in contrast to many numerical MICDs computed via the wave function route, virtually divergence-free.</description>

      <title>Refining Coarse-Grained Molecular Topologies: A Bayesian Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field. Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological domains.</description>

      <title>Modeling the time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging of halomethane photodissociation with \textit{ab initio} potential energy curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an effective theoretical model to simulate observables in time-resolved two-fragment Coulomb explosion experiments. The model employs the potential energy curves of the neutral molecule and the doubly charged cation along a predefined reaction coordinate to simulate the photodissociation process followed by Coulomb explosion. We compare our theoretical predictions with pump-probe experiments on iodomethane and bromoiodomethane. Our theory successfully predicts the two reaction channels in iodomethane photodissociation that lead to $\text{I}(^2\text{P}_{3/2})$ and $\text{I}^*(^2\text{P}_{1/2})$ products, showing excellent agreement with experimental delay-dependent kinetic energy release signals at large pump-probe delays. The theoretical kinetic energy release at small delays depends significantly on the choice of ionic states. By accounting for internal rotation, the kinetic energies of individual fragments in bromoiodomethane align well with experimental results. Furthermore, our theory confirms that two-fragment Coulomb explosion imaging cannot resolve different spin channels in bromoiodomethane photodissociation.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantitative Interpretation of 3D Atomic Force Microscopy at Solid-Liquid Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional atomic force microscopy (3D-AFM) has been a powerful tool to probe the atomic-scale structure of solid-liquid interfaces. As a nanoprobe moves along the 3D volume of interfacial liquid, the probe-sample interaction force is sensed and mapped, providing information on not only the solid morphology, but also the liquid density distribution. To date 3D-AFM force maps of a diverse set of solid-liquid interfaces have been recorded, revealing remarkable force oscillations that are typically attributed to solvation layers or electrical double layers. However, despite the high resolution down to sub-angstrom level, quantitative interpretation of the 3D force maps has been an outstanding challenge. Here we will review the technical details of 3D-AFM and the existing approaches for quantitative data interpretation. Based on evidences in recent literature, we conclude that the perturbation-induced AFM force paradoxically represents the intrinsic, unperturbed liquid density profile. We will further discuss how the oscillatory force profiles can be attributed to the probe-modulation of the liquid configurational entropy, and how the quantitative, atomic-scale liquid density distribution can be derived from the force maps.</description>

      <title>Gearing of nitrate ions in ammonium nitrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reorienting polyatomic ions such as NH4+ and NO3- exhibit weak magnetic fields because the ions at the extremities trace out current loops; if the periodic reorientations become long-range ordered (i.e. gearing of neighboring NO3-), then the magnetic susceptibility should exhibit a unique signature along the different crystallographic axes. For the case of ammonium nitrate NH4NO3, we report the presence of two successive sharp steps in the molar magnetic susceptibility along the a- and b-axes upon crossing its order-disorder phase transition (from phase IV to phase II). We suggest the first step pertains to the NO3- planes shifting away from facing only along the b-axis and onto the a-axis by 45{\deg}. The second step is attributed to the disordering (ungearing) of the NH4+ and NO3-. In contrast, only one step was observed in the magnetic susceptibility along the c-axis and its large magnitude suggest the NO3- remain weakly correlated even in phase I at 400 K. We also find evidence that the NH4+ become magnetically ordered (geared) along the c-axis only until phase V. The approach employed in this work can be extended to experimentally study the lattice dynamics of other solids possessing planar ions such as amphidynamic crystals.</description>

      <title>Investigating Discontinuous X-ray Irradiation as a Damage Mitigation Strategy for [M(COD)Cl]$_2$ Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of ever more intense and focused X-ray sources, including in laboratories, at synchrotrons, and at X-ray free electron lasers, radiation-induced sample change and damage are becoming increasingly challenging. Therefore, the exploration of possible mitigation strategies is crucial to continue to allow the collection of robust and repeatable data. One mitigation approach is the introduction of short, X-ray-free ``dark'' periods. However, it is unclear whether this strategy minimises damage or, in actuality, promotes it through a phenomenon called ``dark progression'', i.e. the increase or progression of radiation damage that occurs after the X-ray beam is turned off. This work discusses the influence of introducing dark periods and their duration on the radiation-induced changes in two model small-molecule catalysts, [Ir(COD)Cl]$_2$ and [Rh(COD)Cl]$_2$, exposed to X-ray radiation in powder diffraction (PXRD) and photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments. This provides, for the first time, insights into how damage progresses under varying radiation regimes and allows the distinction between the processes that affect the unit cell itself, the individual molecular units, and the respective atomic chemical environments. Furthermore, it provides the basis for informed decision-making in the design of future experiments where the need to minimise radiation-induced damage is crucial.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking and inversion-line spectroscopy in gas mixtures</title>

Abstract: According to quantum mechanics chiral molecules, that is molecules that rotate the polarization of light, should not exist. The simplest molecules which can be chiral have four or more atoms with two arrangements of minimal potential energy that are equivalent up to a parity operation. Chiral molecules correspond to states localized in one potential energy minimum and can not be stationary states of the Schr\"odinger equation. A possible solution of the paradox can be founded on the idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking. This idea was behind work we did previously involving a localization phase transition: at low pressure the molecules are delocalized between the two minima of the potential energy while at higher pressure they become localized in one minimum due to the intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Evidence for such a transition is provided by measurements of the inversion spectrum of ammonia and deuterated ammonia at different pressures. A previously proposed model gives a satisfactory account of the empirical results without free parameters. In this paper, we extend this model to gas mixtures. We find that also in these systems a phase transition takes place at a critical pressure which depends on the composition of the mixture. Moreover, we derive formulas giving the dependence of the inversion frequencies on the pressure. These predictions are susceptible to experimental test.</description>

      <title>Active Learning Enables Extrapolation in Molecular Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although generative models hold promise for discovering molecules with optimized desired properties, they often fail to suggest synthesizable molecules that improve upon the known molecules seen in training. We find that a key limitation is not in the molecule generation process itself, but in the poor generalization capabilities of molecular property predictors. We tackle this challenge by creating an active-learning, closed-loop molecule generation pipeline, whereby molecular generative models are iteratively refined on feedback from quantum chemical simulations to improve generalization to new chemical space. Compared against other generative model approaches, only our active learning approach generates molecules with properties that extrapolate beyond the training data (reaching up to 0.44 standard deviations beyond the training data range) and out-of-distribution molecule classification accuracy is improved by 79%. By conditioning molecular generation on thermodynamic stability data from the active-learning loop, the proportion of stable molecules generated is 3.5x higher than the next-best model.</description>

      <title>Establishing baselines for generative discovery of inorganic crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising avenue for materials discovery, yet its advantages over traditional methods remain unclear. In this work, we introduce and benchmark two baseline approaches - random enumeration of charge-balanced prototypes and data-driven ion exchange of known compounds - against three generative models: a variational autoencoder, a large language model, and a diffusion model. Our results show that established methods such as ion exchange perform comparably well in generating stable materials, although many of these materials tend to closely resemble known compounds. In contrast, generative models excel at proposing novel structural frameworks and, when sufficient training data is available, can more effectively target properties such as electronic band gap and bulk modulus while maintaining a high stability rate. To enhance the performance of both the baseline and generative approaches, we implement a post-generation screening step in which all proposed structures are passed through stability and property filters from pre-trained machine learning models including universal interatomic potentials. This low-cost filtering step leads to substantial improvement in the success rates of all methods, remains computationally efficient, and ultimately provides a practical pathway toward more effective generative strategies for materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Efficient periodic density functional theory calculations of charged molecules and surfaces using Coulomb kernel truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of charged molecules and surfaces are critical to applications in electro-catalysis, energy materials and related fields of materials science. DFT implementations such as the Vienna ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) compute the electrostatic potential under 3D periodic boundary conditions, necessitating charge neutrality. In this work, we implement 0D and 2D periodic boundary conditions to facilitate DFT calculations of charged molecules and surfaces respectively. We implement these boundary conditions using the Coulomb kernel truncation method. Our implementation computes the potential under 0D and 2D boundary conditions by selectively subtracting unwanted long-range interactions in the potential computed under 3D boundary conditions. By combining the Coulomb kernel truncation method with a computationally efficient padding approach, we remove nonphysical potentials from vacuum in 0D and 2D systems. To illustrate the computational efficiency of our method, we perform large supercell calculations of the formation energy of a charged chlorine defect on a sodium chloride (001) surface and perform long time-scale molecular dynamics simulations on a stepped gold (211) | water electrode-electrolyte interface.</description>

      <title>Inverted Temperature Gradients in Gold-Palladium Antenna-Reactor Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In addition to enhanced fields and possible charge transfer, the concentration of photothermal energy at the nanoscale is a foundation of plasmon-driven photochemistry. We demonstrate a further enhancement of heat localization during the dissipation of energy in a bimetallic antenna--reactor system with palladium satellites attached to a gold nanoparticle. After pulsed excitation of the gold core, the satellites collect nearly all photothermal energy and heat up by 180\,K while the light-absorbing gold core remains much colder. By comparing transient absorption dynamics of a series of bimetallic nanoparticles with a three-temperature model, we can precisely assess the temperatures of the electronic and vibrational subsystems. We find a strong inverted temperature gradient that opposes the direction of energy input and concentrates the light energy at the active catalytic nanosite.</description>

      <title>Foam stabilization in salt solutions : the role of capillary drainage and Marangoni stresses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long-standing question of why foaming is easier in seawater than in freshwater remains unresolved. In this study, we address this issue through precise interferometry single bubble experiments, demonstrating that the theory proposed by G. Marrucci (1969) provides a compelling explanation. Electrolyte solutions with varying concentrations of phosphate salts were used to study film formation and drainage, with thickness tracked by interferometry. In deionized water, bubbles rupture within seconds due to repaid dimple collapse. However, in phosphate salt solutions, bubbles persisted for several minutes. While surface tension gradients from evaporation-driven salt concentration gradients have been thought to create Marangoni stresses, our results show that despite film thinning being capillary-dominated, Marangoni-driven influx can be observed. Marrucci's theory explains this by showing that an increased interfacial area as the film thins, leads to higher salt concentration in the film due to Gibbs surface excess. This concentration gradient induces Marangoni stresses, causing flow reversal, increased film thickness, and enhanced foam stability. We show that Marrucci's theory has been incorrectly dismissed, and the predicted critical heights where fluid influx occurs closely match our findings and other studies using sodium chloride. Additionally, we extend the theory's applicability to foam films in non-aqueous film mixtures, highlighting its broader relevance.</description>

      <title>Predicting band gap from chemical composition: A simple learned model for a material property with atypical statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In solid-state materials science, substantial efforts have been devoted to the calculation and modeling of the electronic band gap. While a wide range of ab initio methods and machine learning algorithms have been created that can predict this quantity, the development of new computational approaches for studying the band gap remains an active area of research. Here we introduce a simple machine learning model for predicting the band gap using only the chemical composition of the crystalline material. To motivate the form of the model, we first analyze the empirical distribution of the band gap, which sheds new light on its atypical statistics. Specifically, our analysis enables us to frame band gap prediction as a task of modeling a mixed random variable, and we design our model accordingly. Our model formulation incorporates thematic ideas from chemical heuristic models for other material properties in a manner that is suited towards the band gap modeling task. The model has exactly one parameter corresponding to each element, which is fit using data. To predict the band gap for a given material, the model computes a weighted average of the parameters associated with its constituent elements and then takes the maximum of this quantity and zero. The model provides heuristic chemical interpretability by intuitively capturing the associations between the band gap and individual chemical elements.</description>

      <title>Production of linear alkanes via the solid-state hydrogenation of interstellar polyynes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly unsaturated carbon chains, including polyynes, have been detected in many astronomical regions and planetary systems. With the success of the QUIJOTE survey of the TMC-1, the community has seen a "boom" in the number of detected carbon chains. On the other hand, the Rosetta mission revealed the release of fully saturated hydrocarbons, C$_3$H$_8$, C$_4$H$_{10}$, C$_5$H$_{12}$, and (under specific conditions) C$_6$H$_{14}$ with C$_7$H$_{16}$, from the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The detection of the latter two is attributed to dust-rich events. Similarly, the analysis of samples returned from asteroid Ryugu by Hayabusa2 mission indicates the presence of long saturated aliphatic chains in Ryugu's organic matter. The surface chemistry of unsaturated carbon chains under conditions resembling those of molecular clouds can provide a possible link among these independent observations. However, laboratory-based investigations to validate such a chemistry is still lacking. In the present study, we aim to experimentally verify the formation of fully saturated hydrocarbons by the surface hydrogenation of C$_{2n}$H$_2$ ($n&gt;1$) polyynes under ultra-high vacuum conditions at 10 K. We undertook a two-step experimental technique. First, a thin layer of C$_2$H$_2$ ice was irradiated by UV-photons ($\geq$ 121 nm) to achieve a partial conversion of C$_2$H$_2$ into larger polyynes: C$_4$H$_2$ and C$_6$H$_2$. Afterwards, the obtained photoprocessed ice was exposed to H atoms to verify the formation of various saturated hydrocarbons. In addition to C$_2$H$_6$, which was investigated previously, the formation of larger alkanes, including C$_4$H$_{10}$ and (tentatively) C$_6$H$_{14}$, is confirmed by our study. A qualitative analysis of the obtained kinetic data indicates that hydrogenation of HCCH and HCCCCH triple bonds proceeds at comparable rates, given a surface temperature of 10 K.}</description>

Abstract: We have investigated the title question for both a subset of the W4-11 total atomization energies benchmark, and for the A24x8 noncovalent interactions benchmark. Overall, counterpoise corrections to post-CCSD(T) contributions are about two orders of magnitude less important than those to the CCSD(T) interaction energy. Counterpoise corrections for connected quadruple substitutions (Q) are negligible, and $(Q)_\Lambda - (Q)$ or $T_4 - (Q)$ especially so. In contrast, for atomization energies, the $T_3-(T)$ counterpoise correction can reach about 0.05 \kcalmol~for small basis sets like cc-pVDZ, thought it rapidly tapers off with cc-pVTZ and especially aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. It is reduced to insignificance by the extrapolation of $T_3-(T)$ applied in both W4 and HEAT thermochemistry protocols. In noncovalent dimers, the differential BSSE on post-CCSD(T) correlation contributions is negligible even in basis sets as small as the unpolarized split-valence cc-pVDZ(no d).</description>

      <title>Adaptive Kink Filtration: Achieving Asymptotic Size-Independence of Path Integral Simulations Utilizing the Locality of Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent method developments involving path integral simulations have come a long way in making these techniques practical for studying condensed phase non-equilibrium phenomena. One of the main difficulties that still needs to be surmounted is the scaling of the algorithms with the system dimensionality. The majority of recent techniques have only changed the order of this scaling (going from exponential to possibly a very high ordered polynomial) and not eased the dependence on the system size. In this current work, we introduce an adaptive kink filtration technique for path generation approach that leverages the locality of the interactions present in the system and the consequent sparsity of the propagator matrix to remove the asymptotic size dependence of the simulations for the propagation of reduced density matrices. This enables the simulation of larger systems at a significantly reduced cost. This technique can be used both for simulation of non-equilibrium dynamics and for equilibrium correlation functions, and is demonstrated here using examples from both -- simulating the excitonic dynamics in bacteriochlorophyll chains and their absorption and emission spectra. We show that the cost becomes constant with the dimensionality of the system. The only place where a system size-dependence still remains is the calculation of the dynamical maps or propagators which are important for the transfer tensor method. The cost of calculating this solvent-renormalized propagator is the same as the cost of propagating all the elements of the reduced density matrix, which scales as the square of the size. This adaptive kink-filtration technique promises to be instrumental in extending the affordability of path integral simulations for very large systems.</description>

Abstract: Identifying organic molecules with desirable properties from the extensive chemical space can be challenging, particularly when property evaluation methods are time-consuming and resource intensive. In this study, we illustrate this challenge by exploring the chemical space of large oligomers, constructed from monomeric building blocks, for potential use in organic photovoltaics (OPV). For this purpose, we developed a python package to search the chemical space using a building block approach: stk-search. We use stk-search (GitHub link) to compare a variety of search algorithms, including those based upon Bayesian optimization and evolutionary approaches. Initially, we evaluated and compared the performance of different search algorithms within a precomputed search space. We then extended our investigation to the vast chemical space of molecules formed of 6 building blocks (6-mers), comprising over $10^{14}$ molecules. Notably, while some algorithms show only marginal improvements over a random search approach in a relatively small, precomputed, search space, their performance in the larger chemical space is orders of magnitude better. Specifically, Bayesian optimization identified a thousand times more promising molecules with the desired properties compared to random search, using the same computational resources.</description>

      <title>Post-CCSD(T) corrections in the S66 noncovalent interactions benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For noncovalent interactions, it is generally assumed that CCSD(T) is nearly the exact solution within the 1-particle basis set. For the S66 noncovalent interactions benchmark, we present for the majority of species CCSDT and CCSDT(Q) corrections with a polarized double-zeta basis set. For hydrogen bonds, pure London complexes, and mixed-influence complexes, CCSD(T) benefits from error cancellation between (usually repulsive) higher-order triples, $T_3 - (T)$, and (almost universally attractive) connected quadruples, (Q). For $\pi$-stacking complexes, this cancellation starts breaking down and CCSD(T) overbinds; CCSD(T)$_\Lambda$ corrects the problem at the expense of London complexes. A fairly simple two-parameter model predicts CCSDT(Q)--CCSD(T) differences to 0.01 kcal/mol RMS, requiring no calculations that scale more steeply than $O(N^7)$.</description>

Abstract: The tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl radical (TTM) has inspired the synthesis of several luminescent diradicals and diradicaloids, providing an extraordinary opportunity to control the nature of the low-lying excited states by fine-tuning the diradical character. However, the photophysical properties of TTM-derived diradicals remain not fully understood yet. Here we present a combined theoretical and experimental investigation on TTM-derived diradicals to elucidate the origin of their luminescence. The theoretical analysis focuses on a series of symmetric TTM-derived diradicals with singlet ground state, featuring radical moieties linked by pi-conjugated spacers of different length. The nature of the lowest excited electronic states that control their photophysical behaviour is discussed in detail. The study is complemented by a complete spectroscopic characterization of the TTM-TTM diradical, synthesized using a novel, simpler and more efficient procedure exploiting the unique reactivity of TTM. The lowest excited states of the diradicals differ qualitatively from those of TTM: two novel low-lying states emerge in the diradical, due to charge resonance (CR) between the two radical units. The lowest CR state is a dark state for symmetric diradicals. The CR nature explains the blue-shifted emission observed by increasing the distance between the radical centres as seen in TTM-ph-TTM. This insight suggests different design strategies to improve the luminescence properties of TTM-derived diradicals</description>

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics simulations are essential tools for understanding the dynamic behavior of biomolecules, yet extracting meaningful molecular pathways from these simulations remains challenging due to the vast amount of generated data. In this work, we present Molecular Kinetics via Topology (MoKiTo), a novel approach that combines the ISOKANN algorithm to determine the reaction coordinate of a molecular system with a topological analysis inspired by the Mapper algorithm. Our strategy efficiently identifies and characterizes distinct molecular pathways, enabling the detection and visualization of critical conformational transitions and rare events. This method offers deeper insights into molecular mechanisms, facilitating the design of targeted interventions in drug discovery and protein engineering.</description>
