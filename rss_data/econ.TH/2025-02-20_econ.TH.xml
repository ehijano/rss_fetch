      <title>Legal routes for accomplishing corporate environmental compliance against the "carbon peaking and carbon neutrality" goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Against the macro-background of "carbon peaking and carbon neutrality" goals, eco-environment protection regulations are increasingly stricter. Facing high government regulatory risks and frequent environment lawsuits, corporate environmental compliance starts to play a vital role in healthy corporate operation. Law fulfillment routes constitute a critical part in corporate environmental compliance. Few academic scholars have conducted a profound analysis or discussion of legal accomplishment routes for corporate environmental compliances. As a matter of fact, legal routes for accomplishing corporate environmental compliance should be based proper theories concerning corporate environmental rights and obligations as well as dual layer nested governance structure (government environmental power and corporate environmental liabilities). Under the guidance of environmental jurisprudence, enterprises are responsible for setting up practical legal fulfillment routes for their environmental compliance-related rights and obligations. A diversified environmental governance layout composed of government regulation, enterprise self-discipline and social participation should be established. Within enterprises, effective legal routes should be developed for dealing with government regulatory risks and environment lawsuit risks at the same time.</description>

      <title>The probability of satisfying axioms: a non-binary perspective on economic design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a formal framework accounting for a widespread idea in the theory of economic design: analytically established incompatibilities between given axioms should be qualified by the likelihood of their violation. We define the degree to which rules satisfy an axiom, as well as several axioms, on the basis of a probability measure over the inputs of the rules. Armed with this notion of degree, we propose and characterize i) a criterion to evaluate and compare rules given a set of axioms, allowing the importance of each combination of axioms to differ, and ii) a criterion to measure the compatibility between given axioms, building on a analogy with cooperative game theory.</description>

      <title>Tell Me Why: Incentivizing Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common sense suggests that when individuals explain why they believe something, we can arrive at more accurate conclusions than when they simply state what they believe. Yet, there is no known mechanism that provides incentives to elicit explanations for beliefs from agents. This likely stems from the fact that standard Bayesian models make assumptions (like conditional independence of signals) that preempt the need for explanations, in order to show efficient information aggregation. A natural justification for the value of explanations is that agents' beliefs tend to be drawn from overlapping sources of information, so agents' belief reports do not reveal all that needs to be known. Indeed, this work argues that rationales-explanations of an agent's private information-lead to more efficient aggregation by allowing agents to efficiently identify what information they share and what information is new. Building on this model of rationales, we present a novel 'deliberation mechanism' to elicit rationales from agents in which truthful reporting of beliefs and rationales is a perfect Bayesian equilibrium.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Limited Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05546v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study limited strategic leadership. A collection of subsets covering the leader's action space determines her commitment opportunities. We characterize the outcomes resulting from all possible commitment structures of this kind. If the commitment structure is an interval partition, then the leader's payoff is bounded by her Stackelberg and Cournot payoffs. Under general commitment structures the leader may obtain a payoff that is less than her lowest Cournot payoff. We apply our results to a textbook duopoly model and elicit the commitment structures leading to consumer- and producer-optimal outcomes.</description>

      <title>Consumption Dependent Random Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a dynamic random utility model that allows for consumption dependence. We axiomatically analyze this model and find insights that allow us to distinguish between behavior that arises due to consumption dependence and behavior that arises due to state dependence. As part of our analysis, we show that it is impossible to distinguish between myopic and dynamically sophisticated agents when there are well defined marginal choices in each period. Building on our axiomatic analysis, we develop a revealed preference test for consumption dependent random utility. Our test can be implemented with real data, and we show that our test offers computational improvements over the natural extension of Kitamura and Stoye (2018) to our environment.</description>

      <title>T\^atonnement in Homothetic Fisher Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A prevalent theme in the economics and computation literature is to identify natural price-adjustment processes by which sellers and buyers in a market can discover equilibrium prices. An example of such a process is t\^atonnement, an auction-like algorithm first proposed in 1874 by French economist Walras in which sellers adjust prices based on the Marshallian demands of buyers. A dual concept in consumer theory is a buyer's Hicksian demand. In this paper, we identify the maximum of the absolute value of the elasticity of the Hicksian demand, as an economic parameter sufficient to capture and explain a range of convergent and non-convergent t\^atonnement behaviors in a broad class of markets. In particular, we prove the convergence of t\^atonnement at a rate of $O((1+\varepsilon^2)/T)$, in homothetic Fisher markets with bounded price elasticity of Hicksian demand, i.e., Fisher markets in which consumers have preferences represented by homogeneous utility functions and the price elasticity of their Hicksian demand is bounded, where $\varepsilon \geq 0$ is the maximum absolute value of the price elasticity of Hicksian demand across all buyers. Our result not only generalizes known convergence results for CES Fisher markets, but extends them to mixed nested CES markets and Fisher markets with continuous, possibly non-concave, homogeneous utility functions. Our convergence rate covers the full spectrum of nested CES utilities, including Leontief and linear utilities, unifying previously existing disparate convergence and non-convergence results. In particular, for $\varepsilon = 0$, i.e., Leontief markets, we recover the best-known convergence rate of $O(1/T)$, and as $\varepsilon \to \infty$, e.g., linear Fisher markets, we obtain non-convergent behavior, as expected.</description>

      <title>Robust Optimization of Rank-Dependent Models with Uncertain Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies distributionally robust optimization for a large class of risk measures with ambiguity sets defined by $\phi$-divergences. The risk measures are allowed to be non-linear in probabilities, are represented by a Choquet integral possibly induced by a probability weighting function, and include many well-known examples (for example, CVaR, Mean-Median Deviation, Gini-type). Optimization for this class of robust risk measures is challenging due to their rank-dependent nature. We show that for many types of probability weighting functions including concave, convex and inverse $S$-shaped, the robust optimization problem can be reformulated into a rank-independent problem. In the case of a concave probability weighting function, the problem can be further reformulated into a convex optimization problem with finitely many constraints that admits explicit conic representability for a collection of canonical examples. While the number of constraints in general scales exponentially with the dimension of the state space, we circumvent this dimensionality curse and provide two types of upper and lower bounds algorithms. They yield tight upper and lower bounds on the exact optimal value and are formally shown to converge asymptotically. This is illustrated numerically in two examples given by a robust newsvendor problem and a robust portfolio choice problem.</description>
