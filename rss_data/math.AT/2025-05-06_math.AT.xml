      <title>Cyclic polytopes, orientals, and correspondences: some aspects of higher Segal spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the role of higher Segal spaces at the interface of cyclic polytopes, orientals, and higher correspondences. Along the way we review examples from algebraic K-theory, show how cyclic polytopes provide a geometric model for the definition of orientals, and establish a characterization of higher Segal spaces as lax monadic structures in higher correspondence categories.</description>

      <title>THH(Z) and the image of J</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime number and $\mathrm{j}_p$ the $p$-complete connective image of J spectrum. We establish an equivalence of cyclotomic $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-rings $\mathrm{THH}(\mathbb{Z})^{\wedge}_p \simeq \mathrm{sh}(\mathrm{j}_p^{\mathrm{triv}})$ and an equivalence of $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-rings $\mathrm{TP}(\mathbb{Z})^{\wedge}_p \simeq \mathrm{j}_p^{\mathrm{t}\mathrm{S}^1}$. We also record a few applications of this: a new perspective, with some new information, on the description of $\mathrm{TC}(\mathbb{Z})^{\wedge}_p$ as a spectrum; height $1$ analogues of the fiber squares of Antieau-Mathew-Morrow-Nikolaus, resulting in new calculations in $\mathrm{K}(1)$-localized algebraic K-theory; and a proof of a slight refinement of the noncommutative crystalline-de Rham comparison result of Petrov-Vologodsky.</description>

      <title>A multiplicative version of the tom Dieck splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the classical tom Dieck splitting in equivariant stable homotopy theory is typically regarded as a formula for suspension spectra in the genuine equivariant stable category, it can be interpreted as a calculation of the fixed points of $G$-spectra that are derived pushforwards from the naive equivariant stable category. We then establish a corresponding multiplicative splitting formula for derived pushforwards of $N_{\infty}$ ring spectra. Just as the usual tom Dieck splitting characterizes the equivariant stable category associated to an $N_{\infty}$ operad $\mathcal{N}$, the multiplicative tom Dieck splitting characterizes the $G$-symmetric monoidal structure on the genuine equivariant stable category associated to $\mathcal{N}$.</description>

      <title>Filtered Topology and Persistence in Stable Homotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a category of filtered topological spaces and explore some of its homotopy theoretic properties, including a filtered analogue of CW approximation. With this, we define and study a filtered (weighted) variant of the Euler characteristic and show this is a `filtered homotopy invariant'. We then go on to use the recent work of Biran, Cornea and Zhang by considering a persistence Spanier-Whitehead category of filtered CW complexes and show this is a triangulated persistence category and discuss the fragmentation metrics induced by this structure. We go on to show that the K-group of this persistence category is isomorphic to the ring of Novikov polynomials and this isomorphism is induced by the weighted Euler characteristic. Finally, we discuss how these constructions extend to a filtered stable homotopy category and its relation to filtered/persistence homologies.</description>

      <title>Discrete signature tensors for persistence landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signature tensors of paths are a versatile tool for data analysis and machine learning. Recently, they have been applied to persistent homology, by embedding barcodes into spaces of paths. Among the different path embeddings, the persistence landscape embedding is injective and stable, however it loses injectivity when composed with the signature map. Here we address this by proposing a discrete alternative. The critical points of a persistence landscape form a time-series, of which we compute the discrete signature. We call this association the discrete landscape feature map (DLFM). We give results on the injectivity, stability and computability of the DLFM. We apply it to a knotted protein dataset, capturing sequence similarity and knot depth with statistical significance.</description>

Abstract: In this corrigendum to arXiv:2305.02973, we justify that the motivation behind Conjecture 5.1 is based on a mistaken notion. Moreover, we prove a stronger theorem that disproves the conjecture, and obtain an optimal gradient vector field on the matching complex of the complete graph of order 7.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between multiple polylogarithms on a torus and the Steinberg module of $\mathbb{Q}$, and show that multiple polylogarithms of depth $d$ and weight $n$ can be expressed via a single function $\mathrm{Li}_{n-d+1,1,\dots,1}(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_d)$. Using this connection, we give a simple proof of the Bykovski\u{\i} theorem, explain the duality between multiple polylogarithms and iterated integrals, and provide a polylogarithmic interpretation of the conjectures of Rognes and Church-Farb-Putman.</description>

      <title>Topology across Scales on Heterogeneous Cell Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiplexed imaging allows multiple cell types to be simultaneously visualised in a single tissue sample, generating unprecedented amounts of spatially-resolved, biological data. In topological data analysis, persistent homology provides multiscale descriptors of ``shape" suitable for the analysis of such spatial data. Here we propose a novel visualisation of persistence homology (PH) and fine-tune vectorisations thereof (exploring the effect of different weightings for persistence images, a prominent vectorisation of PH). These approaches offer new biological interpretations and promising avenues for improving the analysis of complex spatial biological data especially in multiple cell type data. To illustrate our methods, we apply them to a lung data set from fatal cases of COVID-19 and a data set from lupus murine spleen.</description>

      <title>Graded $p$-polar rings and the homology of $\Omega^n\Sigma^nX$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.05286v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an extension of previous ungraded work, we define a graded $p$-polar ring to be an analog of a graded commutative ring where multiplication is only allowed on $p$-tuples (instead of pairs) of elements of equal degree. We show that the free affine $p$-adic group scheme functor, as well as the free formal group functor, defined on $k$-algebras for a perfect field $k$ of characteristic $p$, factors through $p$-polar $k$-algebras. It follows that the same is true for any affine $p$-adic or formal group functor, in particular for the functor of $p$-typical Witt vectors. As an application, we show that the homology of the free $E_n$-algebra $H^*(\Omega^n\Sigma^n X;\mathbf F_p)$, as a Hopf algebra, only depends on the $p$-polar structure of $H^*(X;\mathbf F_p)$ in a functorial way.</description>

      <title>Operations on spectral partition Lie algebras and TAQ cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.15771v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine all natural operations and their relations on the homotopy groups of spectral partition Lie algebras, which coincide with $\mathbb{F}_p$-linear topological Andr\'{e}-Quillen cohomology operations at any prime. We construct unary operations and a shifted restricted Lie algebra structure on the homotopy groups of spectral partition Lie algebras. Then we prove a composition law for the unary operations, as well as a compatibility condition between unary operations and the shifted Lie bracket with restriction up to a unit for the restriction. Comparing with Brantner-Mathew's result on the ranks of the homotopy groups of free spectral partition Lie algebras, we deduce that these generate all natural operations, thereby also recovering unpublished results of Kriz and Basterra-Mandell on $\mathbb{F}_p$-linear TAQ cohomology operations. As a corollary, we determine the structure of natural operations on mod $p$ $\mathbb{S}$-linear TAQ cohomology.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian homology and homotopy colimit of classifying spaces for a diagram of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10822v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper considers non-Abelian homology groups for a diagram of groups introduced as homotopy groups of a simplicial replacement. It is proved that the non-Abelian homology groups of the group diagram are isomorphic to the homotopy groups of the homotopy colimit of the diagram of classifying spaces, with a dimension shift of 1. As an application, a method is developed for finding a nonzero homotopy group of least dimension for a homotopy colimit of classifying spaces. For a group diagram over a free category with a zero colimit, a criterion for the isomorphism of the first non-Abelian and first Abelian homology groups is obtained. It is established that the non-Abelian homology groups are isomorphic to the cotriple derived functors of the colimit functor defined on the category of group diagrams.</description>

Abstract: We introduce homotopy groups of digraphs that admit an intuitive description of grid structures, which is a variation of the GLMY homotopy groups introduced by Grigor'yan, Lin, Muranov and Yau in 2014. This direct approach enables a descriptive interpretation of GLMY theory in applications such as network science. Furthermore, we prove that there exists a long exact sequence of homotopy groups of digraphs associated to any based digraph map, that is, there exists a digraph version of the Puppe sequence.</description>

      <title>Geometric Bounds for Persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we offer a new perspective on persistent homology by integrating key concepts from metric geometry. For a given compact subset $\mathcal{X}$ of a Banach space $\mathbf{Y}$, we analyze the topological features arising in the family $\mathcal{N}_\bullet(\mathcal{X} \subset \mathbf{Y})$ of nested neighborhoods of $\mathcal{X}$ in $\mathbf{Y}$ and provide several geometric bounds on their persistence (lifespans).
  We begin by examining the lifespans of these homology classes in terms of their filling radii in $\mathbf{Y}$, establishing connections between these lifespans and fundamental invariants in metric geometry, such as the Urysohn width. We then derive bounds on these lifespans by considering the $\ell^\infty$-principal components of $\mathcal{X}$, also known as Kolmogorov widths.
  Additionally, we introduce and investigate the concept of extinction time of a metric space $\mathcal{X}$: the critical threshold beyond which no homological features persist in any degree. We propose methods for estimating the \v{C}ech and Vietoris-Rips extinction times of $\mathcal{X}$ by relating $\mathcal{X}$ to its convex hull and to its tight span, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19352v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building off of many recent advances in the subject by many different researchers, we describe a picture of A-equivariant chromatic homotopy theory which mirrors the now classical non-equivariant picture of Morava, Miller-Ravenel-Wilson, and Devinatz-Hopkins-Smith, where A is a finite abelian p-group. Specifically, we review the structure of the Balmer spectrum of the category of A-spectra, and the work of Hausmann-Meier connecting this to MU_A and equivariant formal group laws. Generalizing work of Bhattacharya-Guillou-Li, we introduce equivariant analogs of v_n-self maps, and generalizing work of Carrick and Balderrama, we introduce equivariant analogs of the chromatic tower, and give equivariant analogs of the smash product and chromatic convergence theorems. The equivariant monochromatic theory is also discussed. We explore computational examples of this theory in the case of A = C_2, where we connect equivariant chromatic theory with redshift phenomena in Mahowald invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.15390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the modal aspects of higher groups in Shulman's Cohesive Homotopy Type Theory. We show that every higher group sits within a modal fracture hexagon which renders it into its discrete, infinitesimal, and contractible components. This gives an unstable and synthetic construction of Schreiber's differential cohomology hexagon. As an example of this modal fracture hexagon, we recover the character diagram characterizing ordinary differential cohomology by its relation to its underlying integral cohomology and differential form data, although there is a subtle obstruction to generalizing the usual hexagon to higher types. Assuming the existence of a long exact sequence of differential form classifiers, we construct the classifiers for circle k-gerbes with connection and describe their modal fracture hexagon.</description>

      <title>Cycles in graphs and in hypergraphs: towards homology theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this expository paper we present some ideas of algebraic topology (more precisely, of homology theory) in a language accessible to non-specialists in the area. A $1$-cycle in a graph is a set $C$ of edges such that every vertex is contained in an even number of edges from $C$. It is easy to check that the sum (modulo $2$) of $1$-cycles is a $1$-cycle. We start from the following problems: to find
  $\bullet$ the number of all $1$-cycles in a given graph;
  $\bullet$ a small number of $1$-cycles in a given graph such that any $1$-cycle is the sum of some of them.
  We consider generalizations (of these problems) to graphs with symmetry, to $2$-cycles in $2$-dimensional hypergraphs, and to certain configuration spaces of graphs (namely, to the square and the deleted square).</description>

Abstract: We address the problem of estimating multiple modes of a multivariate density using persistent homology, a central tool in Topological Data Analysis. We introduce a method based on the preliminary estimation of the $H_0$-persistence diagram to infer the number of modes, their locations, and the corresponding local maxima. For broad classes of piecewise-continuous functions with geometric control on discontinuities loci, we identify a critical separation threshold between modes, also interpretable in our framework in terms of modes prominence, below which modes inference is impossible and above which our procedure achieves minimax optimal rates.</description>

Abstract: We establish Rezk completion functors for $\Theta_n$ spaces with respect to each and all of the completeness conditions. As a consequence, we obtain a characterization of Dwyer-Kan equivalences between Segal $\Theta_n$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Equilevel algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19343v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An equilevel algebra is a subalgebra of the space of smooth functions $f: M \to {\mathbb R}$ distinguished in this space by finitely many linear conditions of the type $f(x_i) = f(\tilde x_i)$, $x_i \neq \tilde x_i \in M$, or approximated by such subalgebras. For $M = S^1$ or ${\mathbb R}^1$, the regular points of the variety of all equilevel subalgebras of codimension $k$ in $C^\infty(M, {\mathbb R})$ are known in knot theory as $k$-chord diagrams. The whole of this variety completes the space of chord diagrams in the same way as the spaces of ideals of given codimensions in complete the configuration spaces. We describe cell structures of the varieties of all equilevel algebras up to the codimension three in $C^\infty(S^1, {\mathbb R})$ and compute their homology rings and characteristic classes of canonical vector bundles. We also give lower estimates of these rings for arbitrary $k$.</description>
