      <title>Physics aware machine learning for micromagnetic energy minimization: recent algorithmic developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore advanced machine learning techniques for minimizing Gibbs free energy in full 3D micromagnetic simulations. Building on Brown's bounds for magnetostatic self-energy, we revisit their application in the context of variational formulations of the transmission problems for the scalar and vector potential. To overcome the computational challenges posed by whole-space integrals, we reformulate these bounds on a finite domain, making the method more efficient and scalable for numerical simulation. Our approach utilizes an alternating optimization scheme for joint minimization of Brown's energy bounds and the Gibbs free energy. The Cayley transform is employed to rigorously enforce the unit norm constraint, while R-functions are used to impose essential boundary conditions in the computation of magnetostatic fields. Our results highlight the potential of mesh-free Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) when integrated with hard constraints, providing highly accurate approximations. These methods exhibit competitive performance compared to traditional numerical approaches, showing significant promise in computing magnetostatic fields and the application for energy minimization, such as the computation of hysteresis curves. This work opens the path for future directions of research on more complex geometries, such as grain structure models, and the application to large scale problem settings which are intractable with traditional numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Full-color nanorouter for high-resolution imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.16751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pixel scaling effects have been a major issue for the development of high-resolution color image sensors due to the reduced photoelectric signal and the color crosstalk. Various structural color techniques have been proposed and demonstrated the large freedom in color manipulation by the structure design. However, the optical efficiency and the color distortion limit the practical applications due to its intrinsic filtering mechanism. Instead, on-chip full-color routing is quite charming for improving the signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, a single-layer quick response code like nanorouter is proposed for the full-color light routing in a pixel level of image sensors. It shows much higher routing efficiency than various planar lens schemes for signal wavelength focusing. Moreover, over 60% signal enhancement with robust polarization insensitivity is obtained in all three primary color bands with a same nanorouter by a multi-objective optimization method. Negligible color distortion is observed from the reconstructed color image. Such a simple nanorouter structure is promising for the development of image sensor, photovoltaics and display.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Difference Method for Variable-Order Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An adaptive finite difference scheme for variable-order fractional-time subdiffusion equations in the Caputo form is studied. The fractional time derivative is discretized by the L1 procedure but using nonhomogeneous timesteps. The size of these timesteps is chosen by an adaptive algorithm in order to keep the local error bounded around a preset value, a value that can be chosen at will. For some types of problems this adaptive method is much faster than the corresponding usual method with fixed timesteps while keeping the local error of the numerical solution around the preset values. These findings turns out to be similar to those found for constant-order fractional diffusion equations.</description>

      <title>The effective use of BLAS interface for implementation of finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods of the ADER family, in particular finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods, are among the most accurate numerical methods for solving quasilinear PDE systems. The internal structure of ADER-DG and ADER-WENO numerical methods contains a large number of basic linear algebra operations related to matrix multiplication. At the moment, the main interface of software libraries for high-performance computing is BLAS. This paper presents an effective method for integration the standard functions of the BLAS interface into the implementation of these numerical methods. The calculated matrices are small matrices; at the same time, the proposed implementation makes it possible to effectively use existing JIT technologies. The proposed approach immediately operates on AoS, which makes it possible to efficiently calculate flux, source and non-conservative terms without need to carry out transposition. The obtained computational costs allowed to conclude that the effective implementation, based on the use of the JIT functions of the BLAS, outperformed both the implementation based on the general BLAS functions and the naive implementations by several times. At the same time, the complexity of developing an implementation based on the approach proposed in this work does not exceed the complexity of developing a naive optimized implementation.</description>

      <title>Robust State Estimation from Partial Out-Core Measurements with Shallow Recurrent Decoder for Nuclear Reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable, real-time state estimation in nuclear reactors is of critical importance for monitoring, control and safety. It further empowers the development of digital twins that are sufficiently accurate for real-world deployment. As nuclear engineering systems are typically characterised by extreme environments, their in-core sensing is a challenging task, even more so in Generation-IV reactor concepts, which feature molten salt or liquid metals as thermal carriers. The emergence of data-driven methods allows for new techniques for accurate and robust estimation of the full state space vector characterising the reactor (mainly composed by neutron fluxes and the thermal-hydraulics fields). These techniques can combine different sources of information, including computational proxy models and local noisy measurements on the system, in order to robustly estimate the state. This work leverages the Shallow Recurrent Decoder (SHRED) architecture to estimate the entire state vector of a reactor from three, out-of-core time-series neutron flux measurements alone. Specifically, the Molten Salt Fast Reactor, in the EVOL geometry (Evaluation and Viability of Liquid Fuel Fast Reactor System project), is demonstrated as a test case, with neutron flux measurements alone allowing for reconstruction of the 20 coupled field variables of the dynamics. This approach can further quantify the uncertainty associated with the state estimation due to its considerably low training cost on compressed data. The accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field in real-time makes this approach suitable for monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin.</description>

      <title>Self-Organizing Maps of Unbiased Ligand-Target Binding Pathways and Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interpretation of ligand-target interactions at atomistic resolution is central to most efforts in computational drug discovery and optimization. However, the highly dynamic nature of protein targets, as well as possible induced fit effects, makes difficult to sample many interactions effectively with docking studies or even with large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We propose a novel application of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) to address the sampling and dynamic mapping tasks, particularly in cases involving ligand flexibility and induced fit. The SOM approach offers a data-driven strategy to create a map of the interaction process and pathways based on unbiased MD. Furthermore, we show how the preliminary SOM mapping is complementary to kinetic analysis, both with the employment of network-based approaches and Markov State Models (MSM). We demonstrate the method by comprehensively mapping a large dataset of 640 {\mu}s of unbiased trajectories sampling the recognition process between the phosphorylated YEEI peptide and its high-specificity target Lck-SH2. The integration of SOM into unbiased simulation protocols significantly advances our understanding of the ligand binding mechanism. This approach serves as a potent tool for mapping intricate ligand-target interactions with unprecedented detail, thereby enhancing the characterization of kinetic properties crucial to drug design.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians: Reduced Memory Cost and Complexity Scaling via Tensor Hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only $2$. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning based high-bandwidth magnetic sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant growth of quantum technologies, and specifically quantum sensing, both in terms of the capabilities of advanced platforms and their applications. One of the leading platforms in this context is nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond, providing versatile, high-sensitivity, and high-resolution magnetic sensing. Nevertheless, current schemes for spin resonance magnetic sensing (as applied by NV quantum sensing) suffer from tradeoffs associated with sensitivity, dynamic range, and bandwidth. Here we address this issue, and implement machine learning tools to enhance NV magnetic sensing in terms of the sensitivity/bandwidth tradeoff in large dynamic range scenarios. We experimentally demonstrate this new approach, reaching an improvement in the relevant figure of merit by a factor of up to 5. Our results promote quantum machine learning protocols for sensing applications towards more feasible and efficient quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Tensor Network Potentials</title>

Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have made a significant contribution to the recent progress in the fields of computational materials and chemistry due to the MLIPs' ability of accurately approximating energy landscapes of quantum-mechanical models while being orders of magnitude more computationally efficient. However, the computational cost and number of parameters of many state-of-the-art MLIPs increases exponentially with the number of atomic features. Tensor (non-neural) networks, based on low-rank representations of high-dimensional tensors, have been a way to reduce the number of parameters in approximating multidimensional functions, however, it is often not easy to encode the model symmetries into them.
  In this work we develop a formalism for rank-efficient equivariant tensor networks (ETNs), i.e. tensor networks that remain invariant under actions of SO(3) upon contraction. All the key algorithms of tensor networks like orthogonalization of cores and DMRG-based algorithms carry over to our equivariant case. Moreover, we show that many elements of modern neural network architectures like message passing, pulling, or attention mechanisms, can in some form be implemented into the ETNs. Based on ETNs, we develop a new class of polynomial-based MLIPs that demonstrate superior performance over existing MLIPs for multicomponent systems.</description>

      <title>Prediction of excitable wave dynamics using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitable systems can exhibit a variety of dynamics with different complexity, ranging from a single, stable spiral to spiral defect chaos (SDC), during which spiral waves are continuously formed and destroyed. The corresponding reaction-diffusion models, including ones for cardiac tissue, can involve a large number of variables and can be time-consuming to simulate. Here we trained a deep-learning (DL) model using snapshots from a single variable, obtained by simulating a single quasi-periodic spiral wave and SDC using a generic cardiac model. Using the trained DL model, we predicted the dynamics in both cases, using timesteps that are much larger than required for the simulations of the underlying equations. We show that the DL model is able to predict the trajectory of a quasi-periodic spiral wave and that the SDC activaton patterns can be predicted for approximately one Lyapunov time. Furthermore, we show that the DL model accurately captures the statistics of termination events in SDC, including the mean termination time. Finally, we show that a DL model trained using a specific domain size is able to replicate termination statistics on larger domains, resulting in significant computational savings.</description>
