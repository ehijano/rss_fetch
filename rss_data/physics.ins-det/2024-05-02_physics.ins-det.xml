      <title>Microwave Cavity Mode Optimisation by Background Anti-Resonance Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To derive the best oscillator phase noise when implementing a high-Q resonator, the spectral line-shape must have high contrast and symmetry. Ideally, this line-shape is Lorentzian, however, in a high mode density spectral region, low-Q background spurious modes interact and distort the resonance. For a sapphire-loaded cavity resonator operating with whispering gallery modes we show that this high contrast and symmetry can be achieved by changing the dimensions of the surrounding cavity shield to tune the background low-Q structures into anti-resonance. This works because the high-Q resonances are primarily defined by the sapphire while the background modes are defined by the cavity shield. Alternatively, it was shown that a similar result can be achieved by exciting the high-Q resonator with a balanced microwave dipole probe in a Mach Zehnder interferometric configuration. The probe was constructed from two separate coaxial electric field probes symmetrically inserted into a cylindrical cavity resonator, from opposite sides with a small gap between them, so they can behave like an active wire dipole antenna. The power into the two separate probes may be matched with an external variable attenuator in one of the arms of the interferometer. Conversely, the phase between the two electric field probes may be changed with an external variable phase shifter, which changes the nature of the field components the probe couples to. The probe couples to the high-Q resonant modes as well as low-Q background modes, which can be made resonant or anti-resonant for the high-Q modes by changing this external phase. When the background modes are in anti-resonance the line shape of the high-Q mode can be made symmetric and with higher contrast. This technique was applied to both whispering gallery sapphire modes, as well as hollow cavity resonators, without changing the dimensions of the cavity.</description>

      <title>Gradient-based Automatic Per-Weight Mixed Precision Quantization for Neural Networks On-Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model size and inference speed at deployment time, are major challenges in many deep learning applications. A promising strategy to overcome these challenges is quantization. However, a straightforward uniform quantization to very low precision can result in significant accuracy loss. Mixed-precision quantization, based on the idea that certain parts of the network can accommodate lower precision without compromising performance compared to other parts, offers a potential solution. In this work, we present High Granularity Quantization (HGQ), an innovative quantization-aware training method designed to fine-tune the per-weight and per-activation precision in an automatic way for ultra-low latency and low power neural networks which are to be deployed on FPGAs. We demonstrate that HGQ can outperform existing methods by a substantial margin, achieving resource reduction by up to a factor of 20 and latency improvement by a factor of 5 while preserving accuracy.</description>

      <title>Combination of crystal growth with optical floating zone and evaluation of Nd3+:LaAlO3 crystals with the dynamic nuclear polarization of 139La and 27Al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07378</link>

Abstract: Producing a polarized lanthanum (La) target with high polarization and long relaxation time is crucial for realizing time-reversal violation experiments using polarized neutron beams. We use a LaAlO3 crystal doped with a small amount of Nd3+ ions for the polarized lanthanum target. Optimizing the amount of Nd3+ ions is considerably important because the achievable polarization and relaxation time strongly depend on this amount. We established a fundamental method to grow single crystals of Nd3+:LaAlO3 using an optical floating zone method that employs halogen lamps and evaluated the crystals with the dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) method for polarizing nuclear spins. Two crystal samples were grown by ourselves and evaluated with the DNP at 1.3 K and 2.3 T for the first time except for the target materials of protons. The enhancement of NMR signals for 139La and 27Al was successfully observed, and the enhancement factors were eventually 3.5+-0.3 and 13+-3 for the samples with Nd3+ ions of 0.05 and 0.01 mol%, respectively. These enhancement factors correspond to absolute vector polarizations of 0.27+-0.02% (Nd 0.05 mol%) and 1.4+-0.3% (Nd 0.01 mol%). Although the obtained polarizations are still low, they are acceptable as a first step. The combination scheme of the crystal growth and evaluation of the crystals is found to be effectively applicable for optimizing the amount of Nd3+ ions for improving the performance of the polarized target.</description>

      <title>3D surface profilometry using neutral helium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11114v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional mapping of surface structures is important in a wide range of biological, technological, healthcare and research applications, including taxonomy, microfluidics and fabrication. Neutral helium atom beams have been established as a sensitive probe of topography and have already enabled structural information to be obtained from delicate samples, where conventional probes would cause damage. Here, we demonstrate empirical reconstruction of a complete surface profile using measurements from a scanning helium microscope (SHeM), using the heliometric stereo method and a single detector instrument geometry. Results for the surface profile of tetrahedral aluminum potassium sulphate crystals demonstrate the areas of surfaces and facet orientations can be recovered to within 5% of the expected values.</description>
