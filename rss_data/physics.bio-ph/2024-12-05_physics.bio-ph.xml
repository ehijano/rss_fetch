      <title>More ATP Does Not Equal More Contractility: Power And Remodelling In Reconstituted Actomyosin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.00764v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cytoskeletal component actomyosin is a canonical example of active matter since the powerstroke cycle locally converts chemical energy in the form of adenoside triphosphate (ATP) into mechanical work for remodelling. Observing myosin II minifilaments as they remodel actin {\it in vitro}, we now report that: at high concentrations of ATP, myosin minifilaments form metastable swirling patterns that are characterised by recurrent vortex and spiral-like motifs, whereas; at low concentrations of ATP, such structures give way to aster-like patterns. To explain this, we construct the (quasi-)steady states of a polar active hydrodynamic theory of actomyosin whose ATP-scaling is obtained from a microscopic, stochastic description for the ATP-dependent binding of the heads of single myosin II minifilaments. The latter codifies the heuristic that, since the powerstroke cycle involves the unbinding of myosin II heads from actin, increases in the concentration of ATP reduce the likelihood that a given myosin II minifilament has more than one head bound simultaneously, reducing its ability to generate contractile forces and increasing the relative likelihood of processive motion. This reproduces several qualitative and some quantitative aspects of experiments, providing evidence for the central phenomenon of the theory: an ATP-dependent active contractile instability. ATP therefore controls not only the rate at which work is done -- \textit{i.e.,} the power -- but also the mode by which this occurs.</description>

      <title>A Physics Preserving Neural Network Based Approach for Constitutive Modeling of Isotropic Fibrous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13357v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new neural network architecture that strictly enforces constitutive constraints such as polyconvexity, frame-indifference, and the symmetry of the stress and material stiffness. Additionally, we show that the accuracy of the stress and material stiffness predictions is significantly improved for this neural network by using a Sobolev minimization strategy that includes derivative terms. Using our neural network, we model the constitutive behavior of fibrous-type discrete network material. With Sobolev minimization, we obtain a normalized mean square error of 0.15% for the strain energy density, 0.815% averaged across the components of the stress, and 5.4% averaged across the components of the stiffness tensor. This machine-learned constitutive model was deployed in a finite element simulation of a facet capsular ligament. The displacement fields and stress-strain curves were compared to a multiscale simulation that required running on a GPU-based supercomputer. The new approach maintained upward of 85% accuracy in stress up to 70% strain while reducing the computation cost by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Chemomechanical regulation of growing tissues from a thermodynamically-consistent framework and its application to tumor spheroid growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is widely recognized that reciprocal interactions between cells and their microenvironment, via mechanical forces and biochemical signaling pathways, regulate cell behaviors during normal development, homeostasis and disease progression such as cancer. However, it is still not well understood how complex patterns of tissue growth emerge. Here, we propose a framework for the chemomechanical regulation of growth based on thermodynamics of continua and growth-elasticity to predict growth patterns. Combining the elastic and chemical energies, we use an energy variational approach to derive a novel formulation that incorporates an energy-dissipating stress relaxation and biochemomechanical regulation of the volumetric growth rate. We validate the model using experimental data from growth of tumor spheroids in confined environments. We also investigate the influence of model parameters, including tissue rearrangement rate, tissue compressibility, strength of mechanical feedback and external mechanical stimuli, on the growth patterns of tumor spheroids.</description>

      <title>Social patch foraging theory in an egalitarian group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foraging is a widespread behavior, and being part of a group may bring several benefits compared to solitary foraging, such as collective pooling of information and reducing environmental uncertainty. Often theoretical models of collective behavior use coarse-grained representations, or are too complex for analytical treatment, and generally do not take into account the noisy decision making process implemented by individual agents. This calls for the development of a mechanistic, analytically tractable, and stochastic framework to study the underlying processes of social foraging, tying the microscopic to the macroscopic levels. Based on an evidence accumulation framework, we developed a model of patch-leaving decisions in a large egalitarian group. Across a variety of environmental statistics and information sharing mechanisms, we were able to analytically derive optimal agent strategies. The environmental statistics considered are either two non-depleting or several successive depleting patches. The social information sharing mechanisms are either through observation of others' food rewards or through belief sharing, with continuous sharing, pulsatile observation of others' departures or arrivals, or through counting the number of individuals in a patch. Throughout all these conditions, we quantified how cohesive a group is over time, how much time agents spend on average in a patch and what are their group equilibrium dynamics. We found that social coupling strongly modulates these features across a variety of environmental statistics. This general modeling framework is crucial to both designing social foraging experiments and generating hypotheses that can be tested. Moreover, this framework can be extended to groups exhibiting hierarchical relations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Dipolar Activity: Quadrupolar Stress Drives Collapse of Nematic Order on Frictional Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of active nematics has traditionally employed descriptions based on dipolar activity, with interactions that align along a single axis. However, it has been theoretically predicted that interactions with a substrate, prevalent in most biological systems, would require novel forms of activity, such as quadrupolar activity, that are governed by hydrodynamic screening. Here, by combining experiments and numerical simulations, we show that upon light-induced solidification of the underlying medium, microtubule-kinesin mixtures undergo a transformation that leads to a biphasic active suspension. Using an active lyotropic model, we prove that the transition is governed by screening effects that alter the dominant form of active stress. Specifically, the combined effect of friction and quadrupolar activity leads to a hierarchical folding that follows the intrinsic bend instability of the active nematic layer. Our results demonstrate the dynamics of the collapse of orientational order in active nematics and present a new route for controlling active matter by modifying the activity through changing the surrounding environment.</description>

      <title>Optimal switching strategies in multi-drug therapies for chronic diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance is a threat to public health with millions of deaths linked to drug resistant infections every year. To mitigate resistance, common strategies that are used are combination therapies and therapy switching. However, the stochastic nature of pathogenic mutation makes the optimization of these strategies challenging. Here, we propose a two-scale stochastic model that considers the effective evolution of therapies in a multidimensional efficacy space, where each dimension represents the efficacy of a specific drug in the therapy. The diffusion of therapies within this space is subject to stochastic resets, representing therapy switches. The boundaries of the space, inferred from coarser pathogen-host dynamics, can be either reflecting or absorbing. Reflecting boundaries impede full recovery of the host, while absorbing boundaries represent the development of antimicrobial resistance, leading to therapy failure. We derive analytical expressions for the average absorption times, accounting for both continuous and discrete genomic changes using the frameworks of Langevin and Master equations, respectively. These expressions allow us to evaluate the relevance of times between drug-switches and the number of simultaneous drugs in relation to typical timescales for drug resistance development. We also explore realistic scenarios where therapy constraints are imposed to the number of administered therapies and/or their costs, finding non-trivial optimal drug-switching protocols that maximize the time before antimicrobial resistance develops while reducing therapy costs.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Causal Models of Time-Varying Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for modelling time-varying connectivity in neuroimaging data, focusing on the slow fluctuations in synaptic efficacy that mediate neuronal dynamics. Building on the framework of Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM), we propose a method that incorporates temporal basis functions into neural models, allowing for the explicit representation of slow parameter changes. This approach balances expressivity and computational efficiency by modelling these fluctuations as a Gaussian process, offering a middle ground between existing methods that either strongly constrain or excessively relax parameter fluctuations. We validate the ensuing model through simulations and real data from an auditory roving oddball paradigm, demonstrating its potential to explain key aspects of brain dynamics. This work aims to equip researchers with a robust tool for investigating time-varying connectivity, particularly in the context of synaptic modulation and its role in both healthy and pathological brain function.</description>
