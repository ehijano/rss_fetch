      <title>Daily Profile of COVID-19 Infections in Germany, throughout the Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress of the COVID-19 pandemic was quantified, in the first instance, using the daily number of positive cases recorded by the national public health authorities. Averaged over a seven-day window, the daily incidence of COVID-19 in Germany reveals clear sections of exponential growth or decay in propagation of infection. Comparing with incidence profiles according to onset-of-symptoms shows that reporting of cases involves variable delays. Observed changes in exponential rates come from growing public awareness, governmental restrictions and their later relaxation, annual holidays, seasonal variation, emergence of new viral variants, and from mass vaccination. Combining the measured rates with epidemiological parameters established for SARS-CoV-2 yields the dynamics of change in disease transmission. Combined with the distribution of serial intervals (or generation times), the rate gives basic and instantaneous values of the reproduction number that govern development and ultimate outcome of the epidemic. Herd immunity requires vaccination of approximately seventy percent of the population, but this increases to circa eighty percent for the more transmissible Alpha-variant. Beyond this point, progressive vaccination reduces the susceptible population, and competes with the emergence of new variants. By the first Omicron wave, circa seventy percent were doubly vaccinated, with the target then standing at circa eighty percent. Combined with the distribution of times-to-death, incidence rates from onset of symptoms predict the daily profile of COVID-associated deaths and estimated case-fatality ratio. Cases are under-reported in the first wave and reflect age heterogeneity in fatalities at the second wave. In periods of low incidence, COVID mortality was one percent or less of detected infection.</description>

      <title>Weighted Food Webs Make Computing Phylogenetic Diversity So Much Harder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees represent certain species and their likely ancestors. In such a tree, present-day species are leaves and an edge from u to v indicates that u is an ancestor of v. Weights on these edges indicate the phylogenetic distance. The phylogenetic diversity (PD) of a set of species A is the total weight of edges that are on any path between the root of the phylogenetic tree and a species in A. Selecting a small set of species that maximizes phylogenetic diversity for a given phylogenetic tree is an essential task in preservation planning, where limited resources naturally prevent saving all species. An optimal solution can be found with a greedy algorithm [Steel, Systematic Biology, 2005; Pardi and Goldman, PLoS Genetics, 2005]. However, when a food web representing predator-prey relationships is given, finding a set of species that optimizes phylogenetic diversity subject to the condition that each saved species should be able to find food among the preserved species is NP-hard [Spillner et al., IEEE/ACM, 2008]. We present a generalization of this problem, where, inspired by biological considerations, the food web has weighted edges to represent the importance of predator-prey relationships. We show that this version is NP-hard even when both structures, the food web and the phylogenetic tree, are stars. To cope with this intractability, we proceed in two directions. Firstly, we study special cases where a species can only survive if a given fraction of its prey is preserved. Secondly, we analyze these problems through the lens of parameterized complexity. Our results include that finding a solution is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the vertex cover number of the food web, assuming the phylogenetic tree is a star.</description>

      <title>How many more is different?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the formation of ice in small clusters of water molecules to the mass raids of army ant colonies, the emergent behavior of collectives depends critically on their size. At the same time, common wisdom holds that such behaviors are robust to the loss of individuals. This tension points to the need for a more systematic study of how number influences collective behavior. We initiate this study by focusing on collective behaviors that change abruptly at certain critical numbers of individuals. We show that a subtle modification of standard bifurcation analysis identifies such critical numbers, including those associated with discreteness- and noise-induced transitions. By treating them as instances of the same phenomenon, we show that critical numbers across physical scales and scientific domains commonly arise from competing feedbacks that scale differently with number. We then use this idea to find overlooked critical numbers in past studies of collective behavior and explore the implications for their conclusions. In particular, we highlight how deterministic approximations of stochastic models can fail near critical numbers. We close by distinguishing these qualitative changes from density-dependent phase transitions and by discussing how our approach could generalize to broader classes of collective behaviors.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic-statistical inference of mosquito dynamics from mark-release-recapture data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological control strategies against mosquito-borne diseases--such as the sterile insect technique (SIT), RIDL, and Wolbachia-based releases--require reliable estimates of dispersal and survival of released males. We propose a mechanistic--statistical framework for mark--release--recapture (MRR) data linking an individual-based 2D diffusion model with its reaction--diffusion limit. Inference is based on solving the macroscopic system and embedding it in a Poisson observation model for daily trap counts, with uncertainty quantified via a parametric bootstrap. We validate identifiability using simulated data and apply the model to an urban MRR campaign in El Cano (Havana, Cuba) involving four weekly releases of sterile Aedes aegypti males. The best-supported model suggests a mean life expectancy of about five days and a typical displacement of about 180 m. Unlike empirical fits of survival or dispersal, our mechanistic approach jointly estimates movement, mortality, and capture, yielding biologically interpretable parameters and a principled framework for designing and evaluating SIT-based interventions.</description>

      <title>An additional food driven biological control patch model, incorporating generalized competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additional food sources for an introduced predator are known to increase its efficiency on a target pest. In this context, inhibiting factors such as interference, predator competition, and the introduction of temporally dependent quantity and quality of additional food are all known to enable pest extinction. As climate change and habitat degradation have increasing effects in enhancing patchiness in ecological systems, the effect of additional food in patch models has also been recently considered. However, the question of complete pest extinction in such patchy systems remains open. In the current manuscript, we consider a biological control model where additional food drives competition among predators in one patch, and they subsequently disperse to a neighboring patch via drift or dispersal. We show that complete pest extinction in both patches is possible. Further, this state is proved to be globally asymptotically stable under certain parametric restrictions. We also prove a codimension-2 Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. We discuss our results in the context of designing pest management strategies under enhanced climate change and habitat fragmentation. Such strategies are particularly relevant to control invasive pests such as the Soybean aphid (\emph{Aphis glycines}), in the North Central United States.</description>

      <title>Evolution of social behaviors in noisy environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary game theory offers a general framework to study how behaviors evolve by social learning in a population. This body of theory can accommodate a range of social dilemmas, or games, as well as real-world complexities such as spatial structure or behaviors conditioned on reputations. Nonetheless, this approach typically assumes a deterministic payoff structure for social interactions. Here, we extend evolutionary game theory to account for random changes in the social environment, so that mutual cooperation may bring different rewards today than it brings tomorrow, for example. Even when such environmental noise is unbiased, we find it can have a qualitative impact on the behaviors that evolve in a population. Noisy payoffs can permit the stable co-existence of cooperators and defectors in the prisoner's dilemma, for example, as well as bistability in snowdrift games and stable limit cycles in rock-paper-scissors games -- dynamical phenomena that cannot occur in the absence of noise. We conclude by discussing the relevance of our framework to scenarios where the nature of social interactions is subject to external perturbations.</description>

      <title>The TAP equation: evaluating combinatorial innovation in Biocosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.14115v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate solutions to the TAP equation, a phenomenological implementation of the Theory of the Adjacent Possible. Several implementations of TAP are studied, with potential applications in a range of topics including economics, social sciences, environmental change, evolutionary biological systems, and the nature of physical laws. The generic behaviour is an extended plateau followed by a sharp explosive divergence. We find accurate analytic approximations for the blow-up time that we validate against numerical simulations, and explore the properties of the equation in the vicinity of equilibrium between innovation and extinction. A particular variant, the two-scale TAP model, replaces the initial plateau with a phase of exponential growth, a widening of the TAP equation phenomenology that may enable it to be applied in a wider range of contexts.</description>

      <title>Investigating Forecasting Models for Pandemic Infections Using Heterogeneous Data Sources: A 2-year Study with COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging in December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread health, economic, and social disruptions. Rapid global transmission overwhelmed healthcare systems, resulting in high infection rates, hospitalisations, and fatalities. To minimise the spread, governments implemented several non-pharmaceutical interventions like lockdowns and travel restrictions. While effective in controlling transmission, these measures also posed significant economic and societal challenges. Although the WHO declared COVID-19 no longer a global health emergency in May 2023, its impact persists, shaping public health strategies. The vast amount of data collected during the pandemic offers valuable insights into disease dynamics, transmission, and intervention effectiveness. Leveraging these insights can improve forecasting models, enhancing preparedness and response to future outbreaks while mitigating their social and economic impact. This paper presents a large-scale case study on COVID-19 forecasting in Cyprus, utilising a two-year dataset that integrates epidemiological data, vaccination records, policy measures, and weather conditions. We analyse infection trends, assess forecasting performance, and examine the influence of external factors on disease dynamics. The insights gained contribute to improved pandemic preparedness and response strategies.</description>

      <title>Adding a fecundity-survival trade-off to a discrete population model with maturation delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although maturation delays are frequently included in population models, researchers rarely account for mortality between birth and maturity. Previous discrete population models have included mortality of immature individuals during the maturation delay finding that increasing the delay decreases the equilibrium population size, eventually leading to extinction. Since maturation delays beyond one breeding cycle are often found in nature, they must also have a benefit leading to a trade-off. We derive a class of models to explore the trade-off between the benefit of a longer maturation delay on fecundity due to larger body sizes at maturity and the down-side on survival. We examine two scenarios: density independent survival and cohort density dependent survival of immature individuals. For the mature and immature individuals, we consider two different, but popular, survival functions: the Beverton--Holt model and the Ricker model. Across all models, we identify a positive maturation delay that maximizes the population size that we refer to as the ``optimal maturation delay'' and a critical delay threshold that results in extinction. We also find oscillatory dynamics with the Ricker survival function for certain ranges of maturation delay. Overall, our delay model sets up a useful phenomenological framework to test multiple combinations of trade-offs in parent survival, offspring survival, and reproductive investment.</description>
