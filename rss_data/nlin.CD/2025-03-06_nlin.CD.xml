      <title>Learning finite symmetry groups of dynamical systems via equivariance detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Equivariance Seeker Model (ESM), a data-driven method for discovering the underlying finite equivariant symmetry group of an arbitrary function. ESM achieves this by optimizing a loss function that balances equivariance preservation with the penalization of redundant solutions, ensuring the complete and accurate identification of all symmetry transformations. We apply this framework specifically to dynamical systems, identifying their symmetry groups directly from observed trajectory data. To demonstrate its versatility, we test ESM on multiple systems in two distinct scenarios: (i) when the governing equations are known theoretically and (ii) when they are unknown, and the equivariance finding relies solely on observed data. The latter case highlights ESM's fully data-driven capability, as it requires no prior knowledge of the system's equations to operate.</description>

      <title>Visibility of heteroclinic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of stability has a long history in the field of dynamical systems: stable invariant objects are the ones that would be expected to be observed in experiments and numerical simulations. Heteroclinic networks are invariant objects in dynamical systems associated with intermittent cycling and switching behaviour, found in a range of applications. In this article, we note that the usual notions of stability, even those developed specifically for heteroclinic networks, do not provide all the information needed to determine the long-term behaviour of trajectories near heteroclinic networks. To complement the notion of stability, we introduce the concept of visibility, which pinpoints precisely the invariant objects that will be observed once transients have decayed. We illustrate our definitions with examples of heteroclinic networks from the literature.</description>

      <title>Spectral truncation of out-of-time-ordered correlators in dissipative system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have emerged as powerful tools for diagnosing quantum chaos and information scrambling. While extensively studied in closed quantum systems, their behavior in dissipative environments remains less understood. In this work, we investigate the spectral decomposition of OTOCs in open quantum systems, using the dissipative modified kicked rotator (DMKR) as a paradigmatic model. By analyzing the eigenvalue spectrum of the quantum Liouvillian, we identify a crucial spectral truncation criterion that enables efficient modeling of OTOC dynamics. Our results reveal two distinct temporal regimes: a long-time decay phase governed by the spectral gap and an intermediate-time regime where a small subset of subdominant eigenvalues plays a crucial role. This spectral truncation criterion allows for efficient modeling of OTOC decay and reveals a direct connection between eigenvalue structure and information scrambling. Our results provide a quantitative framework for understanding OTOCs in dissipative quantum systems and suggest new avenues for experimental exploration in open quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Deviations from spectral Dirac comb due to semiperiodic pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.15904v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the frequency power spectral density, periodic oscillations appear as a Dirac comb at integer multiples of the frequency of the period. In weakly nonlinear systems or systems close to the primary instability threshold, the periodicity may be perturbed, resulting in deviations from the Dirac comb. We present a stochastic model of such semiperiodic fluctuations, describing them as a superposition of pulses with a fixed shape. Closed form expressions are derived for the frequency power spectral density in the case of periodic pulse arrivals and a random distribution of pulse amplitudes and durations. In general, the spectrum is a Dirac comb located at multiples of the inverse periodicity time and modulated by the pulse spectrum. Deviations from strict periodicity in the arrivals are considered in two ways: either as a random offset to each periodic arrival (jitter) or as independently distributed waiting times between arrivals (renewal). Both ways remove the Dirac comb with remarkable efficiency, leaving mainly the spectrum of the pulse function. Where the jitter process modulates the mass of the higher harmonics, the renewal process leads to spectral broadening. We demonstrate the applicability of normally distributed waiting times to modelling. Contrary to the previous literature, we argue that negative waiting times do not pose problems for the theory, broadening the applicability of the normal approximation. Randomness in the pulse arrival times is investigated by numerical realizations of the process, and the model is used to describe time series of kinetic energy of fluctuating motions in two-dimensional thermal convection.</description>

      <title>Nash Equilibrium and Learning Dynamics in Three-Player Matching $m$-Action Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning in games discusses the processes where multiple players learn their optimal strategies through the repetition of game plays. The dynamics of learning between two players in zero-sum games, such as Matching Pennies, where their benefits are competitive, have already been well analyzed. However, it is still unexplored and challenging to analyze the dynamics of learning among three players. In this study, we formulate a minimalistic game where three players compete to match their actions with one another. Although interaction among three players diversifies and complicates the Nash equilibria, we fully analyze the equilibria. We also discuss the dynamics of learning based on some famous algorithms categorized into Follow the Regularized Leader. From both theoretical and experimental aspects, we characterize the dynamics by categorizing three-player interactions into three forces to synchronize their actions, switch their actions rotationally, and seek competition.</description>

      <title>Global Behavior of Learning Dynamics in Zero-Sum Games with Memory Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the global behavior of dynamics in learning in games between two players, X and Y. We consider the simplest situation for memory asymmetry between two players: X memorizes the other Y's previous action and uses reactive strategies, while Y has no memory. Although this memory complicates their learning dynamics, we characterize the global behavior of such complex dynamics by discovering and analyzing two novel quantities. One is an extended Kullback-Leibler divergence from the Nash equilibrium, a well-known conserved quantity from previous studies. The other is a family of Lyapunov functions of X's reactive strategy. One of the global behaviors we capture is that if X exploits Y, then their strategies converge to the Nash equilibrium. Another is that if Y's strategy is out of equilibrium, then X becomes more exploitative with time. Consequently, we suggest global convergence to the Nash equilibrium from both aspects of theory and experiment. This study provides a novel characterization of the global behavior in learning in games through a couple of indicators.</description>

      <title>Chaos destroys the excited state quantum phase transition of the Kerr parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The driven Kerr parametric oscillator, of interest to fundamental physics and quantum technologies, exhibits an excited state quantum phase transition (ESQPT) originating in an unstable classical periodic orbit. The main signature of this type of ESQPT is a singularity in the level density in the vicinity of the energy of the classical separatrix that divides the phase space into two distinct regions. The quantum states with energies below the separatrix are useful for quantum technologies, because they show a cat-like structure that protects them against local decoherence processes. In this work, we show how chaos arising from the interplay between the external drive and the nonlinearities of the system destroys the ESQPT and eventually eliminates the cat states. Our results demonstrate the importance of the analysis of theoretical models for the design of new parametric oscillators with ever larger nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Synchronization in Learning in Periodic Zero-Sum Games Triggers Divergence from Nash Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning in zero-sum games studies a situation where multiple agents competitively learn their strategy. In such multi-agent learning, we often see that the strategies cycle around their optimum, i.e., Nash equilibrium. When a game periodically varies (called a ``periodic'' game), however, the Nash equilibrium moves generically. How learning dynamics behave in such periodic games is of interest but still unclear. Interestingly, we discover that the behavior is highly dependent on the relationship between the two speeds at which the game changes and at which players learn. We observe that when these two speeds synchronize, the learning dynamics diverge, and their time-average does not converge. Otherwise, the learning dynamics draw complicated cycles, but their time-average converges. Under some assumptions introduced for the dynamical systems analysis, we prove that this behavior occurs. Furthermore, our experiments observe this behavior even if removing these assumptions. This study discovers a novel phenomenon, i.e., synchronization, and gains insight widely applicable to learning in periodic games.</description>

      <title>Singular bifurcations in a modified Leslie-Gower model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a predator-prey system with a generalist Leslie-Gower predator, a functional Holling type II response, and a weak Allee effect on the prey. The prey's population often grows much faster than its predator, allowing us to introduce a small time scale parameter $\varepsilon$ that relates the growth rates of both species, giving rise to a slow-fast system. Zhu and Liu (2022) show that, in the case of the weak Allee effect, Hopf singular bifurcation, slow-fast canard cycles, relaxation oscillations, etc., exist. Our main contribution lies in the rigorous analysis of a degenerate scenario organized by a (degenerate) transcritical bifurcation. The key tool employed is the blow-up method that desingularizes the degenerate singularity. In addition, we determine the criticality of the singular Hopf bifurcation using recent intrinsic techniques that do not require a local normal form. The theoretical analysis is complemented by a numerical bifurcation analysis, in which we numerically identify and analytically confirm the existence of a nearby Takens-Bogdanov point.</description>
