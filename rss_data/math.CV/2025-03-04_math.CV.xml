      <title>Some Compact Generalization of Berstein-Type Inequalities Preserved by Modified Smirnov Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P(z)$ be a polynomial of degree $n$. In $2004$, Aziz and Rather \cite{aziz2004some} investigated the dependence of \[\bigg|P(Rz)-\alpha P(z)+\beta\biggl\{\biggl(\frac{R+1}{2}\biggr)^n-|\alpha|\biggr\}P(z)\bigg|, \ \text{for} \ z \in B(\mathbb{D}),\] on $\max_{z\in B(\mathbb{D})}|P(z)|$, for every real and complex number $\alpha, \beta$ satisfying $|\alpha| \leq 1$, $|\beta| \leq 1$, and $R \geq 1$. This paper presents a compact generalization of several well-known polynomial inequalities using modified Smirnov operator, demonstrating that the operator preserves inequalities between polynomials.</description>

      <title>Generically surjective morphisms of holomorphic vector bundles via degenerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an $L^2$ theorem on generically surjective morphism of holomorphic vector bundles via a degeneration argument, generalizing the author's previous work on the $L^2$ division theorem of Skoda. The proof is based on Berndtsson's theorem on the positivity of direct image bundles and is inspired by Berndtsson and Lempert's proof of the $L^2$ extension theorem.</description>

      <title>From division to extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a short proof of a version of the Ohsawa-Takegoshi-Manivel $L^2$ extension theorem as a corollary of a Skoda-type $L^2$ division theorem with bounded generators. The new division theorem is of independent interest: the boundedness of generators allows to send the parameter $\alpha&gt;1$ of the usual $L^2$ division theorems to 1 in the norm of the datum of the division. As an aside, we also use the new division theorem to prove a Brian\c{c}on-Skoda-type result.</description>

      <title>The Axial Electric Potential and Length of a Torus Knot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical knot theory, where knots are treated like physical objects, is important to many fields. One natural problem is to give a knot a uniform charge, and analyze the resulting electric field and electric potential. There have been some results on the number of critical points of the electric potential from knots, such as by Lipton (2021) and Lipton, Townsend, and Strogatz (2022). However, little analysis has been done on the electric field and electric potential using calculations for specific knots.
  We focus on torus knots, specifically a parametrization that embeds it on a torus centered at the origin with rotational symmetry about the z-axis. Particularly, in this project, we analyze the electric field along the z-axis to take advantage of symmetry. We also analyze the length of the knot as a simpler integral. We show that the electric field is zero only at the origin, and investigate the extreme points of the electric field and electric potential using numerical methods and calculations. We also demonstrate a new way to apply methods for contour integration in complex analysis to calculate the length, electric potential, and electric field, and provide an explicit approximation for the length of a torus knot.</description>

      <title>Generic Antiholomorphic Polynomial Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analytic classification of generic anti-polynomial
  vector fields $\dot z = \ol{P(z)}$ is given in term of a topological
  and an analytic invariants. The number of generic strata in the
  parameter space is counted for each degree of $P$. A Realization
  Theorem is established for each pair of topological and analytic
  invariants. The non-generic
  case of a maximal number of heteroclinic connections is also given
  a classification. The bifurcation diagram for the quadratic case
  is presented.</description>

      <title>Partition Functions of Determinantal Point Processes on Polarized K\"ahler Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic expansion of the partition functions of determinantal point processes defined on a polarized K\"ahler manifold. The full asymptotic expansion of the partition functions is derived in two ways: one using Bergman kernel asymptotics and the other using the Quillen anomaly formula along with the asymptotic expansion of the Ray-Singer analytic torsion. By combining these two expressions, we show that each coefficient is given by geometric functionals on K\"ahler metrics satisfying the cocycle identity, and its first variation is closely related to the asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel. In particular, these functionals naturally generalize the Mabuchi functional in K\"ahler geometry and the Liouville functional on Riemann surfaces. Furthermore, we show that a Futaki-type holomorphic invariant obstructs the existence of critical points for each geometric functional given by the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion. Finally, we verify some of our results through explicit computations, which hold without the polarization assumption.</description>

      <title>Numerical invariants for weighted cscK metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In K-stability, the delta invariant of a Fano variety encodes the existence of K\"ahler-Einstein metrics. We introduce a weighted analytic delta invariant, and a reduced version, that characterize the existence of weighted solitons. We further prove a sufficient condition of existence of weighted cscK metrics in terms of this invariant. We elucidate the relation between the weighted delta invariant and the greatest lower bound on the weighted Ricci curvature, called the weighted beta invariant. We provide a general upper bound for the weighted beta invariant in terms of moment images. Finally, we investigate how the geometry of semisimple principal fibrations, whose basis is not assumed to be cscK, allows to estimate their beta invariant in terms of the basis and the weighted fiber. Most of our statements are new even in the trivial weights settings, that is, for K\"ahler-Einstein and cscK metrics.</description>

Abstract: We derive presentation and relations for a group of compact Riemann surface that is given as branched cover of the sphere. In the case that one of the permutations is of full cycle of the form $(1...n)$ we derive a straightforward process to obtain the standard presentation of the fundamental group of Algebraic curve in the form $\prod_{i=1}^g[a_i,b_i]=1$</description>

      <title>Uniform approximation on certain polynomial polyhedra in $\mathbb{C}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the dichotomy given by Samuelsson and Wold that can be thought of as an analogue of the Wermer maximality theorem in $\mathbb{C}^2$ for certain polynomial polyhedra. We consider complex non-degenerate simply connected polynomial polyhedra of the form $\Omega:=\{z\in\mathbb{C}^2: |p_1(z)|&lt;1, |p_2(z)|&lt;1\}$ such that $\overline{\Omega}$ is compact. Under a mild condition of the polynomials $p_1$ and $p_2$, we prove that either the uniform algebra, generated by polynomials and some continuous functions $f_1,\dots, f_N$ on the distinguished boundary that extends as pluriharmonic functions on $\Omega$, is all continuous functions on the distinguished boundary or there exists an algebraic variety in $\overline{\Omega}$ on which each $f_j$ is holomorphic. We also compute the polynomial hull of the graph of pluriharmonic functions in some cases where the pluriharmonic functions are conjugates of holomorphic polynomials. We also give a couple of general theorem about uniform approximation on the domains with low boundary regularity.</description>

Abstract: This note initiates the study of the Fatou\,--\,Julia sets of a complex harmonic mapping. Along with some fundamental properties of the Fatou and the Julia sets, we observe some contrasting behaviour of these sets as those with in case of a holomorphic function. The existence of harmonic mapping with a wandering domain is also shown.</description>
