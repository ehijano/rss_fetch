      <title>Corrigendum and addendum: Long-range multi-scalar models at three loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We correct the computation of one Feynman diagram in the three-loop beta functions for the long-range quartic multi-scalar model, originally presented in (2020 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 53 445008) [arXiv:2007.04603]. The correction requires the use of a different method than in the original paper, and we give here full details about the method. We then report the updated numerics for critical exponents of the Ising model, vector model, cubic model and bifundamental model. Mathematica files for the numerical evaluation of the corrected diagram are provided in ancillary.</description>

      <title>Multi-invariants and Bulk Replica Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the question of replica symmetry in the bulk for multi-partite entanglement measures in the vacuum state of two dimensional holographic CFTs. We first define a class of multi-partite local unitary invariants, multi-invariants, with a given replica symmetry that acts freely and transitively on the replicas. We look for a subclass of measures such that the dual bulk geometry also preserves replica symmetry. We obtain the most general solution to this problem if we require the bulk to preserve replica symmetry for general configurations of the regions. Orbifolding the bulk solution with the replica symmetry gives us a bulk geometry with a network of conical singularities. Our approach makes it clear that there are infinitely many infinitely large families of multi-invariants such that each family evaluates identically on the holographic state. Geometrically, these are equalities involving volumes of handlebodies, possibly of different genus, at particular points in the moduli space. In certain cases, we check our bulk computation with an explicit calculation in CFT. Finally we comment on the generalization to higher dimension.</description>

      <title>Entanglement spectra from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement spectrum of a bipartite quantum system is given by the distribution of eigenvalues of the modular Hamiltonian. In this work, we compute the entanglement spectrum in the vacuum state for a subregion of a $d$-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) admitting a holographic dual. In the case of a spherical (or planar) entangling surface, we recover known results in two dimensions, including the Cardy formula in the high energy regime. In higher dimensions $d&gt;2$, we analytically determine a generalization of the Cardy formula valid at large energies and consistent with previous studies of CFT spectra in the literature. We also investigate numerically the spectrum at energy levels far above the modular ground state energy. We extend our analysis to the supersymmetric point of Einstein-Maxwell gravity, providing exact results when $d=2,3$, and a generalization of the Cardy formula at high energies in generic dimension $d$. We consider small shape deformations of a spherical entangling surface, for both the non-supersymmetric and the supersymmetric cases. In all cases we find that the high-energy scaling of the microcanonical entropy with the modular energy is unaffected by the shape deformation. This result suggests that the high-energy regime of the entanglement spectra carries universal information, independent of the shape of the entangling surface.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Safety within on-shell perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the renormalisation of Einstein gravity using a novel subtraction scheme in dimensional regularisation. The one-loop beta function for Newton's constant receives contributions from poles in even dimensions and can be mapped to the beta function obtained using a proper-time cutoff. Field redefinitions are used to remove off-shell contributions to the renormalisation group equations. To check the consistency of our approximations we use a general parametrisation of the metric fluctuation. Within truncations of the derivative expansion and the expansion in Newton's constant, we show that the parametrisation dependence can be removed order by order. Going to all orders in the scalar curvature an all-order beta function for Newton's constant is obtained that is independent of the parameterisation. The beta function vanishes at the Reuter fixed point and the critical exponent is in good agreement with non-perturbative calculations. Finally, we compare the critical exponent to the counterpart computed via Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT).</description>

      <title>Twisted Orientifold planes and S-duality without supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a novel orientifold of type IIB string theory that breaks all supersymmetries. It is a closed string theory without open sector and it can be understood as a Scherk-Schwarz deformation in which supersymmetry is restored at infinite radius. We conjecture that it is realised in F-theory as a compactification on a freely acting orbifold that acts as the reflection on the elliptic fibre. The SL(2,Z) selfduality is manifest in the F-theory formulation. We construct explicitly the D-branes in this model and find that stable D-branes match the geometric prediction in M-theory. This theory has the salient feature that the O-planes couple only to the massive twisted states of the theory. We call them twisted O-planes. We describe supersymmetric examples of such twisted O-planes and argue that they are similar in nature to combinations of O+ and O- planes with vanishing total charge.</description>

      <title>Not So Flat Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to be in control of the $\alpha'$ derivative expansion, geometric string compactifications are understood in the context of a large volume approximation. In this letter, we consider the reduction of these higher derivative terms, and propose an improved estimate on the large volume approximation using numerical Calabi-Yau metrics obtained via machine learning methods. Further to this, we consider the $\alpha'^3$ corrections to numerical Calabi-Yau metrics in the context of IIB string theory. This correction represents one of several important contributions for realistic string compactifications -- alongside, for example, the backreaction of fluxes and local sources -- all of which have important consequences for string phenomenology. As a simple application of the corrected metric, we compute the change to the spectrum of the scalar Laplacian.</description>

Abstract: We propose a numerical method to estimate one-point functions and the free-energy density of conformal field theories at finite temperature by solving the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition for the two-point functions of identical scalars. We apply the method for the critical O(N) model for N = 1,2,3 in 3 $\leq$ d $\leq$ 4. We find agreement with known results from Monte Carlo simulations and previous results for the 3d Ising model, and we provide new predictions for N = 2,3.</description>

      <title>Noether-Wald and Komar charges in supergravity, fermions, and Killing supervectors in superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supersymmetry properties of Killing vectors and spinors in supergravity theory can be clarified by relating them to Killing supervectors in the supergravity superspace. In the superspace approach it is manifest that supersymmetry 'mixes' a Killing vector with its fermionic spinor 'superpartner' and the Killing equations with the generalization of the Killing spinor equations. The latter reduces to the standard Killing spinor equation, albeit with a fermionic spinor, when the fermionic fields are set to zero. Using these supersymmetry transformations in the spacetime component approach, we construct a Noether-Wald charge of ${\cal N}=1$, $D=4$ supergravity with fermionic contributions which is diff-, Lorentz- and supersymmetry-invariant (up to a total derivative). The Killing supervector formalism for the maximal $D=11$ supergravity and some related issues are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Records from the S-Matrix Marathon: Tasty Bits of Several Complex Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will cover the basics of several complex variables in 4 lectures: Basic properties of holomorphic functions in several variables, the notion of pseudoconvexity, CR functions and CR geometry, and the $\bar\partial$-problem. The main underlying idea is to connect various characterizations of domains of holomorphy, that is, the natural domains of definition for holomorphic functions. In the process we will connect the function theory on the domain to geometric properties of the boundary, and discuss the relationship between the boundary values and the functions themselves and extension of holomorphic functions from subspaces.
  These notes are based on a series of lectures held during the S-Matrix Marathon workshop at the Institute for Advanced Study on 11-22 March 2024.</description>

      <title>UV Effects and Short-Lived Hawking Radiation: Alternative Resolution of Information Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter suggests an alternative solution to the black-hole information paradox by proposing that Hawking radiation ceases around the scrambling time due to trans-Planckian effects inherent in string theory. We consider two toy models in the literature that incorporate stringy effects. The first model utilizes the generalized uncertainty principle, which introduces a minimal length. The second model is inspired by string field theory, where interactions are exponentially suppressed in the UV limit. Both models indicate an early termination of Hawking radiation around the scrambling time, resulting in negligible evaporated energy and a predominantly classical black hole.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Resolved Relative Entropy of Random States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use large-$N$ diagrammatic techniques to calculate the relative entropy of symmetric random states drawn from the Wishart ensemble. These methods are specifically designed for symmetric sectors, allowing us to determine the relative entropy for random states exhibiting $U(1)$ symmetry. This calculation serves as a measure of distinguishability within the symmetry sectors of random states. Our findings reveal that the symmetry-resolved relative entropy of random pure states displays universal statistical behavior. Furthermore, we derive the symmetry-resolved Page curve. These results deepen our understanding of the properties of these random states.</description>

      <title>The 5d Tangram: Brane Webs, 7-Branes and Primitive T-cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two highly successful approaches to constructing 5d SCFTs are geometric engineering using M-theory on a Calabi-Yau 3-fold and the use of 5-brane webs suspended from 7-branes in Type IIB string theory. In the brane web realization, the extended Coulomb branch of the 5d SCFT can be studied by opening the web using rigid triple intersections of branes--i.e. configurations with no deformations. In this paper, we argue that the geometric engineering counterpart of these rigid triple intersections are the T-cones introduced in the mathematical literature. We extend the class of rigid brane webs to include locked superpositions of the minimal ones. These rigid brane webs serve as fundamental building blocks for supersymmetrically tessellating Generalized Toric Polygons (GTPs) from first principles. Interestingly, we find that the extended Coulomb branch generally exhibits a structure consisting of multiple cones intersecting at a single point. Hanany-Witten (HW) transitions in the web have been conjectured to correspond geometrically to flat fibrations over a line, where the central and generic fibers represent the geometries dual to the webs before and after the transition. We demonstrate this explicitly in an example, showing that for GTPs reducing to standard toric diagrams, the HW transition corresponds to a deformation of the BPS quiver that we map to the geometric deformation.</description>

      <title>A Two-Loop Four-Point Form Factor at Function Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the maximally-helicity-violating four-point form factor for the chiral stress-energy tensor in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills was computed to three loops at the level of the symbol associated with multiple polylogarithms. It exhibits {\it antipodal self-duality}, or invariance under the combined action of a kinematic map and reversing the ordering of letters in the symbol. Here we lift the two-loop form factor from symbol level to function level. We provide an iterated representation of the function's derivatives (coproducts). In order to do so, we find a three-parameter limit of the five-parameter phase space where the symbol's letters are all rational. We also use function-level information about dihedral symmetries and the soft, collinear, and factorization limits, as well as limits governed by the form-factor operator product expansion (FFOPE). We provide plots of the remainder function on several kinematic slices, and show that the result is compatible with the FFOPE data. We further verify that antipodal self-duality is valid at two loops beyond the level of the symbol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the study of holographic superfluids from planar topology to spherical topology, inspired by recent studies on Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) superfluid on shell-shaped geometry. We mainly focus on superfluid phase transition and Quasi Normal Modes (QNMs). It turns out that the critical temperature for the superfluid phase transition on the sphere is higher than that in the planar case. We investigated four different solutions in the backgrounds of large black hole and small black hole. The calculation of free energy selects the most stable solution. Finally, after calculating the quasi-normal modes and their dynamic behavior, we obtained three different channels similar to the planar superfluid case, along with the "first" hydrodynamic excitation, which may be associated with Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thoules (BKT) transition.</description>

      <title>Four-twist effects and monodromy in symmetric orbifold CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric orbifold CFTs contain twist operators that can join and split copies of the CFT, leading to the creation of pairs from the vacuum. In this paper, we study the pair creation processes involving four twist-2 operators. In addition to the pair creation previously observed purely in the left or right moving sectors, we find a novel mixing between left and right movers during pair creation. This phenomenon arises from nontrivial monodromy conditions that originate from a genus-one covering surface, where left and right movers become coupled through the torus.</description>

      <title>Black Brane/Bose Gase Duality and Third Law of Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the thermodynamics of black holes in asymptotically flat space, the third law of thermodynamics is violated, and entropy cannot be consistently modeled through conventional statistical mechanics. Notably, the third law of thermodynamics is violated for the Schwarzschild black hole, and its entropy can only be described using an unconventional model, such as a Bose gas in negative dimensions.
  In contrast, for certain black brane solutions such as Poincare AdS black branes, Lifshitz black branes, and anisotropic Lifshitz-type black branes, the third law is preserved, with entropy vanishing as temperature approaches zero. In this paper, we extend the previously established duality between black hole and Bose gas thermodynamics to black branes. Specifically, the Poincare black brane in $D$ spacetime dimensions corresponds to a non-relativistic Bose gas in $2(D-2)$ spatial dimensions. Furthermore, the duality between Lifshitz branes and Bose gases relates a Lifshitz brane with exponent $\alpha$ in $D$-dimensional spacetime to a Bose gas of quasi-particles with energy $k^\alpha$ in $D-2$ spatial dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To construct higher-dimensional counterparts of the Kerr-Newman black holes, we consider Einstein's equations sourced by a vector field and a negative cosmological constant. In contrast to the four-dimensional case, the Maxwell's equations are modified by sources generated by topological Chern-Simons couplings, the situation already encountered in the minimal five dimensional supergravity. After constructing explicit geometries in all odd dimensions, we demonstrate that the Klein-Gordon equation on the new backgrounds is fully separable.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum curves of 5d Seiberg's theories and their 4d limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the classical and quantum Seiberg-Witten curves of 5d N = 1 SCFTs and their 4d limits. The 5d theories we consider are Seiberg's theories of type $E_{6,7,8}$, which serve as the UV completions of 5d SU(2) gauge theories with 5, 6, or 7 flavors. Their classical curves can be constructed using the five-brane web construction [1]. We also use it to re-derive their quantum curves [2], by employing a q-analogue of the Frobenius method in the style of [3]. This allows us to compare the reduction of these 5d curves with the 4d curves, i.e. Seiberg-Witten curves of the Minahan-Nemeschansky theories and their quantization, which have been identified in [4] with the spectral curves of rank-1 complex crystallographic elliptic Calogero-Moser systems.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature fermionic charge and current densities in conical space with a circular edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the finite temperature and edge induced effects on the charge and current densities for a massive spinor field localized on a 2D conical space threaded by a magnetic flux. The field operator is constrained on a circular boundary, concentric with the cone apex, by the bag boundary condition and by the condition with the opposite sign in front of the term containing the normal to the edge. In two-dimensional spaces there exist two inequivalent representations of the Clifford algebra and the analysis is presented for both the fields realizing those representations. The circular boundary divides the conical space into two parts, referred as interior (I-) and exterior (E-) regions. The radial current density vanishes. The edge induced contributions in the expectation values of the charge and azimuthal current densities are explicitly separated in the both regions for the general case of the chemical potential. They are periodic functions of the magnetic flux and odd functions under the simultaneous change of the signs of magnetic flux and chemical potential. In the E-region all the spinorial modes are regular and the total charge and current densities are continuous functions of the magnetic flux. In the I-region the corresponding expectation values are discontinuous at half-integer values of the ratio of the magnetic flux to the flux quantum. 2D fermionic models, symmetric under the parity and time-reversal transformations (in the absence of magnetic fields) combine two spinor fields realizing the inequivalent representations of the Clifford algebra. The total charge and current densities in those models are discussed for different combinations of the boundary conditions for separate fields. Applications are discussed for electronic subsystem in graphitic cones described by the 2D Dirac model.</description>

      <title>Superspace invariants and correlators in 4-dimensional superconformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using polarization spinor methods in conjunction with the superspace formalism, we construct 3-point superconformal invariants that are used to determine the form of 3-point correlators of spinning superfield operators in $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs) in 4-dimensions. We enumerate the structural form of various spinning 3-point correlators using these invariants and find additional constraints on their form when the operators are conserved supercurrents. For these purposes, we first construct the invariants and 3-point correlators in non-supersymmetric $4d$ CFTs which are then extended using superspace methods to $4d$ SCFTs.</description>

Abstract: We investigate two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) with affine $\widehat{su}(2)$ and $\widehat{su}(3)$ algebra symmetry. Their bosonic modular-invariant partition functions have been fully classified based on the ADE classification. In this work, we extend the classification to include fermionic and parafermionic CFTs with the same affine symmetries, utilizing techniques of fermionization and parafermionization. We find that the fermionic and parafermionic $\widehat{su}(2)$ models are related to non-simply laced Dynkin diagrams.</description>

      <title>Uncovering thermodynamic origin of counterflow and coflow instabilities in miscible binary superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore instabilities in binary superfluids with a nonvanishing relative superflow, particularly focusing on counterflow and coflow instabilities. We extend recent results on the thermodynamic origin of finite superflow instabilities in single-component superfluids to binary systems and derive a criterion for the onset of instability through a hydrodynamic analysis. To verify this result, we utilize both the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and a holographic binary superfluid model, which naturally incorporates strong coupling, finite temperature, and dissipation. We find that the counterflow and coflow instabilities in binary superfluids are all essentially thermodynamic. Except the one due to order competing via global thermodynamic instability, the others are caused by an eigenvalue of the free energy Hessian diverging and changing sign. We also observe that the critical velocities of these instabilities follow a general scaling law related to the interaction strength between superfluid components. The nonlinear stages of the instabilities are also studied by full time evolution, where vortex dynamics is found to play a significant role, resulting in the reduction of superfluid velocity back to a stable phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We further develop the BPS/CFT correspondence between quiver W-algebras/$qq$-characters and partition functions of gauge origami. We introduce $qq$-characters associated with multi-dimensional partitions with nontrivial boundary conditions which we call Donaldson--Thomas (DT) $qq$-characters. They are operator versions of the equivariant DT vertices of toric Calabi--Yau three and four-folds. Moreover, we revisit the construction of the D8 $qq$-characters with no boundary conditions and give a quantum algebraic derivation of the sign rules of the magnificent four partition function. We also show that under the proper sign rules, the D6 and D8 $qq$-characters with no boundary conditions all commute with each other and discuss its physical interpretation.</description>

      <title>On (dis)agreement between different methods of calculation of the imaginary part of the effective action in expanding space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two approaches to calculate imaginary parts of effective actions in expanding space-times. While the first approach uses Bogolyubov coefficients, the second one uses the functional integral or the Feynman propagator. In eternally expanding space-times these two approaches give different answers for the imaginary parts. The origin of the difference can be traced to the presence if the wave-functionals for the initial and final states in the functional integral. We show this explicitly on the example of the expanding Poincare patch of the de Sitter space-time.</description>

      <title>On Real Time Dynamics of Large $N$ Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the real-time dynamics of the large $N$ vector model, focusing on heavy states with energies of the order $N$. In this regime, we demonstrate that interactions become sufficiently strong to produce non-zero condensate of the Hubbard-Stratonovich field $\sigma$, which, in turn, induces particle production. This process leads to a significant transformation of the initial state and potential thermalization. For homogeneous perturbations, our results show that the equations become integrable, yet can still lead to thermalization in the continuum limit. Furthermore, we calculate the energies of these heavy states and their contributions to the thermal free energy, thereby determining the free energy of the critical $O(N)$ model by operator counting.</description>

      <title>Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics of Dyonic AdS Black Holes: Comparative Analysis Using Different Entropy Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics (RPST) for the AdS dyonic black hole carrying the central charge $C$ and the chemical potential $\mu$, neglecting the pressure and conjugate volume along with comparison of different entropy models namely the Bekenstein-Hawking and the R\'enyi entropy model. Inclusion of the magnetic charge $\tilde{Q}_m$ gives rise to a richer phase structure of the study of thermodynamics by adding a non-equilibrium transition from an unstable small black hole to a stable black hole on top of the Van der Waals transition in the $T-S$ processes and a Hawking-Page transition in the $F-T$ plots. We study an extra mixed ensemble ($\tilde{\Phi}_e,\tilde{Q}_m)$ due to the inclusion of $\tilde{Q}_m$ where we see Van der Waals phase transition and whose plots change as the entropy model changes though the style of transition remains the same. We observe an interesting phenomenon where changing the R\'enyi parameter $\lambda$, the $T-S$ process changes the same way as when varying the central charge $C$ underlining some similarity that is not seen in the Bekenstein Hawking entropy model. We observe a similarity between the plots when both charges are turned off relating to the Schwarzschild black hole and the grand-canonical ensemble. One can observe that as the entropy models are changed, the homogeneity is not lost where the mass as a function of extensive variables is of order one and the rest zero. Finally, we see a similarity in the $\mu-C$ process across the entropy models signally some universality across entropy models as well as different types of black holes studied before.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emitted radiation and absorption effects in black hole dynamics lead to inelastic scattering amplitudes. In this paper, we study how these effects introduce an inelasticity function to the $2\rightarrow2$ eikonalised $S$-matrix and how they can be described using unequal mass and spin on-shell amplitudes. To achieve this, we formulate the inelastic coupled-channel eikonal (ICCE) using the KMOC formalism and the language of quantum channels, where off-diagonal channels involve mass and spin changes. This formulation allows us to re-use usual eikonal results but also suggests a different resummation of inelastic effects. We then apply this formulation to calculate classical inelastic processes, such as the mass change in binary dynamics due to the presence of an event horizon. Additionally, we provide a complementary analysis for the case of wave scattering on a black hole, considering absorption effects. In both scenarios, we derive unitarity relations accounting for inelastic effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We begin by reexamining the holographic reconstruction of scalar fields in four-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime, adopting a purely Lorentzian signature derivation, reproducing earlier results of HKLL and generalizing to arbitrary boundary metrics. The approach is extended to gravitational perturbations, focussing on perturbations around $AdS_{4}$ and show that the mapping can be formulated as a purely light-like integral of the conformal field theory stress energy tensor. An example is considered of relevance to the flat spacetime limit with nontrivial BMS charges turned on, potentially providing a quantum field theory definition of celestial CFT as a large central charge limit of a 3d CFT.</description>

Abstract: Fundamental particle physics is at a cross road. On the one hand the Standard Model successfully accounts for all experimental observations to date. On the other hand the ElectroWeak symmetry breaking mechanism is poorly understood and suggests the existence of new physics within reach of future colliders. Building on LHC experience, a hadron collider using the well established LHC magnet technology in a 90--100km circular ring, can reach the required 50--60TeV energy range and uncover the next layers of reality by the early 2040s.</description>

      <title>Static spheres and Aschenbach effect for black holes in massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the trajectories of massive and massless particles in four dimensional static and spherically symmetric black holes in dRGT massive gravity theory via phase-plane analysis and point out several novel features. In particular, we show the existence of a static sphere, a finite radial distance outside the black holes in these theories, where a massive particle can be at rest, as seen by an asymptotic zero angular momentum observer. Topological arguments show that the stable and unstable static spheres, which come in pairs, have opposite charges. In the presence of angular momentum, we first study the behaviour of massless particles and find the presence of stable and unstable photon spheres in both neutral and charged black holes. Subsequently, we study the motion of massive test particles around these black holes, and find one pair of stable and unstable time-like circular orbits (TCOs), such that the stable and unstable TCO's are disconnected in certain regions. Computing the angular velocity $\Omega_{\text{\tiny CO}}$ of the TCOs, measured by a static observer at rest, shows the unusual nature of its monotonic increase with the radius of TCO, near the location of stable photon sphere. This confirms the existence of Aschenbach effect for spherically symmetric black holes in massive gravity, which was only found to exist in rapidly spinning black holes, with the only other exception being the rare example of gravity coupled to quasi-topological electromagnetism.</description>

      <title>More Nonlinearities? II. A Short Guide of First- and Second-Order Electromagnetic Perturbations in the Schwarzschild Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study first- and second-order electromagnetic perturbations in Schwarzschild spacetime, deriving effective source terms for the second-order Regge-Wheeler equation, which are quadratic in first-order gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations, in parallel with results from [1]. In addition to the induced mixed-quadratic modes, we find that linear gravitational modes are also excited, with amplitudes dependent on the electromagnetic potential. A toy model involving a Dirac delta potential demonstrates mixing of linear gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations with frequencies $\omega^{(1)} = i \frac{V_G}{2}$ and $\Omega^{(1)} = i \frac{V_{EM}}{2}$, resulting in the second-order QNM mixing in the electromagnetic field at $\Omega^{(2)} = -i \frac{V_{EM} + V_G}{2}$. This complements prior work in [1] on the second-order gravitational perturbation mixing and highlights potential applications in multi-messenger astrophysics for systems observed by LIGO and upcoming LISA. For the first-order perturbations, we reduce the perturbation of a point charge source to a one-dimensional path integral. Using the Dirac delta approximation, we investigated the first-order electromagnetic perturbation due to a radially free-falling single charge $q$ and radial dipole moment $p = q \eta$, employing semi-analytical and numerical methods. For the dipole case, we show that the QNM perturbation is excited with a nearly constant amplitude. Finally, we comment on the limitations of the Dirac delta approximation used in this analysis. This approach overlooks centrifugal effects,subsequently fail to recover the minkowski limit, resulting in an unrealistic spatial behavior. Future work will focus on incorporating mixing in more realistic potentials and exploring numerical approach in the context of rotating spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Why Gauges? Gauge symmetries for the classification of the physical states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note focuses the problem of motivating the use of gauge symmetries (being the identity on the observables) from general principles, beyond their practical success, starting from global gauge symmetries and then by emphasizing the substantially different role of local gauge symmetries. In the latter case, a deterministic time evolution of the local field algebra, necessary for field quantization, requires a reduction of the full local gauge group $\cal{G}$ to a residual local subgroup $\cal{G}_r$ satisfying suitable conditions. A non-trivial residual local gauge group allows for a description/construction of the physical states by using the vacuum representation of a local field algebra, otherwise precluded if $\cal{G}$ is reduced to the identity. Moreover, in the non-abelian case the non-trivial topology of the a residual $\cal{G}_r$ defines the (gauge invariant) topological invariants which classify the vacuum structure with important physical effects; furthermore, it provides a general mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking without Goldstone bosons.</description>

      <title>Is the Harris criterion valid in the case of geometric disorders?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Harris criterion imposes a constraint on the critical behavior of a system upon introduction of new disorder, based on its dimension $d$ and localization length exponent $\nu$. It states that the new disorder can be relevant only if $d \nu &lt; 2$. We analyze the applicability of the Harris criterion to the network disorder formulated in the paper [I. A. Gruzberg, A. Kl\"umper, W. Nuding, and A. Sedrakyan, Phys. Rev. B 95, 125414 (2017)] and show that the fluctuations of the geometry are relevant despite $d \nu&gt; 2$, implying that Harris criterion should be modified. We have observed that the fluctuations of the critical point in different quenched configurations of disordered network blocks is of order $L^0$, i.e.~it does not depend on block size $L$ in contrast to the expectation based on the Harris criterion that they should decrease as $L^{-d/2}$ according to the central limit theorem. Since $L^0 &gt; (x-x_c)$ is always satisfied near the critical point, the mentioned network disorder is relevant and the critical indices of the system can be changed. We have also shown that our disordered network is fundamentally different from Voronoi-Delaunay and dynamically triangulated random lattices: the probability of higher connectivity in our network decreases in a power law as opposed to an exponential, indicating that we are dealing with a ``scale free" network, such as the Internet, protein-protein interactions, etc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Heisenberg double and the Drinfeld double of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded Hopf algebras. To present the constructions, we consider in detail the Borel half of $U_q(sl(2))$ and two super Hopf algebra examples: the Borel half of $U_q(osp(1|2))$ and the Borel half of $U_q(gl(1|1))$ for $q$ being a root of unity. We prove an isomorphism between the graded Heisenberg doubles and the handle algebras in the context of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded generalisation of Alekseev-Schomerus combinatorial quantisation of Chern-Simons theory and illustrate it on the example of the Heisenberg double of the full $U_q(gl(1|1))$ Hopf algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cotton gravity was recently introduced as a higher derivative extension of General Relativity. The field equations of the theory involve the rank-3 Cotton tensor. Here we show that all solutions of the theory, including the black holes, have vanishing conserved charges, i.e. mass and angular momentum. This result implies that either the theory is unphysical since all the black holes carry the charges of the vacuum and can be created at no energy cost, or the theory has confinement of mass/energy and all other conserved quantities.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks viewpoint for solving the Dyson-Schwinger equations of quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve fundamental Dyson-Schwinger integral equations in the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in Euclidean space. Our approach uses neural networks to approximate the fermion wave function renormalization, dynamical mass function, and photon propagator. By integrating the Dyson-Schwinger equations into the loss function, the networks learn and predict solutions over a range of momenta and ultraviolet cutoff values. This method can be extended to other quantum field theories (QFTs), potentially paving the way for forefront applications of machine learning within high-level theoretical physics.</description>

Abstract: Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) is a lattice theory of quantum gravity. It is shown how to identify the IR and the UV limits of this lattice theory with similar limits studied using the continuum, functional renormalization group (FRG) approach. The main technical tool in this study will be the so-called two-point function. It will allow us to identify a correlation length not directly related to the propagation of physical degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The `brane quantisation' is a quantisation procedure developed by Gukov and Witten \cite{Gukov:2008ve}.
  We implement this idea by combining it with the tilting theory and the minimal resolutions. This way, we can realistically compute the deformation quantisation on the space of observables acting on the Hilbert space. We apply this procedure to certain quantisation problems in the context of generalised K\"ahler structure on $\mathbb{P}^2$. Our approach differs from and complements that of Bischoff and Gualtieri \cite{Bischoff:2021ixy}.
  We also benefitted from an important technical tool: a combinatorial criterion for the Maurer-Cartan equation, developed in \cite{BarmeierWang} by Barmeier and Wang.</description>

      <title>Towards a unitary formulation of quantum field theory in curved spacetime: the case of de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06046v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Before we ask what the quantum gravity theory is, it is a legitimate quest to formulate a robust quantum field theory in curved spacetime (QFTCS). Several conceptual problems, especially unitarity loss (pure states evolving into mixed states), have raised concerns over several decades. In this paper, acknowledging the fact that time is a parameter in quantum theory, which is different from its status in the context of General Relativity (GR), we start with a "quantum first approach" and propose a new formulation for QFTCS based on the discrete spacetime transformations which offer a way to achieve unitarity. We rewrite the QFT in Minkowski spacetime with a direct-sum Fock space structure based on the discrete spacetime transformations and geometric superselection rules. Applying this framework to QFTCS, in the context of de Sitter (dS) spacetime, we elucidate how this approach to quantization complies with unitarity and the observer complementarity principle. We then comment on understanding the scattering of states in de Sitter spacetime. Furthermore, we discuss briefly the implications of our QFTCS approach to future research in quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: We explore the properties of a simple renormalizable shift symmetric model with a higher derivative kinetic energy and quartic derivative coupling, that can serve as a toy model for higher derivative theories of gravity. The scattering amplitude behaves as in a normal effective field theory below the threshold for the production of ghosts, but has an unexpectedly soft behavior above the threshold. The physical running of the parameters is extracted from the 2-point and 4-point amplitudes. The results are compared to those obtained by other methods and are found to agree only in limiting cases. We draw several lessons that may apply also to gravity.</description>

      <title>Urn models, Markov chains and random walks in cosmological topologically massive gravity at the critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a partition-valued stochastic process in the logarithmic sector of critical cosmological topologically massive gravity. By applying results obtained in our previous works, we first show that the logarithmic sector can be modelled as an urn scheme, with a conceptual view of the random process occurring in the theory as an evolutionary process whose dynamical state space is the urn content. The urn process is then identified as the celebrated Hoppe urn model. We next show a one-to-one correspondence between Hoppe's urn model and the genus-zero Feynman diagram expansion of the log sector in terms of rooted trees. In this context, the balls in the urn model are represented by nodes in the random tree model, and the "special" ball in this P\'{o}lya-like urn construction finds a nice interpretation as the root in the recursive tree model. Furthermore, a partition-valued Markov process in which a sequence of partitions whose distribution is given by Hurwitz numbers is shown to be encoded in the log partition function. Given the bijection between the set of partitions of $n$ and the conjugacy classes of the symmetric group $S_n$, it is shown that the structure of the Markov chain consisting of a sample space that is also the set of permutations of $n$ elements, leads to a further description of the Markov chain in terms of a random walk on the symmetric group. From this perspective, a probabilistic interpretation of the logarithmic sector of the theory as a two-dimensional gauge theory on the $S_n$ group manifold is given. We suggest that a possible holographic dual to cosmological topologically massive gravity at the critical point could be a logarithmic conformal field theory that takes into account non-equilibrium phenomena.</description>

Abstract: We consider Maxwell theory on a non-spin manifold. Depending on the choice of statistics for line operators, there are three non-anomalous theories and one anomalous theory with different symmetry fractionalizations. We establish the gauging maps that connect the non-anomalous theories by coupling them to a discrete gauge theory. We also construct topological interfaces associated with $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ duality and gauging of electric and magnetic one-form symmetries. Finally, by stacking the topological interfaces, we compose various kinds of duality defects, which lead to non-invertible symmetries of non-spin Maxwell theories.</description>

      <title>Algebraic realisation of three fermion generations with $S_3$ family and unbroken gauge symmetry from $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on previous work, we extend an algebraic realisation of three fermion generations within the complex Clifford algebra $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$ by incorporating a $U(1)_{em}$ gauge symmetry. The algebra $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$ corresponds to the algebra of complex linear maps from the (complexification of the) Cayley-Dickson algebra of sedenions, $\mathbb{S}$, to itself. Previous work represented three generations of fermions with $SU(3)_C$ colour symmetry permuted by an $S_3$ symmetry of order-three, but failed to include a $U(1)$ generator that assigns the correct electric charge to all states. Furthermore, the three generations suffered from a degree of linear dependence between states. By generalising the embedding of the discrete group $S_3$, corresponding to automorphisms of $\mathbb{S}$, into $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$, we include an $S_3$-invariant $U(1)$ that correctly assigns electric charge. First-generation states are represented in terms of two even $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$ semi-spinors, obtained from two minimal left ideals, related to each other via the order-two $S_3$ symmetry. The remaining two generations are obtained by applying the $S_3$ symmetry of order-three to the first generation. In this model, the gauge symmetries, $SU(3)_C\times U(1)_{em}$, are $S_3$-invariant and preserve the semi-spinors. As a result of the generalised embedding of the $S_3$ automorphisms of $\mathbb{S}$ into $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$, the three generations are now linearly independent.</description>

Abstract: We combine the Yang-Baxter (YB) and bi-Yang-Baxter (bi-YB) deformations with higher-spin auxiliary field deformations to construct multi-parameter families of integrable deformations of the principal chiral model on a Lie group $G$ with semi-simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. In the YB case, our construction produces one integrable deformation for each pair $(\mathcal{R}, E)$, where $\mathcal{R}$ is an antisymmetric bilinear operator on $\mathfrak{g}$ obeying the modified classical Yang-Baxter equation and $E$ is a function of several variables. In the bi-YB case, the pair becomes a triplet $(\mathcal{R},\tilde{\mathcal{R}}, E)$, where $\tilde{\mathcal{R}}$ is another antisymmetric bilinear operator on $\mathfrak{g}$ and obeys the non-split inhomogeneous modified classical Yang-Baxter equation. We show that every model in these families is (weakly) classically integrable by exhibiting a Lax representation for their equations of motion.</description>

      <title>Commutator technique for the heat kernel of minimal higher derivative operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We suggest a new technique of the asymptotic heat kernel expansion for minimal higher derivative operators of a generic $2M$-th order, $F(\nabla)=(-\Box)^M+\cdots$, in the background field formalism of gauge theories and quantum gravity. This technique represents the conversion of the recently suggested Fourier integral method of generalized exponential functions [Phys. Rev. D105, 065013 (2022), arXiv:2112.03062] into the commutator algebra of special differential operators, which allows one to express expansion coefficients for $F(\nabla)$ in terms of the Schwinger-DeWitt coefficients of a minimal second order operator $H(\nabla)$. This procedure is based on special functorial properties of the formalism including the Mellin-Barnes representation of the complex operator power $H^M(\nabla)$ and naturally leads to the origin of generalized exponential functions without directly appealing to the Fourier integral method. The algorithm is essentially more straightforward than the Fourier method and consists of three steps ready for computer codification by symbolic manipulation programs. They begin with the decomposition of the operator into a power of some minimal second order operator $H(\nabla)$ and its lower derivative "perturbation part" $W(\nabla)$, $F(\nabla)=H^M(\nabla)+W(\nabla)$, followed by considering their multiple nested commutators. The second step is the construction of special local differential operators -- the perturbation theory in powers of the lower derivative part $W(\nabla)$. The final step is the so-called procedure of their {\em syngification} consisting in a special modification of the covariant derivative monomials in these operators by Synge world function $\sigma(x,x')$ with their subsequent action on the HaMiDeW coefficients of $H(\nabla)$.</description>

      <title>A Note On Projective Structures On Compact Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projective structures on topological surfaces support the structure of 2d CFTs with a degree of technical simplification. We propose a complex analytic space $\mathcal{P}_g$ biholomorphic to $T^*_{(1,0)} \mathcal{M}_g$ as a candidate moduli space of the projective structures of the genus $g$ topological surface. Explicit analysis at $g=1$, including of the fibers over the fictitious orbifold loci of $\mathcal{M}_{g=1}$ and of transformations under the modular group, supports this proposal. It also shows that $\mathcal{P}_{g=1}$ naturally resolves the orbifold locus of the affine structure moduli space $\mathcal{A}_{g=1}$ which is related to the Hodge bundle over $\mathcal{M}_{g=1}$. For $g \geq 2$, intricate quotient operations are expected along fibers over the orbifold loci of $\mathcal{M}_g$, whose analysis we leave to future work.
  Physically, the space $\mathcal{P}_g$ represents the bundle of universal, stationary, chiral hydrodynamic flows spatially confined to compact genus-$g$ Riemann surfaces.</description>

      <title>The Carrollian limit of ModMax electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Carrollian limit of ModMax electrodynamics, namely the limit of vanishing speed of light, for the most general, four-dimensional, duality and conformal invariant electromagnetism. The theory is parameterized by a unique real constant $\gamma$, which remains playing a non-trivial role in the magnetic Carrollian case, while it can be removed in the electric Carrollian contraction, and we therefore focus in the former. Applying the technique of Lie point symmetries, we obtain that the magnetic limit is invariant under the Carrollian group, as well as under the local translation in Carrollian time $x^{0}\rightarrow x^{0\prime}=x^{0}+f\left(x^{i}\right) $ and $x^{i}\rightarrow x^{i\prime}=x^{i}$, with $f$ being an arbitrary function. A diagonal part of the symmetries span the Conformal Carroll algebra of level $2$, $\mathfrak{ccarr}_2$ in four dimensions. Two additional internal symmetries remain in the Carrollian limit of ModMax standing for the conformal invariance of the theory, as well as the invariance under duality transformations.</description>

      <title>Regge trajectories and bridges between them in integrable AdS/CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the analytic continuation in the spin of the planar spectrum of ABJM theory using the integrability-based Quantum Spectral Curve (QSC) method. Under some minimal assumptions, we classify the analytic properties of the Q functions appearing in the QSC compatible with the spin being non-integer. In this way we find not one - but two distinct possibilities. These two choices correspond to a discrete symmetry of the web of Regge trajectories under a spin shadow transformation: a symmetry which, to the best of our knowledge, had not been discussed before for the Chew-Frautschi plot. Under this symmetry, which we refer to as "twist/co-twist symmetry", a Regge trajectory is flipped into a "bridge", which connects leading with sub-leading Regge trajectories. Zigzagging between trajectories and bridges one can reach infinitely many real sheets of the spin Riemann surface without needing to go explicitly around the branch points located in the complex spin plane. Moreover, the symmetry implies the existence of twin points on leading and subleading trajectories, with the same scaling dimensions at any coupling. We discuss how an analogous phenomenon, based on the same mechanism at the level of the QSC, occurs at non-perturbative level in $\mathcal{N}$=4 SYM. This provides a framework to understand some recent independent observations of the symmetry at weak and strong coupling. We present numerical results for Regge trajectories in ABJM theory at finite coupling, in particular we compute exactly the coupling dependence of the position of the leading Regge pole in the correlator of four stress tensors. The shape of this leading trajectory shows a behaviour at weak coupling that strongly resembles the BFKL limit in $\mathcal{N}$=4 SYM.</description>

Abstract: We remind the definition and main properties of the Krichever quasiclassical tau-function, and turn to the application of these formulas for recent studies of two-dimensional quantum gravity. We show, that in the case of minimal gravity it turns to be directly related with the Verlinde formula for minimal models, giving in particular case its one more direct proof. Generalizations for continuous "complex Liouville" theory are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Einstein Equation Governs the Dynamics of Entanglement Entropy in CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The {\it finiteness} of the mixed state entanglement entropy $S_{\text{vN}}$ in CFT$_2$ enables us to show that, the dynamical equation of the coincidence limit of $(\frac{1}{2} S_{vN}^2);_{ij}$ is precisely Einstein equation. A profound relation between the cosmological constant and CFT entanglement entropy is given. Thus entanglement entropies induce internal entropic gravitational geometries in CFT. Deriving the dual metric from an entanglement entropy becomes a trivial procedure. Remarkably, the renormalization group equation turns out to be a geometric identity. As a natural consequence, we are led to conjecture that, the gauge/gravity duality might be `` flat background QFT coupled with an internal entropic gravitational geometry on the boundary $=$ gravity and coupled QFT in the bulk''.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by Son's model for graphene, we consider a $(2+1)$-dimensional fermionic system in which fermions are described by four-component spinors. These fermions are proposed to interact with an electromagnetic field originating from a four-dimensional setting, as the graphene plate is embedded in 4d Minkowski spacetime. In this framework, a chiral anomaly arises at the boundary of the plate, stemming from a non-local anomaly action that depends on both the electromagnetic and chiral gauge fields when the chiral transformation is localized. This results in boundary chiral and electric currents, and we explore potentially observable effects when external magnetic or electric fields are applied to the fermionic system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model is in the midst of a stress test, thanks to the tension between supernovae-based measurements of the Hubble constant $H_{0}$ and inferences of its values from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. Numerous explanations for the present-day cosmic acceleration require the presence of a new fundamental scalar field, as do Early Dark Energy (EDE) solutions to the Hubble tension. This raises the possibility that multiple fields cooperatively contribute to the dark energy component in bursts throughout cosmic time due to distinct initial conditions and couplings. Here, this Cascading Dark Energy (CDE) scenario is illustrated through a realization that effectively reduces to a two-field model, with two epochs in which dark energy is cosmologically significant. The model is compared to measurements of the CMB, baryon acoustic oscillations, as well as both PANTHEON and SH0ES observations of Type-Ia supernovae. Neglecting the linear perturbations, it is found that this scenario ameliorates the Hubble tension, improving over purely late-time models of dark energy, and the agreement between the galaxy survey measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations.</description>

Abstract: We study the mapping properties of a large class of elliptic operators $P_T$ in gluing problems where two non-compact manifolds with asymptotically cylindrical geometry are glued along a neck of length $2T$. In the limit where $T \rightarrow \infty$, we reduce the question of constructing approximate solutions of $P_T u = f$ to a finite-dimensional linear system, and provide a geometric interpretation of the obstructions to solving this system. Under some assumptions on the real roots of the model operator $P_0$ on the cylinder, we construct a Fredholm inverse for $P_T$ with good control on the growth of its norm. As applications of our method, we study the decay rate and density of the low eigenvalues of the Laplacian acting on differential forms, and give improved estimates for compact $G_2$-manifolds constructed by twisted connected sum. We relate our results to the swampland distance conjectures in physics.</description>

      <title>Probing the quantum nature of black holes with ultra-light boson environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum black holes (BHs), thought of as an excited multilevel system, can be effectively modelled by replacing an event horizon with a partially reflective membrane. This emergent feature affects their interaction with hosting environments, with the most pronounced effects happening for particles with mass~$m_{\rm p}\lesssim (10 M_{\odot}/M)\,10^{-11}\mathrm{\,eV}$, where~$M$ is the BH mass. We show that ultra-light bosons -- a viable dark matter candidate -- can be used to probe the quantum nature of BHs. We derive analytical expressions for the accretion rate and dynamical friction acting on exotic compact objects moving through an ultra-light scalar field, finding that while the accretion rate is sensitive to the quantum BH's reflectivity, the dynamical friction is the same as for classical BHs. We then use these expressions to estimate the orbital dephasing in the inspiralling of different binaries in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) band. Our results indicate that LISA may be able to discriminate quantum from classical BHs through their different accretion rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exceptional compact hermitian symmetric space EIII is the quotient $E_6/Spin(10)\times_{\mathbb{Z}_4}U(1)$. We introduce the Pl\"ucker coordinates which give an embedding of EIII into $\mathbb{C}P^{26}$ as a projective subvariety. The subvariety is cut out by 27 Pl\"ucker relations. We show that, using Clifford algebra, one can solve this over-determined system of relations, giving local coordinate charts to the space.
  Our motivation is to understand EIII as the complex projective octonion plane $(\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{O})P^2$, whose construction is somewhat scattered across the literature. We will see that the EIII has an atlas whose transition functions have clear octonion interpretations, apart from those covering a sub-variety $X_{\infty}$ of dimension 10. This subvariety is itself a hermitian symmetric space known as DIII, with no apparent octonion interpretation. We give detailed analysis of the geometry in the neighbourhood of $X_{\infty}$.
  We further decompose $X={\rm EIII}$ into $F_4$-orbits: $X=Y_0\cup Y_{\infty}$, where $Y_0\sim(\mathbb{O}P^2)_{\mathbb{C}}$ is an open $F_4$-orbit and is the complexification of $\mathbb{O}P^2$, whereas $Y_{\infty}$ has co-dimension 1, thus EIII could be more appropriately denoted as $\overline{(\mathbb{O}P^2)_{\mathbb{C}}}$. This decomposition appears in the classification of equivariant completion of homogeneous algebraic varieties by Ahiezer \cite{Ahiezer}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on renormalizable cosmology based on the Gauss-Bonnet theory with torsion. Within the framework of renormalizable quantum field theory, we study the matter field containing the Gauss-Bonnet correction term. By modifying the gauge model, which includes a charged scalar field and two families of fermions, and introducing torsion and Gauss-Bonnet corrections, we analyze the field equations in the super-symmetric hybrid inflation model, investigate the properties of torsion in a flat universe, the characteristics of the energy-momentum tensor, and the sensitivity of the theoretical model to correction parameters. This study shows that the Gauss-Bonnet correction term can directly affect the Hubble constant through the Einstein equations, providing a new observational perspective. This paper proposes a cosmological model that can be adjusted according to different Gauss-Bonnet correction models, providing a theoretical reference for future observational verification of various Gauss-Bonnet models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ first-principles quantum field theoretical methods to investigate the longitudinal and transverse electrical conductivities of a strongly magnetized hot quantum electrodynamics (QED) plasma at the leading order in coupling. The analysis employs the fermion damping rate in the Landau-level representation, calculated with full kinematics and exact amplitudes of one-to-two and two-to-one QED processes. In the relativistic regime, both conductivities exhibit an approximate scaling behavior described by $\sigma_{\parallel,\perp} = T \tilde{\sigma}_{\parallel,\perp}$, where $\tilde{\sigma}_{\parallel,\perp}$ are functions of the dimensionless ratio $|eB|/T^2$ (with $T$ denoting temperature and $B$ magnetic field strength). We argue that the mechanisms for the transverse and longitudinal conductivities differ significantly, leading to a strong suppression of the former in comparison to the latter.</description>

      <title>Learning to grok: Emergence of in-context learning and skill composition in modular arithmetic tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models can solve tasks that were not present in the training set. This capability is believed to be due to in-context learning and skill composition. In this work, we study the emergence of in-context learning and skill composition in a collection of modular arithmetic tasks. Specifically, we consider a finite collection of linear modular functions $z = a \, x + b \, y \;\mathrm{mod}\; p$ labeled by the vector $(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z}_p^2$. We use some of these tasks for pre-training and the rest for out-of-distribution testing. We empirically show that a GPT-style transformer exhibits a transition from in-distribution to out-of-distribution generalization as the number of pre-training tasks increases. We find that the smallest model capable of out-of-distribution generalization requires two transformer blocks, while for deeper models, the out-of-distribution generalization phase is \emph{transient}, necessitating early stopping. Finally, we perform an interpretability study of the pre-trained models, revealing highly structured representations in both attention heads and MLPs; and discuss the learned algorithms. Notably, we find an algorithmic shift in deeper models, as we go from few to many in-context examples.</description>

      <title>Towards 2-dimensional non-commutative integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We collect evidence that the notion of path-ordered non-abelian integration admits an extension to two dimensions. We propose the corresponding notion of non-abelian 2-form along the lines of Lie algebroid theory and argue it is an appropriate one. The processes of parallel transport and integration turn out to be subtly different in the 2-dimensional case; we discuss parallel transport along surfaces and present an indirect definition of a non-abelian integral. This integral includes, for specific choices of 2-forms, both abelian integrals and the continuous limit of Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula as special cases; it interpolates between those cases and broadly generalizes them, allowing, for example, an analog of path-exponential with local, point-depending commutators to be spoken about. We comment on all these objects, their relations, gauge symmetries and geometrical meaning, and roughly sketch a plausible order-by-order procedure for obtaining formulas for non-abelian integrals. The exposition is reasonably concrete, relying on no notions more abstract than sections of vector bundles and homotopies.</description>

      <title>Superpotential method and the amplification of inflationary perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superpotential method is a reconstruction technique which has proven useful to build exact cosmological solutions. We here employ the superpotential method in order to reconstruct the features necessary for the inflaton potential to drive inflation and lead to the amplification of the curvature perturbations. Such an amplification, at wavelengths shorter than those observed in the cosmic microwave background, is necessary in order to have a significant formation of primordial black holes after inflation ends. The technique is applied to the cases of a minimally coupled inflaton, to the nonminimal coupling case and to $f(R)$ theories of gravity. For such theories, a model dependent analysis of the features leading to the scalar spectrum enhancement is also presented.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes in Induced Gravity Inflationary Models with Two Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-field inflationary model with the induced gravity term. Using conformal transformation of the metric, we get the chiral cosmological model with two scalar fields. We demonstrate that the constructed inflationary model does not contradict to the recent observation data and is suitable for primordial black hole (PBH) formation. The estimation of PBH masses allows to consider PBHs as dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>On the Generality and Persistence of Cosmological Stasis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical decays of $N$ matter species to radiation may balance against Hubble expansion to yield stasis, a new phase of cosmological evolution with constant matter and radiation abundances. We analyze stasis with various machine learning techniques on the full $2N$-dimensional space of decay rates and abundances, which serve as inputs to the system of Boltzmann equations that governs the dynamics. We construct a differentiable Boltzmann solver to maximize the number of stasis $e$-folds $\mathcal{N}$. High-stasis configurations obtained by gradient ascent motivate log-uniform distributions on rates and abundances to accompany power-law distributions of previous works. We demonstrate that random configurations drawn from these families of distributions regularly exhibit many $e$-folds of stasis. We additionally use them as priors in a Bayesian analysis conditioned on stasis, using stochastic variational inference with normalizing flows to model the posterior. All three numerical analyses demonstrate the generality of stasis and point to a new model in which the rates and abundances are exponential in the species index. We show that the exponential model solves the exact stasis equations, is an attractor, and satisfies $\mathcal{N}\propto N$, exhibiting inflation-level $e$-folding with a relatively low number of species. This is contrasted with the $\mathcal{N}\propto \log(N)$ scaling of power-law models. Finally, we discuss implications for the emergent string conjecture and string axiverse.</description>

      <title>Chiral Edge States Emerging on Anyon-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a symmetry-based approach to constructing lattice models for chiral topological phases, focusing on non-Abelian anyons. Using a 2+1D version of anyon chains and modular tensor categories(MTCs), we ensure exact MTC symmetry at the microscopic level. Numerical simulations using tensor networks demonstrate chiral edge modes for topological phases with Ising and Fibonacci anyons. Our method contrasts with conventional solvability approaches, providing a new theoretical avenue to explore strongly coupled 2+1D systems, revealing chiral edge states in non-Abelian anyonic systems.</description>

      <title>Compact star in noninteger power model of $f(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate compact stars in the noninteger power (NIP) model of $f(R)$ gravity theory, which includes the higher-curvature correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action. The mass-radius relation of the compact stars in the NIP model predicts large deviations from those in the general relativity in the low-mass region, potentially allowing us to test the NIP model by future astrophysical observations. We also study the nonvanishing scalar hair surrounding the compact star and demonstrate that the chameleon mechanism works efficiently. They result in distinct scalar profiles inside and outside the star, which implies screening the fifth force mediated by the scalar field.</description>

      <title>Charged superradiant instability in a spherical regular black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the stability of a spherically symmetric regular black hole when subjected to perturbations from a charged scalar field. This particular black hole is constructed by deforming the Minkowski spacetime. It has been observed that the charged superradiant instability arises only within a specific range of the deformation parameter, potentially resulting in an instability growth rate with a maximum magnitude of approximately $\text{Im} (M \omega) \sim 10^{-3}$. This growth rate significantly exceeds the instability identified in ABG black holes discussed in prior research, suggesting a notable timescale for detecting this phenomenon in astrophysical scenarios. Additionally, we conduct a thorough investigation into how the three parameters of the model influence the onset and intensity of the instability. Our analysis offers further insights into the possible emergence of this instability in spherically regular black holes and its association with the nonlinear effects of the electromagnetic field.</description>
