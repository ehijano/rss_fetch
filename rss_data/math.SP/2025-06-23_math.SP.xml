      <title>Eigenvalue estimates for the Coulombic one-particle density matrix and the kinetic energy density matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a bound state (an eigenfunction) $\psi$ of an atom with $N$ electrons. We study the spectra of the one-particle density matrix $\gamma$ and of the one-particle kinetic energy density matrix $\tau$ associated with $\psi$. The paper contains two results. First, we obtain the bounds $\lambda_k(\gamma)\le C_1 k^{-8/3}$ and $\lambda_k(\tau)\le C_2 k^{-2}$ with some positive constants $C_1, C_2$ that depend explicitly on the eigenfunction $\psi$. The sharpness of these bounds is confirmed by the asymptotic results obtained by the author in earlier papers. The advantage of these bounds over the ones derived by the author previously, is their explicit dependence on the eigenfunction. Moreover, their new proofs are more elementary and direct. The second result is new and it pertains to the case where the eigenfunction $\psi$ vanishes at the particle coalescence points. In particular, this is true for totally antisymmetric $\psi$. In this case the eigenfunction $\psi$ exhibits enhanced regularity at the coalescence points which leads to the faster decay of the eigenvalues: $\lambda_k(\gamma)\le C_3 k^{-10/3}$ and $\lambda_k(\tau)\le C_4 k^{-8/3}$.
  The proofs rely on the estimates for the derivatives of the eigenfunction $\psi$ that depend explicitly on the distance to the coalescence points. Some of these estimates are borrowed directly from, and some are derived using the methods of a recent paper by S. Fournais and T. \O. S\o rensen.</description>

      <title>Quadratic estimates for the $H^\infty$-functional calculus of bisectorial Clifford operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $H^\infty$-functional calculus is a two-step procedure, introduced by A. McIntosh, that allows the definition of functions of sectorial operators in Banach spaces. It plays a crucial role in the spectral theory of differential operators, as well as in their applications to evolution equations and various other fields of science. An extension of the $H^\infty$-functional calculus also exists in the hypercomplex setting, where it is based on the notion of $S$-spectrum. Originally this was done for sectorial quaternionic operators, but then also generalized all the way to bisectorial fully Clifford operators. In the latter setting and in Hilbert spaces, this paper now characterizes the boundedness of the $H^\infty$-functional calculus through certain quadratic estimates. Due to substantial differences in the definitions of the $S$-spectrum and the $S$-resolvent operators, the proofs of quadratic estimates in this setting face additional challenges compared to the classical theory of complex operators.</description>

      <title>Convergent Methods for Koopman Operators on Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven spectral analysis of Koopman operators is a powerful tool for understanding numerous real-world dynamical systems, from neuronal activity to variations in sea surface temperature. The Koopman operator acts on a function space and is most commonly studied on the space of square-integrable functions. However, defining it on a suitable reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) offers numerous practical advantages, including pointwise predictions with error bounds, improved spectral properties that facilitate computations, and more efficient algorithms, particularly in high dimensions. We introduce the first general, provably convergent, data-driven algorithms for computing spectral properties of Koopman and Perron--Frobenius operators on RKHSs. These methods efficiently compute spectra and pseudospectra with error control and spectral measures while exploiting the RKHS structure to avoid the large-data limits required in the $L^2$ settings. The function space is determined by a user-specified kernel, eliminating the need for quadrature-based sampling as in $L^2$ and enabling greater flexibility with finite, externally provided datasets. Using the Solvability Complexity Index hierarchy, we construct adversarial dynamical systems for these problems to show that no algorithm can succeed in fewer limits, thereby proving the optimality of our algorithms. Notably, this impossibility extends to randomized algorithms and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on challenging, high-dimensional datasets arising from real-world measurements and high-fidelity numerical simulations, including turbulent channel flow, molecular dynamics of a binding protein, Antarctic sea ice concentration, and Northern Hemisphere sea surface height. The algorithms are publicly available in the software package $\texttt{SpecRKHS}$.</description>

      <title>A note on twisted, straight, and sheared waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the Dirichlet Laplacian $-\Delta_{\Omega}^D$ in an unbounded waveguide $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^3$, where the cross-section is translated in a constant direction and rotated along a spatial line. We focus on the effects of twisting on the spectrum, discussing conditions under which discrete eigenvalues emerge. Our results highlight the interplay between geometry and spectral properties, showing that shearing can induce a richer spectral structure even in straight waveguides.</description>

      <title>$L^p$ boundedness of wave operators for higher order schr\"odinger operators with threshold eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the higher order Schr\"odinger operator $H=(-\Delta)^m+V(x)$ in $n$ dimensions with real-valued potential $V$ when $n&gt;2m$, $m\in \mathbb N$ when $H$ has a threshold eigenvalue. We adapt our recent results for $m\geq 1$ when $n&gt;4m$ to lower dimensions $2m&lt;n\leq 4m$ to show that when $H$ has a threshold eigenvalue and no resonances, the wave operators are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb R^n)$ for the natural range $1\leq p&lt;\frac{2n}{n-1}$ when $n$ is odd and $1\leq p&lt;\frac{2n}{n-2}$ when $n$ is even. We further show that if the zero energy eigenfunctions are orthogonal to $x^\alpha V(x)$ for all $|\alpha|&lt;k_0$, then the wave operators are bounded on $1\leq p&lt;\frac{n}{2m-k_0}$ when $k_0&lt;2m$ in all dimensions $n&gt;2m$. The range is $p\in [1,\infty)$ and $p\in[1,\infty]$ when $k_0=2m$ and $k_0&gt;2m$ respectively. The proofs apply in the classical $m=1$ case as well and streamlines existing arguments in the eigenvalue only case, in particular the $L^\infty(\mathbb R^n)$ boundedness is new when $n&gt;3$.</description>

      <title>Determinant formulas for finite Toeplitz plus Hankel matrices with rational symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1975 K. Michael Day produced an exact formula for the determinants of finite Toeplitz matrices whose symbols are rational. The answer is a sum that involves powers of the roots of the numerator of the symbol and whose coefficients depend on both the roots of the numerator and denominator. In this paper we prove an analogue of Day's formula for determinants of finite Toeplitz plus Hankel matrices with rational symbols. The key to the proof is an exact formula for the finite determinants that involves a Fredholm determinant that can be explicitly computed. We apply the formula to find information about the limiting eigenvalues of the finite Toeplitz plus Hankel matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to construct a sequence of spin hyperbolic surfaces $\Sigma_n$ with genus going to infinity and with a uniform spectral gap for the Dirac operator. Our construction is completely explicit. In particular, the $\Sigma_n$ can be taken to be a tower of covers, with each $\Sigma_n$ an arithmetic hyperbolic surface.</description>

      <title>Spectral convergence of graph Laplacians with Ricci curvature bounds and in non-collapsed Ricci limit spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes quantitative high-probability bounds on the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of $\epsilon$-neighborhood graph Laplacians constructed from i.i.d. random variables on $m$-dimensional closed Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$ that satisfy a uniform lower Ricci curvature bound $\operatorname{Ric}_g\ge -(m-1)K$, a positive lower volume bound, and an upper diameter bound. These results extend to non-collapsed Ricci limit spaces that are measured Gromov-Hausdorff limits of such manifolds, and the bounds give a spectral approximation of weighted Laplacians on manifolds with non-smooth points.</description>
