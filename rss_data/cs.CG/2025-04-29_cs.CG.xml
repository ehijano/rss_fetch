      <title>Similarity matrix average for aggregating multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a methodology based on averaging similarity matrices with the aim of integrating the layers of a multiplex network into a single monoplex network. Multiplex networks are adopted for modelling a wide variety of real-world frameworks, such as multi-type relations in social, economic and biological structures. More specifically, multiplex networks are used when relations of different nature (layers) arise between a set of elements from a given population (nodes). A possible approach for investigating multiplex networks consists in aggregating the different layers in a single network (monoplex) which is a valid representation -- in some sense -- of all the layers. In order to obtain such an aggregated network, we propose a theoretical approach -- along with its practical implementation -- which stems on the concept of similarity matrix average. This methodology is finally applied to a multiplex similarity network of statistical journals, where the three considered layers express the similarity of the journals based on co-citations, common authors and common editors, respectively.</description>

      <title>MASH: Masked Anchored SpHerical Distances for 3D Shape Representation and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Masked Anchored SpHerical Distances (MASH), a novel multi-view and parametrized representation of 3D shapes. Inspired by multi-view geometry and motivated by the importance of perceptual shape understanding for learning 3D shapes, MASH represents a 3D shape as a collection of observable local surface patches, each defined by a spherical distance function emanating from an anchor point. We further leverage the compactness of spherical harmonics to encode the MASH functions, combined with a generalized view cone with a parameterized base that masks the spatial extent of the spherical function to attain locality. We develop a differentiable optimization algorithm capable of converting any point cloud into a MASH representation accurately approximating ground-truth surfaces with arbitrary geometry and topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MASH is versatile for multiple applications including surface reconstruction, shape generation, completion, and blending, achieving superior performance thanks to its unique representation encompassing both implicit and explicit features.</description>

      <title>Ordered Yao graphs: maximum degree, edge numbers, and clique numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a positive integer $k$ and an ordered set of $n$ points in the plane, define its k-sector ordered Yao graphs as follows. Divide the plane around each point into $k$ equal sectors and draw an edge from each point to its closest predecessor in each of the $k$ sectors. We analyze several natural parameters of these graphs. Our main results are as follows:
  I) Let $d_k(n)$ be the maximum integer so that for every $n$-element point set in the plane, there exists an order such that the corresponding $k$-sector ordered Yao graph has maximum degree at least $d_k(n)$. We show that $d_k(n)=n-1$ if $k=4$ or $k \ge 6$, and provide some estimates for the remaining values of $k$. Namely, we show that $d_1(n) = \Theta( \log_2n )$; $\frac{1}{2}(n-1) \le d_3(n) \le 5\left\lceil\frac{n}{6}\right\rceil-1$; $\frac{2}{3}(n-1) \le d_5(n) \le n-1$;
  II) Let $e_k(n)$ be the minimum integer so that for every $n$-element point set in the plane, there exists an order such that the corresponding $k$-sector ordered Yao graph has at most $e_k(n)$ edges. Then $e_k(n)=\left\lceil\frac{k}{2}\right\rceil\cdot n-o(n)$.
  III) Let $w_k$ be the minimum integer so that for every point set in the plane, there exists an order such that the corresponding $k$-sector ordered Yao graph has clique number at most $w_k$. Then $\lceil\frac{k}{2}\rceil \le w_k\le \lceil\frac{k}{2}\rceil+1$.
  All the orders mentioned above can be constructed effectively.</description>
