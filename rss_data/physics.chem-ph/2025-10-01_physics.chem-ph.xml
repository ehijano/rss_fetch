      <title>Natural Excitation Framework for Defining the External Space: Uncontracted and Internally Contracted Multireference Nonorthogonal Wavefunction Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this communication, we examine new formalisms for the construction of the external space when correlating reference wavefunctions built from nonorthogonal determinant expansions. Defining the external space in nonorthogonal approaches is challenging, as every substitution from the reference wavefunction can potentially mix both internal and external configurations. As a result, post-nonorthogonal methods are plagued by internal contamination and linear dependencies in the external space, which may lead to correlation double counting that results from overlap of the external and reference spaces. Removal of these internal configurations and orthonormalization of the excited space basis can be computationally expensive. In particular, as the excitation operators cannot be subdivided by their action on orbital subspaces, the external space cannot be partitioned into non-overlapping subsets as is possible in orthogonal methods. To resolve these issues, we propose both uncontracted and internally-contracted approaches based on a natural excitation framework that allows for reduced scaling, more straightforward separation of excitation types that lead to external and internal spaces, and allows for a facile translation of orthogonal methods to a nonorthogonal framework. Several proofs are provided to illustrate the viability of the proposed approach, using a method-agnostic presentation to highlight the generality of the approach.</description>

      <title>Towards A Universally Transferable Acceleration Method for Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, sophisticated deep learning-based approaches have been developed for generating efficient initial guesses to accelerate the convergence of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While the actual initial guesses are often density matrices (DM), quantities that can convert into density matrices also qualify as alternative forms of initial guesses. Hence, existing works mostly rely on the prediction of the Hamiltonian matrix for obtaining high-quality initial guesses. However, the Hamiltonian matrix is both numerically difficult to predict and intrinsically non-transferable, hindering the application of such models in real scenarios. In light of this, we propose a method that constructs DFT initial guesses by predicting the electron density in a compact auxiliary basis representation using E(3)-equivariant neural networks. Trained on small molecules with up to 20 atoms, our model is able to achieve an average 33.3% self-consistent field (SCF) step reduction on systems up to 60 atoms, substantially outperforming Hamiltonian-centric and DM-centric models. Critically, this acceleration remains nearly constant with increasing system sizes and exhibits strong transferring behaviors across orbital basis sets and exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first and robust candidate for a universally transferable DFT acceleration method. We are also releasing the SCFbench dataset and its accompanying code to facilitate future research in this promising direction.</description>

      <title>Scalable Reactive Atomistic Dynamics with GAIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The groundbreaking advance in materials and chemical research has been driven by the development of atomistic simulations. However, the broader applicability of the atomistic simulations remains restricted, as they inherently depend on energy models that are either inaccurate or computationally prohibitive. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have recently emerged as a promising class of energy models, but their deployment remains challenging due to the lack of systematic protocols for generating diverse training data. Here we automate the construction of training datasets to enable the development of general-purpose MLIPs, by introducing GAIA, an end-to-end framework to build a wide range of atomic arrangements. By employing systematic evaluation of metadynamics for effective structural exploration, GAIA overcomes the heuristic nature of conventional dataset generation. Using GAIA, we constructed Titan25, a benchmark-scale dataset, and trained MLIPs that closely match both static and dynamic density functional theory results. The models further reproduce experimental observations across reactive regimes, including detonation, coalescence, and catalytic activity. GAIA narrows the gap between experiment and simulation, and paves the way for the development of universal MLIPs that can reliably describe a wide spectrum of materials and chemical processes.</description>

      <title>A Multimode Classical Hierarchical Fokker-Planck Equations Approach to Molecular Vibrations: Simulating Two-Dimensional Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multimode Brownian model with nonlinear system-bath coupling offers a flexible framework for studying both intra- and intermolecular vibrational modes in condensed-phase molecular systems. This approach allows us to calculate linear and nonlinear spectra of molecular vibrations and to examine thermal effects-such as anharmonicity, energy relaxation, and dephasing-as reflected in the spectral peak profiles. In this study, we present a computer program based on classical hierarchical Fokker-Planck equations applied to three vibrational modes of a molecular liquid. The primary objective of developing this code was to simulate the two-dimensional correlation spectrum of the intramolecular modes of liquid water. [R. Hoshino and Y. Tanimura, J. Chem. Phys. 162, 044105 (2025)]. The code has been further refined to optimize grid selection and numerical integration routines for graphics processing units (GPUs). As a demonstration, we apply this setup to simulate three interacting modes representing intermolecular vibrations in water, and calculate the resulting two-dimensional terahertz-Raman signals. The code and example routines are available in the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Decoding Shake-up Satellites in XPS through Large-Scale ab initio Simulations: Spectral Signatures of Ring Fusion in Porphyrins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), shake-up satellites arise when core ionization is accompanied by simultaneous charge-neutral valence excitations. Although these satellites can contain detailed structural information, they are rarely interpreted due to the lack of accurate and scalable theoretical methods. Here, we develop and apply a many-body perturbation theory framework within the $GW$ plus cumulant ($GW+C$) approach that enables accurate predictions of shake-up satellites in large molecular systems. For unfused, mono-fused, and doubly fused porphyrin derivatives with up to 170 atoms, we achieve excellent agreement with experiment, reproducing both main photoionization signals and satellite features within $0.2-0.3$ eV. We show that ring fusion strongly affects satellite features, whereas the N 1s photoionization signals remain unchanged. Our calculations reveal the mechanism behind these changes, identifying the spatial localization of valence excitations as the driving force. This work not only deepens understanding of the shake-up mechanism in porphyrins but also shows how predictive computations can unlock the chemical information encoded in satellites.</description>

      <title>Are neural scaling laws leading quantum chemistry astray?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural scaling laws are driving the machine learning community toward training ever-larger foundation models across domains, assuring high accuracy and transferable representations for extrapolative tasks. We test this promise in quantum chemistry by scaling model capacity and training data from quantum chemical calculations. As a generalization task, we evaluate the resulting models' predictions of the bond dissociation energy of neutral H$_2$, the simplest possible molecule. We find that, regardless of dataset size or model capacity, models trained only on stable structures fail dramatically to even qualitatively reproduce the H$_2$ energy curve. Only when compressed and stretched geometries are explicitly included in training do the predictions roughly resemble the correct shape. Nonetheless, the largest foundation models trained on the largest and most diverse datasets containing dissociating diatomics exhibit serious failures on simple diatomic molecules. Most strikingly, they cannot reproduce the trivial repulsive energy curve of two bare protons, revealing their failure to learn the basic Coulomb's law involved in electronic structure theory. These results suggest that scaling alone is insufficient for building reliable quantum chemical models.</description>

      <title>Chiral Pt(Me-BPCH): Synthesis and theoretical investigation of parity violation sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complex of platinum and the tetra-coordinate chelating ligand, R,R'-6,6'-dimethyl-N,N'-bis(2'-pyridine-carboxamide)-1-cyclohexane (Me-BPCH) is investigated as a potential candidate for measurement of parity violation (PV) in chiral molecules. The synthesis of Pt(Me-BPCH) is presented alongside computational investigation of PV sensitivity in its vibrational spectrum. Pt(Me-BPCH) is compared to other two derivatives of this complex, Au(Me-BPCH) and Pt(CF$_3$-BPCH) in terms of their PV response and suitability for measurement. We identify the most promising vibrational transitions based on their enhanced PV effects and practical experimental considerations and analyze the relationship between the vibrational structure and the corresponding PV sensitivity for all three molecules.</description>

      <title>AIM: Adaptive Intervention for Deep Multi-task Learning of Molecular Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing multiple, frequently conflicting, molecular properties is a key bottleneck in the development of novel therapeutics. Although a promising approach, the efficacy of multi-task learning is often compromised by destructive gradient interference, especially in the data-scarce regimes common to drug discovery. To address this, we propose AIM, an optimization framework that learns a dynamic policy to mediate gradient conflicts. The policy is trained jointly with the main network using a novel augmented objective composed of dense, differentiable regularizers. This objective guides the policy to produce updates that are geometrically stable and dynamically efficient, prioritizing progress on the most challenging tasks. We demonstrate that AIM achieves statistically significant improvements over multi-task baselines on subsets of the QM9 and targeted protein degraders benchmarks, with its advantage being most pronounced in data-scarce regimes. Beyond performance, AIM's key contribution is its interpretability; the learned policy matrix serves as a diagnostic tool for analyzing inter-task relationships. This combination of data-efficient performance and diagnostic insight highlights the potential of adaptive optimizers to accelerate scientific discovery by creating more robust and insightful models for multi-property molecular design.</description>

      <title>The Effective Reactivity for Capturing Brownian Motion by Partially Reactive Patches on a Spherical Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the trapping of diffusing ligands, modeled as Brownian particles, by a sphere that has $N$ partially reactive boundary patches, each of small area, on an otherwise reflecting boundary. For such a structured target, the partial reactivity of each boundary patch is characterized by a Robin boundary condition, with a local boundary reactivity $\kappa_i$ for $i=1,\ldots,N$. For any spatial arrangement of well-separated patches on the surface of the sphere, the method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to derive explicit results for the capacitance $C_{\rm T}$ of the structured target, which is valid for any $\kappa_i&gt;0$. This target capacitance $C_{\rm T}$ is defined in terms of a Green's matrix, which depends on the spatial configuration of patches, the local reactive capacitance $C_i(\kappa_i)$ of each patch and another coefficient that depends on the local geometry near a patch. The analytical dependence of $C_{i}(\kappa_i)$ on $\kappa_i$ is uncovered via a spectral expansion over Steklov eigenfunctions. For circular patches, the latter are readily computed numerically and provide an accurate fully explicit sigmoidal approximation for $C_{i}(\kappa_i)$. In the homogenization limit of $N\gg 1$ identical uniformly-spaced patches with $\kappa_i=\kappa$, we derive an explicit scaling law for the effective capacitance and the effective reactivity of the structured target that is valid in the limit of small patch area fraction. From a comparison with numerical simulations, we show that this scaling law provides a highly accurate approximation over the full range $\kappa&gt;0$, even when there is only a moderately large number of reactive patches.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Simulations of Catalytic Metal Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of metal surfaces are critical for catalytic innovation. Yet existing methods face a cost-accuracy dilemma: density functional theory is efficient but system-dependent in accuracy, while wavefunction-based theories are accurate but prohibitively costly. Here we introduce FEMION (Fragment Embedding for Metals and Insulators with Onsite and Nonlocal correlation), a systematically improvable quantum embedding framework that resolves this challenge by capturing partially filled electronic states in metals. FEMION combines auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo for local catalytic sites with a global random phase approximation treatment of nonlocal screening, yielding a scalable approach across diverse catalytic systems. Employing FEMION, we address two longstanding challenges: determining the preferred CO adsorption site and quantifying the H2 desorption barrier on Cu(111). Furthermore, our calculations demonstrate that the recently discovered 10-electron-count rule can also be extended to the single-atom catalysis processes on 3d metal surfaces, resolving the controversies arising from density functional theory calculations. We thus open a predictive, first-principles route to modeling complex catalytic systems.</description>

      <title>Noise-reduced stochastic resolution of identity to CC2 for large-scale calculations via tensor hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic resolution of identity (sRI) approximation significantly reduces the computational scaling of CC2 from O(N^5) to O(N^3), where N is a measure of system size. However, the inherent stochastic noise, while controllable, can introduce substantial errors in energy derivatives, limiting its reliability for molecular dynamics simulations. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce a noise-reduced approach, termed THC-sRI-CC2, which synergistically combines the sRI framework with tensor hypercontraction (THC). In this formulation, the expensive Coulomb term, which scales as O(N^4), is decoupled via THC, while the time-determining exchange term with an O(N^5) cost is addressed through the sRI scheme, collectively yielding an overall O(N^3) scaling. Benchmarks demonstrate that our THC-sRI-CC2 implementation achieves greater accuracy and markedly reduced stochastic noise compared to conventional sRI-CC2 with identical computational samplings. The resulting O(N^3) scaling substantially extends the applicability of CC2 for excited-state energy calculations and nonadiabatic dynamics simulations of large molecular systems. Furthermore, this work establishes a general THC-sRI hybrid strategy for the development of reduced-scaling electronic structure methods.</description>

      <title>High-Spin State Dynamics and Quintet-Mediated Emission in Intramolecular Singlet Fission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-spin states in molecular systems hold significant interest for a wide range of applications ranging from optoelectronics to quantum information and singlet fission (SF). Quintet and triplet states play crucial roles, particularly in SF systems, necessitating a precise monitoring and control of their spin dynamics. Spin states in intramolecular SF (iSF) are of particular interest, but tuning these systems to control triplet multiplication pathways has not been extensively studied. Additionally, whilst studies in this context focus on participation of triplet pathways leading to photoluminescence, emission pathways via quintet states remain largely unexplored. Here, we employ a set of unique spin-sensitive techniques to investigate high-spin state formation and emission in dimers and trimers comprising multiple diphenylhexatriene (DPH) units. We demonstrate the formation of pure quintet states in all these oligomers, with high-spin state optical emission via quintet states dominating delayed fluorescence up to room temperature. For triplet formation, we distinguish between the ability to form weakly exchange-coupled triplet pairs and the efficiency-reducing pathway of intersystem crossing (ISC), identifying the trimer Me-(DPH)$_3$ as the only oligomer exhibiting exclusively the desired SF pathways. Conversely, linear (DPH)$_3$ and (DPH)$_2$ show additional or exclusive triplet pathways via ISC. Our comprehensive analysis provides a detailed investigation into high-spin state formation, control, and emission in intramolecular singlet fission systems.</description>

      <title>Noble Gas Fractionation Predictions for High Speed Sampling in the Upper Atmosphere of Venus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Venus, our neighboring planet, is an open-air laboratory that can be used to study why Earth and Venus evolved in such different ways. Noble gases in planetary atmospheres are tracers of their geophysical evolution, and measuring the elemental and isotopic composition of noble gases in the Venus atmosphere informs us about the origin and evolution of the entire planet. In this work we describe a new SmallSat mission concept, Venus ATMOSpheric - Sample Return (VATMOS-SR), that would return gas samples from the upper atmosphere of Venus to Earth for scientific analysis. To ensure it is possible to relate the composition of the sampled gases (acquired when the spacecraft is traveling &gt;10 km/s) to the free stream atmospheric composition, large-scale numerical simulations are employed to model the flow into and through the sampling system. An emphasis is placed on quantifying noble gas elemental and isotopic fractionation that occurs during the sample acquisition and transfer process, to determine how measured isotopic ratios of noble gases in the sample would compare to the actual isotopic ratios in the Venusian atmosphere. We find that lighter noble gases are depleted after they are sampled compared to the freestream conditions, and heavier ones are enriched, due to the high pressure gradients present in the flowfield. Finally, we observe that, in general, the numerical parameters do not have a major impact on the observed fractionation. However, the freestream velocity and density have a major impact on fractionation and need to be precisely known to properly reconstruct the fractionation in the sampling system. We demonstrate that the sample fractionation can be predicted with numerical simulations, and believe that VATMOS-SR, which could be the first mission to bring back samples from another planet, could answer key scientific questions related to understanding the evolution of Venus.</description>
