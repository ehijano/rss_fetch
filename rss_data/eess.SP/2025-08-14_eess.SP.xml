      <title>RadioMamba: Breaking the Accuracy-Efficiency Trade-off in Radio Map Construction via a Hybrid Mamba-UNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio map (RM) has recently attracted much attention since it can provide real-time and accurate spatial channel information for 6G services and applications. However, current deep learning-based methods for RM construction exhibit well known accuracy-efficiency trade-off. In this paper, we introduce RadioMamba, a hybrid Mamba-UNet architecture for RM construction to address the trade-off. Generally, accurate RM construction requires modeling long-range spatial dependencies, reflecting the global nature of wave propagation physics. RadioMamba utilizes a Mamba-Convolutional block where the Mamba branch captures these global dependencies with linear complexity, while a parallel convolutional branch extracts local features. This hybrid design generates feature representations that capture both global context and local detail. Experiments show that RadioMamba achieves higher accuracy than existing methods, including diffusion models, while operating nearly 20 times faster and using only 2.9\% of the model parameters. By improving both accuracy and efficiency, RadioMamba presents a viable approach for real-time intelligent optimization in next generation wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Bayesian-Driven Graph Reasoning for Active Radio Map Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of the low-altitude economy, radio maps have become essential for ensuring reliable wireless connectivity to aerial platforms. Autonomous aerial agents are commonly deployed for data collection using waypoint-based navigation; however, their limited battery capacity significantly constrains coverage and efficiency. To address this, we propose an uncertainty-aware radio map (URAM) reconstruction framework that explicitly leverages graph-based reasoning tailored for waypoint navigation. Our approach integrates two key deep learning components: (1) a Bayesian neural network that estimates spatial uncertainty in real time, and (2) an attention-based reinforcement learning policy that performs global reasoning over a probabilistic roadmap, using uncertainty estimates to plan informative and energy-efficient trajectories. This graph-based reasoning enables intelligent, non-myopic trajectory planning, guiding agents toward the most informative regions while satisfying safety constraints. Experimental results show that URAM improves reconstruction accuracy by up to 34% over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Generative AI-Enabled Robust 6G Uplink: Principles, Challenges, and Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks (6G) face a critical uplink bottleneck due to stringent device-side resource constraints and challenging channel conditions. This article introduces GenCom, a novel system-level paradigm for robust 6G uplink that leverages Generative AI and exploits the inherent resource imbalance between transmitters and receivers. In GenCom, resource-rich receivers deploy powerful offline-trained GenAI models to reconstruct high semantic-fidelity content from degraded signals, while resource-constrained transmitters are simplified in both source and channel coding design. We present the core mechanisms and key design principles behind GenCom, which shifts from conventional approaches toward simple semantic-preserving compression, weak error-distribution codes, and semantic-aware retransmissions. Through a case study, GenCom is shown to deliver robust performance across a wide range of low and uncertain SNR/SINR conditions where conventional systems fail. Finally, we outline critical challenges and research directions toward making GenCom a practical enabler of future human-centric, intelligent, and sustainable wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Satellites are closer than you think: A near field MIMO approach for Ground stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations has revolutionized broadband access, earth observation, and direct-to-device connectivity. However, the expansion of ground station infrastructure has not kept pace, creating a critical bottleneck in satellite-to-ground backhaul capacity. Traditional parabolic dish antennas, though effective for geostationary (GEO) satellites, are ill-suited for dense, fastmoving LEO networks due to mechanical steering delays and their inability to track multiple satellites simultaneously. Phased array antennas offer electronically steerable beams and multisatellite support, but their integration into ground stations is limited by the high cost, hardware issues, and complexity of achieving sufficient antenna gain. We introduce ArrayLink, a distributed phased array architecture that coherently combines multiple small commercially available panels to achieve high-gain beamforming and unlock line-of-sight MIMO spatial multiplexing with minimal additional capital expenditure. By spacing 16 (32x32) panels across a kilometer-scale aperture, ArrayLink enters the radiative near-field, focusing energy in both angle and range while supporting up to four simultaneous spatial streams on a single feeder link. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, detailed 2D beam pattern simulations and real-world hardware experiments, we show that ArrayLink (i) achieves dish-class gain with in range 1-2 dB of 1.47 m reflector, (ii) maintains four parallel streams at ranges of hundreds of kilometers (falling to two beyond 2000 km), and (iii) exhibits tight agreement across theory, simulation, and experiment with minimal variance. These findings open a practical and scalable path to boosting LEO backhaul capacity.</description>

      <title>Sub-THz Power Amplifiers: Measurements, Behavioral Modeling and Predistortion Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With global IMT traffic expected to grow 10-100 times from 2020 to 20301, the Terahertz (THz) spectrum offers a promising solution to satisfy such forecasts. However, occupying the THz spectrum comes with its own challenges, an important one being impairments caused by broadband RF components in THz transceivers. Nonlinearities in power amplifiers (PAs) complicate meeting link budget requirements, with amplitude and phase distortions degrading the system's performance, especially when adopting waveforms with high peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs), such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). In this paper, we present characterization results of a 300 GHz PA using small-signal and large-signal continuous-wave measurements. Models capturing Amplitude-to- Amplitude Modulation (AM-AM) and Amplitude-to-Phase Modulation (AMPM) behavior across 270-330 GHz are developed and verified with wideband measurements, confirming the compression behavior, while nonetheless showing inaccuracies for low input powers due to unaccounted frequency dependencies. Based on the derived models, a predistortion algorithm is designed and analyzed, revealing significant error performance degradation when switching between single- and multi-carrier waveforms. We finally show that an appropriate selection of pre-distorter parameters can significantly improve the performance.</description>

      <title>Low-latency D-MIMO Localization using Distributed Scalable Message-Passing Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed MIMO and integrated sensing and communication are expected to be key technologies in future wireless systems, enabling reliable, low-latency communication and accurate localization. Dedicated localization solutions must support distributed architecture, provide scalability across different system configurations and meet strict latency requirements. We present a scalable message-passing localization method and architecture co-designed for a panel-based distributed MIMO system and network topology, in which interconnected units operate without centralized processing. This method jointly detects line-of-sight paths to distributed units from multipath measurements in dynamic scenarios, localizes the agent, and achieves very low latency. Additionally, we introduce a cycle-accurate system latency model based on implemented FPGA operations, and show important insights into processing latency and hardware utilization and system-level trade-offs. We compare our method to a multipath-based localization method and show that it can achieve similar localization performance, with wide enough distribution of array elements, while offering lower latency and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Profiling Multi-Level Operator Costs for Bottleneck Diagnosis in High-Speed Data Planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a saturation throughput delta-based methodology to precisely measure operator costs in high-speed data planes without intrusive instrumentation. The approach captures non-linear scaling, revealing that compute-intensive operators like CRC exhibit super-linear behavior, while most others are sub-linear. We introduce the Operator Performance Quadrant (OPQ) framework to classify operators by base and scaling costs, exposing a cross-architecture Quadrant Shift between Arm and x86. This method provides accurate, architecture-aware bottleneck diagnosis and a realistic basis for performance modeling and optimization.</description>

      <title>3GPP NR V2X Mode 2d: Analysis of Distributed Scheduling for Groupcast using ns-3 5G LENA Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is a key technology for enabling intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that can improve road safety, traffic efficiency, and environmental sustainability. Among the various V2X applications, platooning is one of the most promising ones, as it allows a group of vehicles to travel closely together at high speeds, reducing fuel consumption and emissions. However, it poses significant challenges for wireless communication, such as high reliability and low latency. In this paper, we evaluate the benefits of group scheduling, also referred to as Mode 2d, which is based on a distributed and scheduled resource allocation scheme that allows the group of cars to select resources from a configured pool without network assistance. We evaluated the scheme through simulations, and the results show that this approach can meet the reliability, low latency, and data rate requirements for platooning.</description>

      <title>CKFNet: Neural Network Aided Cubature Kalman filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cubature Kalman filter (CKF), while theoretically rigorous for nonlinear estimation, often suffers performance degradation due to model-environment mismatches in practice. To address this limitation, we propose CKFNet-a hybrid architecture that synergistically integrates recurrent neural networks (RNN) with the CKF framework while preserving its cubature principles. Unlike conventional model-driven approaches, CKFNet embeds RNN modules in the prediction phase to dynamically adapt to unmodeled uncertainties, effectively reducing cumulative error propagation through temporal noise correlation learning. Crucially, the architecture maintains CKF's analytical interpretability via constrained optimization of cubature point distributions. Numerical simulation experiments have confirmed that our proposed CKFNet exhibits superior accuracy and robustness compared to conventional model-based methods and existing KalmanNet algorithms.</description>

      <title>Online Data Generation for MIMO-OFDM Channel Denoising: Transfer Learning vs. Meta Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel denoising is a practical and effective technique for mitigating channel estimation errors in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. However, adapting denoising techniques to varying channel conditions typically requires prior knowledge or incurs significant training overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a standard-compatible strategy for generating online training data that enables online adaptive channel denoising. The key idea is to leverage high-quality channel estimates obtained via data-aided channel estimation as practical substitutes for unavailable ground-truth channels. Our data-aided method exploits adjacent detected data symbols within a specific time-frequency neighborhood as virtual reference signals, and we analytically derive the optimal size of this neighborhood to minimize the mean squared error of the resulting estimates. By leveraging the proposed strategy, we devise two channel denoising approaches, one based on transfer learning, which fine-tunes a pre-trained denoising neural network, and the other based on meta learning, which rapidly adapts to new channel environments with minimal updates. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively adapt to dynamic channel conditions and significantly reduce channel estimation errors compared to conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>Location Privacy-Enabled Beamforming in ISAC Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology enables simultaneous environmental perception and data transmission in wireless networks; however, it also exposes user location to receivers. In this paper, we introduce a novel beamforming framework guided by the proposed privacy metric direction of arrival obfuscation ratio (DAOR) to protect transmitter location privacy in ISAC scenarios. Unlike previous approaches, we do not suppress the line-of-sight (LOS) component while reshaping the angular power distribution so that a false direction appears dominant at the receiver. We derive closed-form bounds on the feasible DAOR via generalized eigenvalue analysis and formulate an achievable rate-maximization problem under the DAOR constraint. The resulting problem is non-convex, which is efficiently solved using semidefinite relaxation, eigenmode selection, and optimal power allocation. A suboptimal design strategy is also proposed with reduced complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DAOR-based beamformer achieves a trade-off between location privacy and communication rate without nullifying the LOS path. Results also show that a suboptimal design achieves a near-optimal communication rate with nearly an 85% reduction in computation time at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB.</description>

      <title>Beam Cross Sections Create Mixtures: Improving Feature Localization in Secondary Electron Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secondary electron (SE) imaging techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy and helium ion microscopy (HIM), use electrons emitted by a sample in response to a focused beam of charged particles incident at a grid of raster scan positions. Spot size -- the diameter of the incident beam's spatial profile -- is one of the limiting factors for resolution, along with various sources of noise in the SE signal. The effect of the beam spatial profile is commonly understood as convolutional. We show that under a simple and plausible physical abstraction for the beam, though convolution describes the mean of the SE counts, the full distribution of SE counts is a mixture. We demonstrate that this more detailed modeling can enable resolution improvements over conventional estimators through a stylized application in semiconductor inspection of localizing the edge in a two-valued sample. We derive Fisher information about edge location in conventional and time-resolved measurements (TRM) and also derive the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) from the latter. Empirically, the MLE computed from TRM is approximately efficient except at very low beam diameter, so Fisher information comparisons are predictive of performance and can be used to optimize the beam diameter relative to the raster scan spacing. Monte Carlo simulations show that the MLE gives a 5-fold reduction in root mean-squared error (RMSE) of edge localization as compared to conventional interpolation-based estimation. Applied to three real HIM datasets, the average RMSE reduction factor is 5.4.</description>

      <title>Per-antenna power constraints: constructing Pareto-optimal precoders with cubic complexity under non-negligible noise conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precoding matrix construction is a key element of the wireless signal processing using the multiple-input and multiple-output model. It is established that the problem of global throughput optimization under per-antenna power constraints belongs, in general, to the class of monotonic optimization problems, and is unsolvable in real-time. The most widely used real-time baseline is the suboptimal solution of Zero-Forcing, which achieves a cubic complexity by discarding the background noise coefficients. This baseline, however, is not readily adapted to per-antenna power constraints, and performs poorly if background noise coefficients are not negligible. In this paper, we are going to present a computational algorithm which constructs a precoder that is SINR multiobjective Pareto-optimal under per-antenna power constraints - with a complexity that differs from that of Zero-Forcing only by a constant factor. The algorithm has a set of input parameters, changing which skews the importance of particular user throughputs: these parameters make up an efficient parameterization of the entire Pareto boundary.</description>

      <title>ORCAS Codes: A Flexible Generalization of Polar Codes with Low-Complexity Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the need for channel codes with low-complexity soft-decision decoding algorithms, we consider the recursive Plotkin concatenation of optimal low-rate and high-rate codes based on simplex codes and their duals. These component codes come with low-complexity maximum likelihood (ML) decoding which, in turn, enables efficient successive cancellation (SC)-based decoding. As a result, the proposed optimally recursively concatenated simplex (ORCAS) codes achieve a performance that is at least as good as that of polar codes. For practical parameters, the proposed construction significantly outperforms polar codes in terms of block error rate by up to 0.5 dB while maintaining similar decoding complexity. Furthermore, the codes offer greater flexibility in codeword length than conventional polar codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes are important models in the field of probabilistic numerics. We present a procedure for optimizing Mat\'ern kernel temporal Gaussian processes with respect to the kernel covariance function's hyperparameters. It is based on casting the optimization problem as a recursive Bayesian estimation procedure for the parameters of an autoregressive model. We demonstrate that the proposed procedure outperforms maximizing the marginal likelihood as well as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, both in terms of runtime and ultimate root mean square error in Gaussian process regression.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Efficiency and Processing Latency Trade-offs in Panel-Based LIS</title>

Abstract: The next generation wireless systems will face stringent new requirements, including ultra-low latency, high data rates and enhanced reliability. Large Intelligent Surfaces, is one proposed solution that has the potential to solve these high demands. The real-life deployment of such systems involves different design considerations with non-trivial trade-offs. This paper investigates the trade-off between spectral efficiency and processing latency, considering different antenna distribution schemes and detection algorithms. A latency model for the physical layer processing has been developed, using real FPGA and application-specific instruction processor (ASIP) hardware implementation results. Simulation results using an indoor environment show that distributing antennas throughout the scenario improves overall reliability, while the impact from this on latency is limited both when using zero-forcing (ZF) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) detection. Changing the detection algorithm to maximum-ratio combining (MRC) from ZF or MMSE, however, reduces the latency significantly, even if a larger number of antennas are needed to achieve a similar spectrum efficiency.</description>

      <title>Scaling Achievable Rates in SIM-aided MIMO Systems with Metasurface Layers: A Hybrid Optimization Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the achievable rate (AR) of a stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM)-aided holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) system by jointly optimizing the SIM phase shifts and power allocation. Contrary to earlier studies suggesting that the AR decreases when the number of metasurface layers increases past a certain point for \emph{a fixed SIM thickness}, our findings demonstrate consistent increase. To achieve this, we introduce two problem formulations: one based on directly maximizing the AR (RMax) and the other focused on minimizing inter-stream interference (IMin). To solve the RMax problem, we apply Riemannian manifold optimization (RMO) and weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) methods to optimize the SIM phase shifts and power allocation alternately. For the IMin problem, we derive an efficient algorithm that iteratively updates each meta-atom's phase shift using a closed-form expression while keeping others fixed. Our key contribution is integrating these two approaches, where the IMin solution initializes the SIM phase shifts in the first algorithm. This hybrid strategy enhances AR performance across varying numbers of metasurface layers. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform existing benchmarks. Most importantly, we show that increasing the number of metasurface layers while keeping the SIM thickness fixed leads to significant AR improvements.</description>

      <title>MultiFormer: A Multi-Person Pose Estimation System Based on CSI and Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human pose estimation based on Channel State Information (CSI) has emerged as a promising approach for non-intrusive and precise human activity monitoring, yet faces challenges including accurate multi-person pose recognition and effective CSI feature learning. This paper presents MultiFormer, a wireless sensing system that accurately estimates human pose through CSI. The proposed system adopts a Transformer based time-frequency dual-token feature extractor with multi-head self-attention. This feature extractor is able to model inter-subcarrier correlations and temporal dependencies of the CSI. The extracted CSI features and the pose probability heatmaps are then fused by Multi-Stage Feature Fusion Network (MSFN) to enforce the anatomical constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on on the public MM-Fi dataset and our self-collected dataset show that the MultiFormer achieves higher accuracy over state-of-the-art approaches, especially for high-mobility keypoints (wrists, elbows) that are particularly difficult for previous methods to accurately estimate.</description>
