      <title>ParkView: Visualizing Monotone Interleavings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Merge trees are a powerful tool from topological data analysis that is frequently used to analyze scalar fields. The similarity between two merge trees can be captured by an interleaving: a pair of maps between the trees that jointly preserve ancestor relations in the trees. Interleavings can have a complex structure; visualizing them requires a sense of (drawing) order which is not inherent in this purely topological concept. However, in practice it is often desirable to introduce additional geometric constraints, which leads to variants such as labeled or monotone interleavings. Monotone interleavings respect a given order on the leaves of the merge trees and hence have the potential to be visualized in a clear and comprehensive manner.
  In this paper, we introduce ParkView: a schematic, scalable encoding for monotone interleavings. ParkView captures both maps of the interleaving using an optimal decomposition of both trees into paths and corresponding branches. We prove several structural properties of monotone interleavings, which support a sparse visual encoding using active paths and hedges that can be linked using a maximum of 6 colors for merge trees of arbitrary size. We show how to compute an optimal path-branch decomposition in linear time and illustrate ParkView on a number of real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Programming Framework for Generating Approximately Diverse and Optimal Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general framework, called approximately-diverse dynamic programming (ADDP) that can be used to generate a collection of $k\ge2$ maximally diverse solutions to various geometric and combinatorial optimization problems. Given an approximation factor $0\le c\le1$, this framework also allows for maximizing diversity in the larger space of $c$-approximate solutions. We focus on two geometric problems to showcase this technique:
  1. Given a polygon $P$, an integer $k\ge2$ and a value $c\le1$, generate $k$ maximally diverse $c$-nice triangulations of $P$. Here, a $c$-nice triangulation is one that is $c$-approximately optimal with respect to a given quality measure $\sigma$.
  2. Given a planar graph $G$, an integer $k\ge2$ and a value $c\le1$, generate $k$ maximally diverse $c$-optimal Independent Sets (or, Vertex Covers). Here, an independent set $S$ is said to be $c$-optimal if $|S|\ge c|S'|$ for any independent set $S'$ of $G$.
  Given a set of $k$ solutions to the above problems, the diversity measure we focus on is the average distance between the solutions, where $d(X,Y)=|X\Delta Y|$.
  For arbitrary polygons and a wide range of quality measures, we give $\text{poly}(n,k)$ time $(1-\Theta(1/k))$-approximation algorithms for the diverse triangulation problem. For the diverse independent set and vertex cover problems on planar graphs, we give an algorithm that runs in time $2^{O(k\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-2})}n^{O(1/\epsilon)}$ and returns $(1-\epsilon)$-approximately diverse $(1-\delta)c$-optimal independent sets or vertex covers.
  Our triangulation results are the first algorithmic results on computing collections of diverse geometric objects, and our planar graph results are the first PTAS for the diverse versions of any NP-complete problem. Additionally, we also provide applications of this technique to diverse variants of other geometric problems.</description>

      <title>Untangling Segments in the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of n segments in the plane may form a Euclidean TSP tour, a tree, or a matching, among others. Optimal TSP tours as well as minimum spanning trees and perfect matchings have no crossing segments, but several heuristics and approximation algorithms may produce solutions with crossings. If two segments cross, then we can reduce the total length with the following flip operation. We remove a pair of crossing segments, and insert a pair of non-crossing segments, while keeping the same vertex degrees. In this paper, we consider the number of flips performed under different assumptions, using a new unifying framework that applies to tours, trees, matchings, and other types of (multi)graphs. Within this framework, we prove several new bounds that are sensitive to whether some endpoints are in convex position or not.</description>

      <title>Certifying Robustness via Topological Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a neural network architecture that can learn discriminative geometric representations of data from persistence diagrams, common descriptors of Topological Data Analysis. The learned representations enjoy Lipschitz stability with a controllable Lipschitz constant. In adversarial learning, this stability can be used to certify $\epsilon$-robustness for samples in a dataset, which we demonstrate on the ORBIT5K dataset representing the orbits of a discrete dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Covering half-grids with lines and planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study hyperplane covering problems for finite grid-like structures in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We call a set $\mathcal{C}$ of points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ a conical grid if the line $y = a_i$ intersects $\mathcal{C}$ in exactly $i$ points, for some $a_1 &gt; \cdots &gt; a_n \in \mathbb{R}$. We prove that the number of lines required to cover every point of such a grid at least $k$ times is at least $nk\left(1-\frac{1}{e}-O(\frac{1}{n}) \right)$. If the grid $\mathcal{C}$ is obtained by cutting an $m \times n$ grid of points into a half along one of the diagonals, then we prove the lower bound of $mk\left(1-e^{-\frac{n}{m}}-O(\frac{n}{m^2})\right)$.
  Motivated by the Alon-F\"uredi theorem on hyperplane coverings of grids that miss a point and its multiplicity variations, we study the problem of finding the minimum number of hyperplanes required to cover every point of an $n \times \cdots \times n$ half-grid in $\mathbb{R}^d$ at least $k$ times while missing a point $P$. For almost all such half-grids, with $P$ being the corner point, we prove asymptotically sharp upper and lower bounds for the covering number in dimensions $2$ and $3$. For $k = 1$, $d = 2$, and an arbitrary $P$, we determine this number exactly by using the polynomial method bound for grids.</description>

      <title>$O(1)$-Round MPC Algorithms for Multi-dimensional Grid Graph Connectivity, EMST and DBSCAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate three fundamental problems in the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model: (i) grid graph connectivity, (ii) approximate Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (EMST), and (iii) approximate DBSCAN.
  Our first result is a $O(1)$-round Las Vegas (i.e., succeeding with high probability) MPC algorithm for computing the connected components on a $d$-dimensional $c$-penetration grid graph ($(d,c)$-grid graph), where both $d$ and $c$ are positive integer constants. In such a grid graph, each vertex is a point with integer coordinates in $\mathbb{N}^d$, and an edge can only exist between two distinct vertices with $\ell_\infty$-norm at most $c$. To our knowledge, the current best existing result for computing the connected components (CC's) on $(d,c)$-grid graphs in the MPC model is to run the state-of-the-art MPC CC algorithms that are designed for general graphs: they achieve $O(\log \log n + \log D)$[FOCS19] and $O(\log \log n + \log \frac{1}{\lambda})$[PODC19] rounds, respectively, where $D$ is the {\em diameter} and $\lambda$ is the {\em spectral gap} of the graph.
  With our grid graph connectivity technique, our second main result is a $O(1)$-round Las Vegas MPC algorithm for computing approximate Euclidean MST. The existing state-of-the-art result on this problem is the $O(1)$-round MPC algorithm proposed by Andoni et al.[STOC14], which only guarantees an approximation on the overall weight in expectation. In contrast, our algorithm not only guarantees a deterministic overall weight approximation, but also achieves a deterministic edge-wise weight approximation.The latter property is crucial to many applications, such as finding the Bichromatic Closest Pair and DBSCAN clustering.
  Last but not the least, our third main result is a $O(1)$-round Las Vegas MPC algorithm for computing an approximate DBSCAN clustering in $O(1)$-dimensional space.</description>

      <title>Construction, Transformation and Structures of 2x2 Space-Filling Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16962v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 2x2 space-filling curve is a type of generalized space-filling curve characterized by a basic unit is in a "U-shape" that traverses a 2x2 grid. In this work, we propose a universal framework for constructing general 2x2 curves where self-similarity is not strictly required. The construction is based on a novel set of grammars that define the expansion of curves from level 0 (a single point) to level 1 (units in U-shapes), which ultimately determines all $36 \times 2^k$ possible forms of curves on any level $k$ initialized from single points. We further developed an encoding system in which each unique form of the curve is associated with a specific combination of an initial seed and a sequence of codes that sufficiently describes both the global and local structures of the curve. We demonstrated that this encoding system is a powerful tool for studying 2x2 curves and we established comprehensive theoretical foundations from the following three key perspectives: 1) We provided a deterministic encoding for any unit on any level and position on the curve, enabling the study of curve generation across arbitrary parts on the curve and ranges of iterations; 2) We gave deterministic encodings for various curve transformations, including rotations, reflections and reversals; 3) We provided deterministic forms of families of curves exhibiting specific structures, including homogeneous curves, curves with identical shapes, and with completely distinct shapes. We also explored families of recursive curves, subunit identically shaped curves, symmetric curves and closed curves. Finally, we proposed a method to calculate the location of any point on the curve arithmetically, within a time complexity linear to the level of the curve.</description>

      <title>Toolpath Generation for High Density Spatial Fiber Printing Guided by Principal Stresses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While multi-axis 3D printing can align continuous fibers along principal stresses in continuous fiber-reinforced thermoplastic (CFRTP) composites to enhance mechanical strength, existing methods have difficulty generating toolpaths with high fiber coverage. This is mainly due to the orientation consistency constraints imposed by vector-field-based methods and the turbulent stress fields around stress concentration regions. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a 2-RoSy representation for computing the direction field, which is then converted into a periodic scalar field to generate partial iso-curves for fiber toolpaths with nearly equal hatching distance. To improve fiber coverage in stress-concentrated regions, such as around holes, we extend the quaternion-based method for curved slicing by incorporating winding compatibility considerations. Our proposed method can achieve toolpaths coverage between 87.5% and 90.6% by continuous fibers with 1.1mm width. Models fabricated using our toolpaths show up to 84.6% improvement in failure load and 54.4% increase in stiffness when compared to the results obtained from multi-axis 3D printing with sparser fibers.</description>
