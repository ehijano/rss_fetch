      <title>Precision Spectroscopy of Antiprotonic Atoms for Investigation of Low-energy Antinucleon-nucleus Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a high-precision x-ray spectroscopy experiment of antiprotonic atoms to advance the understanding of low-energy antinucleon-nucleus interactions. The current leading model of antiproton-nucleus interactions is based on an optical potential with parameters derived from a global fit to antiprotonic atom x-ray data across the periodic table. However, the isovector parameter of this potential remains poorly constrained due to uncertainties in nucleon distributions of the nuclei. To address this, we propose to use calcium isotopes with well-studied nucleon distributions to minimize these uncertainties. A superconducting microcalorimeter detector will provide a resolution of 50-70 eV in the energy range of interest, allowing high precision determination of the isotope-dependent strong-interaction shifts and widths. The outcomes of the proposed experiment can be used to refine the model of antinucleon-nucleus interactions and provide critical data for future experiments searching for neutron-antineutron oscillations.</description>

      <title>Stepping into the Sea of Instability: The New Sub-us Superheavy Nucleus 252Rf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of the new isotope $^{252}$Rf. With its extremely short half-life of $60^{+90}_{-30}$~ns, it expands the range of half-lives of the known superheavy nuclei by about two orders of magnitude. This nucleus was synthesized in its high-$K$ isomeric state, for which we measured a half-life of $13^{+4}_{-3}$~$\mu$s. Our results confirm a smooth onset of decreasing ground-state spontaneous fission half-lives in the neutron-deficient Rf isotopes towards the isotopic border of $10^{-14}$~s, which is the time needed to form an atomic shell. Our findings set a new benchmark for further exploration of phenomena associated with high-$K$ states and inverted fission-stability in the heaviest nuclei.</description>

      <title>In-situ high voltage generation with Cockcroft-Walton multiplier for xenon gas time projection chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08554v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have newly developed a Cockcroft-Walton (CW) multiplier that can be used in a gas time projection chamber (TPC). TPC requires a high voltage to form an electric field that drifts ionization electrons. Supplying the high voltage from outside the pressure vessel requires a dedicated high-voltage feedthrough. An alternative approach is to generate the high voltage inside the pressure vessel with a relatively low voltage introduced from outside. CW multiplier can convert a low AC voltage input to a high DC voltage output, making it suitable for this purpose.
  We have integrated the CW multiplier into a high-pressure xenon gas TPC, called AXEL (A Xenon ElectroLuminescence detector), which have been developed to search for neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe. It detects ionization electrons by detecting electroluminescence with silicon photomultipliers, making it strong against electrical noises. An operation with the CW multiplier was successfully demonstrated; the TPC was operated for 77 days at 6.8 bar, and an energy resolution as high as (0.67 $\pm$ 0.08) % (FWHM) at 2615 keV was obtained.</description>

      <title>First-Ever Deployment of a SiPM-on-Tile Calorimeter in a Collider: A Parasitic Test with 200 GeV $pp$ Collisions at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the testing of a prototype SiPM-on-tile iron-scintillator calorimeter at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) during its 200 GeV $pp$ run in 2024. The prototype, measuring $20 \times 20 \, \text{cm}^{2}$ and 24 radiation lengths in depth, was positioned in the STAR experimental hall, approximately 8 m from the interaction point and 65 cm from the beam line, covering a pseudorapidity range of about $3.1&lt;\eta&lt;3.4$. By using the dark current of a reference SiPM as a radiation monitor, we estimate that the prototype was exposed to a fluence of about $10^{10}$ 1-MeV $n_{\mathrm{eq}}$/cm$^2$. Channel-by-channel calibration was performed in a data-driven way with the signature from minimum-ionizing particles during beam-on conditions. A Geant4 detector simulation, with inputs from the Pythia8 event generator, describes measurements of energy spectra and hit multiplicities reasonably well. These results mark the first deployment, commissioning, calibration, and long-term operation of a SiPM-on-tile calorimeter in a collider environment. This experimental campaign will guide detector designs and operational strategies for the ePIC detector at the future EIC, as well as other applications.</description>

      <title>Background reduction in $^{136}$Xe double beta decay experiments through direct barium ion detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tagging barium ions in double beta decay experiments involving $^{136}$Xe offers a promising pathway to achieving an almost background-free environment, which is essential for addressing key unresolved questions in neutrino physics, such as the nature of neutrinos and their mass hierarchy. In this manuscript, we present a novel detection scheme that relies exclusively on the intrinsic energy levels of the barium ion. This method eliminates the need for additional additives in the xenon vessel, thereby simplifying the experimental setup and enhancing the potential sensitivity of the experiment.</description>

      <title>First experimental results and optimization study of the portable neutron-gamma imager GN-Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GN-Vision is a compact, dual-modality imaging device designed to simultaneously localize the spatial origin of $\gamma$-ray and slow neutron sources, with potential applications in nuclear safety, security, and hadron therapy. The system utilizes two position-sensitive detection planes, combining Compton imaging techniques for $\gamma$-ray visualization with passive collimation for imaging slow and thermal neutrons (energies below 100 eV). This paper presents the first experimental outcomes from the initial GN-Vision prototype, focused on the development of its neutron imaging capabilities. Following this experimental assessment, we explore the device$'$s performance potential and discuss several Monte Carlo simulation-based optimizations aimed at refining the neutron collimation system. These optimizations seek to improve real-time imaging efficiency and cost-effectiveness, enhancing GN-Vision$'$s applicability for future practical deployments.</description>

      <title>Investigating $\Lambda$ baryon production in p-Pb collisions in jets and the underlying event using angular correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First measurements of hadron(h)$-\Lambda$ azimuthal angular correlations in p$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV using the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider are presented. These correlations are used to separate the production of associated $\Lambda$ baryons into three different kinematic regions, namely those produced in the direction of the trigger particle (near-side), those produced in the opposite direction (away-side), and those whose production is uncorrelated with the jet axis (underlying event). The per-trigger associated $\Lambda$ yields in these regions are extracted, along with the near- and away-side azimuthal peak widths, and the results are studied as a function of associated particle $p_{\rm T}$ and event multiplicity. Comparisons with the DPMJET event generator and previous measurements of the $\phi(1020)$ meson are also made. The final results indicate that strangeness production in the highest multiplicity p$-$Pb collisions is enhanced relative to low multiplicity collisions in both the jet-like regions and the underlying event. The production of $\Lambda$ relative to charged hadrons is also enhanced in the underlying event when compared to the jet-like regions. Additionally, the results hint that strange quark production in the away-side of the jet is modified by soft interactions with the underlying event.</description>
