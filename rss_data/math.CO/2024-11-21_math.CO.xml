      <title>Graphs with Lin-Lu-Yau curvature at least one and regular bone-idle graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Ollivier-Ricci curvature and its modification introduced by Lin, Lu, and Yau on graphs. We provide a complete characterization of all graphs with Lin-Lu-Yau curvature at least one. We then explore the relationship between the Lin-Lu-Yau curvature and the Ollivier-Ricci curvature with vanishing idleness on regular graphs. An exact formula for the difference between these two curvature notions is established, along with an equality condition. This condition allows us to characterize edges that are bone-idle in regular graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the non-existence of 3-regular bone-idle graphs and present a complete characterization of all 4-regular bone-idle graphs. We also show that there exist no 5-regular bone-idle graphs that are symmetric or a Cartesian product of a 3-regular and a 2-regular graph.</description>

      <title>Regular subdivisions, bounds on initial ideals, and categorical limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend two known constructions that relate regular subdivisions to initial degenerations of projective toric varieties and Grassmannians. We associate a point configuration $A$ with any homogeneous ideal $I$. We obtain upper and lower bounds on each initial ideal of $I$ in terms of regular subdivisions of $A$. Both bounds can be interpreted categorically via limits over face posets of subdivisions. We also investigate when these bounds are exact. This is an extended abstract of a forthcoming paper.</description>

      <title>On corona of Konig-Egervary graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\alpha(G)$ denote the cardinality of a maximum independent set and $\mu(G)$ be the size of a maximum matching of a graph $G=\left( V,E\right) $. If $\alpha(G)+\mu(G)=\left\vert V\right\vert $, then $G$ is a K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graph, and $G$ is a $1$-K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graph whenever $\alpha(G)+\mu(G)=\left\vert V\right\vert -1$. The corona $H\circ\mathcal{X}$ of a graph $H$ and a family of graphs $\mathcal{X}=\left\{ X_{i}:1\leq i\leq\left\vert V(H)\right\vert \right\} $ is obtained by joining each vertex $v_{i}$ of $H$ to all the vertices of the corresponding graph $X_{i},i=1,2,...,\left\vert V(H)\right\vert $.
  In this paper we completely characterize graphs whose coronas are $k$-K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graphs, where $k\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} $.</description>

      <title>On large Sidon sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Sidon set $M$ is a subset of $\mathbb{F}_2^t$ such that the sum of four distinct elements of $M$ is never 0. The goal is to find Sidon sets of large size. In this note we show that the graphs of almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions with high linearity can be used to construct large Sidon sets. Thanks to recently constructed APN functions $\mathbb{F}_2^8\to \mathbb{F}_2^8$ with high linearity, we can construct Sidon sets of size 192 in $\mathbb{F}_2^{15}$, where the largest sets so far had size 152. Using the inverse and the Dobbertin function also gives larger Sidon sets as previously known. Moreover, we improve the upper bound for the linearity of arbitrary APN functions.</description>

      <title>Graphs with Bipartite Complement that Admit Two Distinct Eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parameter $q(G)$ of an $n$-vertex graph $G$ is the minimum number of distinct eigenvalues over the family of symmetric matrices described by $G$. We show that all $G$ with $e(\overline{G}) = |E(\overline{G})| \leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor -1$ have $q(G)=2$. We conjecture that any $G$ with $e(\overline{G}) \leq n-3$ satisfies $q(G) = 2$. We show that this conjecture is true if $\overline{G}$ is bipartite and in other sporadic cases. Furthermore, we characterize $G$ with $\overline{G}$ bipartite and $e(\overline{G}) = n-2$ for which $q(G) &gt; 2$.</description>

      <title>Pure Simplicial and Clique Complexes with a Fixed Number of Facets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study structural and enumerative aspects of pure simplicial complexes and clique complexes. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for any simplicial complex to be a clique complex that depends only on the list of facets. We also prove a theorem that a class of ``triangle-intersection free" pure clique complexes are uniquely determined up to isomorphism merely from the facet-adjacency matrix. Lastly, we count the number of pure simplicial complexes with a fixed number of facets and find an upper bound to the number of pure clique complexes.</description>

      <title>Gracefulness of two nested cycles: a first approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that if a plane graph is graceful (resp. near-graceful), then its semidual is conservative (resp. near-conservative). In this work we prove that the semidual of a plane graph of size $M$ consisting of two nested cycles is conservative if $M \equiv 0,3 \pmod 4$, and near-conservative otherwise. We also show that for a given integer $m_1 \geq 3$, there exists $m^* &gt; m_1$ such that for $m_2 \geq m^*$, if $m_1+m_2 \equiv 0,3 \pmod 4$ (resp. $m_1+m_2 \equiv 1,2 \pmod 4$), then there exists a graceful (resp. near-graceful) plane graph consisting of two nested cycles with sizes $m_1$ and $m_2$, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a group-action version of the Szemer\'edi-Trotter theorem over any field, extending Bourgain's result for the group $\mathrm{SL}_2(k)$. As an Elekes-Szab\'o-type application, we obtain quantitative bounds on the number of collinear triples on reducible cubic surfaces in $\mathbb{P}^3(k)$, where $k = \mathbb{F}_{q}$ and $k = \mathbb{C}$, thereby improving a recent result by Bays, Dobrowolski, and the second author.</description>

      <title>On the strong geodeticity in the corona type product of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper focuses on studying strong geodetic sets and numbers in the context of corona-type products of graphs. Our primary focus is on three variations of the corona products: the generalized corona, generalized edge corona, and generalized neighborhood corona products. A strong geodetic set is a minimal subset of vertices that covers all vertices in the graph through unique geodesics connecting pairs from this subset. We obtain the strong geodetic set and number of the corona-type product graph using the strong 2-geodetic set and strong 2-geodetic number of the initial arbitrary graphs. We analyze how the structural properties of these corona products affect the strong geodetic number, providing new insights into geodetic coverage and the relationships between graph compositions. This work contributes to expanding research on the geodetic parameters of product graphs.</description>

      <title>Geometric view of interval poset permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent study by Tenner, the concept of the interval poset of a permutation is introduced to effectively represent all intervals and their inclusions within a permutation. This research presents a new geometric viewpoint on these interval posets. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between the set of interval posets for permutations of size $n$ and a specific subset of dissections of a convex polygon with $n+1$ sides. Through this correspondence, we investigate various intriguing subsets of interval posets and uncover their connections to particular polygon dissections.</description>

      <title>Strong orientation of a connected graph for a crossing family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a connected graph $G=(V,E)$ and a crossing family $\mathcal{C}$ over ground set $V$ such that $|\delta_G(U)|\geq 2$ for every $U\in \mathcal{C}$, we prove there exists a strong orientation of $G$ for $\mathcal{C}$, i.e., an orientation of $G$ such that each set in $\mathcal{C}$ has at least one outgoing and at least one incoming arc. This implies the main conjecture in Chudnovsky et al. (Disjoint dijoins. Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B, 120:18--35, 2016). In particular, in every minimal counterexample to the Edmonds-Giles conjecture where the minimum weight of a dicut is $2$, the arcs of nonzero weight must be disconnected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we introduce cospectral graphons, paralleling the notion of cospectral graphs. As in the graph case, we give three equivalent definitions: by equality of spectra, by equality of cycle densities, and by a unitary transformation. We also give an example of two cospectral graphons that cannot be approximated by two sequences of cospectral graphs in the cut distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Around the early 2000-s, Bourgain, Katz and Tao introduced an arithmetic approach to study Kakeya-type problems. They showed that the Euclidean Kakeya conjecture follows from a natural problem in additive combinatorics, now referred to as the `Arithmetic Kakeya Conjecture'. We consider a higher dimensional variant of this problem and prove an upper bound using a certain iterative argument. The main new ingredient in our proof is a general way to strengthen the sum-difference inequalities of Katz and Tao which might be of independent interest. As a corollary, we obtain a new lower bound for the Minkowski dimension of $(n, d)$-Besicovitch sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates methods for calculating the chromatic symmetric function (CSF) of a graph in chromatic-bases and the $m_\lambda$-basis. Our key contributions include a novel approach for calculating the CSF in chromatic-bases constructed from forests and an efficient method for determining the CSF in the $m_\lambda$-basis. As applications, we present combinatorial proofs for two known theorems that were originally established using algebraic techniques. Additionally, we demonstrate that an algorithm introduced by Gonzalez, Orellana, and Tomba arises as a special case of our proposed method.</description>

Abstract: We study quantitative aspects of the following fact: For every graph $F$, there exists a graph $G$ with the property that any $2$-coloring of the triangles of $G$ yields an induced copy of $F$, in which all triangles are monochromatic. We define the Ramsey number $R_{\text{ind}}^{\Delta}(F)$ as the smallest size of such a graph $G$. Although this fact has several proofs, all of them provide tower-type bounds. We study the number $R_{\text{ind}}^{\Delta}(F)$ for some particular classes of graphs $F$.</description>

      <title>Distance Sequences to bound the Harary Index and other Wiener-type Indices of a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain bounds on a very general class of distance-based topological indices of graphs, which includes the Wiener index, defined as the sum of the distances between all pairs of vertices of the graph, and most generalisations of the Wiener index, including the Harary index and the hyper-Wiener index.
  Our results imply several new bounds on well-studied topological indices, among those sharp lower bounds on the Harary index and sharp upper bounds on the hyper-Wiener index for (i) graphs of given order and size (which resolves a problem in the monograph [The Harary index of a graph, Xu, Das, Trinajsti\'{c}, Springer (2015)], (ii) for $\kappa$-connected graphs, where $\kappa$ is even, (iii) for maximal outerplanar graphs and for Apollonian networks (a subclass of maximal planar graphs), and (iv) for trees in which all vertices have odd degree.</description>

      <title>Exact threshold and lognormal limit for non-linear Hamilton cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For positive integers $r &gt; \ell \geq 1$, an $\ell$-cycle in an $r$-uniform hypergraph is a cycle where each edge consists of $r$ vertices and each pair of consecutive edges intersect in $\ell$ vertices. We show that for $\ell \geq 2$, a random $r$-uniform hypergraph contains a Hamilton $\ell$-cycle with high probability whenever the expected number of such cycles tends to infinity. Moreover, for $\ell = 2$, we show that the normalized number of Hamilton $2$-cycles converges to a lognormal distribution. This determines the exact threshold for the appearance of non-linear Hamilton cycles in random hypergraphs, confirming a conjecture of Narayanan and Schacht.</description>

      <title>Cancellation and regularity for planar, 3-connected Kronecker products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate several properties of Kronecker (direct, tensor) products of graphs that are planar and $3$-connected (polyhedral, $3$-polytopal). This class of graphs was recently characterised and constructed by the second author [15].
  Our main result is that cancellation holds for the Kronecker product of graphs when the product is planar and $3$-connected (it is known that Kronecker cancellation may fail in general). Equivalently, polyhedral graphs are Kronecker products in at most one way. This is a special case of the deep and interesting question, open in general, of Kronecker product cancellation for simple graphs: when does $A\wedge C\simeq B\wedge C$ imply $A\simeq B$?
  We complete our investigation on simultaneous products by characterising and constructing the planar graphs that are Cartesian products in two distinct ways, and the planar, $3$-connected graphs that are both Kronecker and Cartesian products.
  The other type of results we obtain are in extremal graph theory. We classify the polyhedral Kronecker products that are either face-regular or vertex-regular graphs. The face-regular ones are certain quadrangulations of the sphere, while the vertex-regular ones are certain cubic graphs (duals of maximal planar graphs). We also characterise, and iteratively construct, the face-regular subclass of graphs minimising the number of vertices of degree $3$.</description>

Abstract: We prove that if $D$ is a digraph of maximum outdegree and indegree at least $k$, and minimum semidegree at least $k/2$ that contains no oriented $4$-cycles, then $D$ contains each oriented tree $T$ with~$k$ arcs. This can be slightly improved if $T$ is either antidirected or an arborescence.</description>

      <title>Disjoint pairs in set systems and combinatorics of low rank matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study and solve several problems in two closely related settings: set families in $2^{[n]}$ with many disjoint pairs of sets and low rank matrices with many zero entries.
  - More than 40 years ago, Daykin and Erd\H{o}s asked for the maximum number of disjoint pairs of sets in a family $F\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ of size $2^{(1/2+\delta)n}$ and conjectured it contains at most $o(|F|^2)$ such pairs. This was proven by Alon and Frankl in 1985. In this paper we completely resolve this problem, proving an optimal dependence of the number of disjoint pairs on the size of family $F$. We also prove the natural variant of the Daykin-Erd\H{o}s conjecture in which disjoint pairs are replaced by pairs with intersection $\lambda\neq 0$.
  - Motivated by a conjecture of Lovett related to the famous log-rank conjecture, Singer and Sudan asked to show that for two families $A, B \subseteq 2^{[n]}$ with a positive constant fraction of set pairs $(a,b)\in A\times B$ being disjoint, there are $R\subset A$ and $S\subset B$ such that all set pairs $(r, s)\in R\times S$ are disjoint, and $|R|\geq 2^{-O(\sqrt{n})}|A|$ and $|S|\geq 2^{-O(\sqrt{n})}|B|$. We prove this conjecture in a strong quantitative form.
  - We prove the following generalizations of the best known bounds for the log-rank conjecture. If $M$ is an $n\times n$ non-negative integer matrix of rank $r$ in which the average of the entries is $\varepsilon\leq 1/2$, then $M$ contains an all-zero submatrix of size at least $2^{-O(\sqrt{\varepsilon r})}n$. Unlike the known bounds for the log-rank conjecture, this result is optimal. Moreover, using similar methods, we also prove that any $n\times n$ matrix of rank $r$ with entries from $\{0,\dots,t\}$ contains a constant submatrix of size at least $2^{-O(t\sqrt{r})}n$.
  Our proofs use probabilistic, entropy and discrepancy methods and explore connections to additive combinatorics and coding theory.</description>

      <title>(Independent) Roman Domination Parameterized by Distance to Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, a function $f:V\to \{0,1,2\}$ is said to be a \emph{Roman Dominating function} (RDF) if for every $v\in V$ with $f(v)=0$, there exists a vertex $u\in N(v)$ such that $f(u)=2$. A Roman Dominating function $f$ is said to be an \emph{Independent Roman Dominating function} (IRDF), if $V_1\cup V_2$ forms an independent set, where $V_i=\{v\in V~\vert~f(v)=i\}$, for $i\in \{0,1,2\}$. The total weight of $f$ is equal to $\sum_{v\in V} f(v)$, and is denoted as $w(f)$. The \emph{Roman Domination Number} (resp. \emph{Independent Roman Domination Number}) of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_R(G)$ (resp. $i_R(G)$), is defined as min$\{w(f)~\vert~f$ is an RDF (resp. IRDF) of $G\}$. For a given graph $G$, the problem of computing $\gamma_R(G)$ (resp. $i_R(G)$) is defined as the \emph{Roman Domination problem} (resp. \emph{Independent Roman Domination problem}).
  In this paper, we examine structural parameterizations of the (Independent) Roman Domination problem. We propose fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms for the (Independent) Roman Domination problem in graphs that are $k$ vertices away from a cluster graph. These graphs have a set of $k$ vertices whose removal results in a cluster graph. We refer to $k$ as the distance to the cluster graph. Specifically, we prove the following results when parameterized by the deletion distance $k$ to cluster graphs: we can find the Roman Domination Number (and Independent Roman Domination Number) in time $4^kn^{O(1)}$. In terms of lower bounds, we show that the Roman Domination number can not be computed in time $2^{\epsilon k}n^{O(1)}$, for any $0&lt;\epsilon &lt;1$ unless a well-known conjecture, SETH fails. In addition, we also show that the Roman Domination problem parameterized by distance to cluster, does not admit a polynomial kernel unless NP $\subseteq$ coNP$/$poly.</description>

      <title>An Analytical Exploration of the Erd\"os-Moser Equation $ \sum_{i=1}^{m-1} i^k = m^k $ Using Approximation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13146v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Erd\"{o}s-Moser equation $ \sum_{i=1}^{m - 1} i^k = m^k $ is a longstanding problem in number theory, with the only known solution in positive integers being $ (k, m) = (1, 3) $. This paper investigates the possibility of other solutions by employing approximation methods based on the Euler-MacLaurin formula to extend the discrete sum $ S(m - 1, k) $ to a continuous function $ S_{\mathbb{R}}(m - 1, k) $. Analyzing the approximate polynomial $ P_{\mathbb{R}}(m) = S_{\mathbb{R}}(m - 1, k) - m^k $, we apply the rational root theorem to search for potential integer solutions. Our investigation confirms that for $ k = 1 $, the only solution is $ m = 3 $. For $ k \geq 2 $, the approximation suggests that no additional positive integer solutions exist. However, we acknowledge the limitations of using approximation methods in the context of Diophantine equations, where exactness is crucial. The omission of correction terms in the approximation may overlook valid solutions. Despite these limitations, our work provides insights into the behavior of the Erd\"{o}s-Moser equation and highlights the challenges in finding solutions using analytical methods. We discuss the implications of our findings and suggest directions for future research, emphasizing the need for exact analytical techniques to conclusively address the conjecture.</description>

      <title>A Stopping Game on Zero-Sum Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a natural game formulated as follows. In this one-person game, the player is given a random permutation $A=(a_1,\dots, a_n)$ of a multiset $M$ of $n$ reals that sum up to $0$, where each of the $n!$ permutation sequences is equally likely. The player only knows the value of $n$ beforehand. The elements of the sequence are revealed one by one and the player can stop the game at any time. Once the process stops, say, after the $i$th element is revealed, the player collects the amount $\sum_{j=i+1}^{n} a_j$ as his/her payoff and the game is over (the payoff corresponds to the unrevealed part of the sequence).
  Three online algorithms are given for maximizing the expected payoff in the binary case when $M$ contains only $1$'s and $-1$'s. $\texttt{Algorithm 1}$ is slightly suboptimal, but is easier to analyze. Moreover, it can also be used when $n$ is only known with some approximation. $\texttt{Algorithm 2}$ is exactly optimal but not so easy to analyze on its own. $\texttt{Algorithm 3}$ is the simplest of all three. It turns out that the expected payoffs of the player are $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ for all three algorithms.
  In the end, we address the general problem and deal with an arbitrary zero-sum multiset, for which we show that our $\texttt{Algorithm 3}$ returns a payoff proportional to $\sqrt{n}$, which is worst case-optimal.</description>

      <title>On lower bounds of the density of planar periodic sets without unit distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the maximal density $m_1(\mathbb{R}^2)$ of planar sets without unit distances is a fundamental problem in combinatorial geometry. This paper investigates lower bounds for this quantity. We introduce a novel approach to estimating $m_1(\mathbb{R}^2)$ by reformulating the problem as a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) problem on graphs constructed from flat torus, focusing on periodic sets with respect to two non-collinear vectors. Our experimental results supported by theoretical justifications of proposed method demonstrate that for a sufficiently wide range of parameters this approach does not improve the known lower bound $0.22936 \le m_1(\mathbb{R}^2)$. The best discrete sets found are approximations of Croft's construction. In addition, several open source software packages for MIS problem are compared on this task.</description>

      <title>Topological expanders, coarse geometry and thick embeddings of complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantify the topological expansion properties of bounded degree simplicial complexes in terms of a family of sublinear functions, in analogy with the separation profile of Benjamini-Schramm-Tim\'ar for classical expansion of bounded degree graphs. We prove that, like the separation profile, these new invariants are monotone under regular maps between complexes satisfying appropriate higher connectivity assumptions. In the dimension $1$ case, we recover the cutwidth profile of Huang-Hume-Kelly-Lam. We also prove the seemingly new result that any $1$-dimensional topological expander necessarily contains a graphical expander.
  In higher dimensions, we give full calculations of these new invariants for Euclidean spaces, which are natural analogues of waist and width-volume inequalities due to Gromov and Guth respectively. We present several other methods of obtaining upper bounds including na\"ive (yet useful) direct product and fibring theorems, and show how lower bounds can be obtained via thick embeddings of complexes, in analogy with previous work of Barrett-Hume. Using this, we find lower bounds for $k$-expansion of $(k+1)$-fold horocyclic products of trees, and for rank $k$ symmetric spaces of non-compact type. As a further application, we prove that for every $k\geq 2$ there is no coarse embedding (and more generally, no regular map) from the $k$-fold horocyclic product of $3$-regular trees to either any product $(\mathbb{H}^2)^{k-2}\times H \times D$ where $\mathbb{H}^2$ is the real hyperbolic plane, $H$ is a bounded degree hyperbolic graph and $D$ is a doubling metric space, or to any symmetric space whose non-compact factor has corank (dimension minus rank) is strictly less than $k$.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Treewidth of Level-k Rooted Phylogenetic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks are directed acyclic graphs that depict the genomic evolution of related taxa. Reticulation nodes in such networks (nodes with more than one parent) represent reticulate evolutionary events, such as recombination, reassortment, hybridization, or horizontal gene transfer. Typically, the complexity of a phylogenetic network is expressed in terms of its level, i.e., the maximum number of edges that are required to be removed from each biconnected component of the phylogenetic network to turn it into a tree. Here, we study the relationship between the level of a phylogenetic network and another popular graph complexity parameter - treewidth. We show a $\frac{k+3}{2}$ upper bound on the treewidth of level-$k$ phylogenetic networks and an improved $(1/3 + \delta) k$ upper bound for large $k$. These bounds imply that many computational problems on phylogenetic networks, such as the small parsimony problem or some variants of phylogenetic diversity maximization, are polynomial-time solvable on level-$k$ networks with constant $k$. Our first bound is applicable to any $k$, and it allows us to construct an explicit tree decomposition of width $\frac{k+3}{2}$ that can be used to analyze phylogenetic networks generated by tools like SNAQ that guarantee bounded network level. Finally, we show a $k/13$ lower bound on the maximum treewidth among level-$k$ phylogenetic networks for large enough $k$ based on expander graphs.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa, Reed-Muller codes and Shannon capacity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1948, Shannon used a probabilistic argument to show the existence of codes achieving a maximal rate defined by the channel capacity. In 1954, Muller and Reed introduced a simple deterministic code construction, based on polynomial evaluations, conjectured shortly after to achieve capacity. The conjecture led to decades of activity involving various areas of mathematics and the recent settlement by [AS23] using flower set boosting. In this paper, we provide an alternative proof of the weak form of the capacity result, i.e., that RM codes have a vanishing local error at any rate below capacity. Our proof relies on the recent Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture's proof [GGMT23] and an entropy extraction approach similar to [AY19]. Further, a new additive combinatorics conjecture is put forward which would imply the stronger result with vanishing global error. We expect the latter conjecture to be more directly relevant to coding applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.00040v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research in combinatorics has often explored the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP). The ASEP, inspired by examples from statistical mechanics, involves particles of various species moving around a lattice. With the traditional ASEP particles of a given species can move but do not change species. In this paper a new combinatorial formalism, the DASEP (doubly asymmetric simple exclusion process), is explored. The DASEP is inspired by biological processes where, unlike the ASEP, the particles can change from one species to another. The combinatorics of the DASEP on a one dimensional lattice are explored, including the associated generating function. The stationary probabilities of the DASEP are explored, and results are proven relating these stationary probabilities to those of the simpler ASEP.</description>

      <title>Sums of linear transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if $\mathcal{L}_1$ and $\mathcal{L}_2$ are linear transformations from $\mathbb{Z}^d$ to $\mathbb{Z}^d$ satisfying certain mild conditions, then, for any finite subset $A$ of $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $$|\mathcal{L}_1 A+\mathcal{L}_2 A|\geq \left(|\det(\mathcal{L}_1)|^{1/d}+|\det(\mathcal{L}_2)|^{1/d}\right)^d|A|- o(|A|).$$ This result corrects and confirms the two-summand case of a conjecture of Bukh and is best possible up to the lower-order term for certain choices of $\mathcal{L}_1$ and $\mathcal{L}_2$. As an application, we prove a lower bound for $|A + \lambda \cdot A|$ when $A$ is a finite set of real numbers and $\lambda$ is an algebraic number. In particular, when $\lambda$ is of the form $(p/q)^{1/d}$ for some $p, q, d \in \mathbb{N}$, each taken as small as possible for such a representation, we show that $$|A + \lambda \cdot A| \geq (p^{1/d} + q^{1/d})^d |A| - o(|A|).$$ This is again best possible up to the lower-order term and extends a recent result of Krachun and Petrov which treated the case $\lambda = \sqrt{2}$.</description>

      <title>Applications of infinite lower triangular matrices and their group structure in combinatorics and the theory of orthogonal polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the set of lower-triangular, infinite matrices with natural operations such as addition, multiplication by a number or matrix multiplication. With respect to every of these operations separately, the set preserves the group structure. With respect to all three operations considered jointly, the set becomes a ring with unity. We indicate important properties of the obtained in this way algebraic structures. In particular, we indicate several sub-groups or sub-rings. Among sub-groups, we consider the group of Riordan matrices and indicate its several sub-groups. We also present many examples (in fact around 20) of such matrices composed of the sequences of important families of polynomials or numbers as entries of certain lower-triangular infinite matrices. By applying well-known matrix operations such as multiplication and calculating an inverse, we see that such representation can be and is a source of getting new, important relationships between these families.</description>

      <title>The Widths of Strict Outerconfluent Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strict outerconfluent drawing is a style of graph drawing in which vertices are drawn on the boundary of a disk, adjacencies are indicated by the existence of smooth curves through a system of tracks within the disk, and no two adjacent vertices are connected by more than one of these smooth tracks. We investigate graph width parameters on the graphs that have drawings in this style. We prove that the clique-width of these graphs is unbounded, but their twin-width is bounded.</description>

      <title>Twin-width of graphs with tree-structured decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14677v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The twin-width of a graph measures its distance to co-graphs and generalizes classical width concepts such as tree-width or rank-width. Since its introduction in 2020 (Bonnet et. al. 2020), a mass of new results has appeared relating twin width to group theory, model theory, combinatorial optimization, and structural graph theory.
  We take a detailed look at the interplay between the twin-width of a graph and the twin-width of its components under tree-structured decompositions: We prove that the twin-width of a graph is at most twice its strong tree-width, contrasting nicely with the result of (Bonnet and D\'epr\'es 2022), which states that twin-width can be exponential in tree-width. Further, we employ the fundamental concept from structural graph theory of decomposing a graph into highly connected components, in order to obtain an optimal linear bound on the twin-width of a graph given the widths of its biconnected components. For triconnected components we obtain a linear upper bound if we add red edges to the components indicating the splits which led to the components. Extending this approach to quasi-4-connectivity, we obtain a quadratic upper bound. Finally, we investigate how the adhesion of a tree decomposition influences the twin-width of the decomposed graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We call a class $\mathcal{M}$ of matroids hereditary if it is closed under flats. We denote by $\mathcal{M}^{ext}$ the class of matroids $M$ that is in $\mathcal{M}$, or has an element $e$ such that $M \backslash e$ is in $\mathcal{M}$. We prove that if $\mathcal{M}$ has finitely many forbidden flats, then so does $\mathcal{M}^{ext} $. Discussing the interplay of graphs and matroids, we note the consequences of this result for graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a connected graph $G$, its resistance matrix is denoted by $R(G)$. If all the row(column) sums of $R(G)$ are equal, then $G$ is said to be resistance regular. We provide some necessary and sufficient conditions for a simple connected graph to be a resistance regular graph. Also, we determine various bounds for the resistance energy and resistance spectral radius of $G.$ Furthermore, we compute the resistance spectrum and resistance energies of some resistance regular graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a combinatorial rule satisfied by the signs of principal minors of a real symmetric matrix. The sign patterns satisfying this rule are equivalent to uniform oriented Lagrangian matroids. We first discuss their structure and symmetries and then study their asymptotics, proving that almost all of them are not representable by real symmetric matrices. We offer several conjectures and experimental results concerning representable sign patterns and the topology of their representation spaces.</description>

      <title>On torsion in eulerian magnitude homology of Erdos-Renyi random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the regimes where an Erdos-Renyi random graph has torsion free eulerian magnitude homology groups. To this end, we start be introducing the eulerian Asao-Izumihara complex - a quotient CW-complex whose homology groups are isomorphic to direct summands of the graph eulerian magnitude homology group. We then proceed by producing a vanishing threshold for a shelling of eulerian Asao-Izumihara complex. This will lead to a result establishing the regimes where eulerian magnitude homology of Erdos-Renyi random graphs is torsion free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate skein relations in cluster algebras from punctured surfaces, extending the work of \c{C}anak\c{c}i-Schiffler and Musiker-Williams on unpunctured surfaces. Using a combinatorial expansion formula by O{\u{g}}uz-Y{\i}ld{\i}r{\i}m and Pilaud-Reading-Schroll, we provide explicit formulas for these relations. This work demonstrates that the punctured analogues of the bangle and bracelet functions form spanning sets for cluster algebras associated with a punctured surfaces. For surfaces with boundary and closed surfaces of genus 0, we further show that the bangles and bracelets form bases.</description>

      <title>Ramsey Number Counterexample Checking and One Vertex Extension Linearly Related to $s$ and $t$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ramsey number $R(s,t)$ is the smallest integer $n$ such that all graphs of size $n$ contain a clique of size $s$ or an independent set of size $t$. $\mathcal{R}(s,t,n)$ is the set of all counterexample graphs without this property for a given $n$. We prove that if a graph $G_{n+1}$ of size $n+1$ has $\max\{s,t\}+1$ subgraphs in $\mathcal{R}(s,t,n)$, then $G_{n+1}$ is in $\mathcal{R}(s,t,n+1)$. Based on this, we introduce algorithms for one-vertex extension and counterexample checking with runtime linearly bound by $s$ and $t$. We prove the utility of these algorithms by verifying $\mathcal{R}(4,6,36)$ and $\mathcal{R}(5,5,43)$ are empty given current sets $\mathcal{R}(4,6,35)$ and $\mathcal{R}(5,5,42)$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove two supercongruences conjectured by Z.-W. Sun via the Wilf-Zeilberger method. One of them is, for any prime $p&gt;3$, \begin{align*} \sum_{n=0}^{(p-1)/2}\frac{6n+1}{(-512)^n}\binom{2n}n^3&amp;\equiv p\left(\frac{-2}p\right)+\frac{p^3}4\left(\frac2p\right)E_{p-3}\pmod{p^4}, \end{align*} where $\left(\frac{\cdot}p\right)$ stands for the Legendre symbol, and $E_{n}$ is the $n$-th Euler number.</description>

      <title>Weak Bruhat interval modules for genomic Schur functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\lambda$ be a partition of a positive integer $n$. The genomic Schur function $U_\lambda$ was introduced by Pechenik--Yong in the context of the $K$-theory of Grassmannians. Recently, Pechenik provided a positive combinatorial formula for the fundamental quasisymmetric expansion of $U_\lambda$ in terms of increasing gapless tableaux. In this paper, for each $1 \le m \le n$, we construct an $H_m(0)$-module $\mathbf{G}_{\lambda;m}$ whose image under the quasisymmetric characteristic is the $m$th degree homogeneous component of $U_\lambda$ by defining an $H_m(0)$-action on increasing gapless tableaux. We provide a method to assign a permutation to each increasing gapless tableau, and use this assignment to decompose $\mathbf{G}_{\lambda;m}$ into a direct sum of weak Bruhat interval modules. Furthermore, we determine the projective cover of each summand of the direct sum decomposition.</description>

      <title>Rational Normal Curves, Chip Firing and Free Resolutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study rational normal curves via a connection to the chip firing game. A key technique, introduced in this article, is to interpret the defining ideal of the rational normal curve as an ideal associated to a generalisation of a cycle graph called a parcycle. This association allows us to study rational normal curves by combinatorial methods. Given any Cohen-Macaulay initial monomial ideal of the rational normal curve, we explicitly construct (via this association) a corresponding Gr\"obner degeneration and an explicit combinatorial minimal free resolution of this Gr\"obner degeneration. Applications include minimal cellular resolutions for each Cohen-Macaulay initial monomial ideal of the rational normal curve, explicit combinatorial formulas for Hilbert series of certain lex-segment ideals and a combinatorial perspective on the Eagon-Northcott complex associated to the rational normal curve.</description>

      <title>Presentations of Schur and Specht modules in characteristic zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New presentations of Specht modules of symmetric groups over fields of characteristic zero have been obtained by Brauner, Friedmann, Hanlon, Stanley and Wachs. These involve generators that are column tabloids and relations that are Garnir relations with maximal number of exchanges between consecutive columns or symmetrization of Garnir relations with minimal number of exchanges between consecutive columns. In this paper, we examine Garnir relations and their symmetrization with any number of exchanges. In both cases, we provide sufficient arithmetic conditions so that the corresponding quotient is a Specht module. In particular, in the first case this yields new presentations of Specht modules if the parts of the conjugate partition that correspond to maximal number of exchanges greater than 1 are distinct. These results generalize the presentations mentioned above and offer an answer to a question of Friedmann, Hanlon and Wachs. Our approach is via representations of the general linear group.</description>
