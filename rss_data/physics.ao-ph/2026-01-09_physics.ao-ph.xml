      <title>Deep Mediterranean turbulence motions under stratified-water conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertically stable in density, stratified-water conditions 'SW' exist in the deep Mediterranean Sea that are characterized by temperature differences of 0.0002-0.01degrC over 125 m above a flat seafloor. These result in a mean buoyancy frequency of N = (1.5-2)f, where f denotes the inertial frequency. Although the stability values are one order of magnitude smaller than found in the ocean, they govern a dynamical deep sea as demonstrated using observations from a 3D mooring-array equipped with nearly 3000 high-resolution temperature sensors. SW-conditions can last up to a fortnight, before waters become near-homogeneous, and occur about 40% of the time, slightly more often in winter than in summer. Under SW, up to 60 m above seafloor is dominated by convection turbulence that is partially driven by geothermal heating 'GH' suppressed by stratification above. The upper-half of the array shows dominant shear turbulence driven by two sources. Interfacial internal waves generate weakly-nonlinear, resonant parametric instabilities that, upon breaking, provide mean turbulence dissipation rates of about one-third of that via general GH. It is about equal to open-ocean values away from boundaries and may represent the dominant source of turbulence there. Like GH, the observed turbulence is local up- and down-going. Tenfold larger mean dissipation rates are observed when slanted convection drives turbulent overturns &gt;10 m and unstable clouds are advected with the mean flow. It confirms theoretical marginal stability analyses, previous vertical waterflow observations, and suggests a relationship between turbulence and sub-mesoscale eddies across the internal wave band. Movies support the findings.</description>

      <title>Deep Mediterranean turbulence motions under near-homogeneous conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very weakly density-stratified, near-homogeneous 'NH' conditions are found in the deep Western Mediterranean Sea. Under these conditions, over vertical ranges of several hundreds of meters water temperature varies only a few 0.0001degrC and the buoyancy frequency is smaller than the local inertial frequency. While such waters are characterized as 'quiescent', they are not stagnant and demonstrate regular bursts of turbulent overturns across scales larger than 10 m that are relevant for deep-sea life. As will be shown from a 3D mooring-array with nearly 3000 high-resolution temperature 'T-'sensors, consecutive NH conditions can last up to a fortnight, before stratified waters are advected over the array. At the site, NH conditions occur about 60% of the time. The majority of NH periods is governed by convection turbulence that is driven by geothermal heating from below. The associated turbulence dissipation rate, which is calculated from Ellison scales after precise band-pass filtering, compares with historic geophysical heat-flux measurements. Convection turbulence leads to buoyancy-driven scaling of spectra, not only of temperature in the turbulence range, but also suggesting extensions across the internal-wave band into sub-mesoscales, and (limited observations of) kinetic energy and waterflow differences. Such spectra are found to be uniform over the 124-m vertical T-sensor range above the flat seafloor. Small spectral deviations are observed when very weakly stratified waters are advected sideways or from above, whereby turbulence levels increase by about 30%. Movies show the alternation between calm periods, turbulent clouds passing, and geothermal-heat flares of various sizes.</description>

      <title>Error in ERA5 2m Temperature identified using GraphCast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reanalyses such as ERA5 have long been foundational for weather and climate science. They have also found a new use case, as training and verification data for machine-learnt weather prediction (MLWP) models. Here we compare short-lead time (6h) forecasts from the MLWP model GraphCast against ERA5. In doing so, we identify a recurrent, spatially coherent error in 2m Temperature centred on the Ethiopian Highlands, that occurs predominantly at 0600 UTC. We show that these error events are not an error in the forecast from GraphCast, but are in fact an error in ERA5, and are also present in the ECMWF operational analysis. They arise from the 2D optimal interpolation procedure, when surface reports are assimilated that are temporally displaced compared to the background forecast. This produces spuriously warm analysis increments over Ethiopia on approximately 7\% of dates at 0600 UTC across the reanalysis record. The spread from the ensemble of data assimilation partially flags these cases but is underdispersive. We assess the impact on GraphCast, which was trained on ERA5. While GraphCast can largely ignore these unphysical error events, a small systematic degradation in forecast skill over the region is observed. We discuss implications for using reanalysis as truth in machine learning training and verification, and recommend simple changes to reduce such artefacts in future analyses.</description>

      <title>Heat-flash travel just above a deep Mediterranean seafloor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deep sea is weakly stratified in density but shows considerable variations in turbulent motions in all three directions. When registered by moored high-resolution temperature 'T'-sensors, the motions cause variations of 0.01degrC or less and in time of minutes or less, which is much faster than hours or longer of internal waves. Occasionally, T-sensors close to the seafloor register minute-long flashes of 0.0005-0.001degrC warmer than the environment. When singular, such flashes may be artefacts. However, in a large mooring-array with 45 vertical lines at 9.5-m horizontal distances, near-seafloor heat flashes are seen to travel, most likely with internal-wave instabilities in overlying stratified waters. The instabilities seem to release the flashes from a geothermally heated seafloor of which turbulence convection is suppressed by warmer waters from above. The forms and turbulence intensity of these rare signals are compared with those induced by a Remotely Operated Vehicle working near the array. Other causes like unidentified marine mammal passing are hypothesized.</description>

      <title>Making Tunable Parameters State-Dependent in Weather and Climate Models with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weather and climate models rely on parametrisations to represent unresolved sub-grid processes. Traditional schemes rely on fixed coefficients that are weakly constrained and tuned offline, contributing to persistent biases that limit their ability to adapt to the underlying physics. This study presents a framework that learns components of parametrisation schemes online as a function of the evolving model state using reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluates the resulting RL-driven parameter updates across a hierarchy of idealised testbeds spanning a simple climate bias correction (SCBC), a radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), and a zonal mean energy balance model (EBM) with both single-agent and federated multi-agent settings. Across nine RL algorithms, Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) achieved the highest skill and the most stable convergence across configurations, with performance assessed against a static baseline using area-weighted RMSE, temperature profile and pressure-level diagnostics. For the EBM, single-agent RL outperformed static parameter tuning with the strongest gains in tropical and mid-latitude bands, while federated RL on multi-agent setups enabled geographically specialised control and faster convergence, with a six-agent DDPG configuration using frequent aggregation yielding the lowest area-weighted RMSE across the tropics and mid-latitudes. The learnt corrections were also physically meaningful as agents modulated EBM radiative parameters to reduce meridional biases, adjusted RCE lapse rates to match vertical temperature errors, and stabilised SCBC heating increments to limit drift. Overall, results highlight RL to deliver skilful state-dependent, and regime-aware parametrisations, offering a scalable pathway for online learning within numerical models.</description>

      <title>Surveying exogenous species in Saturn with ALMA I. Detecting and Mapping CO</title>

Abstract: The origin of carbon monoxide (CO) in Saturn's stratosphere remains uncertain, with proposed sources including internal thermochemical production, cometary impacts, and exogenic material from the rings and icy moons (i.e. Enceladus). We aim to constrain the vertical and meridional distribution of stratospheric CO and assess the relative contributions of these potential sources. Here, we analysed high-spectral-resolution ALMA observations of the CO (J=3-2) line obtained on 25 May 2018, sampling Saturn's limb from 20{\deg}S to 69{\deg}N. CO vertical profiles were retrieved using a line-by-line radiative transfer model combined with spectral inversion techniques, testing multiple prior scenarios representative of different source hypotheses. CO is confined to a narrow layer between 0.1 and 1 mbar, with a robust negative vertical gradient and mean abundances of (3.7+/- 0.8) x 10$^{-8}$ at 0.1 mbar and (7.2 +/- 0.9) x 10$^{-8}$ at 1 mbar. The meridional distribution is statistically homogeneous, with a marginal enhancement near 60{\deg} N plausibly related to Enceladus. No significant equatorial enhancement is detected. The absence of a strong equatorial enhancement rules out a long-lived steady source associated with ring infall. The observations are most consistent with a relatively recent ($\approx$200-year-old or younger) cometary impact whose material has since been horizontally mixed, while any Cassini Grand Finale ring influx was either too recent or inefficient to affect CO abundances at the probed pressure levels.</description>

      <title>Surface solar radiation: AI satellite retrieval can outperform Heliosat and generalizes well to other climate zones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate estimates of surface solar irradiance (SSI) are essential for solar resource assessments and solar energy forecasts in grid integration and building control applications. SSI estimates for spatially extended regions can be retrieved from geostationary satellites such as Meteosat. Traditional SSI satellite retrievals like Heliosat rely on physical radiative transfer modelling. We introduce the first machine-learning-based satellite retrieval for instantaneous SSI and demonstrate its capability to provide accurate and generalizable SSI estimates across Europe. Our deep learning retrieval provides near real-time SSI estimates based on data-driven emulation of Heliosat and fine-tuning on pyranometer networks. By including SSI from ground stations, our SSI retrieval model can outperform Heliosat accuracy and generalize well to regions with other climates and surface albedos in cloudy conditions (clear-sky index &lt; 0.8). We also show that the SSI retrieved from Heliosat exhibits large biases in mountain regions, and that training and fine-tuning our retrieval models on SSI data from ground stations strongly reduces these biases, outperforming Heliosat. Furthermore, we quantify the relative importance of the Meteosat channels and other predictor variables like solar zenith angle for the accuracy of our deep learning SSI retrieval model in different cloud conditions. We find that in cloudy conditions multiple near-infrared and infrared channels enhance the performance. Our results can facilitate the development of more accurate satellite retrieval models of surface solar irradiance.</description>

      <title>The Equilibrium Response of Atmospheric Machine-Learning Models to Uniform Sea Surface Temperature Warming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning models for the global atmosphere that are capable of producing stable, multi-year simulations of Earth's climate have recently been developed. However, the ability of these ML models to generalize beyond the training distribution remains an open question. In this study, we evaluate the climate response of several state-of-the-art ML models (ACE2-ERA5, NeuralGCM, and cBottle) to a uniform sea surface temperature warming, a widely used benchmark for evaluating climate change. We assess each ML model's performance relative to a physics-based general circulation model (NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory AM4) across key diagnostics, including surface air temperature, precipitation, temperature and wind profiles, and top-of-atmosphere radiation. While the ML models reproduce key aspects of the physical model response, particularly the response of precipitation, some exhibit notable departures from robust physical responses, including radiative responses and land region warming. Our results highlight the promise and current limitations of ML models for climate change applications and suggest that further improvements are needed for robust out-of-sample generalization.</description>

Abstract: Turbulence is indispensable to redistribute nutrients for all life forms larger than microbial, on land and in the ocean. Yet, the development of deep-sea turbulence was not studied in three dimensions to date. As a disproportionate laboratory, an array of nearly 3000 high-resolution temperature sensors had been installed for three years on the flat 2500-m deep bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. The time series from the half-cubic hectometer mooring-array allows for the creation of unique movies of deep-sea water motions. Although temperature differences are typically 0.001degrC, variable convection-turbulence is observed as expected from geothermal heating through the flat seafloor. During about 40% of the time, an additional turbulence, 3 times stronger in magnitude, is observed from slantwise advected warmer waters to pass in turbulent clouds. Besides turbulent clouds and seafloor heating, movies also reveal weakly turbulent interfacial-wave breakdown that commonly occurs in the open ocean far away from boundaries.</description>
