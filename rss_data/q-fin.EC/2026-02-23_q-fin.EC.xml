      <title>Work from Home and Job Satisfaction: Differences by Disability Status among Healthcare Workers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Many workers with disabilities face negative stereotypical attitudes, pay gaps, and a lack of respect in the workplace, contributing to substantially lower job satisfaction compared to people without disabilities. Work from home may help to increase job satisfaction for people with disabilities.
  Objective: This study analyzes how different measures of job satisfaction vary between people with and without disabilities, and the extent to which working from home moderates the relationship between disability and job satisfaction.
  Methods: We use multivariable regression analysis to examine if the ability to work from home moderates the relationship between disability and indicators related to job satisfaction. The dataset draws on a novel survey of healthcare professionals.
  Results: Results show that people with disabilities have relatively greater turnover intentions, lower sense of organizational commitment and support, weaker perceptions of openness and inclusion in the workplace, and worse relations with management and coworkers. Regressions indicate that working from home helps to improve most perceptions of work experiences but does so more for people without disabilities than for people with disabilities.
  Conclusions: The findings suggest that (a) some accommodations typically viewed as exceptions to meet the needs of people with disabilities have even greater benefits for the workforce at large and (b) because workers with and without disabilities benefit from remote work, we cannot expect those accommodations to close the gaps caused by inequities.</description>

      <title>Distributional welfare impacts and compensatory transit strategies under NYC congestion pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early evaluations of NYC's congestion pricing program indicate overall improvements in vehicle speed and transit ridership. However, its distributional impacts remain understudied, as does the design of compensatory transit strategies needed to mitigate potential welfare losses. This study identifies population segments and regions most affected by congestion pricing, and evaluates how those welfare losses can be compensated through transit improvements funded by the toll revenues. We estimate joint mode and destination models using aggregated synthetic trips in the NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area (CSA) and calibrate toll-related parameters using post-toll changes reported by MTA. Compensatory transit strategies are evaluated by quantifying the reductions in transit wait time and fare discounts required to offset the CS losses. The results show that the program leads to an accessibility-related CS loss of $397.23 million per year, while generating net passenger toll revenue of $523.44 million per year estimated based on the MTA's report--indicating a net welfare gain. However, these gains in benefits conceal significant disparities. Achieving a general compensation requires modest investment--a 0.63-minute (13%) reduction in wait time or $165.15 million in annual fare subsidies for NYC residents, and a 2.12-minute (28%) reduction or $171.42 million for New Jersey residents. However, ensuring that no population group and county unit is made worse off is substantially more costly and infeasible through transit improvements alone. These findings underscore the need for differentiated compensation strategies: uniform fare discounts lead to overcompensation for some groups, whereas segment-specific discounts, origin-based fare reductions, or commuter pass bundles can achieve equitable accessibility restoration at lower fiscal cost.</description>

      <title>Optimal Solar Investment and Operation under Asymmetric Net Metering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the joint investment and operational decisions of a prosumer, a customer who both consumes and generates electricity, under net energy metering (NEM) tariffs. Traditional NEM schemes provide temporally flat compensation at the retail price for net energy exports over a billing period. However, ongoing reforms in several U.S. states are introducing time-varying prices and asymmetric import/export compensation to better align incentives with grid costs. While prior studies treat PV capacity as exogenous and focus primarily on consumption behavior, this work endogenizes PV investment and derives the marginal value of solar capacity for a flexible prosumer under asymmetric NEM tariffs. We characterize optimal investment and show how optimal investment changes with prices and PV costs. Through this analysis, we identify a PV effect: changes in NEM pricing in one period can influence net demand and consumption in generating periods with unchanged prices through adjustments in optimal PV investment. The PV effect weakens the ability of higher import prices to increase prosumer payments, with direct implications for NEM reform. We validate our theoretical results in a case study using simulated household and tariff data derived from historical conditions in Massachusetts.</description>
