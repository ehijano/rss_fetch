      <title>Cylindric growth diagrams, walks in simplices, and exclusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish bijections between three classes of combinatorial objects that have been studied in very different contexts: lattice walks in simplicial regions as introduced by Mortimer--Prellberg, standard cylindric tableaux as introduced by Gessel--Krattenthaler and Postnikov, and sequences of states in the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process. This perspective allows us to translate symmetries from one setting into another, revealing unexpected properties of these objects.
  Specifically, we show that a recent bijection of Courtiel, Elvey Price and Marcovici between certain simplicial walks with forward and backward steps is equivalent to a cylindric analogue of the Robinson--Schensted correspondence. Originally defined by Neyman by iterating an insertion operation, we provide an alternative description of this correspondence by introducing a cylindric version of Fomin's growth diagrams. This natural description elucidates the symmetry of the correspondence, and it allows us to interpret the above walks as oscillating cylindric tableaux.</description>

      <title>Sums along the edges of random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices and $(H,+)$ be an abelian group. What is the minimum size ${\sf S}_H(G)$ of the set of all sums $A(u)+A(v)$ over all injections $A:V(G)\to H$? In 2012, Alon, Angel, the first author, and Lubetzky proved that, for expander graphs and $H=\mathbb{Z}$, this minimum is at least $\Omega(\log n)$, and this bound is tight -- there exists a regular expander $G$ with ${\sf S}_{\mathbb{Z}}(G)=O(\log n)$. We prove that, for every constant $d\geq 3$, the random $d$-regular graph $\mathcal{G}_{n,d}$ has significantly larger sum-sets: with high probability, for every abelian group $H$, ${\sf S}_H(\mathcal{G}_{n,d})=\Omega(n^{1-2/d})$. In particular, this proves that, for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists a regular graph with $O(n)$ edges and with sum-sets of size at least $n^{1-\varepsilon}$, for all abelian groups. We also prove that, for $d\gg\ln^2 n$, with high probability, for every abelian group $H$, ${\sf S}_H(\mathcal{G}_{n,d})=n(1-o(1))$.</description>

      <title>Spectral extremal problem for the odd prism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral Tur\'an number $\spex(n, F)$ denotes the maximum spectral radius $\rho(G)$ of an $F$-free graph $G$ of order $n$. This paper determines $\spex\left(n, C_{2k+1}^{\square}\right)$ for all sufficiently large $n$, establishing the unique extremal graph. Here, $C_{2k+1}^{\square}$ is the odd prism -- the Cartesian product $C_{2k+1} \square K_2$ -- where the Cartesian product $G \square F$ has vertex set $V(G) \times V(F)$, and edges between $(u_1,v_1)$ and $(u_2,v_2)$ if either $u_1 = u_2$ and $v_1v_2 \in E(F)$, or ($v_1 = v_2$ and $u_1u_2 \in E(G)$).</description>

      <title>The inverse $Z$-polynomial of a matroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the $Z$-polynomials of matroids, Ferroni, Matherne, Stevens, and Vecchi introduced the inverse $Z$-polynomial of a matroid. In this paper, we prove several fundamental properties of the inverse $Z$-polynomial, including non-negativity and multiplicativity, and show that it is a valuative invariant. We also provide explicit formulas for the inverse $Z$-polynomials of uniform matroids and a broader class of matroids, namely sparse paving matroids, which include uniform matroids as a special case. Furthermore, we establish the unimodality and log-concavity of these polynomials in the case of sparse paving matroids. Based on the properties of the $Z$-polynomial, we conjecture that the coefficients of the inverse $Z$-polynomial are unimodal and log-concave.</description>

      <title>Permanental Analog of the Rank-Nullity Theorem for Symmetric Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rank-nullity theorem is a core result in the study of matrices. The rank of an $n \times n$ matrix is equal to the size of its largest square submatrix with a nonzero determinant; it can be computed in $O(n^{2.37})$ time. For symmetric matrices, the rank equals to the number of nonzero eigenvalues (that is, the nonzero roots of the characteristic polynomial), which implies that the nullity equals the multiplicity of zero eigenvalue. Similar to the rank, the permanental rank of a matrix is the size of the largest square submatrix with nonzero permanent (whose computation is \#P-complete), while the permanental nullity is the multiplicity of zero as a root of the permanental polynomial. In this paper, we prove a permanental analog of the rank-nullity theorem for any non-negative symmetric matrix, positive semi-definite matrix and (-1, 0, 1)-balanced symmetric matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the (almost surely) unique Radon partition of a set of $n$ random Gaussian vectors in $\mathbb R^{n-2}$; choose one of the two parts of this partition uniformly at random, and for $0 \le k \le n$, let $p_k$ denote the probability that it has size $k$. In this paper, we prove strong unimodality results for the distribution $(p_0,\dots,p_n)$.</description>

      <title>Spherical designs for finite quaternionic unit groups and their applications to modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite subset $X$ of the $d$-dimensional unit sphere, the harmonic strength $T(X)$ of $X$ is the set of $\ell\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\sum_{x\in X} P(x)=0$ for all harmonic polynomials $P$ of homogeneous degree $\ell$. We will study three exceptional finite groups of unit quaternions, called the binary tetrahedral group $2T$ of order 24, the octahedral group $2O$ of order 48, and the icosahedral group $2I$ of order 120, which can be viewed as a subset of the 3-dimensional unit sphere. For these three groups, we determine the harmonic strength and show the minimality and the uniqueness as spherical designs. In particular, the group $2O$ is unique as a minimal subset $X$ of the 3-dimensional unit sphere with $T(X)=\{22,14,10,6,4,2 \}\cup \mathbb{O}^+$, where $\mathbb{O}^+$ denotes the set of all positive odd integers. This result provides the first characterization of $2O$ from the spherical design viewpoint.
  For $G\in \{2T,2O,2I\}$, we consider the lattice $\mathcal{O}_{G}$ generated by $G$ over $R_G$ on which the group $G$ acts on by multiplication, where $R_{2T}=\mathbb{Z},\ R_{2O}=\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}],\ R_{2I}=\mathbb{Z}[(1+\sqrt{5})/2]$ are the ring of integers. We introduce the spherical theta function $\theta_{G,P}(z)$ attached to the lattice $\mathcal{O}_G$ and a harmonic polynomial $P$ of degree $\ell$ and prove that they are modular forms. By applying our results on the characterization of $G$ as a spherical design, we determine the cases in which the $\mathbb{C}$-vector space spanned by all $\theta_{G,P}(z)$ of harmonic polynomials $P$ of homogeneous degree $\ell$ has dimension zero--without relying on the theory of modular forms.</description>

      <title>Size-Ramsey numbers of tight paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $s$-colour size-Ramsey number of a hypergraph $H$ is the minimum number of edges in a hypergraph $G$ whose every $s$-edge-colouring contains a monochromatic copy of $H$. We show that the $s$-colour size-Ramsey number of the $r$-uniform tight path on $n$ vertices is linear in $n$, for every fixed $r$ and $s$, thereby answering a question of Dudek, La Fleur, Mubayi and R\"odl (2017).</description>

      <title>Multipacking in Hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an undirected graph $G$, a dominating broadcast on $G$ is a function $f : V(G) \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ such that for any vertex $u \in V(G)$, there exists a vertex $v \in V(G)$ with $f(v) \geqslant 1$ and $d(u,v) \leqslant f(v)$. The cost of $f$ is $\sum_{v \in V} f(v)$. The minimum cost over all the dominating broadcasts on $G$ is defined as the broadcast domination number $\gamma_b(G)$ of $G$. A multipacking in $G$ is a subset $M \subseteq V(G)$ such that, for every vertex $v \in V(G)$ and every positive integer $r$, the number of vertices in $M$ within distance $r$ of $v$ is at most $r$. The multipacking number of $G$, denoted $\operatorname{mp}(G)$, is the maximum cardinality of a multipacking in $G$. These two optimisation problems are duals of each other, and it easily follows that $\operatorname{mp}(G) \leqslant \gamma_b(G)$. It is known that $\gamma_b(G) \leqslant 2\operatorname{mp}(G)+3$ and conjectured that $\gamma_b(G) \leqslant 2\operatorname{mp}(G)$.
  In this paper, we show that for the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ $$ \left\lfloor\frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor
  \leqslant \operatorname{mp}(Q_n)
  \leqslant \frac{n}{2} + 6\sqrt{2n}. $$
  Since $\gamma_b(Q_n) = n-1$ for all $n \geqslant 3$, this verifies the above conjecture on hypercubes and, more interestingly, gives a sequence of connected graphs for which the ratio $\frac{\gamma_b(G)}{\operatorname{mp}(G)}$ approaches $2$, a search for which was initiated by Beaudou, Brewster and Foucaud in 2018. It follows that, for connected graphs $G$ $$
  \limsup_{\operatorname{mp}(G) \rightarrow \infty} \left\{\frac{\gamma_b(G)}{\operatorname{mp}(G)}\right\} = 2.$$
  The lower bound on $\operatorname{mp}(Q_n)$ is established by a recursive construction, and the upper bound is established using a classic result from discrepancy theory.</description>

      <title>Some exact inducibility-type results for graphs via flag algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01596v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $(\kappa,\ell)$-edge-inducibility problem asks for the maximum number of $\kappa$-subsets inducing exactly $\ell$ edges that a graph of given order $n$ can have. Using flag algebras and stability approach, we resolve this problem for all sufficiently large $n$ (including a description of all extremal and almost extremal graphs) in eleven new non-trivial cases when $\kappa\le 7$.
  We also compute the $F$-inducibility constant (the asymptotically maximum density of induced copies of $F$ in a graph of given order $n$) and obtain some corresponding structure results for three new graphs $F$ with $5$ vertices: the 3-edge star plus an isolated vertex, the 4-cycle plus an isolated vertex, and the 4-cycle with a pendant edge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotary maps (orientably regular maps) are highly symmetric graph embeddings on orientable surfaces. This paper classifies all rotary maps whose underlying graphs are Praeger-Xu graphs, denoted $\operatorname{C}(p,r,s)$, for any odd prime $p$ that does not divide $r$. Our main result establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the isomorphism classes of these maps and the multiplicity-free representations of the dihedral group $\operatorname{D}_{2r}$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$. This work extends a recent classification for the case where $p=2$.</description>

      <title>On the Visibility Polynomial of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G(V,E) be a simple graph and let X subset of V. Two vertices u and v are said to be X-visible if there exists a shortest u,v-path P such that V(P) intersection X is a subset of {u, v}. A set X is called a mutual-visibility set of G if every pair of vertices in X are X-visible. The visibility polynomial of a graph G is defined as nu (G)=sum_{i &gt;= 0} r_i x^i, where r_i denotes the number of mutual-visibility sets in G of cardinality i. In the present paper, the visibility polynomial is studied for some well-known classes of graphs. In particular, the instance at which the number of maximal mutual-visibility sets is equal for cycle graphs is identified. The visibility polynomial of the join of two graphs is studied. The algorithm for computing the visibility polynomial of a graph has been identified to have a time complexity of O(n^3.2^n) making the problem computationally intensive for larger graphs.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis Of Heuristic and Approximation Algorithms for the The Mutual-Visibility Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The NP-complete mutual-visibility (MV) problem currently lacks empirical analysis on its practical behaviour despite theoretical studies. This paper addresses this gap by implementing and evaluating three distinct algorithms - a direct greedy heuristic, a hypergraph-based approximation, and a genetic algorithm - on diverse synthetic graph datasets, including those with analytically known $\mu(G)$ values and general graph models. Our results demonstrate that for smaller graphs, the algorithms consistently achieve MV set sizes aligning with theoretical bounds. However, for larger instances, achieved solution sizes notably diverge from theoretical limits; this, combined with the absence of tight bounds, complicates absolute quality assessment. Nevertheless, validation on known optimal graphs showed the Genetic Algorithm and other heuristics empirically performing best among tested methods.</description>

Abstract: Let $\eta_w$ be the quantum twist automorphism for the quantum unipotent coordinate ring $\mathrm{A}_q(\mathfrak{n}(w))$ introduced by Kimura and Oya. In this paper, we study the quantum twist automorphism $\eta_w$ in the viewpoint of the crystal bases theory and provide a crystal-theoretic description of $\eta_w$. In the case of the $*$-twisted minuscule crystals of classical finite types, we provide a combinatorial description of $\eta_w$ in terms of (shifted) Young diagrams. We further investigate the periodicity of $\eta_w$ up to a multiple of frozen variables in various setting.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies two classical inequalities, namely the Hausdorff-Young inequality and equal-exponent Young's convolution inequality, for discrete functions supported in the binary cube $\{0,1\}^d\subset\mathbb{Z}^d$. We characterize the exact ranges of Lebesgue exponents in which sharp versions of these two inequalities hold, and present several immediate consequences. First, if the functions are specialized to be the indicator of some set $A\subseteq\{0,1\}^d$, then we obtain sharp upper bounds on two types of generalized additive energies of $A$, extending the works of Kane-Tao, de Dios Pont-Greenfeld-Ivanisvili-Madrid, and one of the present authors. Second, we obtain a sharp binary variant of the Beckner-Hirschman entropic uncertainty principle, as well as a sharp lower estimate on the entropy of a sum of two independent random variables with values in $\{0,1\}^d$. Finally, the sharp binary Hausdorff-Young inequality also reveals the exact range of dimension-free estimates for the Fourier restriction to the binary cube.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on the uncolored versions of the original CFI-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CFI-graphs, named after Cai, F\"urer, and Immerman, are central to the study of the graph isomorphism testing and of first-order logic with counting. They are colored graphs, and the coloring plays a role in many of their applications. As usual, it is not hard to remove the coloring by some extra graph gadgets, but at the cost of blowing up the size of the graphs and changing some parameters of them as well. This might lead to suboptimal combinatorial bounds important to their applications. Since then for some uncolored variants of the CFI-graphs it has been shown that they serve the same purposes. We show that this already applies to the graphs obtained from the original CFI-graphs by forgetting the colors. Moreover, we will see that there is a first-order formula $\varphi(x,y)$ expressing in almost all uncolored CFI-graphs that $x$ and $y$ have the same color in the corresponding colored graphs.</description>

      <title>Adjoints of Polytopes: Determinantal Representations and Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we study determinantal representations of adjoint hypersurfaces of polytopes. We prove that adjoint polynomials of all polygons can be represented as determinants of tridiagonal symmetric matrices of linear forms with the matrix size being equal to the degree of the adjoint. We prove a sufficient combinatorial condition for a surface in the projective three-space to have a determinantal representation and use it to show that adjoints of all three-dimensional polytopes with at most eight facets and a simple facet hyperplane arrangement admit a determinantal representation. This includes all such polytopes with a smooth adjoint. We demonstrate that, starting from four dimensions, adjoint hypersurfaces may not admit linear determinantal representations. Along the way we prove that, starting from three dimensions, adjoint hypersurfaces are typically singular, in contrast to the two-dimensional case. We also consider a special case of interest to physics, the ABHY associahedron. We construct a determinantal representation of its universal adjoint in three dimensions and show that in higher dimensions a similarly structured representation does not exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.06891v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $d \ge 2$, we show that all graphs of $d$-polytopes have a Hamiltonian line graph if and only if $d \ne 3$: We exhibit a graph of a $3$-polytope on $252$ vertices whose line graph does not even have Hamiltonian paths. Adapting a construction by Gr\"unbaum and Motzkin, for large $n$ we also construct simple $3$-polytopes on $3n$ vertices in whose line graph any simple path is shorter than $10 n^{\alpha}$, for some constant $\alpha&lt;1$. Moreover, we give four elementary counterexamples of plausible extensions to simplicial complexes of four famous results in Hamiltonian graph theory.</description>

      <title>Quasi-period collapse in half-integral polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A half-integral polygon with quasi-period collapse behaves similarly to a lattice polygon in the sense that the number of lattice points in its integer dilates can be calculated as values of a polynomial, its Ehrhart polynomial. As a main result, we classify the Ehrhart polynomials of all half-integral non-lattice polygons with quasi-period collapse. In particular, we obtain that for any positive integer $i$, the polynomial $\frac{4i+5}{2}t^2+\frac{2i+7}{2}t+1\in \mathbb{Q}[t]$ is an Ehrhart polynomial of a rational polygon, which was an open question for $i&gt;1$.
  We also study some extreme cases in detail. In particular, we show that up to affine unimodular equivalence there exist exactly $30$ half-integral non-lattice polygons with quasi-periodic collapse with exactly one interior lattice point, which are the dual polygons of the $30$ LDP polygons of Gorenstein index $2$. Furthermore, we classify all half-integral polygons with quasi-period collapse with at most $6$ interior lattice points or with $i\geq 1$ interior lattice points and the maximum possible number $2i+7$ of boundary lattice points.</description>

      <title>On $k$-uniform tight cycles: the Ramsey number for $C_{kn}^{(k)}$ and an approximate Lehel's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $k$-uniform tight cycle is a $k$-graph with a cyclic ordering of its vertices such that its edges are precisely the sets of $k$ consecutive vertices in that ordering. We show that, for each $k \geq 3$, the Ramsey number of the $k$-uniform tight cycle on $kn$ vertices is $(1+o(1))(k+1)n$. This is an extension to all uniformities of previous results for $k = 3$ by Haxell, {\L}uczak, Peng, R\"odl, Ruci\'nski, and Skokan and for $k = 4$ by Lo and the author and confirms a special case of a conjecture by the former set of authors.
  Lehel's conjecture, which was proved by Bessy and Thomass\'e, states that every red-blue edge-coloured complete graph contains a red cycle and a blue cycle that are vertex-disjoint and together cover all the vertices. We also prove an approximate version of this for $k$-uniform tight cycles. We show that, for every $k \geq 3$, every red-blue edge-coloured complete $k$-graph on $n$ vertices contains a red tight cycle and a blue tight cycle that are vertex-disjoint and together cover $n - o(n)$ vertices.</description>

Abstract: The magic positivity of Ehrhart polynomials is a useful tool for proving the real-rootedness of the $h^\ast$-polynomials. In this paper, we provide a new class of reflexive polytopes whose Ehrhart polynomials are magic positive. First, we prove that the Ehrhart polynomials of Stasheff polytopes are magic positive. Second, we provide a partial proof of the magic positivity of the Ehrhart polynomials of the dual polytopes of the symmetric edge polytopes of cycles.</description>

      <title>Generation of Cycle Permutation Graphs and Permutation Snarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12606v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for the efficient generation of all pairwise non-isomorphic cycle permutation graphs, i.e. cubic graphs with a $2$-factor consisting of two chordless cycles, non-hamiltonian cycle permutation graphs and permutation snarks, i.e. cycle permutation graphs that do not admit a $3$-edge-colouring. This allows us to generate all cycle permutation graphs up to order $34$ and all permutation snarks up to order $46$, improving upon previous computational results by Brinkmann et al. Moreover, we give several improved lower bounds for interesting permutation snarks, such as for a smallest permutation snark of order $6 \bmod 8$ or a smallest permutation snark of girth at least $6$ and give more evidence in support of a conjecture of Goddyn. These computational results also allow us to complete a characterisation of the orders for which non-hamiltonian cycle permutation graphs exist, answering an open question by Klee from 1972, and yield many more counterexamples to conjectures by Jackson and Zhang.</description>

      <title>A signless Laplacian spectral Erd\"os-Stone-Simonovits theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Erd\H{o}s--Stone--Simonovits theorem states that $\mathrm{ex}(n,F)= \big(1-\frac{1}{\chi(F)-1}+o(1) \big)\frac{n^{2}}{2}$, where $\chi(F)$ is the chromatic number of $F$. In 2009, Nikiforov proved a spectral extension of the Erd\H{o}s--Stone--Simonovits theorem in terms of the adjacency spectral radius. In this paper, we shall establish a unified extension in terms of the signless Laplacian spectral radius. Let $q(G)$ be the signless Laplacian spectral radius of $G$ and we denote $\mathrm{ex}_{q}(n,F) =\max \{q(G):|G|=n ~\mbox{and}~F\nsubseteq G\}$. It is known that the Erd\H{o}s--Stone--Simonovits type result for the signless Laplacian spectral radius does not hold for even cycles. We prove that if $F$ is a graph with $\chi(F)\geq 3$, then $\mathrm{ex}_{q}(n,F)=\big(1-\frac{1}{\chi(F)-1}+o(1) \big)2n$. This solves a problem proposed by Li, Liu and Feng (2022), which gives an entirely satisfactory answer to the problem of estimating $\mathrm{ex}_q(n,F)$. Furthermore, it extends the aforementioned result of Erd\H{o}s, Stone and Simonovits as well as the spectral result of Nikiforov. Our result indicates that the Erd\H{o}s--Stone--Simonovits type result regarding the signless Laplacian spectral radius is valid in general.</description>

Abstract: In 2010, Bre\v{s}ar, Klav\v{z}ar and Rall introduced the optimization variant of the graph domination game and the game domination number. In 2024, Leo Versteegen obtained the celebrated proof of the Conjecture $\frac{3}{5}$ on this variant of the domination game, proposed by Kinnersley, West and Zamani in 2013. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the normal play of the domination game, which we call \textsc{Normal Domination Game}, that is an impartial game where the last to play wins. We first prove that this game is PSPACE-complete even in graphs with diameter two. We also use the Sprague-Grundy theory to prove that Alice (the first player) wins in the path $P_n$ if and only if $n$ is not a multiple of $4$, and wins in the cycle $C_n$ if and only if $n=4k+3$ for some integer $k$. Finally, we obtain a polynomial time algorithm to decide the winner for any disjoint union of paths and cycles in the \textsc{Normal Domination Game} and its natural partizan variant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph property is elusive (or evasive) if any algorithm testing it by asking questions of the form ''Is there an edge between vertices x and y?'' must, in the worst case, examine all pairs of vertices. Elusiveness for infinite vertex sets has been first studied by Csern\'ak and Soukup, who proved that the long-standing Aanderaa-Karp-Rosenberg Conjecture -- which states that every nontrivial monotone graph property is elusive -- fails for infinite vertex sets. We extend their work by giving a closer look to the case when the vertex set is countably infinite and the ''algorithm'' terminates after infinitely many steps. Among others, we prove that connectedness is elusive, which strengthens a result of Csern\'ak and Soukup. We give counterexamples to the infinite version of the Aanderaa-Karp-Rosenberg Conjecture even if the ''algorithm'' is required to terminate after infinitely many steps, which strengthens results of Csern\'ak and Soukup.</description>

Abstract: A graph $G$ is called $k$-factor-critical if $G-S$ has a perfect matching for every $S\subseteq G$ with $|S|=k$. A connected graph $G$ is called $t$-connected if it has more than $t$ vertices and remains connected whenever fewer than $t$ vertices are removed. We give a condition on the number of edges and a condition on the spectral radius for $k$-factor-criticality in $t$-connected graphs.</description>

      <title>An example showing that Schrijver's $\vartheta$-function need not upper bound the Shannon capacity of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter addresses an open question concerning a variant of the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$ function, which was introduced by Schrijver and independently by McEliece et al. (1978). The question of whether this variant provides an upper bound on the Shannon capacity of a graph was explicitly stated by Bi and Tang (2019). This letter presents an explicit example of a Tanner graph on 32 vertices, which shows that, in contrast to the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$ function, this variant does not necessarily upper bound the Shannon capacity of a graph. The example, previously outlined by the author in a recent paper (2024), is presented here in full detail, making it easy to follow and verify. By resolving this question, the note clarifies a subtle but significant distinction between these two closely related graph invariants.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every toric monoid appears in a space of maps from tropical curves to an orthant. It follows that spaces of logarithmic maps to Artin fans exhibit arbitrary toric singularities: a virtual universality theorem for logarithmic maps to pairs. The target rank depends on the chosen singularity: we show that the cone over the 7-gon never appears in a space of maps to a rank 1 target. We obtain similar results for tropical maps to affine space.</description>

As an application, we obtain sharp area bounds for rational polygons with a fixed number of interior integral points depending on their denominator.

Abstract: We present an algorithm for finding a perfect matching in a $3$-edge-connected cubic graph that intersects every $3$-edge cut in exactly one edge. Specifically, we propose an algorithm with a time complexity of $O(n \log^4 n)$, which significantly improves upon the previously known $O(n^3)$-time algorithms for the same problem. The technique we use for the improvement is efficient use of cactus model of 3-edge cuts. As an application, we use our algorithm to compute embeddings of $3$-edge-connected cubic graphs with limited number of singular edges (i.e., edges that are twice in the boundary of one face) in $O(n \log^4 n)$ time; this application contributes to the study of the well-known Cycle Double Cover conjecture.</description>

      <title>Cops and Robbers for Graphs on Surfaces with Crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13813</link>

Abstract: Cops and Robbers is a game played on a graph where a set of cops attempt to capture a single robber. The game proceeds in rounds, where each round first consists of the cops' turn, followed by the robber's turn. In the cops' turn, every cop can choose to either stay on the same vertex or move to an adjacent vertex, and likewise the robber in his turn. The robber is considered to be captured if, at any point in time, there is some cop on the same vertex as the robber. A natural question in this game concerns the cop-number of a graph -- the minimum number of cops needed to capture the robber. It has long been known that graphs embeddable (without crossings) on surfaces of bounded genus have bounded cop-number. In contrast, the class of 1-planar graphs -- graphs that can be drawn on the plane with at most one crossing per edge -- does not have bounded cop-number. This paper initiates an investigation into how distance between crossing pairs of edges influences a graph's cop number. In particular, we look at Distance $d$ Cops and Robbers, a variant of the classical game, where the robber is considered to be captured if there is a cop within distance $d$ of the robber. Let $c_d(G)$ denote the minimum number of cops required in the graph $G$ to capture a robber within distance $d$. We look at various classes of graphs, such as 1-plane graphs, $k$-plane graphs (graphs where each edge is crossed at most $k$ times), and even general graph drawings, and show that if every crossing pair of edges can be connected by a path of small length, then $c_d(G)$ is bounded, for small values of $d$.</description>
