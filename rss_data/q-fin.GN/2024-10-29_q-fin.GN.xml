      <title>Tourism destination events classifier based on artificial intelligence techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying client needs to provide optimal services is crucial in tourist destination management. The events held in tourist destinations may help to meet those needs and thus contribute to tourist satisfaction. As with product management, the creation of hierarchical catalogs to classify those events can aid event management. The events that can be found on the internet are listed in dispersed, heterogeneous sources, which makes direct classification a difficult, time-consuming task. The main aim of this work is to create a novel process for automatically classifying an eclectic variety of tourist events using a hierarchical taxonomy, which can be applied to support tourist destination management. Leveraging data science methods such as CRISP-DM, supervised machine learning, and natural language processing techniques, the automatic classification process proposed here allows the creation of a normalized catalog across very different geographical regions. Therefore, we can build catalogs with consistent filters, allowing users to find events regardless of the event categories assigned at source, if any. This is very valuable for companies that offer this kind of information across multiple regions, such as airlines, travel agencies or hotel chains. Ultimately, this tool has the potential to revolutionize the way companies and end users interact with tourist events information.</description>

      <title>On the limits of informationally efficient stock markets: New insights from a chartist-fundamentalist model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize a chartist-fundamentalist model to examine the limits of informationally efficient stock markets. In our model, chartists are permanently active in the stock market, while fundamentalists trade only when their mispricing-dependent trading signals are strong. Our findings indicate the possible coexistence of two distinct regimes. Depending on the initial conditions, the stock market may exhibit either constant or oscillatory mispricing. Constant mispricing occurs when chartists remain the sole active speculators, causing the stock price to converge toward a nonfundamental value. Conversely, the stock price oscillates around its fundamental value when fundamentalists repeatedly enter and exit the market. Exogenous shocks result in intricate regime-switching dynamics.</description>
