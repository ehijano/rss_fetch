      <title>Using Frame Randomization to Mitigate Errors in Quantum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Error mitigation is essential for near-term quantum devices, and one promising technique is frame randomization. This method inserts random twirling gates into a circuit to reduce errors while preserving unitarity and depth. We apply frame randomization to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with $p=1$ on a superconducting quantum circuit system, demonstrating its potential to improve energy calculations. Specifically, we investigate the use of QAOA to calculate the lowest energy state of a frustrated Ising ring system and compare the results of randomized circuits generated using two different randomized techniques. Our results show that both methods can mitigate errors, with expected extremal energy values of $5.25\pm0.145$ and $4.08\pm0.36$, for Randomized Compilation and Pauli frame randomization respectively, compared to $2.63\pm0.068$ without randomization and $5.676\pm0.006$ with a noiseless simulator.</description>

      <title>Time-Incremented Multiscale Evolution (TIME): A Code-Independent Method for Time-Domain 3D Hydrodynamics and its Application to Roche Lobe Overflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Many critical physical processes, such as Roche lobe overflow, strain modern simulation methods due to their durations and multidimensionality. Aims. We employ a novel method of time-domain multidimensional simulations to provide the first grid-based time domain 3D model of Roche lobe overflow using VH-1. Methods. Using a piecewise approach which alternates between high-resolution 3D dynamic modeling and computationally fast evolutionary modeling, we present and test a method capable of self-scaling variable time resolution at greatly reduced computational cost. Results. We find mass transfer in the test high mass x-ray binary M33 X-7 to be unstable and fully conservative in both mass and angular momentum transport onto the accretion disk beyond f &gt;~ 1.01. This phase begins on thermal timescales and accelerates to span &lt; 100 yrs beyond f &gt;= 1.1, while the non-conservative stable phase of f &lt;~ 1.01 occurs on roughly nuclear timescales. Conclusions. We identify a critical point f ~ 1.01 which terminates stable overflow, which may correspond to the point Mdot_L1 ~ Mdot_wind or Mdot_L1 ~ 10^-6 M_solar/yr in the general case.</description>

      <title>Stoquasticity is not enough: towards a sharper diagnostic for Quantum Monte Carlo simulability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are powerful tools for simulating quantum many-body systems, yet their applicability is limited by the infamous sign problem. We approach this challenge through the lens of Vanishing Geometric Phases (VGP) \cite{Hen_2021}, introducing it as a `geometric' criterion for diagnosing QMC simulability. We characterize the class of VGP Hamiltonians, and analyze the complexity of recognizing this class, identifying both hard and efficiently identifiable cases. We further highlight the practical advantage of the VGP criterion by exhibiting specific Hamiltonians that are readily identified as sign-problem-free through VGP, yet whose stoquasticity is difficult to ascertain. These examples underscore the efficiency and sharpness of VGP as a diagnostic tool compared to stoquasticity-based heuristics. Beyond classification, we propose a family of VGP-inspired diagnostics that serve as quantitative indicators of sign problem severity. While exact evaluation of these quantities is generically intractable, we demonstrate their mathematical power in performing scaling analysis for the average sign under unitary transformations. Our results provide both a conceptual foundation and practical tools for understanding and mitigating the sign problem.</description>

      <title>Electron charge dynamics and charge separation: A response theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study applies response theory to investigate electron charge dynamics, with a particular focus on charge separation. We analytically assess the strengths and limitations of linear and quadratic response theories in describing charge density and current, illustrated by a model that simulates charge transfer systems. While linear response accurately captures optical properties, the quadratic response contains the minimal ingredients required to describe charge dynamics and separation. Notably, it closely matches exact time propagation results in some regime that we identify. We propose and test several approximations to the quadratic response and explore the influence of higher-order terms and the effect of an on-site interaction $U$.</description>

      <title>A practical route to donor binding energies: The DFT-1/2 method for shallow defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately calculating the binding energies of shallow defects requires large supercells to capture the extended nature of their wavefunctions. This makes many beyond-DFT methods, such as hybrid functionals, impractical for direct calculations, often requiring indirect or approximate approaches. However, standard DFT alone fails to provide reliable results due to the well-known band gap underestimation and delocalization errors. In this work, we employ the DFT-1/2 method to address these deficiencies while maintaining computational efficiency allowing us to reach supercells of up to 4096 atoms. We develop a practical procedure for applying DFT-1/2 to shallow defects and demonstrate its effectiveness for group V donors in silicon (P, As, Sb, Bi). By using an extrapolation scheme to infinite supercell size, we obtain accurate binding energies with minimal computational overhead. This approach offers a simple and direct method for calculating donor binding energies.</description>

      <title>A SIMPLE-Based Preconditioned Solver for the Direct-Forcing Immersed Boundary Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a robust and scalable solver for direct-forcing immersed boundary simulations, based on a preconditioned SIMPLE algorithm. The method applies block elimination to the pressure-force coupled system, and utilizes the discrete Laplacian operator as an efficient preconditioner for the resulting Schur complement. We rigorously demonstrate the spectral equivalence between the Schur complement and the discrete Laplacian, ensuring convergence behavior that is independent of grid resolution and physical parameters. This enables accurate, stable, and efficient two-way coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations with moving boundaries and significant added-mass effects. These simulations are all executable on standard computing platforms. Extensive validation and verification - including simulations of oscillating, sedimenting, and buoyant spheres, as well as configurations involving multiple immersed bodies - confirm the solver's accuracy and efficiency across a broad range of FSI scenarios. The proposed approach introduces a novel and accessible framework for immersed boundary simulations requiring strong pressure-force coupling.</description>

      <title>Bridging classical and quantum interpretation of chemical state analysis by XPS/HAXPES to resolve short-range order in amorphous alumina films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing the local structure and chemistry of wide-bandgap amorphous oxide thin films remains challenging due to the limitations of lab-based spectroscopy. This work integrates X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES), molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learning interatomic potentials, density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, and classical electrostatic modeling of final-state core-ionization effects in Al atoms to uncover the structure and chemistry of amorphous alumina polymorphs made with atomic layer deposition (ALD). DFT calculations using the Delta Kohn-Sham method supported the interpretation of final-state effects and validated electrostatic model assumptions. Shifts in the measured Auger parameter were interpreted as extra-atomic relaxation energies, revealing sensitivity to the local coordination environment. Structural disorder and thermal fluctuations were found to govern the distribution of extra-atomic relaxation energies, suggesting that cryo-XPS can isolate and reveal intrinsic structural building blocks of amorphous oxides. Simulated heating and annealing demonstrated that Auger parameter shifts can serve as indicators of phase decomposition in H-supersaturated ALD amorphous alumina. These findings provide a pathway for comprehensive interpretation and predictive modeling of XPS spectra in amorphous wide-bandgap oxides.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure prediction of medium and high entropy alloys across composition space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose machine learning (ML) models to predict the electron density -- the fundamental unknown of a material's ground state -- across the composition space of concentrated alloys. From this, other physical properties can be inferred, enabling accelerated exploration. A significant challenge is that the number of sampled compositions and descriptors required to accurately predict fields like the electron density increases rapidly with species. To address this, we employ Bayesian Active Learning (AL), which minimizes training data requirements by leveraging uncertainty quantification capabilities of Bayesian Neural Networks. Compared to strategic tessellation of the composition space, Bayesian-AL reduces the number of training data points by a factor of 2.5 for ternary (SiGeSn) and 1.7 for quaternary (CrFeCoNi) systems. We also introduce easy-to-optimize, body-attached-frame descriptors, which respect physical symmetries and maintain approximately the same descriptor-vector size as alloy elements increase. Our ML models demonstrate high accuracy and generalizability in predicting both electron density and energy across composition space.</description>

      <title>Interpolatory dynamical low-rank approximation for the 3+3d Boltzmann-BGK equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two novel interpolatory dynamical low-rank (DLR) approximation methods for the efficient time integration of the Boltzmann-BGK equation. Both methods overcome limitations of classic DLR schemes based on orthogonal projections for nonlinear equations. In particular, we demonstrate that the proposed methods can efficiently compute solutions to the full Boltzmann-BGK equation without restricting to e.g. weakly compressible or isothermal flow. The first method we propose directly applies the recently developed interpolatory projector-splitting scheme on low-rank matrix manifolds. The second method is a variant of the rank-adaptive basis update and Galerkin scheme, where the Galerkin step is replaced by a collocation step, resulting in a new scheme we call basis update and collocate (BUC). Numerical experiments in both fluid and kinetic regimes demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods. In particular we demonstrate that the methods can be used to efficiently compute low-rank solutions in the six-dimensional (three spatial and three velocity dimensions) setting on a standard laptop.</description>
