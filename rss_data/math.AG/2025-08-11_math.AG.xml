      <title>The modified diagonal cycles of Hypergeometric curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each $N\geq 2$, Asakura and Otsubo have recently introduced a smooth family of algebraic curves $\{X_{N,\lambda}\}_{\lambda \in \mathbb{P}^1\setminus \{0, 1, \infty\}}$ in characteristic 0 that is closely related to hypergeometric functions and the Fermat curve of degree $N$. In this paper, we study the Gross-Kudla-Schoen modified diagonal 1-cycles of these curves. We prove that if $p \ge 3$ is a prime, then for every $\lambda$ the Griffiths Abel-Jacobi image of the modified diagonal cycle of $X_{p,\lambda}$ is nontrivial for every cuspidal choice of a base point. On the other hand, we show that the modified diagonal cycle and hence the Ceresa cycle of $X_{3,\lambda}$ is torsion in the Chow group for every $\lambda$ and every choice of a base point.</description>

      <title>Transversality Methods for Homotopy Groups of Stable Loci in Affine GIT Quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the homotopy groups of stable loci in affine Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT), arising from linear actions of complex reductive algebraic groups on complex affine spaces. Our approach extends the infinite-dimensional transversality framework of Daskalopoulos-Uhlenbeck and Wilkin to this general GIT setting. Central to our method is the construction of a G-equivariant holomorphic vector bundle over the conjugation orbit of a one-parameter subgroup (1-PS), whose fibres are precisely the negative weight spaces determining instability. A key proposition establishes that a naturally defined evaluation map is transverse to the zero section of this bundle, implying that generic homotopies avoid all unstable and strictly semistable strata under certain dimensional inequalities.
  Our result also covers cases where semistability does not coincide with stability. The applicability of this framework is illustrated by several examples. For the 2-Kronecker quiver, our conclusions precisely match the known topology of the stable locus. In linear control theory, where GIT stability corresponds to the notion of controllability, our results determine the connectivity of the space of controllable systems. In statistical modelling, where stability for star-shaped Gaussian model corresponds to the existence of a unique Maximum Likelihood Estimate, we compute the connectivity of the space of data samples that yield such a unique estimate, providing topological insight into the problem of parameter non-identifiability.</description>

      <title>Simple complexes on a flopped curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying crepant blow-ups of (compound) du Val singularities, we classify complexes of coherent sheaves which admit no negative self-extensions -- such a complex, up to flops and mutation equivalences, must either be (1) a module over a derived-equivalent algebra, or (2) a two-term extension of a coherent sheaf by skyscraper sheaves, or (3) a direct sum of shifts of skyscrapers. This translates into classifications of bricks, spherical objects, stability conditions, and algebraic t-structures in the local derived category; the lists populated by the homological minimal programme turn out exhaustive. We deduce that the Bridgeland stability manifold is connected, and that all basic tilting complexes on the variety (equivalently on the g-tame algebras derived-equivalent to it) are related by shifts and iterated mutation.</description>

      <title>The gonality of circulant graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gonality of a graph measures how difficult it is to move chips around the entirety of a graph according to certain chip-firing rules without introducing debt. In this paper we study the gonality of circulant graphs, a class of vertex-transitive graphs that can be specified by their number of vertices together with a list of cyclic adjacency relations satisfied by all vertices. We provide a universal upper bound on the gonality of all circulant graphs with a fixed adjacency list, which holds irrespective of the number of vertices. We use this upper bound together with computational methods to determine that the gonality of the \(4\)-regular Harary graph on \(n\) vertices is \(10\) for \(n\geq 16\). As a special case, this gives the gonality of sufficiently large antiprism graphs to be \(10\).</description>

      <title>Identifiability of Large Phylogenetic Mixtures for Many Phylogenetic Model Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifiability of phylogenetic models is a necessary condition to ensure that the model parameters can be uniquely determined from data. Mixture models are phylogenetic models where the probability distributions in the model are convex combinations of distributions in simpler phylogenetic models. Mixture models are used to model heterogeneity in the substitution process in DNA sequences. While many basic phylogenetic models are known to be identifiable, mixture models in generality have only been shown to be identifiable in certain cases. We expand the main theorem of [Rhodes, Sullivant 2012] to prove identifiability of mixture models in equivariant phylogenetic models, specifically the Jukes-Cantor, Kimura 2-parameter model, Kimura 3-parameter model and the Strand Symmetric model.</description>

      <title>A refined twist on Hurwitz numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter refinement of the Jucys-Murphy theory, that we call the CJT-refinement, unifying Schur, zonal, and, conjecturally, Jack actions of the ring of symmetric functions on the Fock space. Applications of this formalism include a partial resolution of a recent conjecture of Coulter-Do, as well as cut-and-join recursion for $b$-Hurwitz numbers. The cut-and-join equations enable the derivation of the tropicalization of $b$--Hurwitz numbers. We also provide a first application of this tropical interpretation by answering an open problem of Chapuy-Do{\l}\k{e}ga on the polynomial structure of $b$-Hurwitz numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare a couple of notions of differential form on singular complex algebraic varieties, and relate them to the outermost associated graded spaces of the Hodge filtration of ordinary and intersection cohomology. In particular, we introduce and study singularities, that we call quasi-rational, which are normal and such that for all p, the zeroth cohomology sheaf of the complex of Du Bois p-forms is isomorphic to the direct image of p-forms from a desingularization. We show that an isolated singularity is rational if and only if it is quasi-rational, Du Bois, and certain Hodge numbers of the local mixed Hodge structures vanish.</description>

      <title>Matroids and the integral Hodge conjecture for abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the cohomology class of any curve on a very general principally polarized abelian variety of dimension at least 4 is an even multiple of the minimal class. The same holds for the intermediate Jacobian of a very general cubic threefold. This disproves the integral Hodge conjecture for abelian varieties and shows that very general cubic threefolds are not stably rational. Our proof is motivated by tropical geometry; it relies on multivariable Mumford constructions, monodromy considerations, and the combinatorial theory of matroids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a sufficient Fourier-criterion for a $C^{1+\epsilon}$-hypersurface in the $n$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^n$ to be the zero set of a (Lee--Yang) polynomial. The criterion can be stated using a notion recently introduced by Yves Meyer: a positive Radon measure $m$ on $\mathbb{T}^n$ is a lighthouse measure if $\mathrm{supp}(m)$ has zero Lebesgue measure and $\mathrm{supp}(\widehat{m})$ is contained in a proper double cone. Our proof relies on the classification of one-dimensional Fourier quasicrystals and adds a geometric interpretation.</description>

      <title>Automorphism groups and cylindricity of weighted hypersurface Fano threefolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that there are totally 130 deformation families of quasi-smooth terminal weighted hypersurface Fano threefolds and all members belonging to 95 families of Fano indices one are birationally rigid. Among remaining $35$ families, $15$ families have the property that general members are irrational, in particular, any of them has a finite automorphism group and is not cylindrical. In the present paper, we will observe the cylindricity and the full automorphism groups of every member in the remaining $20$ families. Moreover, we deal with the cylindricity of their forms.</description>

      <title>A minimal resolution for the Jacobian ideal of a generic curve arrangement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a nodal curve $C$ in the complex projective plane whose irreducible components $C_i$ are smooth. A minimal set of generators $G$ for the first and second syzygy modules of the Jacobian ideal of $C$ are described, using recent results by Th. Kahle, H. Schenck, B. Sturmfels and M. Wiesmann on the likelihood correspondence. The elements of $G$ have explicit formulas in terms of the equations $f_i=0$ of the irreducible components $C_i$ of $C$. Similar results, including extensions to hypersurfaces arrangements in $\mathbb{P}^n$ were obtained by R. Burity, Z. Ramos, A. Simis and St. Toh\u aneanu with a genericity assumption which may not be easy to test in practice.</description>

      <title>Affine Springer fibers and depth zero L-packets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.13123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a field $F=\mathbb{F}_q((t))$ splitting over $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q((t))$. Following [KV,DR], a tamely unramified Langlands parameter $\lambda:W_F\to{}^L G(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_{\ell})$ in general position gives rise to a finite set $\Pi_{\lambda}$ of irreducible admissible representations of $G(F)$, called the $L$-packet.
  The main goal of this work is to provide a geometric description of characters $\chi_{\pi}$ of $\pi\in\Pi_{\lambda}$ and of their endoscopic linear combinations $\chi_{\lambda}^{\kappa}$ in terms of homology of affine Springer fibers, thus establishing an analog of Lusztig conjectures in this case. Furthermore, each $\chi_{\lambda}^{\kappa}$ can be described as the trace of Frobenius function of a conjugation equivariant perverse sheaf on the loop group by the sheaf-function correspondence.
  As another application, we prove that the sum $\chi_{\lambda}^{st}:=\sum_{\pi\in\Pi_{\lambda}}\chi_{\pi}$ is stable and show that the $\chi_{\lambda}^{st}$'s are compatible with inner twistings. More generally, we prove that each $\chi_{\lambda}^{\kappa}$ is $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda,\kappa}$-stable.</description>

      <title>Support theories for non-Noetherian tensor triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the support theory of Benson--Iyengar--Krause to the non-Noetherian setting by introducing a new notion of small support for modules. This enables us to prove that the stable module category of a finite group is canonically stratified by the action of the Tate cohomology ring, despite the fact that this ring is rarely Noetherian. In the tensor triangular context, we compare the support theory proposed by W. Sanders (which extends the Balmer--Favi support theory beyond the weakly Noetherian setting) with our generalized BIK support theory. When the Balmer spectrum is homeomorphic to the Zariski spectrum of the endomorphism ring of the unit, the two support theories coincide as do their associated theories of stratification. We also prove a negative result which states that the Balmer--Favi--Sanders support theory can only stratify categories whose spectra are weakly Noetherian. This provides additional justification for the weakly Noetherian hypothesis in the work of Barthel, Heard and B. Sanders. On the other hand, the detection property and the local-to-global principle remain interesting in the general setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we first study regular $\mathbb{Z}$-graded local rings. We characterize commutative noetherian regular $\mathbb{Z}$-graded local rings in similar ways as in the usual local case. Then, we characterize graded isolated singularity for a commutative $\mathbb{Z}$-graded semilocal algebra in terms of the global dimension of its associated noncommutative projective scheme. As a corollary, we obtain that a commutative affine $\mathbb{N}$-graded algebra generated in degree $1$ is a graded isolated singularity if and only if its associated noncommutative projective scheme is smooth; if and only if the category of coherent sheaves on its projective scheme has finite global dimension, which are known in literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show coordinate rings of open Richardson varieties are upper cluster algebras for any symmetrizable Kac--Moody type. We further show the coordinate rings of (generalized) open Richardson varieties on the twisted product of flag varieties are upper cluster algebras for any symmetrizable Kac--Moody type. This includes, as special cases, reduced double Bruhat cells, Bott-Samelson varieties, braid varieties. Our results generalize various results by Casals--Gorsky--Gorsky--Le--Shen--Simental and Galashin--Lam--Sherman-Bennett--Speyer in finite types.</description>
