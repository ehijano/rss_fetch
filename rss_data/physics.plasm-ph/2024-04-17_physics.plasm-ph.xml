      <title>A dispersion function for the regularized kappa distribution function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we define the plasma dispersion function for a suprathermal plasma described with a regularized kappa distribution. As is known from Maxwellian as well as (standard) kappa plasmas, the respective Fried-Conte and the modified plasma dispersion functions are valuable tools for various analytical studies. For the latter is has been proven very useful to know about the mathematical properties, as analytical continuation, series expansions as well as asymptotic expressions. Given the growing popularity of the regularized kappa distribution, as indicated by its increasing number of applications to various problems related to suprathermal plasmas, we extend its theoretical treatment here by providing the corresponding plasma dispersion function along with various of its properties.</description>

      <title>On the two-dimensional Brillouin flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Brillouin flow is a rectilinear, sheared electron fluid flow in a crossed electric field (E) and magnetic field (B), in the E x B direction with zero flow velocity and zero electric field at the surface with which the flow is in contact. It is broadly considered as the equilibrium electron flow in high power crossed-field devices including the magnetron and magnetically insulated transmission line oscillators. This paper provides an examination of Brillouin flow in two dimensions, in a cylindrical geometry where the anode radius changes abruptly at a single axial location while the cathode surface has a constant radius. Our simulation confirms the proof that there is no equilibrium Brillouin flow solution for such a geometry. It further reveals that this change in the anode radius introduces novel bunching of the electrons within the Brillouin hub. This bunching occurs at low frequencies and is very pronounced if the Brillouin flow is from the small gap region to the large gap region, but is minimal if the Brillouin flow is from the large gap region to the small gap region. New insights are provided into the physical processes that initiate and sustain the bunching processes that are unique for a crossed-field diode, as compared with a non-magnetized diode. We argue that this enhanced bunching, and its concomitant formation of strong vortices, is not restricted to an abrupt change in the anode-cathode gap spacing.</description>

      <title>Quantification of locked mode instability triggered by a change in confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the first analysis of the disruptive locked mode (LM) triggered by the dynamics of a confinement change. It shows that, under certain conditions, the LM threshold during the transient is significantly lower than expected from steady states. We investigate the sensitivity to a controlled $n = 1$ error field (EF) activated prior to the L-H transition in the COMPASS tokamak, at $q_{95} \approx 3$, $\beta_N \approx 1$, and using EF coils on the high-field side of the vessel. A threshold for EF penetration subsequent to the L-H transition is identified, which shows no significant trend with density or applied torque, and is an apparent consequence of the reduced intrinsic rotation of the 2/1 mode during this transient phase. This finding challenges the assumption made in theoretical and empirical works that natural mode rotation can be predicted by global plasma parameters and urges against using any parametric EF penetration scaling derived from steady-state experiments to define the error field correction strategy in the entire discharge. Furthermore, even at EFs below the identified penetration threshold, disruptive locking of sawtooth-seeded 2/1 tearing modes is observed after about 30% of L-H transitions without external torque.</description>

      <title>Ion acceleration from micrometric targets immersed in an intense laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an experimental study of proton acceleration by intense laser irradiation of micrometric bar targets, whose dimensions are transversely immersed in the laser focal volume and longitudinally smaller than half its wavelength. Using only 120 mJ of laser energy, we recorded proton energies in excess of 6 MeV, exceeding those reported with any other experimental method by a factor of 3. 3D particle-in-cell simulations revealed that the efficient energy transfer from the diffracted laser fields to electrons on both sides of the target, combined with its reduced surface area, results in a thicker electron sheath and higher accelerating electric field gradients. We demonstrated numerically how this ion acceleration technique opens up the possibility of laser ion acceleration in multiple stages, allowing manipulation of the accelerated ion spectrum by optical means.</description>

      <title>A "lighthouse" laser-driven staged proton accelerator allowing for ultrafast angular and spectral control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact laser-plasma acceleration of fast ions has made great strides since its discovery over two decades ago, resulting in the current generation of high-energy ($\geq 100\,\rm MeV$) ultracold beams over ultrashort ($\leq 1\,\rm ps$) durations. To unlock broader applications of these beams, we need the ability to tailor the ion energy spectrum. Here, we present a scheme that achieves precisely this by accelerating protons in a "lighthouse" fashion, whereby the highest-energy component of the beam is emitted in a narrow cone, well separated from the lower-energy components. This is made possible by a two-stage interaction in which the rear surface of the target is first set into rapid motion before the main acceleration phase. This approach offers the additional advantages of leveraging a robust sheath acceleration process in standard micron-thick targets and being optically controllable.</description>

      <title>Bremsstrahlung Radiation Power in Fusion Plasmas Revisited: Towards Accurate Analytical Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fusion plasmas, where electron temperatures $T_e$ range from keV to hundreds of keV, Bremsstrahlung radiation constitutes a significant energy loss mechanism. While various thermal average fitting formulas exist in the literature, their accuracy is limited, particularly for $T_e \leq 20$ keV with error $&gt;10\%$. Additionally, non-relativistic fitting formulas become invalid for $T_e \geq 50$ keV. The accurate calculation of Bremsstrahlung radiation is important for fusion gain study, especially of advanced fuels fusion. In this work, we develop new but still simple fitting formulas that are valid for electron temperatures ranging from small ($\lesssim0.1$ keV) to extreme relativistic range, with errors of less than 1\% even for high atomic number ions (e.g., $Z=30$), which could be sufficient for fusion plasma applications. Both electron-ion (e-i) and electron-electron (e-e) Bremsstrahlung radiations are considered. Both polynomial fitting with truncated ($t=k_BT_e/m_ec^2\leq10$) and one-fit-all formulas are provided. Additionally, we offer fitting formulas for e-i and e-e specifically for electron energies, which could prove useful in non-Maxwellian Bremsstrahlung radiation studies.</description>

      <title>Ring momentum distributions as a general feature of Vlasov dynamics in the synchrotron dominated regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how radiation reaction leads plasmas initially in kinetic equilibrium to develop features in momentum space, such as anisotropies and population inversion, resulting in a ring-shaped momentum distribution that can drive kinetic instabilities. We employ the Landau-Lifshiftz radiation reaction model for a plasma in a strong magnetic field, and we obtain the necessary condition for the development of population inversion, we show that isotropic Maxwellian and Maxwell-J\"uttner plasmas, with thermal temperature $T&gt;m_e c^2/\sqrt{3}$, will develop a ring-like momentum distribution. The timescales and features for forming ring-shaped momentum distributions, the effect of collisions and non-uniform magnetic fields are disscussed, and compared with typical astrophysical and laboratory plasmas parameters. Our results show the pervasiveness of ring-like momentum distribution functions in synchrotron dominated plasma conditions.</description>

      <title>The Fundamental Parameters of Astrophysical Plasma Turbulence and its Dissipation: Nonrelativistic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A specific set of dimensionless plasma and turbulence parameters is introduced to characterize the nature of turbulence and its dissipation in weakly collisional space and astrophysical plasmas. Key considerations are discussed for the development of predictive models of the turbulent plasma heating that characterize the partitioning of dissipated turbulent energy between the ion and electron species and between the perpendicular and parallel degrees of freedom for each species. Identifying the kinetic physical mechanisms that govern the damping of the turbulent fluctuations is a critical first step in constructing such turbulent heating models. A set of ten general plasma and turbulence parameters are defined, and reasonable approximations along with the exploitation of existing scaling theories for magnetohydrodynamic turbulence are used to reduce this general set of ten parameters to just three parameters in the isotropic temperature case. A critical step forward in this study is to identify the dependence of all of the proposed kinetic mechanisms for turbulent damping in terms of the same set of fundamental plasma and turbulence parameters. Analytical estimations of the scaling of each damping mechanism on these fundamental parameters are presented, and this information is synthesized to produce the first phase diagram for the turbulent damping mechanisms as a function of driving scale and ion plasma beta.</description>
