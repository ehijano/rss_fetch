      <title>Single impurity atom embedded in a dipolar two-soliton molecule as a qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a single impurity atom trapped in a double well (DW) potential created by a dipolar two-soliton molecule in a quasi-one-dimensional geometry. By solving the eigenvalue problem for the impurity atom in the DW potential, we find that its ground and first excited states are well separated from higher excited states. This allows it to be approximated by a desirable two-level quantum system. Numerical simulations of the Schr\"odinger equation, governing impurity atom, demonstrate periodic oscillations in the probability of finding the impurity confined either to the ``left" or to the ``right" side of the DW potential. An analytic expression for the coherent oscillations of the population imbalance between the two wells of the DW potential has been derived using the two-mode approximation. Theoretical predictions of the mathematical model are in good agreement with the results of numerical simulations. Potential usage of the developed setup as a physical realization of ``qubit" has been discussed.</description>

      <title>Pair-breaking as the fundamental limit to persistent-current stabilization in fermionic superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of persistent currents in fermionic superfluids with impurities within the BCS regime by using time-dependent density functional theory. Unlike in Bose-Einstein condensates, we find that current stabilization by impurities is intrinsically limited by the pair-breaking threshold. Below the threshold, impurities enhance winding number stability, but pair-breaking continues to drive dissipation of the flow. Above this critical velocity, superflow destabilizes, emitting vortices. Impurities then govern vortex mobility and pinning, exhibiting regimes of collective pinning and hopping. Moreover, pinned vortices do not guarantee dissipationless flow due to ongoing pair-breaking. Our results identify pair breaking as the fundamental mechanism that sets the ultimate limit of persistent-current stability in fermionic superfluids, providing insights relevant to ultracold Fermi gases and neutron-star matter.</description>

      <title>Thermally Assisted Supersolidity in a Dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersolidity in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), which is the coexistence of crystalline density modulation and global phase coherence, emerges from the interplay of contact interactions, long-range dipole-dipole forces, and quantum fluctuations. Although realized experimentally, stabilizing this phase at zero temperature often requires high peak densities. Here we chart the finite-temperature phase behavior of a harmonically trapped dipolar BEC using an extended mean-field framework that incorporates both quantum (Lee-Huang-Yang) and thermal fluctuation effects. We find that finite temperature can act constructively: it shifts the supersolid phase boundary toward larger scattering lengths, lowers the density threshold for the onset of supersolidity, and broadens the stability window of modulated phases. Real-time simulations reveal temperature-driven pathways (crystallization upon heating and melting upon cooling) demonstrating the dynamical accessibility and path dependence of supersolid order. Moreover, moderate thermal fluctuations stabilize single-droplet states that are unstable at zero temperature, expanding the experimentally accessible parameter space. These results identify temperature as a key control parameter for engineering and stabilizing supersolid phases, offering realistic routes for their observation and control in dipolar quantum gases.</description>

      <title>An efficient preconditioned conjugate-gradient solver for a two-component dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a preconditioned nonlinear conjugate-gradient solver for ground states of binary dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates within the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation including Lee-Huang-Yang corrections. The optimization is carried out on the product-of-spheres normalization manifold and combines a manifold-preserving analytic line search, derived from a second-order energy expansion and validated along the exact normalized path, with complementary Fourier-space kinetic and real-space diagonal (Hessian-inspired) preconditioners. The method enforces monotonic energy descent and exhibits robust convergence across droplet, stripe, and supersolid regimes while retaining spectrally accurate discretizations and FFT-based evaluation of the dipolar term. In head-to-head benchmarks against imaginary-time evolution on matched grids and tolerances, the solver reduces iteration counts by one to two orders of magnitude and overall time-to-solution, and it typically attains slightly lower energies, indicating improved resilience to metastability. We reproduce representative textures and droplet-stability windows reported for dipolar mixtures. These results establish a reliable and efficient tool for large-scale parameter scans and phase-boundary mapping, and for quantitatively linking numerically obtained metastable branches to experimentally accessible states.</description>

      <title>Repulsively Bound Hadrons in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A paradigmatic model, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory exhibits confinement mediated by the gauge field that binds pairs of particles into mesons, drawing connections to quantum chromodynamics. In the absence of any additional attractive interactions between particles, mesons are not known to bind in this model. Here, we show that resonant pair-production terms give rise to an additional repulsive binding mechanism that forms a stable ``hadron'' bound state of two mesons. A high-energy state, the hadron is stabilized by being off-resonantly coupled to a continuum. We study the dynamical formation of this bound state starting from local excitations. We use matrix product state techniques based on the time-evolving block decimation algorithm to perform our numerical simulations and analyze the effect of model parameters on hadron formation. Furthermore, we derive an effective model that explains its formation. Our findings are amenable to experimental observation on modern quantum hardware from superconducting qubits to trapped ions.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine-resolved optical spectroscopy of ultracold $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs molecules: the $\mathrm{b}^3\Pi_0$ metastable state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using an ultracold gas of $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs molecules, we perform hyperfine-resolved spectroscopy of transitions from the vibronic ground state to the lowest rovibrational states of the electronic state $\mathrm{b}^3\Pi_0$, as a function of magnetic field. These transitions are spin forbidden, resulting in narrow linewidths, and feature near-diagonal Franck-Condon factors. We develop a model of the hyperfine and Zeeman structure that includes coupling between the $0^+$ and $0^-$ components of $\mathrm{b}^3\Pi_0$. We fit the spectra to obtain rotational and hyperfine coupling constants. We measure transition dipole moments associated with specific transitions by directly observing Rabi oscillations as a function of a resonant laser pulse duration. Using resonant $\pi$ pulses, we prepare molecules in the electronically excited state and directly measure the spontaneous emission rate.</description>

      <title>Long-range resonances in quasiperiodic many-body localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate long-range resonances in quasiperiodic many-body localized (MBL) systems. Focusing on the Heisenberg chain in a deterministic Aubry-Andr\'{e} potential, we complement standard diagnostics by analyzing the structure of long-distance pairwise correlations at high energy. Contrary to the expectation that the ergodic-MBL transition in quasiperiodic systems should be sharper due to the absence of Griffiths regions, we uncover a broad unconventional regime at strong quasiperiodic potential, characterized by fat-tailed distributions of longitudinal correlations at long distance. This reveals the presence of atypical eigenstates with strong long-range correlations in a regime where standard diagnostics indicate stable MBL. We further identify these anomalous eigenstates as quasi-degenerate pairs of resonant cat states, which exhibit entanglement at long distance. These findings advance the understanding of quasiperiodic MBL and identify density-correlation measurements in ultracold atomic systems as a probe of long-range resonances.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and State Preparation in a Two-State System of Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling of two-level quantum systems to the thermal environment is a fundamental problem, with applications ranging from qubit state preparation to spin models. However, for the elementary problem of the thermodynamics of an ensemble of bosons populating a two-level system despite its conceptual simplicity experimental realizations are scarce. Using an optical dye microcavity platform, we thermalize photons in a two-mode system with tunable chemical potential, demonstrating N bosons populating a two-level system coupled to a heat bath. Under pulsed excitation, Josephson oscillations between the two quantum states demonstrate the possibility for coherent manipulation. In contrast, under stationary conditions the thermalization of the two-mode system is observed. As the energetic splitting between eigenstates is two orders of magnitude smaller than thermal energy, at low occupations an almost equal distribution of the modes occupation is observed, as expected from Boltzmann statistics. For larger occupation, we observe efficient population of the ground state and saturation of the upper level at high filling, expected from quantum statistics. Our experiment holds promise for state preparation in quantum technologies as well as for quantum thermodynamics studies.</description>

      <title>Creation of a degenerate Bose-Bose mixture of erbium and lithium atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the realization of a degenerate mixture of $^{166}$Er and $^{7}$Li atoms in their energetically lowest spin states. The two species are sequentially laser-cooled and loaded into an optical dipole trap, then transported to a glass cell and simultaneously evaporated to degeneracy. Er serves as the coolant for Li, and we observe efficient sympathetic cooling facilitated by a large interspecies elastic scattering cross section. Three-body losses are found to be small, making this platform promising for the study of interacting mixtures with large mass imbalance.</description>

      <title>Thermometry of simulated Bose--Einstein condensates using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise determination of thermodynamic parameters in ultracold Bose gases remains challenging due to the destructive nature of conventional measurement techniques and inherent experimental uncertainties. We demonstrate a machine learning approach for rapid, non-destructive estimation of the chemical potential and temperature from a single image of an \emph{in situ} imaged density profiles of finite-temperature Bose gases. Our convolutional neural network is trained exclusively on quasi-2D `pancake' condensates in harmonic trap configurations. It achieves parameter extraction within fractions of a second. The model also demonstrates {some} zero-shot generalisation across both trap geometry and thermalisation dynamics, successfully estimating the temperature (although not the chemical potential) for toroidally trapped condensates with errors of only a few nanokelvin despite no prior exposure to such geometries during training, and maintaining predictive accuracy during dynamic thermalisation processes after a relatively brief evolution without explicit training on non-equilibrium states. These results suggest that supervised learning can overcome traditional limitations in ultracold atom thermometry, with extension to broader geometric configurations, temperature ranges, and additional parameters potentially enabling comprehensive real-time analysis of quantum gas experiments. Such capabilities could significantly streamline experimental workflows whilst improving measurement precision across a range of quantum fluid systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical correlations and domain wall relocalization in transverse field Ising chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.09502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study conventional and out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) for a wide variety of transverse field Ising chains: classical and quantum, clean and disordered, and integrable and generic. The setting we consider is that of a quantum quench. We find a remarkably rich phenomenology, ranging from stable periodic signals to ones decaying with varying rates. This variety is due to a complex interplay of constraints on thermalization imposed by integrability and symmetry. A process we term dynamical domain wall relocalization provides a long-lived signal in the clean, integrable case, which can be degraded by the addition of disorder even without interactions. Our results shed light on a proposal to use an OTOC as a dynamical diagnostic of a quantum phase more powerful than a standard observable.</description>

      <title>Systematic construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states and their relation to supersymmetric quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04853v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic method for constructing asymptotic quantum many-body scar (AQMBS) states. While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</description>
