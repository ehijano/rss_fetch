      <title>EXKALIBUR: Towards a Kaonic Atoms Periodic Table to test Fundamental Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kaonic atoms, formed when a negatively charged kaon replaces an electron, provide a unique laboratory to test fundamental interactions at low energies. EXKALIBUR (EXtensive Kaonic Atoms research: from LIthium and Beryllium to URanium) is a program to perform systematic, high-precision X-ray spectroscopy of selected kaonic atoms across the periodic table at the DA$\Phi$NE accelerator at the National Laboratory of Frascati (INFN-LNF). Here, we outline its detector-driven strategy: Silicon Drift Detectors for 10-40 keV transitions in light targets (Li, Be, B, O), CdZnTe detectors for 40-300 keV lines in intermediate-$Z$ systems (Mg, Al, Si, S), and a High-Purity Germanium detector for high-$Z$ atoms (Se, Zr, Ta, Mo, W, Pb), complemented by VOXES, a high-resolution crystal spectrometer for sub-eV studies. EXKALIBUR plans to (i) reduce the charged-kaon mass uncertainty below 10 keV, (ii) produce a database of nuclear shifts and widths to constrain multi-nucleon K$^{-}$-nucleus interaction models, and (iii) provide precision data for testing bound-state QED in strong fields. We summarize the planned measurements and expected sensitivities within DA$\Phi$NE luminosities.</description>

      <title>Boron Nitride Coatings for the Enhanced Detection of Neutrons in CR-39</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutron detection efficiency of Columbia Resin 39 (CR-39) nuclear track detectors was assessed for AmBe, 252Cf, and D-T (14 MeV) neutron source spectra. A boron nitride (BN) coating for CR-39 was developed to enhance the neutron detection efficiency by converting neutrons into energetic alpha particles through the well-known 10B(n,a)7Li reaction. Separate partially coated CR-39 pieces were exposed to each neutron source and subsequently analyzed under optical microscope and through large-area Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging over the irradiated area. The detection efficiency (tracks per neutron) was evaluated for each source spectra under optical and scanning electron microscopes and with or without BN coating. This resulted in a comprehensive guide to neutron detection with various sources using CR-39.</description>

      <title>Observation of the distribution of nuclear magnetization in a molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid progress in the experimental control and interrogation of molecules, combined with developments in precise calculations of their structure, are enabling new opportunities in the investigation of nuclear and particle physics phenomena. Molecules containing heavy, octupole-deformed nuclei such as radium are of particular interest for such studies, offering an enhanced sensitivity to the properties of fundamental particles and interactions. Here, we report precision laser spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations of the structure of the radioactive radium monofluoride molecule, $^{225}$Ra$^{19}$F. Our results allow fine details of the short-range electron-nucleus interaction to be revealed, indicating the high sensitivity of this molecule to the distribution of magnetization, currently a poorly constrained nuclear property, within the radium nucleus. These results provide a direct and stringent test of the description of the electronic wavefunction inside the nuclear volume, highlighting the suitability of these molecules to investigate subatomic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Enhanced sensitivity to trace $^{238}$U impurity of sapphire via coincidence neutron activation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sapphire has mechanical and electrical properties that are advantageous for the construction of internal components of radiation detectors such as time projection chambers and bolometers. However, it has proved difficult to assess its $\rm ^{232}Th$ and $\rm ^{238}U$ content down to the picogram per gram level. This work reports an experimental verification of a computational study that demonstrates $\gamma\gamma$ coincidence counting, coupled with neutron activation analysis (NAA), can reach ppt sensitivities. Combining results from $\gamma\gamma$ coincidence counting with those of earlier single-$\gamma$ counting based NAA shows that a sample of Saint Gobain sapphire has $\rm ^{232}Th$ and $\rm ^{238}U$ concentrations of $&lt;0.26$ ppt and $&lt;2.3$ ppt, respectively; the best constraints on the radiopurity of sapphire.</description>

      <title>Determining Absolute Neutrino Mass using Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next generation tritium decay experiments to determine the absolute neutrino mass require high-precision measurements of $\beta$-decay electron energies close to the kinematic end point. To achieve this, the development of high phase-space density sources of atomic tritium is required, along with the implementation of methods to control the motion of these atoms to allow extended observation times. A promising approach to efficiently and accurately measure the kinetic energies of individual $\beta$-decay electrons generated in these dilute atomic gases, is to determine the frequency of the cyclotron radiation they emit in a precisely characterised magnetic field. This cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy technique can benefit from recent developments in quantum technologies. Absolute static-field magnetometry and electrometry, which is essential for the precise determination of the electron kinetic energies from the frequency of their emitted cyclotron radiation, can be performed using atoms in superpositions of circular Rydberg states. Quantum-limited microwave amplifiers will allow precise cyclotron frequency measurements to be made with maximal signal-to-noise ratios and minimal observation times. Exploiting the opportunities offered by quantum technologies in these key areas, represents the core activity of the Quantum Technologies for Neutrino Mass project. Its goal is to develop a new experimental apparatus that can enable a determination of the absolute neutrino mass with a sensitivity on the order of 10~meV/$c^2$.</description>

      <title>Kaon and Pion Fragmentation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Drell-Levy-Yan relation is employed to obtain pion and kaon elementary fragmentation functions (EFFs) from the hadron-scale parton distribution functions (DFs) of these mesons. Two different DF sets are used: that calculated using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector $\times$ vector contact interaction (SCI) and the other expressing results obtained using continuum Schwinger function methods (CSMs). Thus determined, the EFFs serve as driving terms in a coupled set of hadron cascade equations, whose solution yields the complete array of hadron-scale fragmentation functions (FFs) for pion and kaon production in high energy reactions. After evolution to scales typical of experiments, the SCI and CSM FF predictions are seen to be in semiquantitative agreement. Importantly, they conform with a range of physical expectations for FF behaviour on the endpoint domains $z\simeq 0, 1$, e.g., nonsinglet FFs vanish at $z=0$ and singlet FFs diverge faster than $1/z$. Predictions for hadron multiplicities in jets are also delivered. They reveal SU$(3)$ symmetry breaking in the charged-kaon/neutral-kaon multiplicity ratio, whose size diminishes with increasing reaction energy, and show that, with increasing energy, the pion/kaon ratio in $e^+ e^- \to h X$ diminishes to a value that is independent of hadron masses.</description>

      <title>On Robust $\beta$-Spectra Shape Parameter Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental extraction of $\beta$-shape functions, C(W), is challenging. Comparing different experimental $\beta$-shapes to each other and to those predicted by theory in a consistent manner is difficult. This difficulty is compounded when different parameterizations of the $\beta$-shape function are used. Usually some form of a power polynomial of the total electron energy is chosen for this parametrization. This choice results in extracted coefficients that are highly correlated, with their physical meaning and numerical value dependent on the order of polynomial chosen. This is true for both theoretical and experimental coefficients, and leads to challenges when comparing coefficients from polynomials of different orders. Accurately representing the highly correlated uncertainties is difficult and subtle. These issues impact the underlying physical interpretation of shape function parameters. We suggest an alternative approach based on orthogonal polynomials. Orthogonal polynomials offer more stable coefficient extraction which is less dependent on the order of the polynomial, allow for easier comparison between theory and experimental coefficients from polynomials of different orders, and offer some observations on simple physical meaning and on the statistical limits of the extracted coefficients.</description>

      <title>Exploring hadronic rescattering effects on resonance productions in pp and p-Pb collisions with PYTHIA8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the quark-gluon plasma is created, and as the medium cools down, the system transitions into a hadronic phase. While such interactions are well established for large systems, such as Pb-Pb collisions, their relevance in smaller collision systems remains unclear. Consequently, hadronic interactions during the hadronic phase are studied in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV with the PYTHIA8 event generator. The interaction is studied via the yield ratios between resonances and stable particles with similar quark contents, which are obtained as a function of transverse momentum ($p_{\rm{T}}$) using $\mathrm{\rho(770)^0}$, $\mathrm{K^*(892)^0}$, and $\mathrm{\phi(1020)}$ mesons and their stable particles, $\mathrm{\pi^\pm}$ and $\mathrm{K^\pm}$ at midrapidity ($|\rm{y}|&lt;0.5$). Yield ratios are calculated in five multiplicity classes for pp and six for p-Pb collisions, using the 60-100% multiplicity class in pp as a reference. Although rescattering leads to stronger suppression at low $p_{\rm{T}} &lt; 2$ GeV/$c$, a visible suppression remains even when rescattering is turned off. To isolate the rescattering effect, double ratios between the rescattering on and off configurations are obtained. These are then integrated in the full $p_{\rm{T}}$ range ($0&lt;p_{\rm{T}}&lt;6.0$ GeV/$c$). The normalized double ratios show a decreasing trend with increasing multiplicity, independent of the collision system. The lower limit of the hadronic phase lifetimes extracted in the integrated-$p_{\rm{T}}$ region increases with multiplicity in both systems, but with a notable discrepancy between pp and p-Pb collisions.</description>

      <title>Neural Unfolding of the Chiral Magnetic Effect in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions (HICs) is challenged by significant background contamination. We present a novel deep learning approach based on a U-Net architecture to time-reversely unfold the dynamics of CME-related charge separation, enabling the reconstruction of the physics signal across the entire evolution of HICs. Trained on the events simulated by a multi-phase transport model with different cases of CME settings, our model learns to recover the charge separation based on final-state transverse momentum distributions at either the quark-gloun plasma freeze-out or hadronic freeze-out. This devises a methodological tool for the study of CME and underscores the promise of deep learning approaches in retrieving physics signals in HICs.</description>
