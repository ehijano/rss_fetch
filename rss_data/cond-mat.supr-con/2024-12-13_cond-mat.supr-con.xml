      <title>Type-I/Type-II superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric compound Ir$_2$Ga$_9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed magnetization, specific heat, and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements on single crystals of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor Ir$_{2}$Ga$_{9}$. The isothermal magnetization measurements show that there is a crossover from Type-I to Type-II superconductivity with decreasing temperature. Potential multi-band superconductivity of Ir$_{2}$Ga$_{9}$~is observed in the specific heat data. $\mu$SR~measurement is performed to map the phase diagram of Ir$_{2}$Ga$_{9}$, and both Type-I and Type-II superconductivity characteristics are obtained. Most importantly, a more unique region with the coexistence of Type-I and Type-II $\mu$SR signals is observed. In addition, time reversal symmetry is found to be preserved in Ir$_{2}$Ga$_{9}$ by zero field $\mu$SR measurement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) study on polycrystalline noncentrosymmetric superconductor NbGe$_2$~with the superconducting transition temperature $T_c=2.0\sim2.1$~K. Zero-field $\mu$SR~experiment indicates the absence of spontaneous magnetic field in the superconducting state, showing the preservation of time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state. Transverse-field $\mu$SR~experiment is performed to map the phase diagram of NbGe$_2$, from which clear evidence of both type-I and type-II superconductivity is obtained. More importantly, we clearly delineate the region in the phase diagram where type-I and type-II superconductivity coexist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel oxychloride, Sr$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{5}$Cl$_{2}$, was synthesized for the first time under high pressure of 10 GPa at 1400 ${}^\circ$C, motivated by a theoretical prediction of its potential superconductivity under ambient pressure. Small single crystals were used to determine the crystal structure and measure the temperature dependence of electrical resistance. The crystal is isostructural with the recently discovered superconductor, La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$, in line with the theoretical expectation.</description>

      <title>Band Oscillation Correlated with Tc for Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous theoretical studies on superconductivity were focused on the static states and adiabatic processes. Quantum mechanics simulations of time-dependent processes in superconductors were rarely performed previously. Here we use real-time time-dependent density functional theory to show a new phenomenon that the electron-phonon excitation is coherent and mode-selective, resulting in a periodic band oscillation. Surprisingly, the predicted oscillation frequency of charges or bands here are strongly correlated with a broad range of superconductivity transition temperatures of various main families of superconductors, including cuprates, Fe-based, hydrides, and WTe2. This shed light on the pairing mechanism in unconventional superconductors, paving the way for the design of higher temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Fermiology with nodal structures in nonsymmorphic superconductor LaNiGa$_2$: A de Haas-van Alphen study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological metals possess various types of symmetry-protected degenerate band crossings. When a topological metal becomes superconducting, the low-energy electronic excitations stemming from the band crossings located close to the Fermi level may contribute to highly unusual pairing symmetry and superconducting states. In this work, we study the electronic band structure of the time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductor LaNiGa$_2$ by means of quantum oscillation measurements. A comprehensive investigation combining angle-resolved high-field de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) spectroscopy and first-principles calculations reveals the fermiology of LaNiGa$_2$ and verifies its nonsymmorphic $Cmcm$ lattice symmetry, which promises nodal band crossings pinned at the Fermi level with fourfold degeneracies. Moreover, such nodal structures, proposed to play a crucial role giving rise to the interorbital triplet pairing, are indeed captured by our dHvA analysis. Our results identify LaNiGa$_2$ as a prototypical topological crystalline superconductor and highlight the putative contribution of low-energy nodal quasiparticles to unconventional superconducting pairing.</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconductivity in barium hydrides via light element incorporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barium hydrides are of interest for their potential in both ionic conductivity and superconductivity. Recently, a superconducting hydride BaH12 containing H$_2$ and H${_3}^{-1}$ molecular units was experimentally reported with a critical temperature $T_\text{c}$ of 20 K at 140 GPa. Herein, we combine ab initio methods with a rapid calculator of $T_\text{c}$ based on the networking value model to predict that the introduction of light elements, such as Be, can effectively expand the structure diversity and structure space of barium hydrides. Although molecular hydrogen units are still widely present in thermodynamically stable and metastable crystal structures, we find that a metastable phase of BeBaH8 shows a higher $T_\text{c}$ of 49 K than BaH12 at a reduced pressure of 100 GPa. This BeBaH8 remains dynamically stable at 15 GPa. Furthermore, our study shows that increasing pressure can further elevate $T_\text{c}$ beyond 100 K by enhancing the electron-phonon coupling constant. Our study proposes a feasible method for broadening the structural landscape in the exploration of superconducting phases of barium hydrides.</description>

      <title>Meissner Effect and Nonreciprocal Charge Transport in Superconducting 1T-CrTe2/FeTe Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interface-induced superconductivity has recently been achieved by stacking a magnetic topological insulator layer on an antiferromagnetic FeTe layer. However, the mechanism driving this emergent superconductivity remains unclear. Here, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to grow a 1T-CrTe2 layer, a two-dimensional ferromagnet with Curie temperature up to room temperature, on a FeTe layer. These 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures show superconductivity with a critical temperature of ~12 K. Through magnetic force microscopy measurements, we observe the Meissner effect on the surface of the 1T-CrTe2 layer. Our electrical transport measurements reveal that the 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures exhibit nonreciprocal charge transport behavior, characterized by a large magneto-chiral anisotropy coefficient. The enhanced nonreciprocal charge transport in 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures provides a promising platform for exploring the magnetically controllable superconducting diode effect.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the multiband metallic nature of the normal state in nickelate La3Ni2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of unconventional superconductivity around 80 K in perovskite nickelates under high pressure has furnished a new platform to explore high-temperature unconventional superconductivity in addition to cuprates. Understanding the normal state of nickelate superconductors is crucial to uncovering the origin of this unconventional superconductivity and gaining further insight into its underlying mechanism. In this study, we systemically studied the transport properties of La3Ni2O7 by tuning the pressure under high magnetic fields. Magnetoresistance (MR) consistently exhibits a quasi-quadratic dependence on the magnetic field across all measured pressures and temperatures. Increased pressure enhances the metallicity of the system and leads to a monotonic increase in MR, which follows the extended Kohler's rule. These results suggest that the normal state of La3Ni2O7 to be a multiband metallic nature.</description>

      <title>Prediction of high-Tc superconductivity in two corrugated graphene sheets with intercalated CeH9 molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries involving high-temperature superconductivity in H3S and LaH10 have sparked a renewed interest in exploring the potential for superconductivity within hydrides. These superconductors require extremely high-pressure condition ( 100 GP a), rendering them virtually impractical for industrial applications. In this study, we verify the occurrence of a low pressure superconductivity phase transition in a system containing two graphene layers with sine form corrugations where CeH9 doped molecules are intercalated between the layers. The lowest-order constrained variational method is applied to calculate the thermodynamic and electrical properties of the valence electrons. We examine 9900 different distributions of CeH9 molecules separately for finding a second-order phase transition with maximized critical temperature. The novelty of the present work is the prediction of a superconductivity transition at Tc = 198.61 K for a specific distribution of CeH9 molecules with applying no external pressure on the exterior surfaces of the graphene sheets. Notably, this critical temperature is approximately 65 K higher than that observed in cuprate materials (HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8+{\delta}), which are known for their high Tc values at room pressure. It is interesting that in this particular case, the distribution periodicity of CeH9 molecules bears the closest resemblance to the periodicity of the graphene corrugations among all 9900 examined cases. Computing the energy gap of the valence electrons reveals that this critical behavior corresponds to an unconventional superconductivity phase transition exhibiting a high critical current density on the order of 107 A/cm2</description>

      <title>Influence of Nb Alloying on Nb Recrystallization and the Upper Critical Field of Nb3Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nb3Sn conductors are important candidates for high-field magnets for particle accelerators, and they continue to be widely used for many laboratory and NMR magnets. However, the critical current density, Jc, of present Nb3Sn conductors declines swiftly above 12-15T. State-of-the-art Ta- and Ti-doped strands exhibit upper critical field, Hc2, values of 24-26.5T (4.2K) and do not reach the FCC target Jc, which serves as the present stretch target for Nb3Sn development. As recently demonstrated, to meet this goal requires enhanced vortex pinning but an independent and supplementary approach is to significantly enhance Hc2. In this study, we have arc-melted multiple Nb alloys with added Hf, Zr, Ta and Ti and drawn them successfully into monofilament wires to investigate the possibilities of Hc2 enhancement through alloying. Hc2(T) was measured for all samples in fields up to 16T and some up to 31T. We have found that all alloys show good agreement with the standard Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenberg (WHH) fitting procedure without the need to adjust the paramagnetic limitation parameter (alpha) and spin-orbit scattering parameter (lambda_so). The evaluation of dHc2/dT near Tc, which is proportional to the electronic specific heat coefficient (gamma) and the normal state resistivity (rho_n), allows a better understanding of the induced disorder introduced by alloying in the A15 phase. So far, we have observed that Hf alloying of pure Nb can enhance Hc2(0) by 3-4T to 28T, while adding just 1 at. %Hf or Zr into a Nb4Ta base alloy can raise Hc2(0) to 31T. Very importantly we find that Hf and Zr raise the alloy recrystallization temperature above the usual A15 reaction temperature range of 650{\deg}C-750{\deg}C, thus ensuring denser A15 phase nucleation in the Nb alloy grain boundaries, possibly leading to a more homogeneous A15 phase Sn content and refined A15 grain size.

      <title>Influence of Magnetic Field on Surface Andreev Bound States in Superfluid $^3$He-B Studied by Mobility of Electron Bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The B phase of superfluid $^\textrm 3$He ($^\textrm 3$He-B) is topologically nontrivial and the surface Andreev bound states formed on a surface are conceived as Majorana fermions. In a magnetic field, the surface Andreev bound states acquire a Zeeman gap. How the Zeeman gap opens when a magnetic field is applied is intimately related to how the topological properties are lost. In this article, we study the mobility of an electron bubble trapped under a free surface of $^\textrm 3$He-B in a magnetic field of 0.25 T to examine the influence of the magnetic field on the surface Andreev bound states. We observe experimentally and theoretically that, with decreasing temperature, the mobility at 0.25 T increases steeper than that in zero magnetic field when the thermal energy is comparable to the Zeeman energy, while the mobility is slightly smaller than that in zero magnetic field at higher temperatures. These features are understood by the opening of the Zeeman gap, the resulting change in the density of states within the bulk superfluid gap, and the distortion of the bulk superfluid gap by the magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: Here we report the positive muon spin relaxation study on Pr-doped La$_{1.9}$Pr$_{1.1}$Ni$_2$O$_{6.97}$ and oxygen-deficient La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{6.63}$ polycrystalline under ambient pressure. Zero-field $\mu^+$SR experiments reveal the existence of bulk long-range magnetic order in La$_{1.9}$Pr$_{1.1}$Ni$_2$O$_{6.97}$ with $T_{N}=161\ \rm{K}$, while La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{6.63}$ exhibits a short-range magnetic ground state with $T_N=30\ \rm{K}$. The magnetic transition width of La$_{1.9}$Pr$_{1.1}$Ni$_2$O$_{6.97}$ revealed by weak-transverse-field $\mu^+$SR is narrower compared to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{6.92}$. Our $\mu^+$SR experiment results provide a comprehensive view on the correlation between magnetism and structure perfection in Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelates under ambient pressure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a minimal model of a two-terminal Josephson junction with conventional superconducting (SC) leads and a pair of interconnected quantum dots in the presence of two Aharonov-Casher (AC) fluxes. The Andreev bound state spectrum features Weyl nodes within a three-dimensional synthetic Brillouin zone defined in the space of these AC fluxes and the SC phase difference. The aim is to determine the location and topological charge of these nodes by probing the Berry curvature on closed surfaces that may enclose them. This is achieved by adiabatically varying the superconducting phase difference and AC fluxes along a path on these surfaces and measuring the associated currents. We define the kinematic curvature as the cross product of a tangent vector along the path and the vector of these currents. In the adiabatic regime, the path-averaged kinematic curvature provides a quantized response equal to the topological charge enclosed by the surface, provided the path uniformly and densely covers it.</description>

      <title>The Frequency Shift and Q of Disordered Superconducting RF Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Niobium superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities for high energy accelerator applications have been greatly improved in terms of the quality factor $Q$ by techniques such as Nitrogen doping. However, the mechanisms leading improvement in $Q$ are still not fully understood. Quite recently the SRF group at Fermilab measured anomalies in the frequency shift of N-doped SRF Niobium cavities near the transition temperature. Here we report our theoretical analysis of these results based on the microscopic theory of superconductivity that incorporates anisotropy of the superconducting gap and inhomogeneous disorder in the screening region of the SRF cavities. We are able to account for frequency shift anomalies very close to $T_c$ of the order of fractions of a kHz. Our results for the frequency shift and Q are in good agreement with the experimental data reported for all four N-doped Nb SRF cavities by Bafia et al. We also compare our theory with an earlier report of on a Nb sample measured at 60 GHz. We also show that the quality factor calculated theoretically has a peak of upper convexity with the largest $Q$ at intermediate levels of disorder. For strong disorder, i.e. the dirty limit, pair breaking in the presence of disorder and screening currents limits the $Q$.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarized Specular Andreev Reflections in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07117v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show theoretically that specular Andreev reflection occurs stably at altermagnet--superconductor interfaces, which is a phenomenon that has previously been predicted only in a limited range of materials, such as Dirac/Weyl materials with fine-tuned chemical potentials. Furthermore, the characteristic spin-split bands of the altermagnet lead to a distinctive spin polarization in the specular Andreev reflections. By utilizing this feature, we propose a device that integrates the functions of both a Cooper pair splitter and a spin beam splitter, thereby creating energy-entangled electron pairs. The positive nonlocal conductance and the positive noise cross-correlation are unambiguous signatures of specular Andreev reflections in the proposed device.</description>

      <title>Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-type spin-spin interaction from mixed-parity superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interacting impurity spins adsorbed on surfaces have been suggested as basic components for applications in quantum computation and spintronics. Such spins usually prefer a parallel or antiparallel configuration, but weakly non-collinear alignments are possible due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) that arises in the presence of relativistic spin-orbit coupling. Here, we show that an effective Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-type interaction (DMTI) can emerge purely from superconducting correlations without any spin-orbit interaction. We give an analytical proof and provide a numerical study which shows that DMTI arises in mixed-parity superconductors solely from the superconducting pairing. Moreover, we show that the same effect can be realized in Josephson junctions between s-wave and p-wave superconductors, where a phase bias toggles the DMTI entirely on and off. These results enable a way to engineer spin textures using superconducting order.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic, multiband, and strong-coupling superconductivity of the Pb0.64Bi0.36 alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents theoretical and experimental studies on the superconductivity of Pb${_{0.64}}$Bi$_{0.36}$ alloy, which is a prototype of strongly coupled superconductors and exhibits one of the strongest coupling under ambient pressure among the materials studied so far. The critical temperature, the specific heat in the superconducting state, and the magnetic critical fields are experimentally determined. Deviations from the single-gap s-wave BCS-like behavior are observed. The electronic structure, phonons and electron-phonon interactions are analyzed in relation to the metallic Pb, explaining why the Pb-Bi alloy exhibits such a large value of the electron-phonon coupling parameter $\lambda \simeq 2$. Superconductivity is studied using the isotropic Eliashberg formalism as well as the anisotropic density functional theory for superconductors. We find that while Pb is a two-gap superconductor with well-defined separate superconducting gaps, in the Pb-Bi alloy an overlapped three-gap-like structure is formed with a strong anisotropy. Furthermore, the chemical disorder, inherent to this alloy, leads to strong electron scattering, which is found to reduce the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Light-Induced Electron Pairing in a Bilayer Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous experimental and theoretical work has given evidence of the existence of doubly charged exciton states in strongly screened bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) layers. These complexes are important because they are performed electron pairs that can, in principle, undergo Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), in which case they would also form a new type of superconductor, consisting of stable bosons with net charges. In this paper, we present key electrostatic and magnetic measurements that definitively confirm the existence of these charged bosons. These measurements include 1) continuous control of the doping density with both positive and negative carriers, showing the expected population dependencies on the free carrier density, and 2) measurement of the dependence on the magnetic field, showing that this new bound state is a spin triplet. These results imply that it is promising to look for BEC and superconductivity in this system.</description>

      <title>Microwave Hall measurements using a circularly polarized dielectric cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed a circularly polarized dielectric rutile (TiO$_2$) cavity with a high quality-factor that can generate circularly polarized microwaves from two orthogonal linearly polarized microwaves with a phase difference of $\pm \pi/2$ using a hybrid coupler. Using this cavity, we have established a new methodology to measure the microwave Hall conductivity of a small single crystal of metal in the skin-depth region. Based on the cavity perturbation technique, we have shown that all components of the surface impedance tensor can be extracted under the application of a magnetic field by comparing the right- and left-handed circularly polarized modes. To verify the validity of the developed method, we performed test measurements on tiny Bi single crystals at low temperatures. As a result, we have successfully obtained the surface impedance tensor components and confirmed that the characteristic field dependence of the ac Hall angle in the microwave region is consistent with the expectation from the dc transport measurements. These results demonstrate a significant improvement in sensitivity compared to previous methods. Thus, our developed technique allows more accurate microwave Hall measurements, opening the way for new approaches to explore novel topological quantum phenomena, such as time-reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors.</description>

      <title>Entanglement measures of Majorana bound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Majorana bound states emerge in topological superconductors as zero-energy edge states exhibiting spatial nonlocality. Despite the enormous advances, the detection of Majorana bound states is still challenging mainly because topologically trivial Andreev bound states produce similar signatures. In this work we consider a topological superconductor with Majorana bound states coupled to quantum dots and investigate the dynamics of their quantum correlations with the aim to explore their entanglement properties. In particular, we characterize entanglement by using concurrence and discord, which are also complemented by the entanglement dynamics and return probability. We find that Majorana bound states at truly zero energy can transform an initially entangled system into its classical state, while they can create maximally entangled states at a finite energy overlap. Interestingly, we show that the system can generate a maximally entangled state between MBSs and a quantum dot by simply controlling the Majorana nonlocality. We demonstrate that these results hold in the scenarios when the initial state is either maximally entangled or separable, albeit in the latter maximally entangled states are achieved in the long time dynamics. Furthermore, we contrast our findings with those produced by a regular fermion and obtain very distinct entanglement signatures. Our work offers an alternative approach to characterize Majorana bound states, which can be also useful towards their utilization for quantum information tasks.</description>
