      <title>Photoionization-induced reflection for benchmarking of the photoionization models in solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The choice of the most suitable analytic photoionization model in solids is a challenging task with no default solution. Here we show how the best formalism can be determined based on the waveform of the pulse reflected by a sample due to photoionized almost-free electrons in the conduction band. For a typical case of diamond, we compare three simple models and benchmark them against highly accurate first-principle TDDFT simulation, by analysing the fit between the reflected pulses in time and frequency domain. For the aims of this paper, we have developed a software package, called PIGLET, for the FDTD simulation of photoionization-governed propagation, which is now freely available for the scientific community. Furthermore, we show that due to interband contributions for very short sub-10-fs pulses a semi-classical description based on any analytical photoionization model fail to provide an adequate description.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable total reflection of light by oblique helicoidal cholesteric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An oblique helicoidal state of a cholesteric liquid crystal (ChOH) is capable of continuous change of the pitch P in response to an applied electric field. Such a structure reflects 50% of the unpolarized light incident along the ChOH axis in the electrically tunable band determined by P/2. Here we demonstrate that at an oblique incidence of light, ChOH reflects 100% of light of any polarization. This singlet band of total reflection is associated with the full pitch P. We also describe the satellite P/2, P/3, and P/4 bands. The P/2 and P/4 bands are triplets while P/3 band is a singlet caused by multiple scatterings at P and P/2. A single ChOH cell acted upon by an electric field tunes all these bands in a very broad spectral range, from ultraviolet to infrared and beyond, thus representing a structural color device with enormous potential for optical and photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared 2D nonredundant optical phased array of mirror emitters in an InGaAs/InP platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extension of photonic technologies such as lidar and free-space optical communications from the traditional visible and near-infrared wavelengths to longer wavelengths can improve performance in adverse environments such as haze, fog, smoke, or strong solar background. Non-mechanical beam steerers will be a critical component of the low size, weight, and power modules needed for the portable or unmanned systems deployed in these environments. In this work, we demonstrate the first 2D optical phased array for non-mechanical beam steering in the mid-infrared spectral region. We combine a total internal-reflection mirror emitter with a non-redundant array of 30 elements to carry out 2D beam steering at a single wavelength of 4.6 $\mu$m. The experiment yielded 600 resolvable far-field points, with 2400 points over a $28^\circ \times 28^\circ$ field of view calculated theoretically. Moreover, the device was fabricated in a passive InGaAs/InP platform, contributing another advance in the ongoing development of quantum cascade laser-based photonic integration.</description>

      <title>Temporal-Spatial Manipulation of Bi-Focal Bi-Chromatic Fields for Terahertz Radiations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixing the fundamental ($\omega$) and the second harmonic (2$\omega$) waves in gas phase is a widely employed technique for emitting terahertz (THz) pulses. The THz generation driven by bi-chromatic fields can be described by the photocurrent model, where the THz generation is attributed to free electrons ionized by the $\omega$ field, and the 2$\omega$ field provides a perturbation to break the symmetry of the asymptotic momentum of free electrons. However, we find that the THz radiation is amplified by one order of magnitude when driven by bi-focal bi-chromatic fields, contradicting the common understanding of the photocurrent model. Meanwhile, present measurements demonstrate that the THz radiation mainly originates from the plasma created by the 2$\omega$ pulses instead of the $\omega$ pulses. Energy transfer from the 2$\omega$ beam to the THz beam during the THz generation has been observed, validating the major contribution of the 2$\omega$ beam. Furthermore, the THz bandwidth has been observed to extensively exceed the bandwidth of the pump pulse, not be explained by the photocurrent model as well. These counterintuitive results indicate that undiscovered physical mechanisms are involved in bi-chromatic THz generation in plasma, presenting a significant challenge for understanding strong-field nonlinear optics and simultaneously expanding various applications.</description>

      <title>Image Scanning Microscopy Reconstruction by Autocorrelation Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) stands out as one of the most widely used microscopy techniques, thanks to its three-dimensional imaging capability and its sub-diffraction spatial resolution, achieved through the closure of a pinhole in front of a single-element detector. However, the pinhole also rejects useful photons and beating the diffraction limit comes at the price of irremediably compromising the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data. Image scanning microscopy (ISM) emerged as the natural evolution of CLSM, exploiting a small array detector in place of the pinhole and the single-element detector. Each sensitive element is small enough to achieve sub-diffraction resolution through the confocal effect, but the size of the whole detector is large enough to guarantee excellent collection efficiency and SNR. However, the raw data produced by an ISM setup consists of a 4D dataset which can be seen as a set of confocal-like images. Thus, fusing the dataset into a single super-resolved image requires a dedicated reconstruction algorithm. Conventional methods are multi-image deconvolution, which requires prior knowledge of the system point spread functions (PSF), or adaptive pixel reassignment (APR), which is effective only on a limited range of experimental conditions. In this work, we describe and validate a novel concept for ISM image reconstruction based on autocorrelation inversion. We leverage unique properties of the autocorrelation to discard low-frequency components and maximize the resolution of the reconstructed image, without any assumption on the image or any knowledge of the PSF. Our results push the quality of the ISM reconstruction beyond the level provided by APR and open new perspectives for multi-dimensional image processing.</description>

      <title>Dual-comb mode-locked Yb:CALGO laser based on cavity-shared configuration with separated end mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-comb spectroscopy typically requires the utilization of two independent and phase-locked femtosecond lasers, resulting in a complex and expensive system that hinders its industrial applications. Single-cavity dual-comb lasers are considered as one of the primary solution to simplify the system. However, controlling the crucial parameter of difference in repetition rates remains challenging. In this study, we present a dual-comb mode-locked Yb:CALGO laser based on a cavity-shared configuration with separated end mirrors. We employ two pairs of end mirrors and two thin-film polarizers angled at 45 degrees to the cavity axis, leading to separating the cross-polarized laser modes. We achieve simultaneous operation of two combs at approximately 1040 nm with pulse durations of around 400 fs and an average power exceeding 1 W. The repetition rates are approximately 59 MHz and their difference can be easily tuned from zero up to the MHz range. By effectively canceling out common mode noises, we observe minimal fluctuation in the repetition rate difference with a standard deviation of about 1.9 Hz over ten minutes, while experiencing fluctuations in repetition rates as large as 90 Hz. We demonstrate the capabilities of this system by utilizing the free-running dual-comb setup for asynchronous optical sampling on a saturable absorber and measuring etalon transmission spectrum. This system allows for simple and independent control of the repetition rates and their difference during operation, facilitating the selection of optimal repetition rate difference and implementation of phase-locking loops. This advancement paves the way for the development of simple yet high-performance dual-comb laser sources.</description>

      <title>The electromagnetic scalar product in spatially-bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many physically interesting quantities of the electromagnetic field can be computed using the electromagnetic scalar product. However, none of the existing expressions for such scalar product are directly applicable when the fields are only known in a spatially-bounded domain, as is the case for many numerical Maxwell solvers. In here, we derive an expression for the electromagnetic scalar product between radiation fields that only involves integrals over closed spatial surfaces. The expression readily leads to formulas for the number of photons, energy, and helicity of generic polychromatic light pulses of incoming or outgoing character. The capabilities of popular Maxwell solvers in spatially-bounded computational domains are thereby augmented, for example, by a straightforward method for normalizing emitted fields so that they contain a single photon.</description>

      <title>Moving impedance profiles make one--way, spectrum--reshaping mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a new set of exact solutions to Maxwell's equations in space--time varying materials, where the refractive index is constant, while the impedance exhibits effective motion, i.e. it is a function of $x-vt$. We find that waves co--propagating with the modulation are not reflected within the material, while counter--propagating waves are continually reflected by the changing impedance. For a finite section of such a material we find analogues of transmission resonances, where specially shaped `eigenpulses' enter without reflection. We also find that there is a strong asymmetry in reflection from the medium when the impedance modulation is small but rapid, the material reflecting strongly from one side, and negligibly from the other. Unlike stationary media, the spectrum of the reflected wave can be significantly different from the incident one.</description>

      <title>STAR-FDTD : Space-time modulated acousto-optic guidestar in disordered media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a 2D Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method for modeling a space-time modulated guidestar targeting wavefront shaping applications in disordered media. Space-time modulation in general (a particular example being the acousto-optic effect) is used here as a guidestar for the transverse confinement of light around the tagged region surrounded by disorder. Together with the guidestar, the iterative optical phase conjugation (IOPC) method is used to overcome the diffusion of light due to multiple scattering. A phase sensitive lock-in detection technique is utilized to estimate the steady-state amplitude and phase of the modulated wavefronts emerging from the guidestar region continuously operating in the Raman-Nath regime. As the IOPC scheme naturally converges to the maximally transmitting eigenchannel profile, one could use the position of the guidestar within the disorder to channelize the maximal transmission through the tagged region. The associated code developed in MATLAB is provided as an open source (MIT license) package. The code package is referred by the acronym STAR-FDTD where STAR stands for Space-Time modulated Acousto-optic guidestaR.</description>

      <title>Clarification of the transverse orbital angular momentum of spatiotemporal optical vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in the generation and the application of spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOV) are proceeding fast, but fundamental aspects of their nature remain obscure. Phys. Rev. A 107, L031501 (2023) (PRA) and Prog. Electromagn. Res. 177, 95 (2023) (PIER) provide contradictory results on the transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM) carried by STOVs. We show that the results by Porras in PIER and by Bliokh in PRA refer to different STOVs and are all correct. In PIER, STOVs are elliptical at given cross section and time, or in space-time, but not in three-dimensional space. In PRA, STOVs are elliptical in space but not in space-time. This is evidenced from two dual, equivalent theories on the transverse OAM where a wave packet is seen in space-time evolving with propagation distance or in space evolving in time, that accounts for all values of the total, intrinsic and extrinsic OAM in PIERS and PRA. However, the intrinsic OAM with respect to the photon wave function center in PRA is not generally conserved, which advocates for the energy center in PIER as the STOV center. We argue that STOVs are generated in experiments to purportedly have elliptical symmetry in space-time. The values provided in PIER should then be taken as the reference for elliptical STOVs, and the theory therein to evaluate the transverse OAM of other wave packets. Hancock et al. in Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021) and Phys. Rev. X. 14, 011031 (2024) erroneously attribute the transverse OAM of elliptical STOVs in space to the elliptical STOVs in space-time they consider theoretically and can generate in their experiments.</description>

      <title>Pump-locked microcavity Brillouin laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microcavity-based microlasers are the kernel light sources for integrating photonics and optoelectronics. The traditional pump light frequency locking mainly utilizes a complex system with optoelectronic feedback, which requires a high-cost narrow-linewidth pump laser and limits the application of microlasers in integrated optoelectronic systems. We propose to utilize Rayleigh scattering of microcavities to lock the frequency of the pump laser to the resonant frequency of the laser microcavity with an all-optical method. While compressing the linewidth of the pump laser, it can greatly improve the long-term stability of the optically pumped microcavity laser. In the experiment, the linewidth of the semiconductor pump laser is compressed from the MHz level to the kHz level. The microcavity Brillouin laser achieves an ultra-narrow intrinsic linewidth of 100 Hz, with an ultra-low frequency noise of 35 Hz2/Hz. The constructed microlaser obtains a locking time up to 1 hour, which does not require any temperature control or vibration isolation of the laser system. This work is the first demonstration to achieve an optically pump-locked microcavity Brillouin laser, which provides a stable and reliable low-cost experimental platform for ultra-narrow linewidth lasers, precision laser sensors, microwave-photonic signal synthesizer, and optomechanical systems.</description>

      <title>On-chip Real-time Hyperspectral Imager with Full CMOS Resolution Enabled by Massively Parallel Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional spectral imaging methods are constrained by the time-consuming scanning process, limiting the application in dynamic scenarios. One-shot spectral imaging based on reconstruction has been a hot research topic recently and the primary challenges still lie in both efficient fabrication techniques suitable for mass production and the high-speed, high-accuracy reconstruction algorithm for real-time spectral imaging. In this study, we introduce an innovative on-chip real-time hyperspectral imager that leverages nanophotonic film spectral encoders and a Massively Parallel Network (MP-Net), featuring a 4 * 4 array of compact, all-dielectric film units for the micro-spectrometers. Each curved nanophotonic film unit uniquely modulates incident light across the underlying 3 * 3 CMOS image sensor (CIS) pixels, enabling a high spatial resolution equivalent to the full CMOS resolution. The implementation of MP-Net, specially designed to address variability in transmittance and manufacturing errors such as misalignment and non-uniformities in thin film deposition, can greatly increase the structural tolerance of the device and reduce the preparation requirement, further simplifying the manufacturing process. Tested in varied environments on both static and moving objects, the real-time hyperspectral imager demonstrates the robustness and high-fidelity spatial-spectral data capabilities across diverse scenarios. This on-chip hyperspectral imager represents a significant advancement in real-time, high-resolution spectral imaging, offering a versatile solution for applications ranging from environmental monitoring, remote sensing to consumer electronics.</description>

      <title>Dual-comb-enhanced microwave clock synchronization over commercial fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale clock network is the key ingredient to obtain high precision in many scenarios, from fundamental research to cutting-edge applications. However, time synchronization among microwave clocks has become an upper limit of the time-frequency network because of the inherent constrained precision in optical pulse measurements. Here, we demonstrate a femtosecond-level time synchronization of microwave clocks through a commercial link of 205.86 km via dual-comb-enhanced optical two-way time transfer, which achieves a 6.23-fs residual time deviation between synchronized timescales at 1 s and an instability below 6E-18 at 10,000 s. Further, the high-precision time synchronization of microwave clocks significantly enhances the probe ability of subtle reciprocity changes of fiber to the sub-picosecond level. This work provides a path toward secure fiber time-frequency networks to support future microwave-clock-based precise timing and sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Optical control of topological end states via soliton formation in a 1D lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solitons are self-consistent solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation that maintain their shape during propagation. Here we show, using a pump-probe technique, that soliton formation can be used to optically induce and control a linear topological end state in the bulk of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice, using evanescently-coupled waveguide arrays. Specifically, we observe an abrupt nonlinearly-induced transition above a certain power threshold due to an inversion symmetry-breaking nonlinear bifurcation. Our results demonstrate all-optical active control of topological states.</description>

      <title>Localized Resonant Phonon Polaritons in Biaxial Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of localized plasmon polariton resonances has been pivotal in enabling tunability of the optical resonance. Recently, extensive research efforts have aimed to expand these achievements to other polaritonic states that exhibit less loss and in other spectral regions. However, these efforts were limited to isotropic or uniaxial structures, and an eigenmode theory was derived only for isotropic particles. Here, we present a breakthrough in synthesizing biaxial nanostructures that exhibit localized hyperbolic phonon resonances with high Q-factors in the mid-infrared. Furthermore, we develop a theory that predicts high-order resonances in anisotropic particles with coupling between the axial permittivites. Finally, we confirm the theoretical predictions through near-field measurements, which demonstrate the existence of both the first and higher-order resonant modes. Our findings provide the foundation for designing a new generation of anisotropic resonators with various applications in the mid-IR range. Our analysis applies to other fields, such as quasi-magnetostatics and heat conduction.</description>

Abstract: The research on sensing the sensitivity of the light field in the whispering gallery mode (WGM) to the micro-cavity environment has already appeared, which uses the frequency shift of the light field in the WGM or the sensitivity of the resonance peak frequency shift. Multi-mode comb teeth of optical frequency comb(OFC) generated by nonlinear micro-cavity have excellent sensitivity to micro-cavity environment, and they have more sensitivity degrees of freedom compared with WGM light field (the strength of each comb tooth can be influenced by micro-cavity environment). The influence of different substances on the environmental parameters of micro-cavity is complex and nonlinear, so we use machine learning method to automatically extract the spectrum characteristics, the average accuracy of single-parameter identification attains to 99.5%, and the average accuracy of double parameter identification attains to 97.0%. Based on the integration of micro-cavity OFC and wave-guide coupling structure, we propose an set of fluid characteristics detection integrated device in theoretically.</description>

      <title>Extremely high extinction ratio electro-optic modulator via frequency upconversion to visible wavelengths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intensity modulators are fundamental components for integrated photonics. From near infrared to visible spectral ranges, they find applications in optical communication and quantum technologies. In particular, they are required for the control and manipulation of atomic systems such as atomic clocks and quantum computers. Typical integrated electro-optic modulators operating at these wavelengths show high bandwidth and low voltage operation, but their extinction ratios are moderate. Here we present an integrated thin-film lithium niobate electro-optic modulator operating in the C-band, which uses a subsequent periodically poled waveguide to convert the modulated signal from 1536 nm to 768 nm using second harmonic generation. We demonstrate that the upconverted signal retains the characteristics of the modulated input signal, reaching a measured high bandwidth of 40 GHz. Due to the nature of the nonlinear process, it exhibits, with respect to the fundamental signal, a doubled extinction ratio of 46 dB, which is the highest recorded for near-infrared light on this platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper discusses certain special Gaussian beams that, thanks to some polynomial prefactors, have uniquely designed holes in the irradiance. Such holes, or rather tubes, can constitute potential valleys for negatively polarizable particles, providing the possibility of guiding several objects of that kind, each along its own trajectory. The mechanism of creating these holes by interference of Gaussian beams which exhibit orbital angular momentum is discussed, and then the trajectories of particles moving in such a wave are numerically calculated. As it turns out, these particles, performing transverse oscillations, follow the designed tunnels of low irradiance. On the contrary, for particles with positive polarizability these areas are inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Scalable photonic diffractive generators through sampling noises from scattering medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic computing, with potentials of high parallelism, low latency and high energy efficiency, have gained progressive interest at the forefront of neural network (NN) accelerators. However, most existing photonic computing accelerators concentrate on discriminative NNs. Large-scale generative photonic computing machines remain largely unexplored, partly due to poor data accessibility, accuracy and hardware feasibility. Here, we harness random light scattering in disordered media as a native noise source and leverage large-scale diffractive optical computing to generate images from above noise, thereby achieving hardware consistency by solely pursuing the spatial parallelism of light. To realize experimental data accessibility, we design two encoding strategies between images and optical noise latent space that effectively solves the training problem. Furthermore, we utilize advanced photonic NN architectures including cascaded and parallel configurations of diffraction layers to enhance the image generation performance. Our results show that the photonic generator is capable of producing clear and meaningful synthesized images across several standard public datasets. As a photonic generative machine, this work makes an important contribution to photonic computing and paves the way for more sophisticated applications such as real world data augmentation and multi modal generation.</description>

Abstract: Data center networks are experiencing unprecedented exponential growth, mostly driven by the continuous computing demands in machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. Within this realm, optical networking offers numerous advantages, including low latency, energy efficiency, and bandwidth transparency, positioning it as a compelling alternative to its electronic counterparts. In this work, we showcase a range of software-defined optical networking applications deployed on a general-purpose programmable integrated photonic processor. Leveraging graph-based theory, we experimentally demonstrate dynamic optical interconnects, circuit switching, and multicasting on the same photonic platform, yielding remarkable results in terms of crosstalk and reconfiguration speed. Our approach harnesses the benefits of reconfigurability and reliability, paving the way for a new generation of high-performance optical devices tailored for data center and computing clusters.</description>

      <title>Analysis of growth of silicon thin films on textured and non-textured surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogenated amorphous silicon alloy films are generally deposited by radio frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RF PECVD) technique on various types of substrates. Generally it is assumed that film quality remains unchanged when deposited on textured or non-textured substrates. Here we analyzed the difference in growth of thin film silicon layers when deposited in a textured and a non-textured surface. In this investigation characteristics of two solar cells were compared, where one cell was prepared on a textured surface ( Cell-A) while the other prepared on a non-textured surface (Cell-B). Defect analysis of the devices were carried out by simulation and device modeling. It shows that the intrinsic film deposited on a textured surface was more defective ($2.4\times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$) than that deposited on a flat surface ($3.2\times 10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$). Although the primary differences in these two cells were thickness of the active layer and nature of surface texturing, the simulation results show that thin film deposited on a textured surface may acquire an increased defect density than that deposited on a flat surface. Lower effective flux density of $SiH_{3}$ precursors on the textured surface can be one of the reasons for higher defect density in the film deposited on textured surface. An Improved light coupling can be achieved by using a thinner doped window layer. By changing the thickness from 15 nm to 3 nm, the short circuit current density increased from 16.4 mA/cm$^{2}$ to 20.96 mA/cm$^{2}$ and efficiency increased from $9.4\%$ to $12.32\%$.</description>

      <title>Identification of a replicable optical security element using laser speckle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An optical security element containing an area of random rough relief is proposed. It combines the low cost of mass replication inherent in traditional security holograms with the impossibility of holographic copying, when the wave restored by the hologram is rewritten as a copy of this hologram. The proposed optical element is also protected from contact and photographic copying. Laboratory samples of optical elements were obtained by taking replicas of a rough surface. Identification of the authenticity of optical elements was demonstrated by calculating the cross-correlation of speckle patterns produced by coherent light scattered off different replicas. It is assumed that the proposed security elements can be mass-produced on standard equipment for embossing security holograms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-finesse microcavities offer a platform for compact, high-precision sensing by employing high-reflectivity, low-loss mirrors to create effective optical path lengths that are orders of magnitude larger than the device geometry. Here, we investigate the radiation hardness of Fabry-Perot microcavities formed from dielectric mirrors deposited on the tips of optical fibers. The microcavities are irradiated under both conventional (~0.1 Gy/s) and ultrahigh (FLASH, ~20 Gy/s) radiotherapy dose rates. Within our measurement sensitivity of ~40 ppm loss, we observe no degradation in the mirror absorption after irradiation with over 300 Gy accumulated dose. This result highlights the excellent radiation hardness of the dielectric mirrors forming the cavities, enabling new optics-based, real-time, in-vivo, tissue-equivalent radiation dosimeters with ~10 micron spatial resolution (our motivation), as well as other applications in high-radiation environments.</description>

      <title>Explanations of MTF discrepancy in grating-based X-ray differential phase contrast CT imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a multi-contrast X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging system, the grating-based Talbot-Lau interferometer is able to generate the absorption contrast and differential phase contrast (DPC) images concurrently. However, experiments found that the absorption CT (ACT) images have better spatial resolution, i.e., higher modulation transfer function (MTF), than the differential phase contrast CT (DPCT) images. Until now, the root cause of such observed discrepancy has not been rigorously investigated. Through physical experiments, this study revealed that the phase grating in the Talbot-Lau interferometer induces direct superposition of paired split absorption signals and inverse superposition of paired split phase signals via diffraction. Further simulation experiments demonstrated that this splitting leads to a reduction in MTF in both ACT and DPCT images, with distinct superposition mechanisms contributing to the lower MTF in DPCT. Besides, such MTF discrepancy may also be affected in a minor extent by object composition, sample size, beam spectra and detector pixel size. Based on this study, the spatial resolution could be optimized when designing a grating-based DPC imaging system.</description>

      <title>Influence of Auger heating and Shockley-Read-Hall recombination on hot carrier dynamics in InGaAs nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of hot carrier relaxation in nanowires (NWs) with one-dimensional (1D) geometry is significant for designing efficient hot carrier solar cells with such nanostructures. Here, we study the influence of Auger heating and Shockley-Read-Hall recombination on hot carrier dynamics of catalyst-free InGaAs-InAlAs core-shell NWs. Using steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy the dependencies of hot carrier effects on the degree of confinement of photo-generated carriers induced by the nanowire diameter are determined at different lattice temperatures. Analysis of excitation-power dependent data and temperature-dependent PL linewidth broadening reveal that at low temperatures, strong Auger recombination and phonon-bottleneck are responsible for hot carrier effects. Our analysis gives also insights into electron-phonon and ionized impurity scattering, showing opposing trends with NW diameter, and it allows to estimate the Fr\"ohlich coupling constant for the InGaAs NWs. Conversely, with increasing lattice temperature, hot carrier relaxation rates increase due to enhanced Shockley-Read Hall and surface recombination. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals a fourfold increase in the rate of Shockley-Read-Hall recombination from 6 ns at 10 K to 1.5 ns at 150 K. The findings suggest that minimizing defect densities in the bulk and surfaces of these NWs will be key to enhance hot carrier effects towards higher temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Space-time metamaterials, or materials with properties changing in space and time, have gained a wide-spread interest due to their exotic properties. In this Letter, we propose a novel temporal metasurface of phononic crystals in one and two-dimensions, that combines the use of nonlocal interactions in phononic crystals to customize dispersion relations, and the use of temporal interfaces to transition from a local material to a nonlocal material and vice-versa, to achieve the interesting phenomenon of \textit{wave-freezing}, where the entire propagating wave is stopped without diffusing or spreading. The phononic crystals are modeled using spring-mass systems and we use finite difference calculations to present our numerical results. We also demonstrate other effects observed in such temporal metasurfaces, such as time-reversed waves, and anomalous temporal refraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum transducer converts an input signal to an output at a different frequency, while maintaining the quantum information with high fidelity. When operating between the microwave and optical frequencies, it is crucial for quantum networking between quantum computers via low-loss optical links, and thereby enabling distributed quantum computing. However, the state-of-the-art quantum transducers suffer from low transduction efficiency due to weak nonlinear coupling, wherein increasing pump power to enhance efficiency leads to inevitable thermal noise from heating. Moreover, we reveal that the efficiency-bandwidth product in such systems is fundamentally limited by pump power and nonlinear coupling coefficient, irrespective of cavity engineering efforts. To resolve the conundrum, we propose to boost the transduction efficiency by consuming entanglement within the same frequency band (e.g., microwave-microwave or optical-optical entanglement). Via a squeezer-coupler-antisqueezer sandwich structure, the protocol enhances the transduction efficiency to unity in the ideal lossless case, given an arbitrarily weak nonlinear coupling, which establishes a high-fidelity quantum communication link without any signal encoding. In practical cavity systems, our entanglement-assisted protocol surpasses the non-assisted fundamental limit of the efficiency-bandwidth product and reduces the threshold cooperativity for positive quantum capacity by a factor proportional to two-mode squeezing gain. Given a fixed cooperativity, our approach increases the broadband quantum capacity by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to create and transfer thermal squeezed states and random-phase coherent states in a system of two interacting levitated nanoparticles. In this coupled levitated system, we create a thermal squeezed state of motion in one of the nanoparticles by parametrically driving it and then transferring the state to the other nanoparticle with high fidelity. The transfer mechanism is based on inducing a non-reciprocal type of coupling in the system by suitably modulating the phases of the trapping lasers and the inter-particle distance between the levitated nanoparticles. This non-reciprocal coupling creates a unidirectional channel where information flows from one nanoparticle to the other nanoparticle but not vice versa, thereby allowing for transfer of mechanical states between the nanoparticles with high fidelity. We also affirm this transfer mechanism by creating and efficiently transferring a random-phase coherent state in the coupled levitated system. Further, we make use of the feedback nonlinearity and parametric driving to create simultaneous bistability in the coupled levitated system. Our results may have potential applications in quantum information processing, quantum metrology, and in exploring many-body physics under a controlled environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) is the leading wide-bandgap semiconductor material, providing mature doping and device fabrication. Additionally, SiC hosts a multitude of optically active point defects (color centers), it is an excellent material for optical resonators due to its high refractive index and an outstanding material for mechanical resonators due to its high Q/f product. Moreover, epitaxial graphene layers can be grown as ultrathin electrodes and provide the potential to fine-tune color center resonances. These characteristics render SiC an ideal platform for experiments with single color centers towards quantum technologies including coupling color centers towards cooperative effects. A crucial step towards harnessing the full potential of the SiC platform includes technologies to create color centers with defined localization and density, e.g.\ to facilitate their coupling to nano-photonic structures and to observe cooperative effects. Here, silicon vacancy centers (V$_{Si}$) stand out as no impurity atom is needed and high-thermal budget annealing steps can be avoided. We characterize the effect of localized, femtosecond laser irradiation of SiC, investigating surface modifications and photoluminescence including Raman spectroscopy and optical lifetime measurements.</description>

Abstract: The effect of quenched disorder in a many-body system is experimentally investigated in a controlled fashion. It is done by measuring the phase synchronization (i.e. mutual coherence) of 400 coupled lasers as a function of tunable disorder and coupling strengths. The results reveal that correlated disorder has a non-trivial effect on the decrease of phase synchronization, which depends on the ratio of the disorder correlation length over the average number of synchronized lasers. The experimental results are supported by numerical simulations and analytic derivations.</description>

      <title>Characterization and Exploitation of the Rotational Memory Effect in Multimode Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an ideal perfectly straight multimode fiber with a circular-core, the symmetry ensures that rotating the input wavefront leads to a corresponding rotation of the output wavefront. This invariant property, known as the rotational memory effect (RME), remains independent of the typically unknown output profile. The RME thus offers significant potential for imaging and telecommunication applications. However, in real-life fibers, this effect is degraded by intrinsic imperfections and external perturbations, and is challenging to observe because of its acute sensitivity to misalignments and aberrations in the optical setup. Thanks to processing involving a spatial light modulator, we efficiently overcome these measurement biases, allowing for precise quantification of the RME. We establish an experimental and theoretical framework for studying and manipulating the RME in multimode fibers. Theoretical predictions are consistent with experimental data and simulations, connecting the shape of the angular-dependent correlation of the RME to the geometrical properties of the core deformation. This work opens the road for accurate characterization of the distributed disorder originating from the fabrication process and calibration-less imaging in multimode fibers.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Polaritons in Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The collective excitations of solids are classified as longitudinal and transverse depending on their relative polarization and propagation direction. This seemingly formal classification results in surprisingly distinct types of excitations if calculated within the Coulomb gauge. Transverse modes couple to free-space photons and hybridize into polaritons for strong light-matter coupling. Longitudinal modes, in contrast, are seen as pure matter excitations that produce a dynamic polarization inside the material without photon coupling. Here we show that both longitudinal and transverse modes become polaritons in the explicitly covariant Lorenz gauge. Longitudinal excitations couple to longitudinal and scalar photons, which have been considered elusive so far. We show that the dipolar excitations become three-fold degenerate in the long-wavelength limit when including all photonic degrees of freedom, as expected from symmetry. Our findings demonstrate how choosing a gauge determines our thinking about materials excitations and how gauge fixing reveals new pathways for tailoring polaritons in crystals, metamaterials, and surfaces. Longitudinal polaritons will interact with longitudinal near fields located at surfaces, which provides additional excitation channels to engineer scanning near-field microscopy and surface-enhanced spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Triangular Cross-Section Beam Splitters in Silicon Carbide for Quantum Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Triangular cross-section color center photonics in silicon carbide is a leading candidate for scalable implementation of quantum hardware. Within this geometry, we model low-loss beam splitters for applications in key quantum optical operations such as entanglement and single-photon interferometry. We consider triangular cross-section single-mode waveguides for the design of a directional coupler. We optimize parameters for a 50:50 beam splitter. Finally, we test the experimental feasibility of the designs by fabricating triangular waveguides in an ion beam etching process and identify suitable designs for short-term implementation.</description>

      <title>Sensing with submarine optical cables</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the theoretical framework for understanding the sensing capabilities of optical fibers. We show the distinct advantage of polarization over phase in detecting subhertz environmental processes. Subsequently, we propose a scheme capable of extracting the spectrum of perturbations affecting a specific section at any position along an optical fiber by detecting the state of polarization of the backreflected light. We discuss two examples of earthquake detection and the detection of sea swells and ocean tides through the analysis of the state of polarization of an optical signal reconstructed by the receiver of a transoceanic cable, obtained from an online database.\cite{zhongwenzhan_2020} Finally, we provide the analytical expression for the cross-correlation of the polarization perturbations of two wavelength division multiplexed channels, and show that the analysis of the polarization correlations between adjacent channels can provide valuable insights into the localization of earthquakes.</description>

      <title>Transmission of vortex electrons through a solenoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that it is generally nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian states (NSLG) rather than the Landau ones that appropriately describe electrons with orbital angular momentum both in their dynamics at a hard-edge boundary between a solenoid and vacuum and inside the magnetic field. It is shown that the r.m.s. radius of the NSLG state oscillates in time and its period-averaged value can significantly exceed the r.m.s. radius of the Landau state, even far from the boundary. We propose to study the unconventional features of quantum dynamics inside a solenoid in several experimental scenarios with vortex electrons described by the NSLG states. Relevance for processes in scanning and transmission electron microscopes, as well as for particle accelerators with relativistic beams is emphasized.</description>

      <title>Edge theory of non-Hermitian skin modes in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish an effective edge theory to characterize non-Hermitian edge-skin modes in higher dimensions. We begin by proposing a bulk projection criterion to straightforwardly identify the localized edges of skin modes. Through an exact mapping, we show that the edge-skin mode shares the same bulk-boundary correspondence and localization characteristics as the zero-energy edge states in a Hermitian semimetal under open-boundary conditions, bridging the gap between non-Hermitian edge-skin effect and Hermitian semimetals. Another key finding is the introduction of ``skewness,'' a term we proposed to describe the characteristic decay direction of skin mode from the localized edge into the bulk. Remarkably, we demonstrate that skewness is an intrinsic quantity of the skin mode and can be analytically determined using the corresponding cylinder-geometry bulk Hamiltonian, without requiring any boundary details. Furthermore, we reveal that in the edge-skin effect, the spectrum exhibits anomalous spectral sensitivity to weak local disturbances, a feature that crucially distinguishes it from the corner-skin effect.</description>

      <title>Large-space and long-time asymptotic behaviors of $N_{\infty}$-soliton solutions (soliton gas) for the focusing Hirota equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hirota equation is one of the integrable higher-order extensions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, and can describe the ultra-short optical pulse propagation in the form $iq_t+\alpha(q_{xx}+ 2|q|^2q)+i\beta (q_{xxx}+ 6|q|^2q_x)=0,\, (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^2\, (\alpha,\,\beta\in\mathbb{R})$. In this paper, we analytically explore the asymptotic behaviors of a soliton gas for the Hirota equation including the complex modified KdV equation, in which the soliton gas is regarded as the limit $N\to \infty$ of $N$-soliton solutions, and characterized using the Riemann-Hilbert problem with discrete spectra restricted in the intervals $(ia, ib)\cup (-ib, -ia)\, (0&lt;a&lt;b)$. We find that this soliton gas tends slowly to the Jaocbian elliptic wave solution with an error $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-1})$ (zero exponentially quickly ) as $x\to -\infty$ ($x\to +\infty$). We also present the long-time asymptotics of the soliton gas under the different velocity conditions: $x/t&gt;4\beta b^2,\, \xi_c&lt;x/t&lt;4\beta b^2,\, x/t&lt;\xi_c$. Moreover, we analyze the property of the soliton gas for the case of the discrete spectra filling uniformly a quadrature domain.</description>
