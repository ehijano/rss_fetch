      <title>On forced RF generation of CW magnetrons for SRF accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CW magnetrons, initially developed for industrial RF heaters, were suggested to power RF cavities of superconducting accelerators due to their higher efficiency and lower cost than traditionally used klystrons, IOTs or solid-state amplifiers. RF amplifiers driven by a master oscillator serve as coherent RF sources. CW magnetrons are regenerative RF generators with a huge regenerative gain. This causes regenerative instability with a large noise when a magnetron operates with the anode voltage above the threshold of self-excitation. Traditionally for stabilization of magnetrons is used injection locking by a quite small signal. Then the magnetron except the injection locked oscillations may generate noise. This may preclude use of standard CW magnetrons in some SRF accelerators. Recently we developed briefly described below a mode for forced RF generation of CW magnetrons when the magnetron startup is provided by the injected forcing signal and the regenerative noise is suppressed. The mode is most suitable for powering high Q-factor SRF cavities.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of FEL-generated THz waves using linear and helical undulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emission of terahertz waves in free electron lasers (FELs) with both linear and helical undulators has been explored. The analysis employs Lienard-Wiechert fields to characterize FEL radiation within the THz region. Specifically, the study delves into the analytical examination of radiation pattern of THz waves, which provides insight into the angular distribution of radiation energy. The variations of radiation pattern for various parameters such as different harmonics, Lorentz factor, magnetic parameter, and total number of periods of linear and helical undulators were investigated. The Fourier transform of free electron laser electric field is showcased across four distinct sets of FEL parameters. The interplay between electron beam and undulators parameters sheds light on how these factors influence the directionality of THz waves. Simulation results indicate that linear undulators often produce radiation with noticeable side lobes, especially at higher harmonics, while helical undulators typically exhibit reduced side lobes, resulting in a more focused main radiation peak. However, the radiation pattern of THz waves tends to concentrate predominantly in the forward direction and the polarization of the emitted radiation is determined by the properties of the undulator and electron beam, rather than the specific undulator geometry. The study underscores that an optimal selection of undulator and beam parameters can effectively maximize the angular distribution of emitted radiation.</description>
