      <title>Shortest Path Separators in Unit Disk Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new balanced separator theorem for unit-disk graphs involving two shortest paths combined with the 1-hop neighbours of those paths and two other vertices. This answers an open problem of Yan, Xiang and Dragan [CGTA '12] and improves their result that requires removing the 3-hop neighborhood of two shortest paths. Our proof uses very different ideas, including Delaunay triangulations and a generalization of the celebrated balanced separator theorem of Lipton and Tarjan [J. Appl. Math. '79] to systems of non-intersecting paths.</description>

      <title>Carving Polytopes with Saws in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of carving an $n$-face triangulated three-dimensional polytope using a tool to make cuts modelled by either a half-plane or sweeps from an infinite ray. In the case of half-planes cuts, we present a deterministic algorithm running in $O(n^2)$ time and a randomized algorithm running in $O(n^{3/2+\varepsilon})$ expected time for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$. In the case of cuts defined by sweeps of infinite rays, we present an algorithm running in $O(n^5)$ time.</description>

      <title>Two Results on LPT: A Near-Linear Time Algorithm and Parcel Delivery using Drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The focus of this paper is to increase our understanding of the Longest Processing Time First (LPT) heuristic. LPT is a classical heuristic for the fundamental problem of uniform machine scheduling. For different machine speeds, LPT was first considered by Gonzalez et al (SIAM J. Computing, 1977). Since then, extensive work has been done to improve the approximation factor of the LPT heuristic. However, all known implementations of the LPT heuristic take $O(mn)$ time, where $m$ is the number of machines and $n$ is the number of jobs. In this work, we come up with the first near-linear time implementation for LPT. Specifically, the running time is $O((n+m)(\log^2{m}+\log{n}))$. Somewhat surprisingly, the result is obtained by mapping the problem to dynamic maintenance of lower envelope of lines, which has been well studied in the computational geometry community.
  Our second contribution is to analyze the performance of LPT for the Drones Warehouse Problem (DWP), which is a natural generalization of the uniform machine scheduling problem motivated by drone-based parcel delivery from a warehouse. In this problem, a warehouse has multiple drones and wants to deliver parcels to several customers. Each drone picks a parcel from the warehouse, delivers it, and returns to the warehouse (where it can also get charged). The speeds and battery lives of the drones could be different, and due to the limited battery life, each drone has a bounded range in which it can deliver parcels. The goal is to assign parcels to the drones so that the time taken to deliver all the parcels is minimized. We prove that the natural approach of solving this problem via the LPT heuristic has an approximation factor of $\phi$, where $\phi \approx 1.62$ is the golden ratio.</description>

      <title>Equality cases of the Alexandrov--Fenchel inequality are not in the polynomial hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05764v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Describing the equality conditions of the Alexandrov--Fenchel inequality has been a major open problem for decades. We prove that in the case of convex polytopes, this description is not in the polynomial hierarchy unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to a finite level. This is the first hardness result for the problem, and is a complexity counterpart of the recent result by Shenfeld and van Handel (arXiv:archive/201104059), which gave a geometric characterization of the equality conditions. The proof involves Stanley's order polytopes and employs poset theoretic technology.</description>

      <title>No Dimensional Sampling Coresets for Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We refine and generalize what is known about coresets for classification problems via the sensitivity sampling framework. Such coresets seek the smallest possible subsets of input data, so one can optimize a loss function on the coreset and ensure approximation guarantees with respect to the original data. Our analysis provides the first no dimensional coresets, so the size does not depend on the dimension. Moreover, our results are general, apply for distributional input and can use iid samples, so provide sample complexity bounds, and work for a variety of loss functions. A key tool we develop is a Radamacher complexity version of the main sensitivity sampling approach, which can be of independent interest.</description>
