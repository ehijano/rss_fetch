      <title>Spatiotemporal modulation of surface texture for information encoding and object manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamically tunable surface textures offer a powerful route to spatiotemporally regulate surface and interfacial properties, enabling emerging applications ranging from adaptive optics to soft robotic manipulation. However, achieving programmable, reversible, and spatiotemporal modulation of surface texture remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we present a photothermal-actuated liquid crystal elastomer bilayer that enables reversible, on-demand spatiotemporal modulation of surface textures through dynamically emerging and propagating wrinkles. Using direct laser writing or projected light fields, programmable and self-erasable wrinkle patterns are generated for dynamic information encoding. This spatiotemporal wrinkling enables object manipulation across diverse geometries, including uphill transport and navigation along predesigned paths. By coupling wrinkle-driven motion with thermally reversible dynamic bonding, the bilayer further enables assembly and disassembly of dynamic polymers, as well as cargo transportation. This work demonstrates spatiotemporally programmable wrinkling as a powerful mechanism for dynamic modulation of surface textures, establishing a versatile platform for multifunctional and reconfigurable smart surfaces.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits on QBER and Distance in Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables information-theoretic secure communication, yet its ultimate tolerance to noise and achievable transmission distance remain fundamentally constrained. We establish the maximum quantum bit error rate (QBER) compatible with secure QKD and derive corresponding upper bounds on communication distance. Our results follow from a fundamental capacity threshold for qubit Pauli channels and apply to protocols based on two or more mutually unbiased bases, using either single-photon or weak coherent sources. By connecting information-theoretic limits to realistic physical noise models, we obtain universal bounds on achievable distances in fiber and free-space links, including diffraction-limited constraints relevant to deep-space quantum communications. These findings clarify the ultimate noise robustness of QKD and delineate the fundamental boundaries of secure quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stabilization of chiral modes in space-time modulated parametric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase control of parametric modulation in coupled oscillator networks enables sculpting of dynamical states with desired spatiotemporal symmetries. Symmetry-aware Floquet analysis successfully predicts such states in linear systems, but whether their symmetry properties persist under nonlinearity remains largely unexplored. Here, we establish the existence of nonlinear chiral steady states in a trio of coupled parametric oscillators with modulation phases chosen to selectively amplify a circulating mode in the linearized system. We find that a cubic nonlinearity arrests exponential growth of the amplified mode, producing a steady finite-amplitude motion that retains the expected chirality. By exploiting space-time symmetry, we reduce the dynamics to a single averaged equation that quantitatively predicts nonlinear trajectories, steady-state amplitudes, and characteristic time scales. The chiral steady states possess finite basins of attraction and are accessible from wide ranges of initial conditions and system parameters. Finite-element simulations of elastic plate resonators quantitatively reproduce these features, establishing the relevance of the reduced model to realistic continuum systems. Our results demonstrate that desirable properties of linear time-modulated systems, such as chirality and directional amplification, persist into strongly nonlinear regimes, opening pathways to robust nonreciprocal signal routing and amplification in parametrically driven platforms.</description>

      <title>Growth-controlled photochromism in yttrium oxyhydride thin films deposited by HiPIMS and pulsed-DC magnetron sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study investigates photochromic oxygen-containing yttrium hydride (YHO) thin films deposited by reactive high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) and compares their photochromic, optical, and structural properties with those of films synthesized by reactive pulsed direct current magnetron sputtering (pulsed-DCMS). Optical emission spectroscopy reveals that, unlike pulsed-DCMS where Ar$^{+}$ ions dominate, HiPIMS discharges are characterised by strong Y$^{+}$ emission, evidencing high yttrium ionisation and substantial self-sputter recycling. The critical working pressure (P$_c$) required to obtain transparent and photochromic films is higher for HiPIMS (Pc $\approx$ 1.0 Pa) than for pulsed-DCMS (Pc $\approx$ 0.5 Pa). Although films deposited near Pc exhibit similar solar transmittance (~72 %) and lattice parameters (5.38--5.39 \r{A}), the pulsed-DCMS film shows a substantially higher relative photochromic contrast (34 %) and a lower optical band gap (2.70 eV) compared with the HiPIMS film (9 % contrast and 2.94 eV). This difference is partly attributed to a lower oxygen-to-hydrogen atomic ratio in the pulsed-DCMS film. Structurally, HiPIMS films are largely polycrystalline with random out-of-plane crystallographic orientation, whereas pulsed-DCMS films exhibit a pronounced &lt;100&gt; out-of-plane preferred orientation. These results demonstrate that, beyond composition, thin-film growth conditions and microstructure play a crucial role in governing the photochromic performance of YHO.</description>

      <title>Electromechanical Switching and Momentum-Selective Transport in Geometry-Defined Blue Phosphorus Homojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing intrinsic homojunctions without chemical heterogeneity remains a key challenge in future two - dimensional devices. Here, we report a geometry - defined metal--semiconductor--metal homojunction in bilayer blue phosphorus (BlueP) created by a localized bubble corrugation, without chemical doping or foreign - material interfaces. First - principles calculations show that enlarging the interlayer separation in the metallic A\(_1\)B\(_1\) - stacked BlueP bilayer opens a band gap, enabling a semiconducting barrier embedded between metallic segments. First - principles quantum - transport simulations reveal a crossover from ballistic to tunneling transport upon bubble formation. In the tunneling regime, transmission decreases exponentially with bubble width while remaining weakly sensitive to bubble height and bulging direction. The junction acts as an orientation - dependent \(k\) - space filter, producing transport anisotropy and momentum selectivity. Orbital - resolved scattering analysis shows that intralayer - bonding channels persist under deformation whereas interlayer - hybridized channels are quenched, and that \sigma - type bonding yields higher conductance than \pi - type bonding. These insights motivate two electromechanical device concepts: a mechanically switchable memory element with ON/OFF ratios up to 30 and a nanoscale sliding rheostat with reproducible exponential resistance tuning for \AA - scale displacement sensing.</description>

      <title>Temporal metamaterials with passive switching as impedance-matched absorbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments on temporal reflection in transmission line metamaterials and theoretical treatments of dispersive time-varying media have unearthed the fundamental role of modulation mechanisms on the interface conditions, underpinning the introduction of passive photonic time crystals with stable momentum band gaps. Drawing from these concepts, it is shown that temporal metamaterials with simultaneous passive permittivity and permeability switching exhibit wideband absorption with impedance-matching, effectively behaving as one-dimensional perfectly matched layers. Under the effective medium theory, the loss mechanism is attributed to the emergent effective electric and magnetic conductivities, which are used to derive an approximate matching condition for asynchronous modulation and to engineer lossy material properties. The proposed approach and its performance beyond the Rozanov bound are verified with semi-analytical calculations as well as full-wave simulations, and the possibility of realizing a two-dimensional temporal perfectly matched layer is discussed.</description>

      <title>Exact Solutions to Acoustoelectric Interactions in Arbitrary Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acoustoelectric interactions occur when free carriers in a semiconductor interact with the fields of an acoustic wave in a piezoelectric medium. These interactions can amplify acoustic waves, as well as give rise to extremely large phononic nonlinearities and strong non-reciprocal effects. The field of acoustoelectric devices is currently dependent on analytical and perturbative solutions for the two simplest arrangements of piezoelectric-semiconductor materials. While these canonical models have allowed the field to advance substantially, new geometries are arising that do not satisfy assumptions integral to these models. These assumptions include the treatment of the interactions between the acoustic fields and free carriers as weak, the neglect of the tensorial nature of the material properties, the omission of the spatial variations in the phonons' electric field profiles, and the disregard of elastic coupling across material boundaries, among others. We develop, for the first time, a finite element method (FEM) model to solve for acoustoelectric interactions in arbitrary geometries that avoids making the assumptions of the canonical models. We verify the FEM model using results for amplification, dispersion, and non-reciprocity obtained from the canonical models in their regime of validity. We then examine the acoustoelectric effect in two geometries not covered by the canonical models: a thin piezoelectric film placed on a semiconductor substrate and a fully 2D waveguide under a thin semiconductor layer. This work lays the foundation for accurate modeling of arbitrary acoustoelectric geometries such as those currently being developed for all-acoustic radio frequency (RF) signal processing, acoustoelectrically enhanced photonic devices, and quantum acoustoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Composable and adaptive design of machine learning interatomic potentials guided by Fisher-information analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An adaptive physics-inspired model design strategy for machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is proposed. This strategy relies on iterative reconfigurations of composite models from single-term models, followed by a unified training procedure. A model evaluation method based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and multiple-property error metrics is also proposed to guide the model reconfiguration and hyperparameter optimization. By combining the reconfiguration and the evaluation subroutines, we provide an adaptive MLIP design strategy that balances flexibility and extensibility. In a case study of designing models against a structurally diverse niobium dataset, we managed to obtain an optimal model configuration with 75 parameters generated by our framework that achieved a force RMSE of 0.172 eV/{\AA} and an energy RMSE of 0.013 eV/atom.</description>
