      <title>Crisis Alpha: A High-Performance Trading Algorithm Tested in Market Downturns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forming quantitative portfolios using statistical risk models presents a significant challenge for hedge funds and portfolio managers. This research investigates three distinct statistical risk models to construct quantitative portfolios of 1,000 floating stocks in the US market. Utilizing five different investment strategies, these models are tested across four periods, encompassing the last three major financial crises: The Dot Com Bubble, Global Financial Crisis, and Covid-19 market downturn. Backtests leverage the CRSP dataset from January 1990 through December 2023. The results demonstrate that the proposed models consistently outperformed market excess returns across all periods. These findings suggest that the developed risk models can serve as valuable tools for asset managers, aiding in strategic decision-making and risk management in various economic conditions.</description>

      <title>The Merton's Default Risk Model for Public Company</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we developed the Merton's structural model for public companies under an assumption that liabilities of the companies are observed. Using Campbell and Shiller's approximation method, we obtain formulas of risk-neutral equity and liability values and default probabilities for the public companies. Also, the paper provides ML estimators of suggested model's parameters.</description>

      <title>Risk sharing with Lambda value at risk under heterogeneous beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the risk sharing problem among multiple agents using Lambda Value-at-Risk as their preference functional, under heterogeneous beliefs, where beliefs are represented by several probability measures. We obtain semi-explicit formulas for the inf-convolution of multiple Lambda Value-at-Risk measures under heterogeneous beliefs and the explicit forms of the corresponding optimal allocations. To show the impact of belief heterogeneity, we consider three cases: homogeneous beliefs, conditional beliefs and absolutely continuous beliefs. For those cases, we find more explicit expressions for the inf-convolution, showing the influence of the relation of the beliefs on the inf-convolution. Moreover, we consider, in a two-agent setting, the inf-convolution of one Lambda Value-at-Risk and a general risk measure, including expected utility, distortion risk measures and Lambda Value-at-Risk as special cases, with differing beliefs. The expression of the inf-convolution and the form of the optimal allocation are obtained. In all above cases we demonstrate that trivial outcomes arise when both belief inconsistency and risk tolerance are high. Finally, we discuss risk sharing for an alternative definition of Lambda Value-at-Risk.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Seasonal Weather Risk in Indian Markets: Stochastic Model for Risk-Averse State-Specific Temperature Derivative Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This technical report presents a stochastic model for pricing weather derivatives and devising hedging strategies tailored to Indian markets. We model temperature dynamics using a modified Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with jumps to account for sudden shocks, such as heatwaves and coldwaves. Historical data from 12 Indian states (1951-2023) is used for calibration, and Monte Carlo simulations are employed under the risk-neutral measure to price Heating Degree Days (HDD), Cooling Degree Days (CDD), and extreme event options. Sensitivity analysis reveals that a 20% increase in volatility leads to an approximate 4.2% increase in option prices, highlighting the critical impact of volatility on derivative pricing. Results show that HDD options in colder states like Himachal Pradesh are significantly more expensive, with prices reaching up to INR 684,693, while CDD options in hotter states like Gujarat are priced higher, up to INR 262,986. A comprehensive portfolio analysis indicates that investing INR 120,000 in HDD put options in Uttar Pradesh yields an expected payoff of INR 132,369, resulting in a return on investment (ROI) of 10.3%. Conversely, a similar investment in Karnataka yields a negative ROI of -66.7% due to its milder climate. Hedging strategies are tailored to each state's climatic risk, with recommendations to buy 90.66 HDD put options at a strike of 90.89 in Uttar Pradesh and invest in CDD call options in Gujarat. These insights offer practical solutions for managing temperature-related financial risk in energy and agriculture, providing actionable, state-specific hedging strategies for diverse climatic scenarios in India.</description>
