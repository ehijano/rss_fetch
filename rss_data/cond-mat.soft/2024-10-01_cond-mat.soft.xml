      <title>Active morphodynamics of intracellular organelles in the trafficking pathway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the Golgi apparatus to endosomes, organelles in the endomembrane system exhibit complex and varied morphologies that are often related to their function. Such membrane-bound organelles operate far from equilibrium due to directed fluxes of smaller trafficking vesicles; the physical principles governing the emergence and maintenance of these structures have thus remained elusive. By understanding individual fission and fusion events in terms of active mechano-chemical cycles, we show how such trafficking manifests at the hydrodynamic scale, resulting not only in fluxes of material -- such as membrane area and encapsulated volume -- but also in active stresses that drive momentum transfer between an organelle and its cytosolic environment. Due to the fluid and deformable nature of the bounding membrane, this gives rise to novel physics, coupling nonequilibrium forces to organelle composition, morphology and hydrodynamic flows. We demonstrate how both stable compartment drift and ramified sac-like morphologies, each reminiscent of Golgi-cisternae, emerge naturally from the same underlying nonequilibrium dynamics of fission and fusion.</description>

      <title>Collective action and entanglement of magnetically active liquid crystal elastomer ribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between active individuals in animal collectives lead to emergent responses that remain elusive in synthetic soft matter. Here, shape-morphing polymers are used to create bio-inspired transient solids that self-assemble with controlled mechanical properties and disassemble on demand. Dilute-suspensions of magnetic, heat-responsive liquid crystal elastomer ribbons mechanically interlock, inducing reversible aggregation. A mathematical model is developed that sheds light on the role of topological mechanisms in aggregation. Aggregation was favored for ribbons with moderate curvature at 25C above crosslinking temperature as compared to flat ribbons or higher curvature ribbons at higher temperatures. The ribbon suspensions reversibly transition between fluid- and solid-like states, exhibiting up to 6 orders-of-magnitude increase in the storage moduli of the entangled aggregates compared with the liquid dispersions. Controlled dissociation is induced by imparting kinetic energy to the individual ribbons at high magnetic field rotation speeds (&gt; 200 RPM). Ribbon shape and the medium in which dissociation occurs were shown to govern disassembly. Imparting dynamic collective behaviors into synthetic systems may enable a range of potential applications from bio-inspired soft robotics to injectable biomaterials.</description>

      <title>IceCoder: Identification of Ice phases in molecular simulation using variational autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification and classification of different phases of ice within molecular simulations is a challenging task due to the complex and varied phase space of ice, which includes numerous crystalline and amorphous forms. Traditional order parameters often struggle to differentiate between these phases, especially under conditions of thermal fluctuations. In this work, we present a novel machine learning-based framework, \textit{IceCoder}, which combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) with the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptor to classify a large number of ice phases effectively. Our approach compresses high-dimensional SOAP vectors into a two-dimensional latent space using VAE, facilitating the visualization and distinction of various ice phases. We trained the model on a comprehensive dataset generated through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and demonstrated its ability to accurately detect various phases of crystalline ice as well as liquid water at the molecular level. IceCoder provides a robust and generalizable tool for tracking ice phase transitions in simulations, overcoming limitations of traditional methods. This approach may be generalized to detect polymorphs in other molecular crystals as well, leading to new insights into the microscopic mechanisms underlying nucleation, growth, and phase transitions, while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Universality in diffusion-controlled nucleation and growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nucleation and growth is studied in a system undergoing diffusion-controlled condensation under gradual changes in parameters, such as cooling. It is demonstrated that when Gibbs-Thompson effect becomes negligible, the system falls into a universal regime. i.e. the final droplet size distribution remains invariant under certain rescaling of system parameters. An approximate yet very accurate analytic form is obtained for the size distribution function in this regime.</description>

      <title>Generating ultradense jammed ellipse packings using biased SWAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a Lubachevsky-Stillinger-like growth algorithm combined with biased SWAP Monte Carlo and transient degrees of freedom, we generate ultradense disordered jammed ellipse packings. For all aspect ratios $\alpha$, these packings exhibit significantly smaller intermediate-wavelength density fluctuations and greater local nematic order than their less-dense counterparts. The densest packings are disordered despite having packing fractions $\phi_{\rm J}(\alpha)$ that are within less than 0.5% of that of the monodisperse-ellipse crystal [$\phi_{\rm xtal} = \pi/(2\sqrt{3}) \simeq .9069$] over the range $1.25 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim 1.4$ and coordination numbers $Z_{\rm J}(\alpha)$ that are within less than 0.5% of isostaticity [$Z_{\rm iso} = 6$] over the range $1.3 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim 2.0$. Lower-$\alpha$ packings are strongly fractionated and consist of polycrystals of intermediate-size particles, with the largest and smallest particles isolated at the grain boundaries. Higher-$\alpha$ packings are also fractionated, but in a qualitatively-different fashion; they are composed of increasingly-large locally-nematic domains reminiscent of liquid glasses.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamic length increases monotonically in pinned and unpinned glass forming systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Random First Order Transition Theory (RFOT) predicts that transport proceeds by cooperative movement of particles in domains whose sizes increase as a liquid is compressed above a characteristic volume fraction, $\phi_d$. The rounded dynamical transition around $\phi_d$, which signals a crossover to activated transport, is accompanied by a growing correlation length that is predicted to diverge at the thermodynamic glass transition density ($&gt; \phi_d$). Simulations and imaging experiments probed the single particle dynamics of mobile particles in response to pinning all the particles in a semi-infinite space or randomly pinning (RP) a fraction of particles in a liquid at equilibrium. The extracted dynamic length increases non-monotonically with a peak around $\phi_d$. This finding is at variance with the results obtained using the small wave length limit of a four-point structure factor for unpinned systems. To obtain a consistent picture of the growth of the dynamic length, one that is impervious to the use of RP, we introduce a multi particle structure factor, $S^c_{mp}(q,t)$, that probes collective dynamics. The collective dynamic length, calculated from the small wave vector limit of $S^c_{mp}(q,t)$, increases monotonically as a function of the volume fraction in glass forming binary mixture of charged colloidal particles in both unpinned and pinned systems. This prediction, which also holds in the presence of added monovalent salt, may be validated using imaging experiments.</description>

      <title>Lift Force on a Moving Intruder in Granular Shear Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lift and drag forces on moving intruders in granular materials are of fundamental interest. While the drag force on an intruder in granular flow has been studied, the few studies characterizing the lift force explore a relatively limited range of parameters. Here we use discrete element method (DEM) simulations to measure the lift force, $F_\mathrm{L}$, on a spherical intruder in a uniformly sheared bed of smaller spheres for a range of intruder slip velocities, $u_\mathrm{s}$, relative to the unperturbed flow. In what at first appears as a puzzling result, $F_\mathrm{L}$ in granular shear flow acts in the opposite direction to the Saffman lift force on a sphere in a sheared fluid at low $u_\mathrm{s}$, reaches a maximum value, and then decreases, eventually reversing direction and becoming comparable to $F_\mathrm{L}$ for a fluid. This non-monotonic response holds over a range of flow conditions, and the $F_\mathrm{L}$ versus $u_\mathrm{s}$ data can be collapsed by scaling both quantities using the particle sizes, shear rate, and overburden pressure. Analogous fluid simulations demonstrate that the flow field around the intruder particle is similar in the granular and fluid cases. However, the shear stress acting on the intruder in a granular shear flow is much less than that in a fluid shear flow. This difference, combined with a void region behind the intruder in granular flow, which alters the pressure and shear stress on the trailing side of the intruder, significantly changes the lift-force inducing stresses acting on the intruder between the granular and fluid cases.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis-induced phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemotaxis allows single cells to self-organize at the population level, as classically described by Keller-Segel models. We show that chemotactic aggregation can be understood using a generalized Maxwell construction based on the balance of density fluxes and reactive turnover. This formulation implies that aggregates generically undergo coarsening, which is interrupted and reversed by cell growth and death. Together, both stable and spatiotemporally dynamic aggregates emerge. Our theory mechanistically links chemotactic self-organization to phase separation and reaction-diffusion patterns.</description>

      <title>Coarsening dynamics of chemotactic aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auto-chemotaxis, the directed movement of cells along gradients in chemicals they secrete, is central to the formation of complex spatiotemporal patterns in biological systems. Since the introduction of the Keller-Segel model, numerous variants have been analyzed, revealing phenomena such as coarsening of aggregates, stable aggregate sizes, and spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics. Here, we consider general mass-conserving Keller-Segel models, that is, models without cell growth and death, and analyze the generic long-time dynamics of the chemotactic aggregates. Building on and extending our previous work, which demonstrated that chemotactic aggregation can be understood through a generalized Maxwell construction balancing density fluxes and reactive turnover, we use singular perturbation theory to derive the full rates of mass competition between well-separated aggregates. We analyze how this mass-competition process drives coarsening in both diffusion- and reaction-limited regimes, with the diffusion-limited rate aligning with our previous quasi-steady-state analyses. Our results generalize earlier mathematical findings, demonstrating that coarsening is driven by self-amplifying mass transport and aggregate coalescence. Additionally, we provide a linear stability analysis of the lateral instability, predicting it through a nullcline-slope criterion similar to the curvature criterion in spinodal decomposition. Overall, our findings suggest that chemotactic aggregates behave similarly to phase-separating droplets, providing a robust framework for understanding the coarse-grained dynamics of auto-chemotactic cell populations and providing a basis for the analysis of more complex multi-species chemotactic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous mechanical self-assembly of monodisperse bubbles generally leads to disordered foams at low density: producing crystalline structures such as Kelvin foams has proven to be challenging experimentally, despite them being a minimum of energy. Here we show how bubbling in different fiber arrays controls foam architectures through a guided mechanical self-assembly. Analyzing X-ray tomography scans of solidified polymer foams using Steinhardt's parameters highlights clear signatures of Kelvin and hexagonal close packing crystalline foams, opening a novel route towards ordered hierarchical materials.</description>

      <title>Topology affects diffusion dynamics of ring polymers in dilute solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, ring polymers have become one of the most widely studied subjects of macromolecular physics research. These molecules can be synthesized with fascinating supramolecular topological constraints, which include molecular knots, and mechanically interlocked rings such as catenanes. The diffusion dynamics of such unique macromolecules also play a fundamental role in comprehending the physics of DNA and cellular chromatin. While most studies on the diffusion of topologically complex polymer chains have been done by keeping their molecular weight constant, where the distinct effect of topology is dominated by the size of the polymers, comparative studies for the same sizes are scanty. Hence, in the present work, we investigate the role of topology on the translational and rotational diffusion dynamics of ring polymers with supramolecular topological constraints. We have modeled linear, ring, catenane (two interlocked rings), and trefoil-knot for three constant hydrodynamic radius($R_h$) cases under good solvent conditions in the limit of infinite dilution. In each case, the molecular weights of the four topologically distinct polymer chains are selected such that their resulting hydrodynamic radius are approximately constant. The solvent particles are modeled using multi-particle collision dynamics. We find that, while the rate of translational diffusion of these four topologically distinct polymer chains are approximately equal to each other at constant $R_h$ and agrees well with the Zimm theory in all three cases, there is a appreciable difference in the values of the rotational diffusion coefficients. The explicit role of the topology on the diffusion dynamics of ring polymers is delineated by comparing the results of the present work with the results for star polymers.</description>

      <title>Reprogrammable, in-materia matrix-vector multiplication with floppy modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix-vector multiplications are a fundamental building block of artificial intelligence; this essential role has motivated their implementation in a variety of physical substrates, from memristor crossbar arrays to photonic integrated circuits. Yet their realization in soft-matter intelligent systems remains elusive. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a reprogrammable elastic metamaterial that computes matrix-vector multiplications using floppy modes -- deformations with near-zero stored elastic energy. Floppy modes allow us to program complex deformations without being hindered by the natural stiffness of the material; but their practical application is challenging, as their existence depends on global topological properties of the system. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a continuously parameterized unit cell design with well-defined compatibility characteristics. This unit cell is then combined to form arbitrary matrix-vector multiplications that can even be reprogrammed after fabrication. Our results demonstrate that floppy modes can act as key enablers for embodied intelligence, smart MEMS devices and in-sensor edge computing.</description>

      <title>Isovolumetric dividing active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and theoretically investigate a minimal particle-based model for a new class of active matter where particles exhibit directional, volume-conserving division in confinement while interacting sterically, mimicking cells in early embryogenesis. We find that complex motion, synchronized within division cycles, displays strong collective effects and becomes self-similar in the long-time limit. Introducing the method of normalized retraced trajectories, we show that the transgenerational motion caused by cell division can be mapped to a time-inhomogenous random walk with an exponentially decreasing length scale. Analytical predictions for this stochastic process allow us to extract effective parameters, indicating unusual effects of crowding and absence of jamming. Robustness of our findings against desynchronized divisions, cell size dispersity, and variations in confinement hints at universal behavior. Our results establish an understanding of complex dynamics exhibited by isovolumentric division over long timescales, paving the way for new bioengineering strategies and perspectives on living matter.</description>

      <title>Presence of a Spatially Varying Electric Field at Lipid-Water Interface with Na/K ratio in Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ion-lipid interface in Langmuir monolayers of Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) on pure water and 10 mM solutions of Na+ and K+ at different [K+]/[Na+] (a), atom/atom ratios, were studied initially by Surface Pressure (p) versus Specific Molecular Area (A) isotherms. The values of a were chosen as 0 (no K+), 0.43 ([K+]:[Na+] = 30:70) and 1.0 ([K+]:[Na+] = 50:50) These monolayers were studied through X-Ray Reflectivity (XRR) and Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy at the O K-edge. The two-dimensional rigidity of the monolayer was found to increase with Na+ ions with respect to the pristine monolayer but fall drastically and non-linearly below the pristine value with introduction of the K+ ions, as a was increased. Analysis of the XRR profiles provided the thickness, average electron density (aed) and the interfacial roughness of the phosphatidylcholine head group and the two hydrocarbon tails of the monolayers on Si (001), from which the angle (f) between the head and the tails was determined. This was also follow the same as former one. From NEXAFS, it was found that a linear increase in the cation ratio towards K led to a nonlinear variation in the P=O bond energy and a weakening of the P-O bond energy, the latter becoming more pronounced with K ions, consistent with Fajans rule. Also a split in the C=O p-bond peak was observed at a = 1.0. These results cannot be explained with the model of a uniform electric field due to the cations, which would fall linearly with increase in the K+ proportion, and rather suggest a structured field due a spatial variation in charge density in an interfacial layer of high ion concentration assembled by the counterionic attraction of the phosphatidylcholine head groups. Our results have important implications for the cell membrane, where such mixtures at high concentrations constitute the norm.</description>

      <title>Role of intercellular adhesion in modulating tissue fluidity</title>

Abstract: Tuning cell rearrangements is essential in collective cell movement that underlies cancer progression, wound repair, and embryonic development. A key question is how tissue material properties and morphology emerge from cellular factors such as cell-cell adhesion. Here, we introduce a two-dimensional active force-based model of tissue monolayers that captures the liquid-to-solid transition exhibited by tissues. Unlike the Vertex and Voronoi models, our model shows that reducing intercellular adhesion in near-confluent tissues leads to spontaneous neighbor exchanges and fluidization. Near the liquid-solid phase boundary, we also found glassy behavior characterized by subdiffusive dynamics, swirling cell motion, and non-Gaussian exponential tails in displacement distributions. These exponential tails collapse onto a single master curve, suggesting a universal 'diffusion length' in the glassy regime. Notably, we demonstrate that structural parameters based on cell shape cannot always distinguish tissue phases due to huge cell shape fluctuations that are not observed in Vertex and Voronoi models. Our general simulation framework streamlines previous approaches by removing many arbitrary features and can reproduce known model behaviors under different conditions, offering potential applications in developmental biology and physiology.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Interface Laws of Turing Mixtures and Foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For cellular functions like division and polarization, protein pattern formation driven by NTPase cycles is a central spatial control strategy. Operating far from equilibrium, no general theory links microscopic reaction networks and parameters to the pattern type and dynamics. We discover a generic mechanism giving rise to an effective interfacial tension organizing the macroscopic structure of non-equilibrium steady-state patterns. Namely, maintaining protein-density interfaces by cyclic protein attachment and detachment produces curvature-dependent protein redistribution which straightens the interface. We develop a non-equilibrium Neumann angle law and Plateau vertex conditions for interface junctions and mesh patterns, thus introducing the concepts of ``Turing mixtures'' and ``Turing foams''. In contrast to liquid foams and mixtures, these non-equilibrium patterns can select an intrinsic wavelength by interrupting an equilibrium-like coarsening process. Data from in vitro experiments with the E. coli Min protein system verifies the vertex conditions and supports the wavelength dynamics. Our study uncovers interface laws with correspondence to thermodynamic relations that arise from distinct physical processes in active systems. It allows the design of specific pattern morphologies with potential applications as spatial control strategies in synthetic cells.</description>

      <title>Emergent dynamics and spatiotemporal patterns in soft robotic swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collective swimming of soft robots in an infinite viscous fluid is an emergent phenomenon due to the non-reciprocal hydrodynamic interactions between individual swimmers. These physical interactions give rise to unique spatiotemporal patterns and unusual swimming trajectories that are often difficult to predict due to the two-way fully coupled nature of the strong fluid-structure interaction at a thermodynamic state that is far from equilibrium. Until now, robotic swarms have mostly been studied for rigid swimmers in two-dimensional settings. Here we study the emergence of three-dimensional spatiotemporal patterns of helical magnetically actuated soft-robotic swimmers by systematically studying the effect of different initial configurations. Our results show that swimmers with variations in initial positions in the swimming direction are attracted to each other, while swimmers with variations in lateral positions repel each other, eventually converging to a state in which all swimmers concentrate in one lateral plane drifting radially outward.</description>

      <title>Learning thermodynamics and topological order of the 2D XY model with generative real-valued restricted Boltzmann machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting the topological Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition in the prototypical 2D XY model using unsupervised machine learning methods has long been a challenging problem due to the lack of suitable order parameters. To address this issue, we begin with a conventional real-valued RBM (RBM-xy), which uses exponential conditional probabilities to generate visible units. We then develop a novel real-valued RBM (RBM-CosSin) featuring nonlinear cos/sin activation, whose visible units follow the von Mises distribution. Our findings reveal that RBM-CosSin effectively learns the underlying Boltzmann distribution of 2D XY systems and generate authentic XY configurations that accurately capture both thermodynamics and topological order (vortex). Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to extract phase transition information, including the KT transition, from the weight matrices without relying on prior physics knowledge.</description>

      <title>Polymer Concentration Regimes from Fractional Microrheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10130v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a framework for deriving theoretical equations for mean squared displacement (MSD) and fractional Fokker-Planck (FFP) is developed for any arbitrary rheological model. The obtained general results are then specified for different fractional rheological models. To test the novel equations extracted from our framework and bridge the gap between microrheology and fractional rheological models, microrheology of polystyrene (PS) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solutions at several polymer concentrations is measured. By comparing the experimental and theoretical MSDs, we find the fractional rheological parameters and demonstrate for the first time that the polymer concentration regimes can be distinguished using the fractional exponent and relaxation time data because of the existence of a distinct behavior in each regime. We suggest simple approximations for the critical overlap concentration and the shear viscosity of viscoelastic liquid-like solutions. This work provides a more sensitive approach for distinguishing different polymer concentration regimes and measuring the critical overlap concentration and shear viscosity of polymeric solutions, which is useful when conventional rheological characterization methods are unreliable due to the volatility and low viscosity of the samples.</description>

      <title>Hybrid particle-phase field model and renormalized surface tension in dilute suspensions of nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a two-phase field model and a hybrid particle-phase field model to simulate dilute colloidal sedimentation and flotation near a liquid-gas interface (or fluid-fluid interface in general). Both models are coupled to the incompressible Stokes equation, which is solved numerically using a combination of sine and regular Fourier transforms to account for the no-slip boundary conditions at the boundaries. The continuum two-phase field model allows us to analytically solve the equilibrium interfacial profile using a perturbative approach, demonstrating excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Notably, we show that strong coupling to particle dynamics can significantly alter the liquid-gas interface, thereby modifying the liquid-gas interfacial tension. In particular, we show that the renormalized surface tension is monotonically decreasing with increasing colloidal particle concentration and decreasing buoyant mass.</description>

      <title>Universal Aspects of Barrier Crossing Under Bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.16277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal activation process by which a system passes from one local energy minimum to another is a recurring motif in physics, chemistry, and biology. For instance, biopolymer chains are typically modeled in terms of energy landscapes, with folded and unfolded conformations represented by two distinct wells separated by a barrier. The rate of transfer between wells depends primarily on the height of the barrier, but it also depends on the details of the shape of the landscape along the trajectory. We consider the case of bias due to an external force, analogous to the pulling force applied in optical tweezer experiments on biopolymers. Away from the Arrhenius-law limit and well out of equilibrium, somewhat idiosyncratic behavior might be expected. Instead, we identify universal behavior of the biased activated-barrier-crossing process and demonstrate that data collapse onto a universal curve can be achieved for simulated data over a wide variety of energy landscapes having barriers of different height and shape and for loading rates spanning many orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Thickness of the Air-Water Interface from Two Extremes of Interface Hydrogen Bond Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.13941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The air-water interface plays a crucial role in many aspects of science, because of its unique properties, such as a two-dimensional hydrogen bond (HB) network and completely different HB dynamics compared to bulk water. However, accurately determining the boundary of interfacial and bulk water, that is, the thickness of the air-water interface, still challenges experimentalists. Various simulation-based methods have been developed to estimate the thickness, converging on a range of approximately 3--10 (Angstrom). In this study, we introduce a novel approach, grounded in density functional theory-based molecular dynamics and deep potential molecular dynamics simulations, to measure the air-water interface thickness, offering a different perspective based on prior research. To capture realistic HB dynamics in the air-water interface, two extreme scenarios of the interface HB dynamics are obtained: one underestimates the interface HB dynamics, while the other overestimates it. Surprisingly, our results suggest that the interface HB dynamics in both scenarios converges as the thickness of the air-water interface increases to 4 (Angstrom). This convergence point, indicative of the realistic interface thickness, is also validated by our calculation of anisotropic decay of OH stretch and the free OH dynamics at the air-water interface.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic cost of finite-time stochastic resetting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11267v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have implemented resetting by means of an external trap, whereby a system relaxes to the minimum of the trap and is reset in a finite time. In this work, we set up and analyse the thermodynamics of such a protocol. We present a general framework, even valid for non-Poissonian resetting, that captures the thermodynamic work required to maintain a resetting process up to a given observation time, and exactly calculate the moment generating function of this work. Our framework is valid for a wide range of systems, the only assumption being relaxation to equilibrium in the resetting trap. Examples and extensions are considered. In the case of Brownian motion, we investigate optimal resetting schemes that minimise work and its fluctuations, the mean work for arbitrary switching protocols and comparisons to previously studied resetting schemes. Numerical simulations are performed to validate our findings.</description>

      <title>Melting of a vortex matter Wigner crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional One-Component Plasma (OCP) is a foundational model of the statistical mechanics of interacting particles, describing phenomena common to astrophysics, turbulence, and the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE). Despite an extensive literature, the phase diagram of the 2D OCP is still a subject of some controversy. Here we develop a "vortex matter" simulator to realize the logarithmic-interaction OCP experimentally by exploiting the topological character of quantized vortices in a thin superfluid layer. Precision optical-tweezer control of the location of quantized vortices enables direct preparation of the OCP ground state with or without defects, and heating from acoustic excitations allows the observation of the melting transition from the solid Wigner crystal through the liquid phase. We present novel theoretical analysis that is in quantitative agreement with experimental observations, and demonstrates how equilibrium states are achieved through the system dynamics. This allows a precise measurement of the superfluid-thermal cloud mutual friction and heating coefficients. This platform provides a route towards solving a number of open problems in systems with long-range interactions. At equilibrium, it could distinguish between the competing scenarios of grain boundary melting and KTHNY theory. Dynamical simulators could test the existence of predicted edge-wave solitons which form a hydrodynamic analogue of topological edge states in the FQHE.</description>
