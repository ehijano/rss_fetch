      <title>Global geometric estimates for the heat equation via duality methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss first-order and second-order regularization effects for solutions to the classical heat equation. In particular we propose a global approach to study smoothing effects of Hamilton-Li-Yau type: such approach is nonlinear in spirit and it is based on the Bernstein method and duality techniques \`a la Evans. In a similar way, we also deal with the conservation of geometric properties for the heat flow as initiated by Brascamp-Lieb. In contrast to maximum principle methods based on sup-norm procedures, the integral method we adopt relies on contractivity properties for advection-diffusion equations and it applies to problems with homogeneous Neumann conditions posed equally on bounded and unbounded convex domains under suitable assumptions on their geometry.</description>

      <title>On $p(x)$-Laplacian equations in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ with nonlinearity sublinear at zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p,q$ be functions on $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ satisfying $1\ll q\ll p\ll N$, we consider $p(x)$-Laplacian problems of the form \[ \left\{ \begin{array} [c]{l}% -\Delta_{p(x)}u+V(x)\vert u\vert ^{p(x)-2}u=\lambda\vert u\vert ^{q(x)-2}u+g(x,u)\text{,}\\ u\in W^{1,p(x)}(\mathbb{R}^{N})\text{.}% \end{array} \right. \] To apply variational methods, we introduce a subspace $X$ of $W^{1,p(x)}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ as our working space. Compact embedding from $X$ into $L^{q(x)}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ is proved, this enable us to get nontrivial solution of the problem; and two sequences of solutions going to $\infty$ and $0$ respectively, when $g(x,\cdot)$ is odd.</description>

      <title>Another look at the control properties of the Korteweg-de Vries equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper represents a new perspective in understanding the controllability of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation on unbounded domains. By studying the equation on both the right and left half-line with a single control input, we show that a class of solutions exists for which the KdV equation is exactly controllable. This is achieved by introducing a new concept known as \textit{operational controllability}, which provides key insights for establishing exact controllability results for the KdV equation. This approach allows explicitly characterizing both the control input and the controllable solutions. Furthermore, this concept holds significant potential for application to a wide range of nonlinear dispersive equations on the half-line and in bounded intervals.</description>

      <title>A revisit on well-posedness of a boundary value problem of a stationary advection equation without the separation condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a boundary value problem of a stationary advection equation in a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary. It is known to be well-posed in $L^p$-based function spaces for $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ under the separation condition of the inflow and the outflow boundaries. In this article, we provide another sufficient condition for the well-posedness with $1 \leq p \leq \infty$.</description>

      <title>On the regularity of magneto-vorticity field and the global existence for the Hall magnetohydrodynamic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the incompressible viscous and resistive Hall magnetohydrodynamic equations (Hall MHD in short). We first study the regularity of the magneto-vorticity field $B+\omega$. In three dimensions, we derive some bounds of $B+\omega$ under a condition of the velocity field $u$. Moreover, if we consider the Hall MHD with 2D variables, the uniform-in-time bounds of $B+\omega$ come from the three dimensional case. The regularity of $B+\omega$ gives us a crucial clue of blow-up scenario and provides conditions of the existence of global-in-time solutions. In particular, we prove the global well-posedness of the Hall MHD (also the electron MHD) with 2D variables when the third component of the initial current density $J_0=\nabla\times B_0$ is sufficiently small. We also derive temporal decay rate of $B+\omega$.</description>

      <title>Solitons, scattering and blow-up for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with combined power-type nonlinearities on $\mathbb{R}^d\times\mathbb{T}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the long time dynamics of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with combined powers on the waveguide manifold $\mathbb{R}^d\times\mathbb{T}$. Different from the previously studied NLS-models with single power on the waveguide manifolds, where the non-scale-invariance is mainly due to the mixed nature of the underlying domain, the non-scale-invariance of the present model is both geometrical and structural. By considering different combinations of the nonlinearities, we establish both qualitative and quantitative properties of the soliton, scattering and blow-up solutions. As one of the main novelties of the paper compared to the previous results for the NLS with single power, we particularly construct two different rescaled families of variational problems, which leads to an NLS with single power in different limiting profiles respectively, to establish the periodic dependence results.</description>

      <title>Identifying early tumour states in a Cahn-Hilliard-reaction-diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of reconstructing earlier tumour configurations starting from a single spatial measurement at a later time. We describe the tumour evolution through a diffuse interface model coupling a Cahn-Hilliard-type equation for the tumour phase field to a reaction-diffusion equation for a key nutrient proportion, also accounting for chemotaxis effects. We stress that the ability to reconstruct earlier tumour states is crucial for calibrating the model used to predict the tumour dynamics and also to identify the areas where the tumour initially began to develop. However, backward-in-time inverse problems are well-known to be severely ill-posed, even for linear parabolic equations. Moreover, we also face additional challenges due to the complexity of a non-linear fourth-order parabolic system. Nonetheless, we can establish uniqueness by using logarithmic convexity methods under suitable a priori assumptions. To further address the ill-posedness of the inverse problem, we propose a Tikhonov regularisation approach that approximates the solution through a family of constrained minimisation problems. For such problems, we analytically derive the first-order necessary optimality conditions. Finally, we develop a computationally efficient numerical approximation of the optimisation problems by employing standard $C^0$-conforming first-order finite elements. We conduct numerical experiments on several pertinent test cases and observe that the proposed algorithm consistently meets expectations, delivering accurate reconstructions of the original ground truth.</description>

      <title>Effective interface laws for fluid flow and solute transport through thin reactive porous layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a coupled model for fluid flow and transport in a domain consisting of two bulk regions separated by a thin porous layer. The thickness of the layer is of order $\varepsilon$ and the microscopic structure of the layer is periodic in the tangential direction also with period $\varepsilon$. The fluid flow is described by an instationary Stokes system, properly scaled in the fluid part of the thin layer. The evolution of the solute concentrations is described by a reaction-diffusion-advection equation in the fluid part of the domain and a diffusion equation (allowing different scaling in the diffusion coefficients) in the solid part of the layer. At the microscopic fluid-solid interface inside the layer nonlinear reactions take place. This system is rigorously homogenized in the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$, based on weak and strong (two-scale) compactness results for the solutions. These are based on new embedding inequalities for thin perforated layers including coupling to bulk domains. In the limit, effective interface laws for flow and transport are derived at the interface separating the two bulk regions. These interface laws enable effective mass transport through the membrane, which is also an important feature from an application point of view.</description>

      <title>A new penalty method for elliptic quasivariational inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of elliptic quasivariational inequalities in a reflexive Banach space $X$ for which we recall a convergence criterion obtained in [10]. Each inequality $\cal P$ in the class is governed by a set of constraints $K$ and has a unique solution $u\in K$. The criterion provides necessary and sufficient conditions which guarantee that an arbitrary sequence $\{u_n\}\subset X$ converges to the solution $u$. Then, we consider a sequence $\{\cal P_n\}$ of unconstrained variational-hemivariational inequalities governed by a sequence of parameters $\{\lambda_n\}\subset\mathbb{R}_+$. We use our criterion to deduce that, if for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ the term $u_n$ represents a solution of Problem $\cal P_n$, then the sequence $\{u_n\}$ converges to $u$ as $\lambda_n\to 0$. We apply our abstract results in the study of an elastic frictional contact problem with unilateral constraints and provide the corresponding mechanical interpretations. We also present numerical simulation in the study of a two-dimensional example which represents an evidence of our convergence results.</description>

      <title>On notions of $p$-parabolic capacity and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider different notions of capacity related to the parabolic $p$-Laplace equation. Our focus is on a variational notion, which is consistent in the full range $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. For such a notion we show some basic properties as well as its connection to other notions of capacity presented in the literature, and to a certain parabolic version of the Hausdorff measure. As applications, we use the introduced variational notion of capacity to study polar sets and removability results for supersolutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the spreading speed and asymptotical behaviors, which was left as an open problem in \cite{LLW22}, of a Fisher-KPP nonlocal diffusion model with a free boundary. Using a new lower solution, we get the exact finite spreading speed of free boundary that is proved to be the asymptotical spreading speed of solution component $u$. Moreover, for the algebraic decay kernels, we derive the rates of accelerated spreading and the corresponding asymptotical behaviors of solution component $u$. Especially, for the level set $E^{\lambda}(t)$ with $\lambda\in(0,u^*)$, we find an interesting propagation phenomenon different from the double free boundary problem.</description>

      <title>Euler equations with non-homogeneous Navier slip boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the flow of an { ideal} fluid in a 2D-bounded domain, admitting flows through the boundary of this domain. The flow is described by Euler equations with \textit{non-homogeneous } Navier slip boundary conditions. These conditions can be written in the form $\mathbf{v}\cdot \mathsf{n}=a,$ $2D(\mathbf{v})\mathsf{n}\cdot \mathsf{s}+\alpha \mathbf{v}% \cdot {\mathsf{s}}=b,$ where the tensor $D(\mathbf{v})$ is the rate-of-strain of the fluid's velocity $\mathbf{v}$ and\ $\mathsf{(n},% \mathsf{s)}$ is the pair formed by the normal and tangent vectors to the boundary. We establish the solvability of this problem in the class of solutions with $L_{p}-$bounded \ vorticity, $p\in (2,\infty ].$ To prove the solvability we realize the passage to the limit in Navier-Stokes equations with vanishing viscosity.</description>

      <title>Improved stability threshold of the Two-Dimensional Couette flow for Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq Systems via quasi-linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we improve the size requirement of the perturbations for the asymptotic stability of the Couette flow in stratified fluids governed by the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq system. More precisely, the size of perturbed temperature is improved to $\nu^{2/3}$ from $\nu^{5/6}$ in the paper of Zhang and Zi [J. Math. Pure. Anal. 179:123-182 (2023)]. The idea is the quasi-linearization. The main system is decomposed into two or more equations: a good equation (might be linear) that carries the regularity and size of the initial data and some quasi-linear and nonlinear equations that contain the nonlinear part, which start from zero initial data.</description>

      <title>Stability of the expanding region of Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes and smoothness at the conformal boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new proof of the recent result by Fournodavlos-Schlue on the nonlinear stability of the expanding region of Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes as solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations with positive cosmological constant. Our gauge is a modification of a generalized harmonic gauge introduced by Ringstr\"om in which the asymptotic analysis becomes particularly simple. Due to the hyperbolic character of our gauge, our stability result is local near points on the conformal boundary. We show furthermore that, in yet another gauge, the conformally rescaled metric is smooth down to the future conformal boundary, with the coefficients of its Fefferman-Graham type asymptotic expansion featuring a mild singularity at future timelike infinity of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks for Timoshenko system with Thermoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main focus of this paper is to analyze the behavior of a numerical solution of the Timoshenko system coupled with Thermoelasticity and incorporating second sound effects. In order to address this target, we employ the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) framework to derive an approximate solution for the system. Our investigation delves into the extent to which this approximate solution can accurately capture the asymptotic behavior of the discrete energy, contingent upon the stability number $\chi$. Interestingly, the PINNs overcome the major difficulties encountered while using the standard numerical methods.</description>

      <title>A Singular Integral for a Simplified Clairaut Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This expository article makes a connection between Euler's homogeneous function theorem and a Lagrange integral for a simplified version of the Clairaut Equation. After describing both solutions in detail, we prove a new result, that the Lagrange solution is strictly more general than Euler's solution. This is shown using a few examples which substitute Euler's homogeneous function with a more general surface. The first rather complicated example is based directly on Goursat's definition of a general integral, while the subsequent simpler examples are based on a suitably expanded notion of the general integral. These new examples, and the expanded notion of the general integral may be of interest. We aim to present these classical PDE concepts to readers with a basic knowledge of multivariable calculus.</description>

Abstract: We study the Hausdorff dimension of the sets on which the pointwise convergence of the solutions to the fractional Schr\"odinger equation $e^{it(-\Delta)^\frac m2}f$ fails when $m\in(0,1)$ in one spatial dimension. The pointwise convergence along a non-tangential curve and a set of lines are also considered, where we find different nature from the case when $m\in(1,\infty)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a kind of degenerate normalized $p$-Laplacian equation with general variable exponents. We establish local $C^{1,\alpha'}$ regularity of viscosity solutions by making use of the compactness argument, scaling techniques and the localized oscillating method. In addition, we also obtain almost optimal pointwise $C^{1,\tau} $ regularity for degenerate free transmission problem related to normalized $ p$-Laplacian. Our argument is based on a new improved oscillation-type estimate combined with a localized analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the setting of manifolds with ends which are obtained by compact perturbation (gluing) of ends of the form $\mathbb{R}^{n_i}\times \mathcal{M}_i$. We investigate family of vertical resolvent $\{\sqrt{t}\nabla(1+t\Delta)^{-m}\}_{t&gt;0}$ where $m\geq1$. We show that the family is uniformly continuous on all $L^p$ for $1\le p \le \min_{i}n_i$. Interestingly this is a closed-end condition in the considered setting. We prove that the corresponding Maximal function is bounded in the same range except that it is only weak-type $(1,1)$ for $p=1$. The Fefferman-Stein vector-valued maximal function is again of weak-type $(1,1)$ but bounded if and only if $1&lt;p&lt;\min_{i}n_i$, and not at $p=\min_{i}n_i$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the modulational instability of small-amplitude periodic traveling wave solutions in a dispersion generalized Ostrovsky equation. Specifically, we investigate the invertibility of the associated linearized operator in the vicinity of the origin and derive a modulational instability index that depends on the dispersion and nonlinearity. For the classical Ostrovsky equation, we recover the well-known Lighthill condition for modulational instability of small-amplitude periodic traveling waves, and further provide a rigorous connection of the Lighthill condition to the spectral instability of the underlying wave. Our results and methodologies further apply to a wide-class of Ostrovsky type models that incorporate various dispersive effects. As such, we present new results illuminating the effects of rotation on various full-dispersion models arising in the study of weakly nonlinear surface water waves.</description>

      <title>Measure propagation along a $\mathscr{C}^0$-vector field and wave controllability on a rough compact manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Rauch-Taylor/Bardos-Lebeau-Rauch geometric control condition is central in the study of the observability of the wave equation linking this property to high-frequency propagation along geodesics that are therays of geometric optics. This connection is best understood through the propagation properties of microlocal defect measures that appear as solutions to the wave equation concentrate. For a sufficiently smooth metric this propagation occurs along the bicharacteristic flow. If one considers a merely $\mathscr{C}^1$-metric this bicharacteristic flow may however not exist. The Hamiltonian vector field is only continuous; bicharacteristics do exist (as integral curves of this continuous vector field) but uniqueness is lost. Here, on a compact manifold without boundary, we consider this low regularity setting, revisit the geometric control condition, and address the question of support propagation for a measure solution to an ODE with continuous coefficients. This leads to a sufficient condition for the observability and equivalently the exact controllability of the wave equation. Moreover, we investigate the stabililty of the observability property and the sensitivity of the control process under a perturbation of the metric of regularity as low as Lipschitz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the 1D Hou-Luo model on the real line admits exact self-similar finite-time blowup solutions with smooth self-similar profiles. The existence of these profiles is established via a fixed-point method that is purely analytic. We also prove that the profiles satisfy some monotonicity and convexity properties that were unknown before, and we give rigorous estimates on the algebraic decay rates of the profiles in the far field. Our result supplements the previous computer-assisted proof of self-similar finite-time blowup for the Hou-Luo model with finer characterizations of the profiles.</description>

      <title>Linearization in incompatible elasticity for general ambient spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent interest in elastic problems in which the target space is non-Euclidean, we study a limit where local rest distances within an elastic body are incompatible, yet close to, distances within the ambient space. Specifically, we obtain, via $\Gamma$-convergence, a limit elastic model for a sequence of elastic bodies $(M,g_\varepsilon)$ in an ambient space $(S,s)$, for Riemannian metrics $g_\varepsilon$ and $s$ such that $g_\varepsilon \to s$. Furthermore, we relate the minimum of the limit problem to a linearized curvature discrepancy between $g_\varepsilon$ and $s$, using recent results of Kupferman and Leder. This relation confirms a linearized version of a long-standing conjecture in elasticity regarding the relation between the elastic energy and the curvature of the underlying space. The main technical challenge, compared to other linearization results in elasticity, is obtaining the correct notion of displacement for manifold-valued configurations, using Sobolev truncations and parallel transport. We show that the associated compactness result is obtained if $(S,s)$ satisfies a quantitative rigidity property, analogous to the Friesecke--James--M\"uller rigidity estimate in Euclidean space, and show that this property holds when $(S,s)$ is a round sphere.</description>

Abstract: Transport phenomena play a vital role in various fields of science and engineering. In this work, exact solutions are derived for advection equations with integer- and fractional-order time derivatives and a constant time-delay in the spatial derivative. Solutions are obtained, for arbitrary separable initial conditions, by incorporating recently introduced delay functions in a separation of variables approach. Examples are provided showing oscillatory and translatory behaviours that are fundamentally different to standard propagating wave solutions.</description>

      <title>Buoyancy-Driven Flows With Navier-Slip Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this dissertation two-dimensional buoyancy-driven flows are investigated. While usually the Navier-Stokes equations are equipped with no-slip boundary conditions here we focus on the Navier-slip conditions that, depending on the system at hand, better reflect the physical behavior. In particular, we study two systems, Rayleigh-B\'enard convection and a closely related problem without thermal diffusion. In the former, bounds on the vertical heat transfer, given by the Nusselt number, with respect to the strength of the buoyancy force, characterized by the Rayleigh number, are derived. These bounds hold for a broad range of applications, allowing for non-flat boundaries, any sufficiently smooth positive slip coefficient, and are valid over all ranges of the Prandtl number, a system parameter determined by the fluid. For the thermally non-diffusive system, regularity estimates are proven. Up to a certain order, these bounds hold uniformly in time, which, combined with estimates for their growth, provide insight into the long-time behavior. In particular, solutions converge to the hydrostatic equilibrium, where the fluid's velocity vanishes and the buoyancy force is balanced by the pressure gradient.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the kinetic chemotaxis kernel using macroscopic data: well-posedness and ill-posedness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05004v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bacterial motion is steered by external stimuli (chemotaxis), and the motion described on the mesoscopic scale is uniquely determined by a parameter $K$ that models velocity change response from the bacteria. This parameter is called chemotaxis kernel. In a practical setting, it is inferred by experimental data. We deploy a PDE-constrained optimization framework to perform this reconstruction using velocity-averaged, localized data taken in the interior of the domain. The problem can be well-posed or ill-posed depending on the data preparation and the experimental setup. In particular, we propose one specific design that guarantees numerical reconstructability and local convergence. This design is adapted to the discretization of $K$ in space and decouples the reconstruction of local values of $K$ into smaller cell problems, opening up parallelization opportunities. Numerical evidences support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a geometric flow for Lagrangian submanifolds in a K\"ahler manifold that stays in its initial Hamiltonian isotopy class and is a gradient flow for volume. The stationary solutions are the Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian submanifolds. The flow is not strictly parabolic but it corresponds to a fourth order strictly parabolic scalar equation in the cotangent bundle of the submanifold via Weinstein's Lagrangian neighborhood theorem. For any compact initial Lagrangian immersion, we establish short-time existence, uniqueness, and higher order estimates when the second fundamental forms are uniformly bounded up to time $T$.</description>
