      <title>Intrinsic Energy Resolution of Plastic Scintillator Tiles: Muon Beamtest Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the feasibility of using scintillation detectors for muon calorimetry through experiments conducted at CERN's T10 beamline. Results from organic scintillators with varying thicknesses and readout methods, as well as a lead-glass calorimeter, showed minimal correlation between muon energy and the peak or spread of the detected signal amplitudes. These findings highlight the influence of temperature on SiPMs and indicate a significant amount of contamination in the muon beam.</description>

      <title>The T-SDHCAL Hadronic Calorimeter for a Future Higgs factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CALICE technological RPC-based SDHCAL prototype that fullfils all the requirements of compactness, hermeticity and power budget of the future lepton accelerator experiments, has been extensively tested and has provided excellent results in terms of the energy resolution and shower separation. A new phase of R&amp;D to validate completely the SDHCAL option for the International Linear Detector (ILD) project of the ILC and also the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC and FCCee) has started with the conception and the realization of new prototypes. The new prototype proposes to exploit the excellent time resolution that can be provided by multi-gap resistive plate chamber detectors in order to better build the hadronic showers with the aim to separate close-by ones and also to single out the contribution of delayed neutrons with the purpose to improve on the Particle Flow Algorithm performances and better reconstruct the showers energy. A new technique to build multi-gap resistive plate chambers has been developed and first results confirm the excellent efficiency of the new detectors. The timing performance is under study using the PETIROC ASIC developed by the OMEGA group. The progress realized on the different aspects of the new concept will be presented and the future steps will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Caribou -- A versatile data acquisition system for silicon pixel detector prototyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Caribou is a versatile data acquisition system used in multiple collaborative frameworks (CERN EP R&amp;D, DRD3, AIDAinnova, Tangerine) for laboratory and test-beam qualification of novel silicon pixel detector prototypes. The system is built around a common hardware, firmware and software stack shared accross different projects, thereby drastically reducing the development effort and cost. It consists of a custom Control and Readout (CaR) board and a commercial Xilinx Zynq System-on-Chip (SoC) platform. The SoC platform runs a full Yocto distribution integrating the custom software framework (Peary) and a custom FPGA firmware built within a common firmware infrastructure (Boreal). The CaR board provides a hardware environment featuring various services such as powering, slow-control, and high-speed data links for the target detector prototype. Boreal and Peary, in turn, offer firmware and software architectures that enable seamless integration of control and readout for new devices. While the first version of the system used a SoC platform based on the ZC706 evaluation board, migration to a Zynq UltraScale+ architecture is progressing towards the support of the ZCU102 board and the ultimate objective of integrating the SoC functionality directly into the CaR board, eliminating the need for separate evaluation boards. This paper describes the Caribou system, focusing on the latest project developments and showcasing progress and future plans across its hardware, firmware, and software components.</description>

      <title>Performance studies of the CE-65v2 MAPS prototype structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the next upgrade of the ALICE inner tracking system (ITS3) as its primary focus, a set of small MAPS test structures have been developed in the 65 nm TPSCo CMOS process. The CE-65 focuses on the characterisation of the analogue charge collection properties of this technology. The latest iteration, the CE-65v2, was produced in different processes (Standard, with a low-dose n-type blanket, and blanket with gap between pixels), pixel pitches (15, 18, 22.5 $\mu$m) and pixel arrangements (square or staggered). The comparatively large pixel array size of $48\times24$ pixels in CE-65v2 allows, among other benefits, to study the uniformity of the pixel response.
  The CE-65v2 chip was characterised in a test beam at the CERN SPS. A first analysis showed that hit efficiencies of $\geq 99\%$ and spatial resolution better than 5 $\mu$m can be achieved for all pitches and process variants. For the Standard process, thanks to larger charge sharing, even spatial resolutions below 3 $\mu$m are reached, in line with vertex detector requirements for the FCC-ee.
  This contribution further investigates the data collected at the SPS test beam. Thanks to the large sensor size and efficient data collection, a large amount of statistics was collected, which allows for detailed in-pixel studies to see the efficiency and spatial resolution as a function of the hit position within the pixels. Again, different pitches and process variants are compared.</description>

      <title>Radon Removal in XENONnT down to the Solar Neutrino Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The XENONnT experiment has achieved an unprecedented reduction of the $^\text{222}$Rn activity concentration within its liquid xenon dual-phase time projection chamber to a level of (0.90$\,\pm\,$0.01$\,$stat.$\,\pm\,$0.07 sys.)$\,\mu$Bq/kg, equivalent to about 1200 $^\text{222}$Rn atoms per cubic meter of liquid xenon. This represents a 15-fold improvement over the $^\text{222}$Rn levels encountered during XENON1T's main science runs and is a factor five lower compared to other currently operational multi-tonne liquid xenon detectors engaged in dark matter searches. This breakthrough enables the pursuit of various rare event searches that lie beyond the confines of the standard model of particle physics, with world-leading sensitivity. The ultra-low $^\text{222}$Rn levels have diminished the radon-induced background rate in the detector to a point where it is for the first time lower than the solar neutrino-induced background, which is poised to become the primary irreducible background in liquid xenon-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared dual comb spectroscopy via continuous-wave optical parametric oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dual-comb spectroscopy has demonstrated remarkable capabilities for rapid and sensitive measurements; however, significant challenges still exist in generating high-power, mutually coherent mid-infrared combs. Here we demonstrate that a pair of near-infrared femtosecond frequency combs can be spectrally translated via a continuous-wave optical parametric oscillator. The pair of spectrally translated combs demonstrated high mutual coherence, power per comb tooth in excess of hundreds of microwatts, and were tunable between 4 um and 5 um. Unlike previous approaches which relied upon synchronous optical parametric oscillation, the present approach avoids challenges associated with comb stabilization, low power per comb tooth, and complex cavity designs. Further it is readily amenable to high repetition rates (gigahertz-level and beyond). The flexible and facile nature of this approach provides a robust path for the spectral translation of mode-locked combs, achieving spectral bandwidths limited only by the phase matching bandwidth of the optical parametric oscillator. This approach holds significant promise for applications in chemical kinetics, remote sensing, combustion science, and precision spectroscopy, where the combination of high powers, broad bandwidths, and high measurement rates are transformative.</description>

      <title>Proof of principle for a light dark matter search with low-energy positron beams at NA64</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal light dark matter (LDM) with particle masses in the 1 MeV - 1 GeV range could successfully explain the observed dark matter abundance as a relic from the primordial Universe. In this picture, a new feeble interaction acts as a "portal" between the Standard Model and LDM particles, allowing for the exploration of this paradigm at accelerator experiments. In the last years, the "missing energy" experiment NA64e at CERN SPS (Super Proton Synchrotron) has set world-leading constraints in the vector-mediated LDM parameter space, by exploiting a 100 GeV electron beam impinging on an electromagnetic calorimeter, acting as an active target. In this paper, we report a detailed description of the analysis of a preliminary measurement with a 70 GeV positron beam at NA64e, performed during summer 2023 with an accumulated statistic of 1.6 x 10^10 positrons on target. This data set was analyzed with the primary aim of evaluating the performance of the NA64e detector with a lower energy positron beam, towards the realization of the post-LS3 program. The analysis results, other than additionally probing unexplored regions in the LDM parameter space, provide valuable information towards the future NA64e positron campaign.</description>

      <title>The vertexing challenge at FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following in the footsteps of the LHC, the Future Circular Collider (FCC) plans to be the next multi-generational collider project. In the first stage, FCC-ee will collide intense beams of electrons and positrons at centre of mass energies between 88 and 365 GeV, making it an electroweak, flavour, Higgs and top factory. The unprecedented statistical precision requires FCC-ee experiments to limit their systematic uncertainties to the very minimum.
  The precise reconstruction of the interaction vertices is central to most measurements at FCC-ee, such as rare flavour physics processes and the measurement of Higgs and Z decays to bottom and charm quarks and taus. This contribution will discuss the requirements of FCC-ee vertex detectors, from the necessary impact parameter resolution via the challenging collision environment at the Z pole to the tight requirement on the material budget, which should be kept below 0.3% of a radiation length per detection layer. Next, the proposed vertex detector designs for FCC-ee are shortly presented, and an outlook is given on novel detector designs and features.
  The requirements for the vertexing performance translate into requirements for the sensors used for the vertex detector. As discussed in this contribution, they need to feature a spatial resolution of about 3 $\mu$m and provide timing information of O($\mu$s-ns) while keeping power consumption minimal to allow for air-cooling of the detector - minimising the detector material budget.
  The only type of sensor capable of aiming to fulfil such requirements are CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS), which combine signal generation, amplification and readout into a single silicon die. Therefore, the rest of this contribution will present an overview of existing and planned MAPS technologies and prototypes aiming to fulfil the stringent FCC-ee vertex detector requirements.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic cesium iodide as a potential PET material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Total Body PET (TBPET) scanners have recently demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce both acquisition time and the administered radioactive dose, thanks to their increased sensitivity. However, their widespread adoption is limited by the high costs associated with the current available systems. Cesium iodide (CsI), though historically less favored for PET due to its lower stopping power and light yield compared to crystals like LYSO, shows remarkable improvement when operated at cryogenic temperatures ($\sim$100 K). Under these conditions, CsI light yield rises dramatically to about 100 photons/keV, providing excellent energy resolution and good coincidence time resolution at a lower cost - typically 3 to 5 times cheaper than other crystals at parity of radiation length. In our study, we measured the light yield, the energy resolution and the coincidence time resolution as a function of temperature for two pure CsI crystals read out by a pair of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). An energy resolution of 6.3% FWHM and a coincidence time resolution of 1.84 ns at 511 keV were achieved at a temperature of 104 K. These results point towards the potential of cryogenic CsI as a cost-effective, high-performance material for TBPET scanners.</description>

      <title>Sharp electromagnetically induced absorption via balanced interferometric excitation in a microwave resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A cylindrical TM$_{0,1,0}$ mode microwave cavity resonator was excited using a balanced interferometric configuration that allowed manipulation of the electric field and potential within the resonator by adjusting the phase and amplitude of the interferometer arms driving the resonator. With precise tuning of the phase and amplitude, 25 dB suppression of the electric field at the resonance frequency was achieved while simultaneously resonantly enhancing the time-varying electric-scalar potential. Under these conditions, the system demonstrated electromagnetically induced absorption in the cavity response due to the annulment of the electric field at the resonance frequency. This phenomena can be regarded as a form of extreme dispersion, and led to a sharp increase in the cavity phase versus frequency response by an order of magnitude when compared to the cavity Q-factor. This work presents an experimental setup that will allow the electric-scalar Aharonov-Bohm effect to be tested under conditions involving a time-varying electric-scalar potential, without the presence of an electric field or magnetic vector potential, an experiment that has not yet been realised.</description>

      <title>First demonstration of a TES based cryogenic Li$_2$MoO$_4$detector for neutrinoless double beta decay search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic calorimetric experiments to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) are highly competitive, scalable and versatile in isotope. The largest planned detector array, CUPID, is comprised of about 1500 individual Li$_2^{100}$MoO$_{4}$ detector modules with a further scale up envisioned for a follow up experiment (CUPID-1T). In this article, we present a novel detector concept targeting this second stage with a low impedance TES based readout for the Li$_2$MoO$_{4}$ absorber that is easily mass-produced and lends itself to a multiplexed readout. We present the detector design and results from a first prototype detector operated at the NEXUS shallow underground facility at Fermilab. The detector is a 2-cm-side cube with 21$\,$g mass that is strongly thermally coupled to its readout chip to allow rise-times of $\sim$0.5$\,$ms. This design is more than one order of magnitude faster than present NTD based detectors and is hence expected to effectively mitigate backgrounds generated through the pile-up of two independent two neutrino decay events coinciding close in time. Together with a baseline resolution of 1.95$\,$keV (FWHM) these performance parameters extrapolate to a background index from pile-up as low as $5\cdot 10^{-6}\,$counts/keV/kg/yr in CUPID size crystals. The detector was calibrated up to the MeV region showing sufficient dynamic range for $0\nu\beta\beta$ searches. In combination with a SuperCDMS HVeV detector this setup also allowed us to perform a precision measurement of the scintillation time constants of Li$_2$MoO$_{4}$. The crystal showed a significant fast scintillation emission with O(10$\,\mu$s) time-scale, more than an order below the detector response of presently considered light detectors suggesting the possibility of further progress in pile-up rejection through better light detectors in the future.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of FPGA and GPU Performance for Machine Learning-Based Track Reconstruction at LHCb</title>

Abstract: In high-energy physics, the increasing luminosity and detector granularity at the Large Hadron Collider are driving the need for more efficient data processing solutions. Machine Learning has emerged as a promising tool for reconstructing charged particle tracks, due to its potentially linear computational scaling with detector hits. The recent implementation of a graph neural network-based track reconstruction pipeline in the first level trigger of the LHCb experiment on GPUs serves as a platform for comparative studies between computational architectures in the context of high-energy physics. This paper presents a novel comparison of the throughput of ML model inference between FPGAs and GPUs, focusing on the first step of the track reconstruction pipeline$\unicode{x2013}$an implementation of a multilayer perceptron. Using HLS4ML for FPGA deployment, we benchmark its performance against the GPU implementation and demonstrate the potential of FPGAs for high-throughput, low-latency inference without the need for an expertise in FPGA development and while consuming significantly less power.</description>

      <title>Application of Flex-QA Arrays in HTS Magnet Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flexible PCB quench antennas have been very useful in providing high-quality high-resolution data in low temperature superconducting magnet tests. Similar multi-sensor arrays have been employed recently to cover a high temperature superconductor magnet tested at FNAL. In the present work, data taking conditions and magnet features to support the analysis framework are discussed. Then observations made during complete magnet powering cycles are described and analysis of quench antenna data are presented. Based on results, improvements to instrumentation and data taking are debated. Views on the future of flexible quench antenna sensors for HTS magnet diagnostics and operational support are shared.</description>
