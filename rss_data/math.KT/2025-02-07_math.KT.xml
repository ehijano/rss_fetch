      <title>Localizing invariants of inverse limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the category of nuclear modules on an affine formal scheme as defined by Clausen and Scholze \cite{CS20}. We also study related constructions in the framework of dualizable and rigid monoidal categories. We prove that the $K$-theory (in the sense of \cite{E24}) of the category of nuclear modules on $\operatorname{Spf}(R^{\wedge}_I)$ is isomorphic to the classical continuous $K$-theory, which in the noetherian case is given by the limit $\varprojlim\limits_{n} K(R/I^n).$ This isomorphism was conjectured previously by Clausen and Scholze.
  More precisely, we study two versions of the category of nuclear modules: the original one defined in \cite{CS20} and a different version, which contains the original one as a full subcategory. For our category $\operatorname{Nuc}(R^{\wedge}_I)$ we give three equivalent definitions. The first definition is by taking the internal $\operatorname{Hom}$ in the category $\operatorname{Cat}_R^{\operatorname{dual}}$ of $R$-linear dualizable categories. The second definition is by taking the rigidification of the usual $I$-complete derived category of $R.$ The third definition is by taking an inverse limit in $\operatorname{Cat}_R^{\operatorname{dual}}.$ For each of the three approaches we prove that the corresponding construction is well-behaved in a certain sense.
  Moreover, we prove that the two versions of the category of nuclear modules have the same $K$-theory, and in fact the same finitary localizing invariants.</description>

      <title>K-theory and localizing invariants of large categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the so-called continuous $K$-theory for a certain class of "large" stable $\infty$-categories, more precisely, for dualizable presentable categories. For compactly generated categories, the continuous $K$-theory is simply the usual (non-connective) $K$-theory of the full subcategory of compact objects. More generally, we show that any localizing invariant of small stable $\infty$-categories can be uniquely extended to a localizing invariant of dualizable categories.
  We compute the continuous $K$-theory for categories of sheaves on locally compact Hausdorff spaces. Using the special case for sheaves on the real line, we give an alternative proof of the theorem of Kasprowski and Winges \cite{KW19} on the commutation of $K$-theory with infinite products for small stable $\infty$-categories.
  We also study the general theory of dualizable categories. In particular, we give an "explicit" proof of Ramzi's theorem \cite{Ram24a} on the $\omega_1$-presentability of the category of dualizable categories. Among other things, we prove that dualizability is equivalent to "flatness" in the category of presentable stable categories.</description>

      <title>The Bloch--Kato conjecture, decomposing fields, and generating cohomology in degree one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The famous Bloch--Kato conjecture implies that for a field $F$ containing a primitive $p$ th root of unity, the cohomology ring of the absolute Galois group $G_F$ of $F$ with $\mathbb{F}_p$ coefficients is generated by degree one elements. We investigate other groups with this property and characterize all such groups that are finite. As a further step in this program, we study implications of the Bloch--Kato conjecture to cohomological invariants of finite field extensions. Conversely, these cohomological invariants have implications for refining the Bloch--Kato conjecture. In service of such a refinement, we define the notion of a decomposing field for a cohomology class of a finite field extension and study minimal decomposing fields of degree two cohomology classes arising from degree $p$ extensions. We illustrate this refinement by explicitly computing the cohomology rings of superpythagorean fields and $p$-rigid fields. Finally, we construct nontrivial examples of cohomology classes and their decomposing fields, which rely on computations by David Benson in the appendix.</description>
