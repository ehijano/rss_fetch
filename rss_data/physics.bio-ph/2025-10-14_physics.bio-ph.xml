      <title>Modal analysis and optimization of swimming active filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active flexible filaments form the classical continuum framework for modelling the locomotion of spermatozoa and algae driven by the periodic oscillation of flagella. This framework also applies to the locomotion of various artificial swimmers. Classical studies have quantified the relationship between internal forcing (localised or distributed internal moments or forces) and external output (filament shape and swimming speed). In this paper, we pose locomotion as a mathematical optimisation problem and demonstrate that the swimming of an isolated active filament can be accurately described and optimised using a small number of eigenmodes, significantly reducing computational complexity. In particular, we reveal that the motion of a filament with monophasic forcing, relevant to recently proposed artificial swimmers, is governed by exactly four forcing eigenmodes, only two of which are independent. We further present optimisations of such swimmers under various constraints.</description>

      <title>Bigger is Faster in the Adaptive Immune Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zoonotic pathogens represent a growing global risk, yet the speed of adaptive immune activation across mammalian species remains poorly understood. Despite orders-of-magnitude differences in size and metabolic rate, we show that the time to initiate adaptive immunity is remarkably consistent across species. To understand this invariance, we analyse empirical data showing how the numbers and sizes of lymph nodes scale with body mass, finding that larger animals have both more and larger lymph nodes. Using scaling theory and our mathematical model, we show that larger lymph nodes enable faster search times, conferring an advantage to larger animals that otherwise face slower biological times. This enables mammals to maintain, or even accelerate, the time to initiate the adaptive immune response as body size increases. We validate our analysis in simulations and compare it to empirical data.</description>

      <title>A mathematical theory for understanding when abstract representations emerge in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments reveal that task-relevant variables are often encoded in approximately orthogonal subspaces of the neural activity space. These disentangled low-dimensional representations are observed in multiple brain areas and across different species, and are typically the result of a process of abstraction that supports simple forms of out-of-distribution generalization. The mechanisms by which such geometries emerge remain poorly understood, and the mechanisms that have been investigated are typically unsupervised (e.g., based on variational auto-encoders). Here, we show mathematically that abstract representations of latent variables are guaranteed to appear in the last hidden layer of feedforward nonlinear networks when they are trained on tasks that depend directly on these latent variables. These abstract representations reflect the structure of the desired outputs or the semantics of the input stimuli. To investigate the neural representations that emerge in these networks, we develop an analytical framework that maps the optimization over the network weights into a mean-field problem over the distribution of neural preactivations. Applying this framework to a finite-width ReLU network, we find that its hidden layer exhibits an abstract representation at all global minima of the task objective. We further extend these analyses to two broad families of activation functions and deep feedforward architectures, demonstrating that abstract representations naturally arise in all these scenarios. Together, these results provide an explanation for the widely observed abstract representations in both the brain and artificial neural networks, as well as a mathematically tractable toolkit for understanding the emergence of different kinds of representations in task-optimized, feature-learning network models.</description>

      <title>High-Contrast Interferometric Imaging of Single-Molecule Dynamics on Optical Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-molecule detection enables direct observation of individual biomolecular events, providing mechanistic insights into biological processes and offering a powerful tool for disease diagnostics. However, the fundamental scale mismatch between optical wavelengths and molecules restricts the application of label-free techniques, leading to poor signal-to-noise (SNR) performance. Here, we propose a high-contrast, label-free approach based on interferometric imaging, utilizing the strong evanescent field supported on a microfiber surface to provide near-field illumination. We observed unique interference patterns generated by in-plane scattering from natural defects, which enabled high-contrast detection of localized phase changes induced by single molecules. The results indicate an approximately 38 dB enhancement in SNR over the conventional fluorescence methods, without employing any plasmonic or microcavity-based amplification techniques. This approach was further applied to track molecular dynamics, capturing both conformational transition and binding behaviors of individual protein molecules. Meanwhile, the stimulus-response of single molecules to acoustic waves was investigated, demonstrating the ultimate miniaturization of an acoustic sensor at the single-molecule scale. By enabling direct observation of molecular dynamics and mechanical responses at the single-molecule level, this approach provides a versatile platform for probing fundamental biological processes and developing ultra-sensitive biosensors. Moreover, this approach lays the foundation for coupling optical and acoustic waves at the molecular scale, opening new avenues for next-generation single-molecule diagnostics and precision biophysics studies.</description>

      <title>First Passage Problem: Asymptotic Corrections due to Discrete Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How long a stochastic process survives before leaving a domain depends not only on its intrinsic dynamics but also on how it is observed. Classical first-passage theory assumes continuous monitoring with absorbing boundaries (``kill-on-touch''). In practice, however, measurements are often taken at discrete times. Between two checks, a trajectory may leave and re-enter the domain without being detected. Under this \emph{stroboscopic} rule (``kill-on-check''), exit statistics change qualitatively.
  We analyze one-dimensional Brownian motion confined to an interval of length $L$ and observed at frame intervals~$\Delta t$, with diffusive step scale $\sigma\sqrt{\Delta t}$. The dynamics collapse onto a single confinement ratio $\rho=L/(\sigma\sqrt{\Delta t})$. For boundary starts we obtain linear scaling of the mean number of frames until exit, while for bulk starts the survival is governed by the spectral gap of a one-step stroboscopic operator, leading to a quadratic law with linear corrections. These results identify the stroboscopic first-passage problem where the observation protocol itself reshapes the statistics of escape.</description>

      <title>Spectral spacetime-geometry of Womersley flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical Womersley solution for pulsatile viscous flow in a circular tube and reconstruct its full time-domain geometry from first principles. By combining harmonic decomposition with exact Bessel solutions, we derive a unified spectral spacetime analytical solution in which the instantaneous relationship between pressure gradient and velocity can be visualized as a loop in phase space. The enclosed loop area is shown to equal the mean hydraulic power per cycle, establishing an exact geometric-energetic identity that holds for arbitrary Womersley number and harmonic composition. We further show that higher harmonic content and increasing Womersley number induce topological transitions in these loops, producing cusps, self-intersections, and curvature hot spots that correspond to inertial-viscous phase dispersion. This framework provides a rigorous baseline for interpreting arterial pressure-flow loops, connecting frequency-domain impedance analysis to measurable time-domain geometry.</description>

      <title>Osmotic forces modify lipid membrane fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In hydrodynamic descriptions of lipid bilayers, the membrane is often approximated as being impermeable to the surrounding, solute-containing fluid. However, biological and in vitro lipid membranes are influenced by their permeability and the resultant osmotic forces -- whose effects remain poorly understood. Here, we study the dynamics of a fluctuating, planar lipid membrane that is ideally selective: fluid can pass through it, while the electrically-neutral solutes cannot. We find that the canonical membrane relaxation mode, in which internal membrane forces are balanced by fluid drag, no longer exists over all wavenumbers. Rather, this mode only exists when it is slower than solute diffusion -- corresponding to a finite range of wavenumbers. The well-known equipartition result quantifying the size of membrane undulations due to thermal perturbations is consequently limited in its validity to the aforementioned range. Moreover, this range shrinks as the membrane surface tension is increased, and above a critical tension the membrane mode vanishes. Our findings are relevant when interpreting experimental measurements of membrane fluctuations, especially in vesicles at moderate to high tensions.</description>

      <title>Formulation and Therapeutic Assessment of a Zinc Oxide, Silver, and Cerium Oxide Enriched Ointment for Accelerated Wound Healing in Aged Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chronic wounds present a major challenge in elderly individuals due to diminished regenerative capacity and impaired tissue repair mechanisms associated with aging. In this study, we formulated a topical gel composed of zinc oxide (ZnO), silver (Ag), and cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles, each chosen for their respective antimicrobial, antioxidant, and tissue-regenerative properties. The nanoparticles were synthesized through precise precipitation or reduction techniques and thoroughly characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and electron microscopy to confirm nanoscale structure and purity. An in vivo wound healing model utilizing aged Sprague-Dawley rats was employed, with animals divided into three groups: untreated, placebo-treated, and those receiving the nanoparticle-enriched gel. Wound dimensions were tracked for 14 days, revealing significantly improved healing in the nanoparticle-treated group, with nearly complete closure observed by day 14 (ANOVA, p less than 0.0001). Cytocompatibility was assessed via MTT assay on L929 fibroblasts, confirming greater than 80 percent viability at therapeutically relevant concentrations. These findings underscore the potential of multifunctional nanoparticle-based formulations to enhance wound healing in aged or compromised skin environments, offering a promising therapeutic avenue.</description>

      <title>Electron-hole liquid in biological tissues under ultra high dose rate ionizing radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a quantitative model of ionization processes in biological tissues under Ultra High Dose Rate (UHDR) radiation. The underlying conjecture is that of electron-hole liquid (EHL) forming in water based substances of biological tissues. Unlike the earlier known EHL in semiconductor crystals, the charge carriers here are low mobile due to strong interactions with the background (solvated electrons, etc.); hence, EHL resembling ionic melts. Similar to all ionic systems, the Coulomb coupling makes that EHL energetically favorable that leads to recombination barriers suppressing subsequent structural transformations. In particular, generation of secondary reactive species in such EHL becomes limited translating into reduction of biological damages and tissue sparing effect. We show how these processes are sensitive to the tissue quality and frequency dispersion of the dielectric permittivity. Equations for dose and dose rate defining the sparing thresholds are derived.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Fidelity and Diversity in the Evolution of the Genetic Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin and organizing principles of the genetic code remain fundamental puzzles in life science. The vanishingly low probability of the natural codon-to-amino acid mapping arising by chance has spurred the hypothesis that its structure is a solution optimized for robustness against mutations and translational errors. For the construction of effective molecular machines, the dictionary of encoded amino acids must also be diverse enough in physicochemical features. Here, we examine whether the standard genetic code can be understood as a near-optimal solution balancing these two objectives: minimizing error load and aligning codon assignments with the naturally occurring amino acid composition. Using simulated annealing, we explore this trade-off across a broad range of parameters. We find that the standard genetic code lies near local optima within the multidimensional parameter space. It is a highly effective solution that balances fidelity against resource availability constraints. These results suggest that the present genetic code reflects coevolution under conflicting pressures of fidelity and diversity, offering new insight into its emergence and evolution.</description>

      <title>Behavior of passive polymeric tracers of different topologies in a dilute bath of active Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using computer simulations in two dimensions we investigate the dynamics and structure of passive polymeric tracer with different topologies immersed in a low-density active particle bath. One of the key observations is that polymer exhibit faster dynamics compared to passive colloidal particles at high activity, for the same particle density, in both linear and star polymer topologies. This enhanced motion is attributed to the accumulation of active particles, which induces prolonged and persistent movement of the polymer. Further analysis reveals that star polymers exhibit more complex and intriguing behavior than their linear counterparts. Notably, the accumulation of active particles promotes the pairing of arms in star polymers. For instance, a three-armed star polymer adopts a conformation similar to a linear polymer with two-arms due to this pairing as a result, at high activity, the dynamics of both the polymers converge. Finally, we explore the dynamics of a linear polymer with the same total number of beads as the star polymer. Interestingly, at high activity -- where arm pairing in the star polymer is significant -- the star polymer demonstrates faster dynamics than the linear polymer, despite having the identical number of beads. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of the interactions between active and passive components of varying topologies in dilute systems and highlight their potential for innovative applications ranging from materials science to biomedicine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.05198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Limbless animals such as snakes, limbless lizards, worms, eels, and lampreys move their slender, long bodies in three dimensions to traverse diverse environments. Accurately quantifying their continuous body's 3-D shape and motion is important for understanding body-environment interactions in complex terrain, but this is difficult to achieve (especially for local orientation and rotation). Here, we describe an interpolation method to quantify continuous body 3-D position and orientation. We simplify the body as an elastic rod and apply a backbone optimization method to interpolate continuous body shape between end constraints imposed by tracked markers. Despite over-simplifying the biomechanics, our method achieves a higher interpolation accuracy (~50% error) in both 3-D position and orientation compared with the widely-used cubic B-spline interpolation method. Beyond snakes traversing large obstacles as demonstrated, our method applies to other long, slender, limbless animals and continuum robots. We provide codes and demo files for easy application of our method.</description>

Abstract: A range of computational biology software (GROMACS, AMBER, NAMD, LAMMPS, OpenMM, Psi4 and RELION) was benchmarked on a representative selection of HPC hardware, including AMD EPYC 7742 CPU nodes, NVIDIA V100 and AMD MI250X GPU nodes, and an NVIDIA GH200 testbed. The raw performance, power efficiency and data storage requirements of the software was evaluated for each HPC facility, along with qualitative factors such as the user experience and software environment. It was found that the diversity of methods used within computational biology means that there is no single HPC hardware that can optimally run every type of HPC job, and that diverse hardware is the only way to properly support all methods. New hardware, such as AMD GPUs and Nvidia AI chips, are mostly compatible with existing methods, but are also more labour-intensive to support. GPUs offer the most efficient way to run most computational biology tasks, though some tasks still require CPUs. A fast HPC node running molecular dynamics can produce around 10GB of data per day, however, most facilities and research institutions lack short-term and long-term means to store this data. Finally, as the HPC landscape has become more complex, deploying software and keeping HPC systems online has become more difficult. This situation could be improved through hiring/training in DevOps practices, expanding the consortium model to provide greater support to HPC system administrators, and implementing build frameworks/containerisation/virtualisation tools to allow users to configure their own software environment, rather than relying on centralised software installations.</description>

      <title>In-vitro measurements coupled with in-silico simulations for stochastic calibration and uncertainty quantification of the mechanical response of biological materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a simple and practical approach based on in-vitro measurements and in-silico simulation using the likelihood-free Bayesian inference with the finite element method simultaneously for stochastic calibration and uncertainty quantification of the mechanical response of biological materials. We implement the approach for distal, middle, and proximal human Achilles tendon specimens obtained from diabetic patients post-amputation. A wide range of in-vitro loading conditions are considered, including one-step and two-step relaxation, as well as incremental cyclic loading tests. In-silico simulations are performed for the tendons assuming a fiber-reinforced viscoelastic response, which is modeled for the ground matrix and fiber components. Initially, the calibration of the specimen-specific parameters is predicted using Bayesian optimization and the sensitivity of each parameter is evaluated using the Sobol index and random forest. Then, these parameters are used as priors, and coupled with in-vitro data in simulation-based approximate Bayesian computation to calibrate and quantify the uncertainty parameters for three loading cases. The results demonstrate that in-silico simulations using the posterior parameters of approximate Bayesian computation can capture the uncertainty bounds of in-vitro measurements. This approach provides a useful framework for stochastic calibration of constitutive material model parameters without the need to derive a likelihood function, regardless of the specimen's geometry or loading conditions.</description>

Abstract: While scattered light conveys most of the information we perceive, scattering may also distort that information before it reaches our detectors. The problem is acute in many applications, such as in high-resolution microscopy of biological tissue, where scattering degrades both resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that uniting two intrinsic properties of scattered light: speckle statistics and the angular memory effect, with highly non-linear optical response yields, rather surprisingly, super-resolution, low-background, non-invasive imaging of objects completely hidden behind a strongly scattering, opaque layer. Crucially, our technique of non-invasive imaging through scatterers does not resort to wavefront shaping, adaptive optics, complicated optical setups, or iterative image reconstruction algorithms. Because the strategy relies solely on the properties of scattered light and high-order nonlinear response of the fluorophores, it can be applied to any speckle-forming propagation, from biological tissue to multicore fibres, combined with any type of phenomenon that exhibits a sufficiently high order nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>What if each voxel were measured with a different diffusion protocol?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Expansion of diffusion MRI (dMRI) both into the realm of strong gradients, and into accessible imaging with portable low-field devices, brings about the challenge of gradient nonlinearities. Spatial variations of the diffusion gradients make diffusion weightings and directions non-uniform across the field of view, and deform perfect shells in the q-space designed for isotropic directional coverage. Such imperfections hinder parameter estimation: Anisotropic shells hamper the deconvolution of fiber orientation distribution function (fODF), while brute-force retraining of a nonlinear regressor for each unique set of directions and diffusion weightings is computationally inefficient. Here we propose a protocol-independent parameter estimation (PIPE) method that enables fast parameter estimation for the most general case where the scan in each voxel is acquired with a different protocol in q-space. PIPE applies for any spherical convolution-based dMRI model, irrespective of its complexity, which makes it suitable both for white and gray matter in the brain or spinal cord, and for other tissues where fiber bundles have the same properties within a voxel (fiber response), but are distributed with an arbitrary fODF. Applied to in vivo human MRI with linear tensor encoding on a high-performance system, PIPE maps fiber response and fODF parameters for the whole brain in the presence of significant gradient nonlinearities in under 3 minutes. PIPE enables fast parameter estimation in the presence of arbitrary gradient nonlinearities, eliminating the need to arrange dMRI in shells or to retrain the estimator for different protocols in each voxel. PIPE applies for any model based on a convolution of a voxel-wise fiber response and fODF, and data from varying b-values, diffusion/echo times, and other scan parameters.</description>
