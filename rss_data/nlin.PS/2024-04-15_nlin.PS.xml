      <title>Optical control of topological end states via soliton formation in a 1D lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solitons are self-consistent solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation that maintain their shape during propagation. Here we show, using a pump-probe technique, that soliton formation can be used to optically induce and control a linear topological end state in the bulk of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice, using evanescently-coupled waveguide arrays. Specifically, we observe an abrupt nonlinearly-induced transition above a certain power threshold due to an inversion symmetry-breaking nonlinear bifurcation. Our results demonstrate all-optical active control of topological states.</description>

      <title>Spirals and heteroclinic cycles in a spatially extended Rock-Paper-Scissors model of cyclic dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:1609.04141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatially extended versions of the cyclic-dominance Rock-Paper-Scissors model have traveling wave (in one dimension) and spiral (in two dimensions) behavior. The far field of the spirals behave like traveling waves, which themselves have profiles reminiscent of heteroclinic cycles. We compute numerically a nonlinear dispersion relation between the wavelength and wavespeed of the traveling waves, and, together with insight from heteroclinic bifurcation theory and further numerical results from 2D simulations, we are able to make predictions about the overall structure and stability of spiral waves in 2D cyclic dominance models.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity of rogue wave generation in gyrotrons: Beyond the Peregrine breather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of numerical simulations, we study the gyrotron dynamics under conditions of a significant excess of the operating current over the starting value, when the generation of electromagnetic pulses with anomalously large amplitudes (``rogue waves'') can be realized. The averaged shape of high-power pulses is shown to be very close to the celebrated Peregrine breather. At the same time, we demonstrate that the relation between peak power and duration of rogue waves is self-similar, but does not reproduce the one characteristic for Peregrine breathers. Remarkably, the discovered self-similar relation corresponds to the exponential nonlinearity of an equivalent Schr\"odinger-like evolution equation. This interpretation can be used as a theoretical basis for explaining the giant amplitudes of gyrotron rogue waves.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation delay and front propagation in the real Ginzburg-Landau equation on a time-dependent domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work analyzes bifurcation delay and front propagation in the one-dimensional real Ginzburg-Landau equation (RGLE) with periodic boundary conditions on monotonically growing or shrinking domains. First, we obtain closed-form expressions for the delay of primary bifurcations on a growing domain and show that the additional domain growth before the appearance of a pattern is independent of the growth time scale. We also quantify primary bifurcation delay on a shrinking domain; the time scale of domain compression is reflected in the additional compression before the pattern decays. For secondary bifurcations such as the Eckhaus instability, we obtain a lower bound on the delay of phase slips due to a time-dependent domain. We also construct a heuristic model to classify regimes with arrested phase slips, i.e. phase slips that fail to develop. Then, we study how fronts are influenced by a time-dependent domain. We derive expressions for the velocity and profile of homogeneous fronts on a time-dependent domain. We also derive the natural ``asymptotic'' velocity and front profile and show that these deviate from predictions based on the marginal stability criterion familiar from fixed domain theory. This difference arises because the time-dependence of the domain lifts the degeneracy of the spatial eigenvalues associated with speed selection and represents a fundamental distinction from the fixed domain theory that we verify using direct numerical simulations. The effect of a growing domain on pattern-spreading and Eckhaus front velocities is inspected qualitatively and found to be similar to that of homogeneous fronts. These more complex fronts can also experience delayed onset. Lastly, we show that dilution -- an effect present when the order parameter is conserved -- increases bifurcation delay and amplifies changes in the homogeneous front velocity on time-dependent domains.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic description of a feedback-control Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic Information Theory (SIT) offers a new approach to evaluating the information architecture of complex systems. In this study we describe the steps required to {\it operationalize} SIT via its application to dynamical problems. Our road map has four steps: (1) separating the dynamical system into agent-environment sub-systems; (2) choosing an appropriate coarse graining and quantifying correlations; (3) identifying a measure of viability; (4) implementing a scrambling protocol and measuring the semantic content. We apply the road map to a model inspired by the neural dynamics of epileptic seizures whereby an agent (a control process) attempts to maintain an environment (a base process) in a desynchronized state. The synchronization dynamics is studied through the well-known Kuramoto model of phase synchronization. Our application of SIT to this problem reveals new features of both semantic information and the Kuramoto model. For the latter we find articulating the correlational structure for agent and environment(the oscillators), allows us to cast the model in in a novel computational (information theoretic) perspective, where the agent-environment dynamics can be thought of as analyzing a communication channel. For the former we find that all the information in our system is semantic. This is in contrast to previous SIT studies of foragers in which semantic thresholds where seen above which no further semantic content was obtained.</description>

      <title>Phase reduction explains chimera shape: when multi-body interaction matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an extension of the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model for networks, deriving the second-order phase approximation for a paradigmatic model of oscillatory networks - an ensemble of non-identical Stuart-Landau oscillators coupled pairwisely via an arbitrary adjacency matrix. We explicitly demonstrate how this matrix translates into the coupling structure in the phase equations. To illustrate the power of our approach and the crucial importance of high-order phase reduction, we tackle a trendy setup of non-locally coupled oscillators exhibiting a chimera state. We reveal that our second-order phase model reproduces the dependence of the chimera shape on the coupling strength that is not captured by the typically used first-order Kuramoto-like model. Our derivation contributes to a better understanding of complex networks' dynamics, establishing a relation between the adjacency matrix and multi-body interaction terms in the high-order phase model.</description>

      <title>Large-space and long-time asymptotic behaviors of $N_{\infty}$-soliton solutions (soliton gas) for the focusing Hirota equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hirota equation is one of the integrable higher-order extensions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, and can describe the ultra-short optical pulse propagation in the form $iq_t+\alpha(q_{xx}+ 2|q|^2q)+i\beta (q_{xxx}+ 6|q|^2q_x)=0,\, (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^2\, (\alpha,\,\beta\in\mathbb{R})$. In this paper, we analytically explore the asymptotic behaviors of a soliton gas for the Hirota equation including the complex modified KdV equation, in which the soliton gas is regarded as the limit $N\to \infty$ of $N$-soliton solutions, and characterized using the Riemann-Hilbert problem with discrete spectra restricted in the intervals $(ia, ib)\cup (-ib, -ia)\, (0&lt;a&lt;b)$. We find that this soliton gas tends slowly to the Jaocbian elliptic wave solution with an error $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-1})$ (zero exponentially quickly ) as $x\to -\infty$ ($x\to +\infty$). We also present the long-time asymptotics of the soliton gas under the different velocity conditions: $x/t&gt;4\beta b^2,\, \xi_c&lt;x/t&lt;4\beta b^2,\, x/t&lt;\xi_c$. Moreover, we analyze the property of the soliton gas for the case of the discrete spectra filling uniformly a quadrature domain.</description>
