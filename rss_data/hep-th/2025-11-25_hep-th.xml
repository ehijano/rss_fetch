      <title>Thermodynamics of Geodetic Brane Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the effect at cosmological level of the extra contribution arising from the Geodetic Brane Gravity model within a thermodynamical perspective. As already known, the universe seen as an extended object embedded within a higher dimensional space time, modifies the dynamical background equations, which in turn results in correction contributions to the entropy and temperature of the apparent horizon. Additionally, we investigate the possibility that the apparent horizon and the bulk remain in thermal equilibrium across various matter contents, demonstrating that such properties are highly sensitive to the equation-of-state parameter.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric AdS Solitons, Coulomb Branch Flows and Twisted Compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18128v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work, which accompanies [1], is about constructing smooth solutions in type II and eleven dimensional supergravity which describe supersymmetry preserving RG flows from four-dimensional SCFTs in the UV to three-dimensional SQFTs in the IR, through holography. We show that all the different UV fixed points flow to theories which confine external quarks and have a mass gap. We proceed by presenting extended calculations of a plethora of observables and analyse the dual field theories in great detail. This includes a boundary analysis and application of holographic renormalization methods in the simplest case of the type IIB solution. Many of the observables computed here have a universal behaviour: they factorize into two parts, one of which includes information about the UV SCFTs, and the other describing the dynamics of the RG flow, which is the same regardless of the UV fixed point.</description>

      <title>On Thermodynamics of Charged Black Holes via Extended Space-time Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by non-commutative geometry in string theory, we propose extended derivatives in black hole physics by incorporating a real antisymmetric tensor of rank 2 carrying similarities of certain stringy fields. Using gauge theory formulation of gravity via de Sitter group theory, we first find the associated black hole solutions by solving the Einstein field equations. Then, we study the thermodynamic properties by approaching the stability analysis, the criticality, and the phase transitions. Concretely, we investigate the P-V criticality behavior of the obtained solution. We compute and examine the Gibbs free energy revealing comparable attitudes with the Van der Waals phase transitions. Combining such results, we provide constraints on the deformed parameter B and the charge Q with the help of CUDA numerical methods exploited in machine learning computations. Precisely, we show that there are suitable ranges for such parameters where the obtained black holes behave like the Van der Waals fluid systems.</description>

      <title>New Near Extremal Black Holes and Love Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating and charged black holes are known to exhibit remarkable properties close to extremality, including emergent hidden symmetries and holographic duality to 2D theories. In this note, we introduce a new class of near-extremal black holes living in $(2,2)$ signature, strongly resembling the Lorentzian ones but with an exact integrable structure $SL(2,\mathbb{R})\times SL(2,\mathbb{R})$. The exterior of the black hole is a self-dual solution with a photon ring. It develops an infinite near-horizon throat described by the Eguchi-Hanson instanton. An exact version of the so-called Love symmetry controls perturbations on the throat. Furthermore, the normalizable spectrum of this black hole provides quasinormal modes in Lorentzian signature.</description>

      <title>BPS Solutions of 4d Euclidean N=2 Supergravity with Higher Derivative Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fully BPS and a broad class of half-BPS stationary configurations of four-dimensional Euclidean N=2 supergravity with higher-derivative interactions. Working within the off-shell conformal supergravity framework of de Wit and Reys (arXiv:1706.04973), we analyse the complete set of Killing spinor equations and obtain the corresponding algebraic and differential constraints. We further derive the Euclidean attractor equations and evaluate the Wald entropy for the fully BPS AdS_2 x S^2 background. For half-BPS stationary configurations, we obtain the generalized stabilization equations expressing all fields in terms of harmonic functions on three-dimensional flat base space, extending the Lorentzian analysis of Cardoso et al.(arXiv:hep-th/0009234) to the Euclidean signature. Our results provide a framework for studying supersymmetric saddles and computing the gravitational indices entirely within Euclidean higher-derivative supergravity, without recourse to analytic continuation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate behavior of brane backgrounds under poly-vector deformations in Type IIB and D=11 supergravities. We find that the standard bi-vector deformations add dissolved F1 string charge to a Dp-brane background, quadri-vector deformations add D3-brane charge, tri- and six-vector deformations in D=11 add M2- and M5-brane charges respectively. We discuss these results in the context of NRCS and OM theories.</description>

      <title>Towards spinning $U(1)$ gauged non-topological solitons in the model with Chern-Simons term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain localized field configurations with finite energy in a ($2+1$)-dimensional model with Maxwell and Chern-Simons gauge terms coupled to a massive complex scalar field. These non-topological solitons are characterized by the $U(1)$ frequency and a winding number. Thus, the solutions possess Noether charge and non-trivial angular momentum, which is not quantized in contrast to the topological case. We study the solitons and their integral characteristics numerically and demonstrate that they are kinematically stable. The obtained solutions allow for the thin-wall approximation in some region of frequencies. For each winding number, the Noether charge has a lower bound that coincides with an isolated point, where the non-relativistic conformal symmetry seems to be restored.</description>

      <title>Analytical studies on 3D hairy rotating black hole interiors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical study of the interior structure of hairy rotating black holes in three-dimensional Einstein gravity, minimally coupled to a complex scalar field with a sup-exponential potential. The interior dynamics of these black holes are characterized by an infinite sequence of Kasner epochs, separated by inversion and transitions, each of which admits an analytical description. We derive an explicit analytical expression for this infinite sequence of epochs. At late interior times, the geometry evolves into a curvature singularity, despite the local resemblance of each Kasner epoch to a regular Milne universe on a circle. These results reveal an interior structure richer and more complex than that of its 4D static black hole counterparts.</description>

      <title>Noncritical Conformal Gravity and Four-Dimensional Liouville Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum aspects of the conformal gravity in four dimensions, specifically addressing a known discrepancy in beta functions between general quadratic curvature theories and conformal gravity, which corresponds to two scalar degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that this mismatch is resolved by carefully introducing gauge-fixing and ghost terms via the BRST symmetry, which effectively adds the two scalar modes. Drawing lessons from two-dimensional quantum gravity and Liouville theory, we proceed to integrate the four-dimensional trace anomaly to derive a consistent Liouville action, which is given by a free-field action for the conformal mode with a consistent conformal anomaly. Finally we give the condition that the BRST transformation is anomaly free.</description>

      <title>SL(2N,C) Hyperunification: Dynamical Tetrads, Induced Gravity, and Composite Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a four-dimensional hyperunified gauge framework in which local Lorentz symmetry and internal gauge interactions are embedded into a special noncompact $\mathrm{SL}(2N,\mathbb{C})$ group acting on spinors. The accompanying tetrads are promoted to dynamical fields whose contracted invertibility condition is interpreted as a nonlinear sigma-model type length constraint. This triggers tetrad condensation and spontaneously breaks $\mathrm{SL}(2N, \mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(N)$, lifting all noncompact directions. A special ghost-free curvature-squared Lagrangian provides a consistent quadratic sector, while an Einstein--Cartan linear curvature term is shown to arise radiatively from fermion loops. Below the breaking scale only the neutral tetrad (graviton) and $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ vector fields remain massless, whereas axial-vector and tensor fields of the entire gauge multiplet acquire heavy masses. Applying the same $\mathrm{SL}(2N,\mathbb{C})$ symmetry to underlying preons in fundamental spin-$\tfrac12$ representations, rather than directly to quarks and leptons, together with the anomaly matching for the preon chiral symmetry, singles out $N=8$. The chain $\mathrm{SL}(16,\mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(8)$ then naturally yields three composite quark--lepton families, while filtering out extraneous heavy states.</description>

      <title>Three-loop banana integrals with three equal masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain and solve the canonical differential equations for the three-loop banana integrals in dimensional regularisation when three of the four masses are equal. The K3 surface associated with the maximal cuts factorises into a product of two elliptic curves. This allows us to express the differential forms in the canonical differential equations in terms of meromorphic modular forms. We present a rigorous proof that these differential forms only have simple poles and that they define independent cohomology classes. We also present explicit results for all master integrals in terms of iterated integrals of meromorphic modular forms (and integrals thereof). This is the first time that it was possible to express the results of a Feynman integral associated with a K3 geometry and depending on two dimensionless ratios in terms of functions that have previously been studied in the literature.</description>

Abstract: We propose and calculate a holographic Krylov complexity in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM via the proper momentum for motion in $AdS_5$ sliced by $AdS_3$. The motion in an $AdS_3$ subgroup corresponds to the Krylov complexity of the $Sl(2)$ subsector. The general motion corresponds to the Krylov complexity of the ${\cal N}=4$ SYM.</description>

      <title>Conformal symmetry of the massless Staruszkiewicz model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown by Yu.~Yaremko [Elect. J. Theor. Phys. {\bf 9}, 153 (2012)] within the classial electrodynamics that the hypothetical massless charged particle must generate an infinitely strong radiation reaction, thus not an external force can accelerate this particle. Here the version the Staruszkiewicz model is presented to describe the relativistic system of two massless charged particles interacting as follows: the retarded field of the first particle acts on the second particle, the advanced field of the second particle acts on the first particle, and a radiation reaction is neglected. The model is formulated within the Hamiltonian formalism with constraints. The system is invariant with respect to 15-parametric conformal group. The corresponding conserved canonical generators and the relativistic Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector provide a superintegrability of the system. The trajectory of the unbounded relative motion is represented by the hyperbolic conic section, similarly to the case of the non-relativistic Kepler problem. Surprisingly, however, the particle world lines appears the isotropic rectilinear rays, i.e., the particles behave as if non-interacting or neutral electrically. This result agrees with the aforementioned Yaremko's work, despite that the radiation reaction in the Staruszkiewicz model is abandoned.</description>

      <title>Constraining strongly-warped extra dimensions with rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive bosonic fields can trigger superradiant instabilities in rotating astrophysical black holes leading to gaps in their mass-spin distribution. For spin-2 fields, the instability timescale is orders of magnitude shorter than for any other superradiant mode, thereby yielding much stronger constraints. We consider a tower of ultra-light spin-2 fields arising from a warped compactification of a single extra dimension and translate superradiant constraints on their masses into constraints on the warping. As a concrete scenario we consider the 2-brane Randall-Sundrum model and find constraints on the size of the extra dimension and the curvature of $AdS_5$. We discuss the implications of these bounds for strongly warped throats and D-brane uplifts commonly used in attempts to realise metastable de Sitter vacua in string theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I will discuss how the concept of basho, introduced by Nishida Kitaro nearly a century ago, can give an interesting insight to understand the concept of a point in modern quantum gravity. A quantum spacetime, necessary for the quantization of gravity, requires a whole rethinking of geometry, starting from the primitive concepts, like that of a point. I argue that the local vision of what becomes of classical points in quantum gravity, and in particular in noncommutative geometry, shows several similarities with Nishida's basho.</description>

      <title>Characterising hadronisation across the phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leading hadronisation corrections to two-jet global event shapes amount to a shift in the corresponding perturbative distributions. It has been recently established that this shift depends significantly on the value of the considered event shape. These analyses consider perturbative configurations with only three partons emitting an ultra-soft non-perturbative gluon. These are dominant in the three-jet region. However, multiple soft and/or collinear emissions need to be considered to accurately describe event shape distributions near their Sudakov peak. In this region, non-perturbative shifts are usually computed by considering only two hard emitters. In this paper, we find that this approximation misses an important correction to the shift due to the emission of an additional soft wide-angle gluon. We then compute its contribution, and embed it in a general treatment for the shift that is valid in both the two-jet and three-jet regions.</description>

      <title>Quintessence Star Solutions with Conformal Symmetry in a Durgapal Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the Universe can be suitably attributed to the existence of the dark energy (DE). On the backdrop of this concept, this paper introduces a novel, anisotropic compact star model whose stability and structure are governed by the presence of quintessence field, defined by the parameter $ w_{Q} (-1&lt;w_{Q}&lt;-\frac{1}{3}) $ and which admits conformal symmetry. The construction of the model relied on the Durgapal-Fuloria (DP) metric formulation. The model successfully meets all the necessary physical constraints viz., TOV equation, energy conditions, compactness factor, surface redshift and casuality condition. The results are analyzed through analytical methods as well as through the graphical visualization for the various physical attributes.</description>

      <title>Late-time cosmic dynamics in $f(R,L_{m})$ gravity with recent observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the late-time cosmic dynamics in the framework of non-linear $f(R, L_m)$ gravity, adopting the functional form $f(R,L_m)=\frac{R}{2}+L_m^2$. To explore the dark energy behavior, we assume an oscillatory parametric equation of state, $\omega(z) = \omega_0 + b \sin[\log(1+z)]$, which allows smooth deviations from the cosmological constant. Using a joint MCMC analysis with the latest Hubble 31 chronometer data, DESI DR2 BAO measurements, and Type Ia supernova samples (Pantheon+, DES-SN5Y and Union 3), we obtain well-constrained parameters around $H_0 \simeq 67.2~\text{km s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\omega_0\approx-0.5$, consistent with Planck 2018 and other current observations. The model exhibits a clear transition from deceleration to acceleration with $z_{\rm tr} \sim 0.7$--$0.8$, satisfies the NEC and DEC while violating the SEC and yields present EoS values close to $-1$, reproducing $\Lambda$CDM behavior at late times. The derived Universe ages ($t_0 \approx 13.3~\text{Gyr}$) agree well with CMB and stellar constraints, confirming that the proposed oscillatory $f(R, L_m)$ model provides an observationally consistent and dynamically viable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.</description>

      <title>Constraining linear form of $f(\mathcal{R,G,T})$ gravity from astrophysical observations of the Pulsar U1724</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we examine the internal structure of compact stars within an extended gravitational framework described by the function $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{T})$. Throughout this work, the quantity $\mathcal{R}$ refers to the curvature scalar formed from the Ricci tensor. The term $\mathcal{G}$ denotes the Gauss--Bonnet curvature invariant, while $\mathcal{T}$ corresponds to the trace obtained by contracting the matter energy-momentum tensor. Our analysis is directed toward massive radio pulsars with masses above $1.8\,M_{\odot}$, which provide an exceptional testing ground for gravity under conditions inaccessible to laboratory experiments. Adopting the linear form $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{T})=\mathcal{R}+\alpha\,\mathcal{G}+\beta\,\mathcal{T}$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are parameters of suitable dimensionality,\footnote{$\alpha$ has dimensions of $[L^{2}]$ and $\beta$ carries units of $[N^{-1}]$.} we obtain an exact analytic solution for static anisotropic stellar matter in hydrostatic equilibrium. This solution allows all physical quantities to be expressed in terms of the dimensionless parameters $ \alpha_{1}=\alpha/R^{2},\qquad \beta_{1}=\beta/\kappa^{2}$ together with the compactness $C=2GM/(Rc^{2})$. We constraint the two parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ by matching the model with the mass and radius of pulsar \textit{U1724} requires restricting these parameters to $\alpha_{1}=\pm0.023$ and $\beta_{1}=\pm0.001$, where $\kappa^{2}=8\pi G/c^{4}$ is the standard Einstein coupling. The resulting stellar configuration satisfies the causal bound on the radial sound speed, $c_{s}^{2}&lt;c^{2}/3$, distinguishing it from the corresponding behaviour in general relativity.</description>

      <title>Universal scalarization in topological AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the universal behavior of black hole scalarization induced by a charged scalar field in the extended phase space of the asymptotic AdS spacetime with three distinct horizon topologies. The results indicate that in all the three cases, the charged black hole spacetime undergoes scalarization at low temperatures. Notably, the spherical topology is unique in that its domain of scalarization theoretically extends to much higher temperatures under low pressure in the extended phase space. Moreover, the scalarization process in the spherical case exhibits complex phase transition behaviors without additional non-linear terms, which are similar to those in the planar and hyperbolic topologies with the assistance of non-linear terms. With increasing pressure in the extended phase space, the condensate of the scalarization in all three cases undergoes a transition from the first-order style to a cave-of-wind style. This study provides deeper insight into the zeroth-order phase transition during black hole scalarization and reveals the complete phase structure of black holes in the extended phase space.</description>

      <title>Discrete Action, Graph Evolution, and the Hierarchy of Symmetries: A Rigorous Construction of Temporal Layers $C1 \to C2 \to C3 \to C4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Postulating a minimal discrete quantum of action $S=\hbar$ and a simple rule for the growth of an oriented graph, we construct a strict hierarchy of temporal layers $C N$ with discrete periods $\tau_N=N\hbar/E$. Each layer is specified by its configuration space, symplectic structure, update rule, and emergent symmetry. At $C1$ the state is represented by a single oriented edge with $U(1)$ phase $e^{i E t/\hbar}$. The transition $C1 \to C2$ splits the edge into two independent flows, which yields canonical pairs $(x_a,p_a)$, local $U(1)$ invariance, and an effective $(2{+}1)$ metric with signature $(+--)$. The closure $C2 \to C3$ produces $SU(3)$ connections and an Einstein-Yang-Mills type action. We show that these structures follow from discrete-action principles, and that stochastic graph growth naturally provides mechanisms for decoherence and spontaneous symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Precision estimates of large charge RG exponents $Y_q$ in the 3D XY universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We accurately compute the RG exponents $Y_q$ of large $q$ fields at the $O(2)$ invariant fixed point in three dimensions. We build on an iterative approach that has been previously proposed and is implemented by using the worm algorithm. We simulate an improved XY model, that has next-to-next-to-nearest couplings in addition to nearest ones. In the worm update we incorporate weights, which allows us to obtain accurate results up to $q=64$. For example we get $Y_q=1.76370(12)$, $0.89167(23)$, and $-0.11203(34)$ for $q=2$, $3$, and $4$, respectively. The comparison with the large $q$ effective field theory gives an excellent agreement down to $q=4$ and provides accurate estimates of the parameters of the effective field theory.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Grassmann-Pfaffian Framework for Monomer-Dimer and Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables that establishes master identities for exponential quadratic fermionic forms and linear fermionic forms coupled to both bosonic and fermionic sources. The construction is rigorous for both real and complex fermions in arbitrary dimensions and remains well-defined even when the underlying matrices are singular. Our main mathematical results appear in two master theorems. Theorem 12 provides a comprehensive identity for Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables for real fermions with mixed bosonic-fermionic sources, applicable to any antisymmetric matrix. Its complex analogue, Theorem 13, yields corresponding determinant-based representations. Together, they serve as generating functionals for a wide range of combinatorial and physical models. Key applications include the dimer, monomer-dimer, matching, and almost-matching problems. We revisit the Kasteleyn theorem for planar dimers using Berezin integrals. We construct monomer-dimer systems through the \textit{Monobisyzexant (Mbsz)} function, which generalizes the Hafnian to incorporate monomer contributions and admits a Pfaffian-sum representation for planar graphs (Theorem 5); and practical techniques for handling singular matrices via unitary block decomposition (Theorem 6) and spectral analysis. We further present explicit mappings between Hafnians and Pfaffians and their submatrix generalizations (Hafnianinhos and Pfaffianinhos); an alternative source-ordered Berezin integral representation for spanning trees and forests using complex bosonic sources that regularizes the Laplacian zero mode (Theorem 10). Overall, this work offers a flexible toolkit for the theoretical analysis and computational implementation of graph-based models and lattice field theories using Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables .</description>

      <title>Three faces of random walks in hyperbolic domain: BKT, Lifshitz tails, and KPZ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that continuous random walks (diffusion) in the Poincar\'{e} hyperbolic upper halfplane $\mathbb{H}^2 = {(x,y)}|y&gt;0$, interpreted as multiplicative stochastic processes with log-normal statistics, provide a unifying framework linking three seemingly unrelated phenomena: (i) the non-analytic divergence of corrrelation length at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition; (ii) the appearence of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang 9KPZ) exponent in the fluctuational behavior of stretched random walks constrained above an impermeable disc; and (iii) the emergence of Lifshitz tails in one-dimensional statistics of rare events. Combining scaling arguments with analytic derivations and numerical analysis, we adapt the renormalization-group equations originally developed for the Efimov effect in a two-dimensional conformally invariant potential to the case of diffusion in $\mathbb{H}^2$, thereby deriving the BKT-type divergence of the correlation length. We further demonstrate how the KPZ-type scaling governs the large-deviation behavior and survival probability near the boundary in the hyperbolic domain, and how Lifshitz tails arise naturally in a deterministic large-deviation landscape on the hyperbolic plane via instanton approach, reproducing the rare-event statistics of one-dimensional diffusion in the array of traps with the Poisson distribution. We conjecture that the dominant contribution to the ensemble of paths responsible for BKT-like physics comes from random paths pushed to large-deviation stretched regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a novel cosmological model based on coupled fields in the framework of scalar tensor theories, considering the specific interplay between gravity and scalar fields. The model further extends a recent axion-dilaton system by introducing viable couplings with the space--time geometry encoded into the scalar curvature. After briefly introducing the action and the corresponding field equations, we employ linear stability theory to investigate the physical properties. The analysis showed the compatibility of the current theoretical model with the recent history of the Universe, obtaining viable constraints for the model's parameters in some specific cases. In the present setup, the axion--dilaton system is non--minimally coupled with gravity in an independent manner, leading to distinct physical features in the phase-space structure, possible alleviating the cosmic coincidence problem.</description>

      <title>How Complex is Dark Energy? A Bayesian Analysis of CPL Extensions with Recent DESI BAO Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark energy is one of the big puzzling issues in cosmology. While $\Lambda$CDM provides a good fit to the observational data, evolving dark energy scenarios, such as the CPL parametrization, offer a compelling alternative. In this paper, we present a Bayesian model comparison of various dark energy parametrizations using a joint analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background data, DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements, and the PantheonPlus (or Union3) Supernovae type Ia sample. We find that while the $\Lambda$CDM model is initially favored over a constant $w$CDM model, the CPL parametrization is significantly preferred over $w$CDM, reinforcing recent evidence for an evolving dark energy component, consistent with DESI collaboration findings. Crucially, when testing higher-order CPL extensions, the so-called CPL$^+$ and CPL$^{++}$, our Bayesian analysis shows that the observational data do not favor these more complex scenarios compared to the standard CPL. This result indicates that adding excessive complexity to the CPL form is unwarranted by current observations. Interestingly, similar to the CPL parametrization, alternative two-parameter forms, specifically $w_{de}(a) = w_0 + w_b(1-a)^2$ and $w_{de}(a) = w_0 + w_c(1-a)^3$, yield a better fit to observational data than the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Our results challenge the necessity for overly complex CPL extensions and confirm that well-chosen two-parameter $w_0w_a$ parametrizations effectively capture DE evolution with current cosmological data, supporting the recent signals for dynamical dark energy by DESI collaboration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information transmitted across modern communication platforms is degraded not only by intentional manipulation (disinformation) but also by intrinsic cognitive decay and topology-dependent social averaging (misinformation). We develop a continuous-fidelity field theory on multiplex networks with distinct layers representing private chats, group interactions, and broadcast channels. Our analytic solutions reveal three universal mechanisms controlling information quality: (i) groupthink blending, where dense group coupling drives fidelity to the initial group mean; (ii) bridge-node bottlenecks, where cross-community flow produces irreversible dilution; and (iii) a network-wide fidelity landscape set by a competition between broadcast truth-injection and structural degradation pathways. These results demonstrate that connectivity can reduce information integrity and establish quantitative control strategies to enhance fidelity in large-scale communication systems.</description>

Abstract: In thermal quantum field theory, the global Liouvillian (the generator of time translations) is passive. How is this reflected in the properties of its local density, a quantum field? We propose that the locally averaged density is bounded below, but not above, with respect to the noncommutative $L^4$ norm. This is analogous to the known quantum energy inequalities in the vacuum situation. Our examples include thermal equilibrium on Minkowski space, and the Unruh effect on the Rindler wedge, both for the real scalar free field.</description>

      <title>Instantons on the Blown-up Surface and the Affine Vertex Algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vafa-Witten observed that Yoshioka's blow-up formula for the Euler characteristics of rank $r$ instantons on an algebraic surface coincides with the character of the Wess-Zumino-Witten model for $\mathrm{SU}(r)$ at level $1$, and raised the question of finding a rational conformal field theory explanation for this striking coincidence. In this work, we provide an answer to this question by constructing and analyzing the affine $\mathrm{gl}_r$ action on various cohomology theories, including the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves, Hochschild homology, Chow groups, and Hodge cohomology, of the moduli space of stable sheaves on a blown-up surface.
  A key ingredient in our proof is a representation-theoretic reformulation of the theory of Grassmannians of Tor-amplitude $[0,1]$-perfect complexes studied by the first-named author in terms of the spin representation of the finite-dimensional Clifford algebra. This may be viewed as a finite analog of the question of Vafa-Witten via the Boson-Fermion correspondence.</description>

      <title>Web of Non-invertible Dualities for (2+1) Dimensional Models with Subsystem Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend non-invertible duality concepts from one-dimensional systems to two spatial dimensions by constructing a web of non-invertible dualities for lattice models with subsystem symmetries. For the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ subsystem symmetry on the square lattice, we build two complementary dualities: a map that sends spontaneous subsystem symmetry-broken (SSSB) phases to the trivial phase (the analogue of the Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality in 1+1D), and a generalized subsystem Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformation that maps SSSB phases to subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases while leaving the trivial phase invariant. These dualities are boundary-sensitive. On open lattices, both subsystem KW and KT transformations act as unitary, invertible operators. In particular, the KT map not only matches the bulk Hamiltonians of the dual phases but also carries the spontaneous ground-state degeneracy of the SSSB phase onto the protected boundary degeneracy of the SSPT phase. On closed manifolds, however, both maps become intrinsically non-unitary and non-invertible when restricted to the original Hilbert space. We demonstrate this non-invertibility via ground-state degeneracy matching (in two copies of the Xu-Moore/Ising-plaquette model), analysis of symmetry-twist sectors mapping, and the fusion algebra of the duality operator. Enlarging the Hilbert space to include twisted sectors allows the subsystem KW map to be formulated as a projective unitary preserving quantum transition probabilities, consistent with generalized Wigner-theorem-based constructions. We also show that the KT map faithfully transmits the algebraic content of bulk and edge invariants diagnosing strong SSPT order: although strictly local SSPT repair operators map to highly nonlocal objects in the dual SSSB phase, the essential commutation algebra and the bulk-edge correspondence remain intact.</description>

      <title>Ghost instabilities and strong coupling in quadratic non-metricity theories</title>

Abstract: We revisit the framework of Newer General Relativity, defined by all independent quadratic invariants of the non-metricity tensor, including the unique quadratic parity-violating term. We analyze linear perturbations around a flat FLRW background and find that the theory generically exhibits ghost instabilities, except for the special case of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR) supplemented by the parity-violating operator. Using both the Dirac-Bergmann procedure and the Cartan-Kuranishi algorithm, we show that this remaining case propagates eight degrees of freedom at the fully non-linear level. This result implies that the parity-violating extension of STEGR is strongly coupled around FLRW and therefore lies beyond the regime of validity of standard linear perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Separating the Inseparable: Constraining Arbitrary Primordial Bispectra with Cosmic Microwave Background Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To efficiently probe primordial non-Gaussianity using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, we require theoretical predictions that are factorizable, \textit{i.e.}\ those whose kinematic dependence can be separated. This property does not hold for many models, hindering their application to data. In this work, we introduce a general framework for constructing separable approximations to primordial bispectra, enabling direct CMB constraints on arbitrary models including those computed using numerical tools. In contrast to other approaches such as modal decompositions, we learn the basis functions directly from the data, allowing high-fidelity representations with just a handful of terms. This is practically implemented using machine-learning techniques, utilizing neural network basis functions and a loss function designed to mimic the CMB cosine similarity. We validate our pipeline using a variety of input bispectra, demonstrating that the approximations are $&gt;99.5\%$ correlated with the truth with just three terms. By incorporating the neural basis into the \textsc{PolySpec} code, we derive KSW-type CMB estimators, which reproduce local- and equilateral-type non-Gaussianity to within $0.1\sigma$. As a proof-of-concept, we constrain two inflationary bispectra from the `cosmological collider' scenario; these feature an additional strongly-mixed particle sector and cannot be computed analytically. By combining the numerical predictions from \textsc{CosmoFlow} with our factorizable approach (with just three terms), we place novel constraints on the collider models using \textit{Planck} PR4 data, finding no detection of non-Gaussianity. Our method facilitates detailed studies of the inflationary paradigm, connecting modern theoretical tools with high-resolution observational data.</description>

      <title>Entropic Dynamics approach to Quantum Electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropic dynamics (ED) is a framework that allows one to derive quantum theory as a Hamilton-Killing flow on the cotangent bundle of a statistical manifold. These flows are such that they preserve the symplectic and the (information) metric geometries; they explain the linearity of quantum mechanics and the appearance of complex numbers. In this paper the ED framework is extended to deal with local gauge symmetries. More specifically, on the basis of maximum entropy methods and information geometry, for an appropriate choice of ontic variables and constraints, we derive the quantum electrodynamics of radiation fields interacting with charged particles. As a test that despite its unorthodox foundation the ED approach is empirically successful we derive the Maxwell equations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Probe of Singlet-Doublet Dark Matter Induced Radiative Neutrino Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an one loop radiative neutrino mass model, where the loop particles, notably a singlet fermion ($\chi$), a doublet fermion ($\Psi$) and three generations of singlet scalars ($\phi_i, i=\{1,2,3\}$) are assumed to be odd under an additional $\mathcal{Z}_2$-symmetry. In this setup, the singlet fermion mixes with the neutral component of the doublet to give rise singlet-doublet Majorana dark matter. The addition of $\mathcal{Z}_2$ odd scalars in the model provides rich phenomenological implications. We find that the quartic interaction terms between the SM Higgs and $\phi_i$s play a significant role in modifying the scalar potential to have a first-order phase transition (FOPT) leading to observable gravitational waves (GWs) spectra. We also examine the non-trivial role played by the singlet-doublet fermion DM and the scalars in loop-induced neutrino mass, $(g-2)_\mu$, and lepton flavor violation. We find that the model is predictive due to the combined constraints and can be verified at different terrestrial experiments.</description>

      <title>Axion Cosmology with Multi-Branch Yang-Mills</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that Yang-Mills theories, especially in the large-$N$ limit, exhibit a $\theta$-vacuum structure with a multi-branched vacuum energy. In this work, we demonstrate that this multi-branch structure can play a crucial role in axion cosmology when the axion acquires its mass from the Yang-Mills sector, even when that sector is never reheated by the inflaton. The key observation is that the axion potential is directly tied to the tunneling rate between adjacent branches. We find qualitatively new phenomena, including a new class of first-order phase transitions, bouncing bubbles, and nested "bubbles-within-bubbles." When the axion has a decay constant around the Planck scale, as motivated by the string Axiverse, the axion can be driven near the hilltop by inflationary dynamics, allowing the phase transition to be triggered. The associated energy release can be large enough to generate a significant stochastic gravitational-wave background, produce primordial black holes, or populate the Yang-Mills sector with particles. These phenomena represent novel predictions of the Axiverse and should be taken into account when assessing the cosmological impact of axions or axion-like particles. To recover conventional axion cosmology, one must suppress or avoid the dynamics discussed in this work.</description>

Abstract: A number of computational results concerning quantum conformal symmetry is presented. After a review of the connection between conformal symmetry for a Lagrangian field theory in flat space and Weyl symmetry for the same system embedded in a gravitational background, which is discussed in chapter 1, in chapter 2 the 3 energy momentum tensors correlation function is explicitly computed in three free field theories in 4 dimensions; the result is given for two of the three operators on the mass-shell. In chapter 3 a general method to map Green functions built in position space on the ground of symmetry requirements to momentum space, where they can be computed in terms of Feynman diagrams, is developed and discussed: an "integrability" condition, allowing to decide whether a certain correlator can exist within a Lagrangian theory, is derived. Chapter 4 discusses the possible phenomenological implications of the conformal anomaly pole which shows up in the 3 point Green function of one energy momentum tensor with two gauge currents and is interpreted as the perturbative signature of the pseudo-Goldstone boson of conformal symmetry, the dilaton. In chapter 5 we present the computation of the completely traced 4 point function of the energy momentum tensor with a method that exploits the relation between 1-loop counterterms and conformal anomalies, completely bypassing perturbative computations with Feynman diagrams. Later in chapter 6, an algorithm is developed which allows to compute recursively the completely traced Green functions of any number of energy momentum tensors in any renormalization scheme, starting from the dilaton Wess-Zumino action for conformal anomalies. This is derived by applying the Weyl-gauging procedure to the 1-loop counterterms in dimensional regularization. The result is explicitly derived and tested in 2, 4 and 6 dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.15478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We uncover a new gravitational-wave production mechanism in cosmological, first-order, thermal phase transitions. These are usually assumed to proceed via the nucleation of bubbles of the stable phase inside the metastable phase. However, if the nucleation rate is sufficiently suppressed, then the Universe may supercool all the way down the metastable branch and enter the spinodal region. In this case the transition proceeds via the exponential growth of unstable modes and the subsequent formation, merging and relaxation of phase domains. We use holography to follow the real-time evolution of this process in a strongly coupled, four-dimensional gauge theory. The resulting gravitational wave spectrum differs qualitatively from that in transitions mediated by bubble nucleation. We discuss the possibility that the spinodal dynamics may be preceded by a period of thermal inflation.</description>

      <title>Higher-Derivative Corrections via the Double Copy Procedure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05628v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in the off-shell formulation of the Double Copy (DC) procedure have revealed a profound connection between gauge theories and T-duality invariant frameworks. The main example is Double Field Theory (DFT), emerging as the the off-shell DC of Yang-Mills theory up to cubic order in perturbations. Extending this procedure to a higher-derivative gauge theory gives rise to a Higher-Derivative Double Theory (HDDT), which incorporates Weyl gravity along with $b$-field and dilaton contributions, all in a T-duality invariant manner. In this work, we show that the quadratic contributions of HDDT are directly related (up to field redefinitions) to DFT+, a T-duality invariant model associated with the bosonic string that incorporates first-order $\alpha'$ corrections upon parameterization. Our results expand the potential applications of the off-shell DC program towards constructing perturbative $\alpha'$-corrected Lagrangians, while also opening up possibilities for reversing the map by considering the single and zeroth copies.</description>

      <title>Fortuity in SYK Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fortuity phenomenon in supersymmetric Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. For generic choices of couplings, all the BPS states in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY SYK model are fortuitous. The SYK models reveal an intimate connection between fortuity and the Schwarzian description of supersymmetric black holes, reflected in a sharp feature of $R$-charge concentration - microscopically, all the fortuitous states are concentrated in particular charge sectors. We propose that both $R$-charge concentration and the random matrix behavior near the BPS states are key properties of a generic $q$-local supercharge and formulate these as a supercharge chaos conjecture. We expect supercharge chaos to hold universally for supercharges in holographic CFTs near their fortuitous states, potentially providing a microscopic interpretation for the charge constraints of supersymmetric black holes.
  We also construct SYK models that contain both fortuitous states and monotonous states and contrast their properties, providing further evidence that monotonous states are less chaotic than fortuitous states.</description>

Abstract: We present a new computational framework combining coarse-graining techniques with bootstrap methods to study quantum many-body systems. The method efficiently computes rigorous upper and lower bounds on both zero- and finite-temperature expectation values of any local observables of infinite quantum spin chains. This is achieved by using tensor networks to coarse-grain bootstrap constraints, including positivity, translation invariance, equations of motion, and energy-entropy balance inequalities. Coarse-graining allows access to constraints from significantly larger subsystems than previously possible, yielding tighter bounds compared to those obtained without coarse-graining.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the consistency of a perturbative definition of the S-matrix in a particular class of non-Lagrangian theories. We focus on the $p$-form theories proposed in \cite{Broccoli:2021pvv}, which are fully defined by "third-way" consistent equations of motion. Using the perturbiner method, we show that the unitarity is absent even at the tree level. We then pin down a unique modification of the equations of motion that restores unitarity. The trade-off is the reinstatement of an underlying Lagrangian, which we recognize as the higher-dimensional generalization of the Freedman-Townsend (FT) model. Finally, we discuss conserved currents in third-way theories and show they all follow from parent currents in the FT model. In particular, we point out the existence of a higher-ranked global symmetry, which signals that the FT model is compatible with the existence of brane-like charged objects in higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We explore the tropical analog of spinors by representing tropical geometries as foliated Riemann surfaces endowed with degenerate complex structures. We investigate tropical limits of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and explicitly construct its square root, which defines a tropical Dirac operator. We find that the tropical Clifford algebra is classified as a degenerate Clifford algebra with nilpotent generators. The nilpotent generator allows us to work with a new kind of representation that allows for Grassmann odd numbers, effectively supersymmetrizing the tropical spin bundle. We show through Dirac-Bergmann's quantization procedure, that the corresponding tropicalized quantum field theories enjoy a purely fermionic topological symmetry which can be expected to give a new class of path integral localization that we call tropical localization similar to the alternative localization method recently constructed by Choi and Takhtajan. We also discuss how the tropical Dirac operator, when twisted by gauge fields, obeys a tropical version of the Lichnerowicz identity, thereby demonstrating how some elements of Yang-Mills curvature should arise in the tropical limit.</description>

Abstract: We study anisotropic scaling limits of topological field theories using tropical geometry. The resulting topological field theories are characterized by foliated geometries and are invariant under foliation-preserving gauge transformations. We demonstrate the tropicalization for the 2D BF theory and generalize the prescription to topological Yang-Mills and Chern-Simons theories. We call the tropical limit of the BF theory, the \textit{TBF} theory, which is an anisotropic generalization of the BF theory with an additional adjoint-valued field $T$ that enforces a projectability condition onto the leaves of the foliation. The TBF theory localizes onto the moduli space of tropicalized flat connections $\mathcal{M}(\Sigma_g,G)$ on a foliated Riemann surface $\Sigma_g$ of genus $g$. The tropical connections exhibit anisotropic behavior; their holonomy is sensitive only to the leaves of the foliation. We analyze this moduli space two distinct ways, Firstly, they are classified by leaf-wise holonomy whose dimension can be explicitly calculated for the case of tropical projective space $\mathbb{TP}^1$ by the moduli space isomorphism $\mathcal{M}\left(\mathbb{TP} ^1, G\right) \cong \operatorname{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}, G) / G$. The second way is through Kodaira-Spencer theory which gives a twisted cohomology argument to argue that $\operatorname{dim} \mathcal{M}\left(\mathbb{T} P^1, G\right)=\operatorname{rank}(\mathfrak{g})$ and we demonstrate their equivalence for the case of SU$(N)$. We show that we can glue together several $\mathbb{TP}^1$ to obtain $\operatorname{dim} \mathcal{M}\left(\Sigma_g, G\right)=(g-1)\operatorname{rank}(\mathfrak{g})$ for $g \geq 2$ which is precisely $\frac{1}{2}$ of the usual result through an application of a foliated refinement of the Atiyah-Segal axioms. We leave several open questions such as potential connections to JT gravity and anisotropic conformal field theory.</description>

Abstract: Through the holographic correspondence, we compute the entanglement entropy of the gluonic field sourced by a quark-antiquark pair undergoing uniform back-to-back acceleration. Previous calculations had obtained this only for the case where the entanglement surface is located midway between the quark and antiquark. Here, we consider the more general case with a relative lateral displacement, and determine the entanglement entropy as a function of the distance between the quark and the entanglement surface. This setup is of interest because it departs from the usual simplifying conditions of staticity and thermality, and because it yields more information about the entanglement pattern in the gluonic field and about the possibility of eventually developing a purely worldsheet interpretation for said entanglement.</description>

Abstract: We continue our investigation into anisotropic topological field theories which arise from a tropical limit of conventional isotropic topological field theories. We analyze both the TBF theory and the tropical analogue of 2D topological Yang-Mills theory (TrYM) through a direct path integral calculation which probes a deformed analytic torsion and also through canonical quantization. The explicit construction of the Hilbert space of TrYM theory demonstrates that the TrYM theory provides an example of a solvable field theory where anisotropy properties and topological invariance can simultaneously hold. We show that the partition function has an asymptotic limit, which verifies that the dimension of the moduli space of tropicalized flat connection on a Riemann surface of genus $g&gt;1$ is precisely given by $(g-1) \operatorname{rank}(\mathfrak{g})$. We show that the interpretation of this result is that the random matrix model associated to the U$(N)$ TrYM is in fact a novel random matrix theory whose integration space is still the same space of hermitian matrices (similar to a GUE) however the Dyson index matches that of a GOE consistent with the usual intuition that tropicalization reduces down complex objects to their real counterparts.</description>

      <title>Structure of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ chiral algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chiral algebra of 4D $\mathcal{N}=4$ SU$(N)$ super-Yang-Mills theory is an $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal vertex operator algebra. We analyse the structure of this algebra by studying recursively the constraints that are required by the associativity of the operator product expansion. We find that the algebra is uniquely characterized by the central charge (which can take an arbitrary value), without any additional free parameter. Furthermore, the truncation pattern of the OPE coefficients suggests that the algebra cannot arise from the symmetric orbifold.</description>

      <title>Character of the highest weight module of BMS algebra realized on codimensional-two boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the highest weight representation (HWR) of the three and four-dimensional Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) algebra realized on the codimension-two boundary of asymptotic flat spacetime (AFS). In such a realization, the action of supertranslation shifts the conformal weight of the highest-weight states. As a result, there is no extra quantum number relating to the supertranslation. We construct the highest-weight BMS modules and compute their characters. We show that the BMS$_3$ highest-weight vacuum character with special value of central charges coincides with the 1-loop partition function of three-dimensional asymptotic flat gravity, up to an overall phase factor ``$i$''. We expect the vacuum character of BMS$_4$ may shed light on the flat holography in four dimensions.</description>

      <title>Bubbling saddles of the gravitational index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the five-dimensional supergravity path integral that computes a supersymmetric index, and uncover a wealth of semiclassical saddles with bubbling topology. These are complex finite-temperature configurations asymptotic to $S^1\times\mathbb{R}^4$, solving the supersymmetry equations. We assume a ${\rm U}(1)^3$ symmetry given by the thermal isometry and two rotations, and present a general construction based on a rod structure specifying the fixed loci of the ${\rm U}(1)$ isometries and their three-dimensional topology. These fixed loci may correspond to multiple horizons or three-dimensional bubbles, and they may have $S^3$, $S^2\times S^1$, or lens space topology. Allowing for conical singularities gives additional topologies involving spindles and branched spheres or branched lens spaces. As a particularly significant example, we analyze in detail the configurations with a horizon and a bubble just outside of it. We determine the possible saddle-point contribution of these configurations to the gravitational index by evaluating their on-shell action and the relevant thermodynamic relations. We also spell out two limits leading to well-defined Lorentzian solutions. The first is the extremal limit, which gives the known BPS black ring and black lens solutions. The on-shell action and chemical potentials remain well-defined in this limit and should thus provide the contribution of the black ring and black lens to the gravitational index. The second is a limit leading to horizonless bubbling solutions, which have purely imaginary action.</description>

Abstract: We systematically classify all supersymmetry-preserving mass deformations of SYM matrix models in all dimensions (D = 3, 4, 6, 10). In D = 10, the polarized IKKT model emerges as the only possible deformation. In D = 4, we identify two massive models without a sign problem, making them attractive candidates for non-perturbative numerical studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gradient flow exact renormalization (GFERG) is a variant of the exact renormalization group of gauge theory that aims to preserve gauge symmetry as manifestly as possible. From an integral representation of the Wilson action in GFERG for the Yang--Mills theory, we explicitly compute the one-loop renormalization group functions that reproduce correct coefficients. From the correspondence with the gradient flow formalism by L\"uscher and Weisz, we also argue that GFERG reproduces the conventional renormalization group functions in all orders of perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: We solve the classical and quantum problems for the 1D sigma model with target space the flag manifold $\mathrm{U}(3)\over \mathrm{U}(1)^3$, equipped with the most general invariant metric. In particular, we explicitly describe all geodesics in terms of elliptic functions and demonstrate that the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator may be found by solving polynomial (Bethe) equations. The main technical tool that we use is a mapping between the sigma model and a Gaudin model, which is also shown to hold in the $\mathrm{U}(n)$ case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the holographic thermal propagator in 4 spacetime dimensions can be related to the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of the $\Omega$-deformed ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory with $N_f=4$ hypermultiplets. There are two expansions involved: one is the expansion in small temperature which in the Seiberg-Witten language is equivalent to the semiclassical expansion in inverse powers of the large adjoint vev and the second is the expansion in instanton numbers. Working in the simplified case of zero energy, we find that the latter expansion gives rise to quasi-modular forms which can be resummed as functions of Eisenstein series. The so obtained series in positive powers of small temperature shows clear signs of being asymptotic.</description>

      <title>Boundary reflection matrices of massive $\phi_{1,3}$-perturbed unitary minimal models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose explicit expressions for the boundary reflection matrices of the ${\cal A}_m+(r,s)$ series of massive scattering theories, obtained by perturbing the ${\cal A}_m$ unitary minimal models with $(r,s)$ boundary conditions with both bulk and boundary $\phi_{1,3}$ operators. We identify the vacua that live on the boundary with the allowed edges of the $(r,s)$ conformal boundary conditions of the $A_m$ Andrews-Baxter-Forrester model. The boundary reflection matrices are then ``direct sums'' of certain pairs of $A_{m-1}$ Behrend-Pearce solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation and are consistent with the boundary bootstrap and the recently-introduced crossing, as well as the $Z_{2}$ (height-reversal), Kac table and non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers how exponential corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula affect the thermodynamic behavior of the FLRW cosmological model. These corrections drastically change the form of the Friedman field equations inducing non-trivial phase transition behavior. For negative values of the trace parameter $\alpha$, the system presents first-order phase transitions above the critical temperature, and for positive $\alpha$, the system undergoes a reentrant phase transition. As these corrections are presumably relevant at the early Universe stage, to corroborate the presence of some potential vestige of this contribution in the current era, a study has been carried out comparing observational data and current values of the Hubble parameter.</description>

      <title>New formalism for perturbations of massive gravity theories around arbitrary background spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new technique for studying the perturbations of dRGT-type massive gravity theories around arbitrary background spacetimes. Built initially from the vielbein formulation of the theory, but switching back to the metric formulation afterwards, our approach bypasses many of the complications that arise in previous metric formulation approaches to linearising massive gravity around generic backgrounds, naturally elucidates the ghost-free structure of the interactions, and readily generalises to higher orders in perturbation theory, as well as to multiple interacting metric tensor fields. To demonstrate the power of our technique, we apply our formalism to a number of commonly occurring example backgrounds - proportional, cosmological, and black hole - recovering and extending many known results from the literature at linear order. Lastly, we provide, for the first time, the cubic order multi-gravity potential around a generic background spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the first rigorous one-loop proof of quantum stability for BPS membranes in the Lorentz-covariant M2-brane matrix model with Restricted Volume-Preserving Deformations (RVPD). Exploiting the closure of restricted $\kappa$-symmetry with RVPD ensures that the BRST complex terminates without an infinite ghost tower, keeping the gauge-fixed measure analytically controllable.
  Our main result establishes that the 2D, 4D, 6D, and 8D noncommutative membranes remain stable, while the 10D configuration inevitably develops a tachyonic mode.
  Our analysis unifies the treatment of zero-modes, connects the effective action to central charges, and clarifies relations to BFSS, BLG/ABJM, and prospective M5-brane matrix models, providing a roadmap for RVPD-based extensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the systematic construction of bosonic DDF operators to the light-like linear dilaton background to investigate how higher-spin string states behave beyond flat spacetime. Using previous results, we show that the spectrum-generating algebra is isomorphic to the flat spacetime case up to a few subtleties. This extension provides a controlled setting to explore higher-spin massive string interactions in a nontrivial yet exactly solvable string background. Most of the derivations lead to expressions very similar to those in the flat background, with the expected modifications appearing quite naturally in the spectrum and the deformed momentum-(non)conserving delta function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the (type 0B) $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric complex Liouville string ($\text{S}\mathbb{C}\text{LS}$), a supersymmetric extension of the bosonic complex Liouville string ($\mathbb{C}\text{LS}$). We compute the sphere three-point amplitudes (including NS-NS-NS and NS-R-R types) and find they share the same form as the sphere three-point amplitude of the bosonic $\mathbb{C}\text{LS}$. Analysis of the analytic structure of the NS-NS-NS-NS four-point amplitude and the higher equations of motion also yields results identical to the bosonic case. Based on these findings, we propose that the dual matrix model for the $\text{S}\mathbb{C}\text{LS}$ is the same as that for the bosonic $\mathbb{C}\text{LS}$. We also investigate a related theory $\widehat{\text{S}\mathbb{C}\text{LS}}$, which differs in the gauged worldsheet supersymmetry. A parallel analysis is performed for $\widehat{\text{S}\mathbb{C}\text{LS}}$, and a candidate for its dual matrix model is proposed. We then carry out a partial numerical evaluation of the moduli space integral, which provides further evidence for both the proposals of the dual matrix model regarding $\text{S}\mathbb{C}\text{LS}$ and $\widehat{\text{S}\mathbb{C}\text{LS}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter we show that the one-loop QCD $\beta$-function can be obtained from an index theorem on twistor space. This is achieved by recalling that the $\theta$-angle of self-dual gauge theory flows according the one-loop $\beta$-function. Rewriting self-dual gauge theory as a holomorphic theory on twistor space this flow can be computed as the anomaly to scale invariance. The one-loop Weyl anomaly coefficient $a-c$ can be recovered similarly.</description>

Abstract: We study wavepackets that propagate across (a) topological interfaces in quantum spin systems exhibiting non-invertible symmetries and (b) duality defects coupling dual theories. We demonstrate that the transmission is always perfect, and that a particle traversing the interface is converted into a nonlocal string-like excitation. We give a systematic way of constructing such a defect by identifying its Hilbert space with the virtual bond dimension of the matrix product operator representing defect lines. Our work both gives an operational meaning to topological interfaces, and provides a lattice analogue of recent results solving the monopole paradox in quantum field theory.</description>

These models extend factorised scattering beyond the conventional framework, featuring both the usual hierarchy of integer-spin conserved charges and an additional tower of fractional-spin ones. Our construction relies on a reparametrisation of rapidity space that lifts standard scattering amplitudes to a multiplet related by an internal cyclic symmetry. This construction is naturally embedded within a generalised Gibbs ensemble, which provides the natural framework for a consistent graded Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz. This leads to new Y-systems encoding the graded spectrum. In a special case, these functional relations match those obtained via the ODE/IM correspondence from the monodromy analysis of the quantum cubic oscillator. Even in the simplest models, for one sign of the auxiliary temperature, the finite-volume ground-state energy spectrum undergoes an infinite sequence of level crossings as the coupling strength increases. A preliminary analysis also suggests that these theories exhibit structural connections with cyclic orbifolds. Within this setup, one can consistently include extra CDD factors that realise fractional-spin analogues of the $T\bar{T}$ deformation. In analytically tractable cases, a Hagedorn-like behaviour is observed for a sign of the flow parameter, and the deformed spectrum develops a finite limiting temperature.</description>

      <title>Quantum Vacuum Self-Consistency as the Dynamical Origin of Spacetime and Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework based on the postulate of quantum vacuum self-consistency, where classical backgrounds -- spacetime, gauge fields, and the Higgs condensate -- are macroscopic order parameters of a single quantum state, sustained by the vacuum expectation values of the fluctuations they support. Using a background-field, heat-kernel approach, we derive the coupled low-energy effective equations for the metric, gauge, and Higgs fields as vacuum equations of state. This recovers the Einstein, Yang--Mills, and Higgs equations, augmented by the higher-derivative operators required for quantum consistency, with all couplings running coherently under a single RG flow.
  The framework is embedded in a UV-complete theory of higher-derivative gravity (quantized with the fakeon prescription for unitarity) coupled to the Standard Model (SM). We assume the combined system flows to an asymptotically safe fixed point in the UV, rendering the theory predictive. A solvable O(N) model is used to explicitly demonstrate how the vacuum gap equations constrain both the condensate and curvature.
  The framework yields robust phenomenological predictions: (1) The loop-induced $R^2$ term drives Starobinsky-type inflation, with $n_s \simeq 1 - 2/N_e$ and $r \simeq 12/N_e^2$. (2) Short-distance corrections to gravity are quantified and satisfy laboratory bounds. (3) The speed of gravitational waves is luminal, consistent with GW170817. The combination of asymptotic safety with the vacuum gap equations correlates IR observables in gravity and particle physics, constraining SM parameters from the properties of the UV fixed point. The theory is testable across cosmology and precision gravity, reducing to General Relativity and the SM at low energies with controlled corrections.</description>

      <title>Dual holography as functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the functional renormalization group (RG) and the dual holography framework in the path integral formulation, highlighting how each can be understood as a manifestation of the other. Rather than employing the conventional functional RG formalism, we consider a functional RG equation for the probability distribution function, where the RG flow is governed by a Fokker-Planck-type equation. The central idea is to reformulate the solution of Fokker-Planck type functional RG equation in a path integral representation. Within the semiclassical approximation, this leads to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation for an effective renormalized on-shell action. We then examine our framework for an Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to a scalar field. Applying standard techniques, we derive a corresponding functional RG equation for the distribution function, where the dual holographic path integral serves as its formal solution. By synthesizing these two perspectives, we propose a generalized dual holography framework in which the RG flow is explicitly incorporated into the bulk effective action. This generalization naturally introduces RG $\beta$-functions and reveals that the RG flow of the distribution function is essentially identical to that of the functional RG equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the nonvanishing spectral torsion functional of the internal part of the noncommutative geometry behind the Standard Model. We show that with a suitable modification of the usual differential graded calculus it matches an analogous functional constructed in terms of the connection. We study also the impact of the torsion on the other spectral fuctionals, which correspond to geometric invariants such as volume integral, metric and Einstein tensors, and scalar curvature. We discuss the impact of the SM Yukawa couplings and the Majorana mass matrix on our results.</description>

      <title>Geometry Induced Chiral Transport and Entanglement in $AdS_2$ Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the real-time chiral dynamics of Dirac fermions in AdS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ black hole backgrounds. The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of bulk metric reconstruction in holography by leveraging the inverse scattering framework applied to boundary two-point correlation functions. We generalize our previous work of scalar field and show that reconstruction can be achieved using a single operator rather than a pair. We also apply this method into reconstruction of static homogeneous anisotropic black holes and the reconstruction using correlation function of gauge field. In addition, we analyze the method's robustness under measurement noise and propose filtering strategies to improve reconstruction accuracy. This work advances data-driven bulk reconstruction by providing a concrete, experimentally viable pathway to recover spacetime geometry from field-theoretic observables.</description>

      <title>Geometric Solution of the Loop Equation and Quark Confinement in Planar QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact analytic area law for planar QCD satisfying the MM loop equation for arbitrary loops. The solution is constructed using a quaternionic Hodge-dual minimal surface in a 16-dimensional auxiliary space. Unlike random surfaces, this construction defines a \textbf{topological string theory} where the action is proportional to the area of the conformal map of the 2D disk, possessing no bulk quantum fluctuations.
  The Wilson loop factorizes into a confining dressing factor and the perturbative term: $W[C] = W_{pert}[C] e^{- \kappa S[C]}$. This corresponds to a non-perturbative gluon condensate vacuum supporting planar graph fluctuations. We prove the inequality $S[C] \ge \sqrt{2} A[C]$ (where $A[C]$ is the Euclidean minimal area), establishing a sufficient condition for confinement.
  The area law is defined explicitly as $S[C] = 2\sqrt{2} (\lambda_3 + \lambda_4)$ using the two largest eigenvalues of the Douglas-Gram matrix. We demonstrate that this functional is an exact additive zero mode of the loop diffusion operator, protected algebraically by the Bianchi identity. This ensures global validity for all regular loops ($C \in H^{1/2}(\mathbb{S}^1, \mathbb{R}^4)$).
  Matching this confining factor with the gluon condensate via the QCD Operator Product Expansion (OPE) determines the physical string tension $\kappa \sim \Lambda_{QCD}^2$ (up to a universal numerical factor). This framework provides a first-principles derivation of confinement in large-$N_c$ QCD and new tools for the high-lying meson spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the entanglement first law of conformal field theory (CFT) to timelike subregions. Focusing on intervals along the time direction of the boundary CFT, we show that the associated timelike entanglement entropy obeys a first-law-like relation, with an effective entanglement temperature inversely proportional to the temporal size of the interval. By implementing a double Wick rotation, we obtain the exact modular Hamiltonian for a suitable hyperbolic subsystem and use it to formulate the timelike entanglement first law precisely. Our central result is a detailed proof that, in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetime, this timelike entanglement first law is equivalent to linearized Einstein's equations in the bulk: the first law follows from the linearized equations and, conversely, implies them. Our result further reveal the dynamical connections between entanglement and gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For most of cosmic history, the evolution of our Universe has been governed by the physics of a 'dark sector', consisting of dark matter and dark energy, whose properties are only understood in a schematic way. The influence of these constituents is mediated exclusively by the force of gravity, meaning that insight into their nature must be gleaned from gravitational phenomena. The advent of gravitational-wave astronomy has revolutionised the field of black hole astrophysics, and opens a new window of discovery for cosmological sources. Relevant examples include topological defects, such as domain walls or cosmic strings, which are remnants of a phase transition. Here we present the first simulations of cosmic structure formation in which the dynamics of the dark sector introduces domain walls as a source of stochastic gravitational waves in the late Universe. We study in detail how the spectrum of gravitational waves is affected by the properties of the model, and extrapolate the results to scales relevant to the recent evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background. Our relativistic implementation of the field dynamics paves the way for optimal use of the next generation of gravitational experiments to unravel the dark sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study rank-2 wobbly bundles on a Riemann surface $C$ of genus $g\geq 2$, i.e. semi-stable bundles admitting nonzero nilpotent Higgs fields, in terms of direct images of line bundles on smooth spectral curves $\tilde{C} \overset{\pi}{\rightarrow} C$. We give a sufficient condition for a semi-stable bundle $E$ to be wobbly: $E$ is a twist of $\pi_\ast \left(\mathcal{O}_{\tilde{C}}(\tilde{D}) \right)$ where the norm of $\tilde{D}$ is a summand of the divisor of a quadratic differential on $C$. We sketch the proof of the necessary condition statement, namely all rank-2 wobbly bundles can be characterised as such, and discuss how certain singularities of the wobbly locus arise from the Brill-Noether loci of spectral curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a paper in the field of ontological deterministic theories behind Quantum Field Theories, like for example the cellular automaton theories proposed by 't Hooft. In these theories one has ontological states in which the state of reality is exactly known and no uncertainties are present. Also these states evolve in time deterministically. A first step in finding the ontological deterministic theory behind the Standard Model is to find in Quantum Field Theory the states that behave as ontological states. We present the ontological states for all non-interacting (3+1-dimensional) Quantum Field Theories occurring in the Standard Model. We summarize the ontological states for free scalar bosons and for free masless Dirac fermions, which are known from the literature. We construct the ontological states for vector bosons, in analogy to the scalar boson case. With this we have a set of ontological states for all particles that are known to occur in reality and in the Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vertex algebras (and their modules) can be described as vector spaces together with a linear operator-valued series in one parameter $z$. With the interpretation of $z$ as a coordinate at a point on a curve, one can construct algebraic structures on the moduli space of curves from $V$-modules. Here we propose a generalization of vertex algebras involving linear operators in parameters $z_1,\ldots,z_n$. One may interpret these as being the components of a set of coordinates on an $n$-dimensional algebraic variety. These are referred to as cohomological vertex algebras (CVAs): the formal punctured 1-disk underlying a vertex algebra is replaced by a ring modeling the cohomology of certain modifications of the formal $n$-disk. We prove several structural theorems for CVAs and give a definition of cohomological vertex operator algebras (CVOAs). Using a reconstruction theorem for CVAs, we provide basic examples such as the $\beta\gamma$-system, the Heisenberg CVA, and the affine Kac-Moody CVAs. We use these constructions to describe BRST reduction, leading to an analog of W-algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-form symmetries act on sub-dimensional spatial manifolds of a quantum system. They can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose that the emergence of 1-form symmetries is information-theoretic in nature, precisely characterized by the preservation of information about how quantum states transform under the symmetry. As a consequence, the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition which we argue to be revealed from the long-range entanglement in the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to efficiently detect 1-form symmetries with a global quantum error correction (QEC) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As a practical application of our framework, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transition characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately determined by a disorder parameter. We further argue that our proposed theory for emergent 1-form symmetries offers new perspectives on particle condensation and suggests sharp information-theoretic phase boundaries between Higgs and confining regimes in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13904v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe\,Ia) serve as crucial cosmological distance indicators because of their empirical consistency in peak luminosity and characteristic light curve decline rates. These properties facilitate them to be standardized candles for the determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) within late-time universe cosmology. Nevertheless, a statistically significant difference persists between $H_0$ values derived from early and late-time measurements, a phenomenon known as the Hubble tension. Furthermore, recent observations have identified a subset of over-luminous SNe\,Ia, characterized by peak luminosities exceeding the nominal range and faster decline rates. These discoveries raise questions regarding the reliability of SNe\,Ia as standard candles for measuring cosmological distances. In this article, we present the Bayesian analysis of 15 over-luminous SNe\,Ia and show that they yield a lower $H_0$ estimate due to the increase in their absolute magnitude. This investigation potentially represents a step toward addressing the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Relativistic stars in $f(Q)$-gravity: Exact analytic solution for the power-law case $f(Q) = Q + b \: Q^\nu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate static spherically symmetric spacetimes within the framework of symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity in order to describe relativistic stars. We adopt a specific ansatz for the background geometry corresponding to a singularity-free space-time. We obtain an expression for the connection, which allows the derivation of solutions for any $f(Q)$ theory in this context. Our approach aims to address a recurring error appearing in the literature, where even when a connection compatible with spherical symmetry is adopted, the field equation for the connection is systematically omitted and not checked if it is satisfied. For the stellar configuration, we concentrate on the power-law model $f(Q)=Q+\alpha Q_{0}\left( \frac{Q}{Q_{0}}\right) ^{\nu }$. The de Sitter-Schwarzschild geometry naturally emerges as an attractor beyond a certain radius, we thus utilize it as the external solution beyond the boundary of the star. We perform a detailed investigation of the physical characteristics of the interior solution, explicitly determining the mass function, analyzing the resulting gravitational fluid properties and deriving the angular and radial speed of sound.</description>

      <title>Hints for a Geon from Causal Dynamic Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of geons, physical states of self-bound gravitons, has long been proposed. In the context of four-dimensional causal dynamical triangulation simulations we investigate this possibility by measuring curvature-curvature correlators of different gravitational operators. We find a behavior consistent with a massive state, independent of the operators considered, over a certain distance window. While at most a hint, this is tantalizing due to its possible implications for dark matter or (primordial) black holes. We also find indications that the phase of rapid expansion of the obtained de Sitter universe impacts the mass, and relates to quantum fluctuations of space-time.</description>

      <title>Frequency contamination from new fundamental fields in black hole ringdowns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the modelling of black hole ringdown beyond General Relativity (GR), emphasizing the limitations of approaches that rely solely on shifted quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies. Starting from modified Teukolsky equations in such scenarios, we classify the distinct types of deviations that can arise -- those shifting QNM frequencies, and those introducing additional frequencies associated with extra fields. We then construct the most general ansatz for metric perturbations in this context and discuss its implications for QNM modelling and theory-agnostic tests of GR using gravitational wave data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give the most up-to-date determinations of the normalization of the leading renormalons of the pole mass, the singlet static potential, the octet static potential, and the gluelump energy. They read $Z^{\rm MS}_m=-Z^{\rm MS}_{V_s}/2=\{0.604(17),0.551(20)\}$, $Z^{\rm MS}_{V_o}=\{0.136(8),0.121(13)\}$, and $Z^{\rm MS}_A=\{-1.343(36),-1.224(43)\}$, for $n_f=0$ and $n_f=3$ respectively. We obtain two independent renormalization group invariant and renormalization scale independent determinations of the energy of the ground state gluelump in the principal value summation scheme: $\Lambda_{B}^{\rm PV}=2.47(9)r_0^{-1}$ and $\Lambda_{B}^{\rm PV}=2.38(11)r_0^{-1}$. They combine in $\Lambda_{B}^{\rm PV}=2.44(7)r_0^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Can Gravitational Wave Data Shed Light on Dark Matter Particles ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) data from observed binary black hole coalescences (BBHC) have been demonstrated in recent analyses to validate the Hawking Area Theorem (HAT) for black hole horizons. The result of such analyses is imposed here as a criterion of {\it absolute} consistency on the logarithmic (in horizon area) corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking Area Formula (BHAF) for the black hole entropy, when these corrections are computed both from non-perturbative quantum fluctuations of spacetime in matter-free quantum general relativity, as well as arising due to perturbative quantum matter field fluctuations around a stationary classical black hole background spacetime. This criterion of absolute consistency is seen to be obeyed provided certain restrictions ensue on the spin-parity and number of species of the spectrum of quantum matter fluctuations. Such constraints appear to restrict the Beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) part of the matter fluctuation spectrum. Some species of the constrained, yet-unobserved BSM particle spectrum are currently under active consideration in particle cosmology as candidates for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Hemisphere mass up to four-loops with generalised $k_t$ algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the fixed-order distribution of the non-global hemisphere mass observable in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation up to four loops for various sequential recombination jet algorithms. In particular, we focus on the $k_t$ and Cambridge/Aachen algorithms. Using eikonal theory and strong-energy ordering of the final-state partons, we determine the complete structure of both abelian (clustering) and non-abelian non-global logarithms through four loops in perturbation theory. We compare the resulting resummed expressions for both jet algorithms with the standard Sudakov form factor and demonstrate that neglecting these logarithms leads to unreliable phenomenological predictions for the observable's distribution.</description>

      <title>Effects of a Brueckner-Hartree-Fock-corrected effective mass on speed of sound, conformality, and observables of dark matter-admixed neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an equation of state describing cold and dense matter in the core of neutron stars which includes an admixture of fermionic dark matter and incorporates nucleon effective masses derived from the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) many-body approach within a relativistic mean-field model. Such a BHF-informed mixed-model approach increases stellar compactness, with mass-radius configurations which are consistent with smaller, lighter pulsars. The model displays the expected non-monotonic behavior of sound speed hinted at by neutron star data, and is closer to the conformal bound at maximum mass. We find that the model displays tension with bounds on heavier pulsars, suggesting that the hypothesis of an aggregated dark component in neutron stars needs further critical study.</description>

      <title>Cancellation of one-loop correction to soft tensor power spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that there are no scale-invariant one-loop corrections to the superhorizon tensor perturbations from small-scale (potentially enhanced) scalar perturbations, irrespective of the details of inflationary background time evolution. For this purpose we derive a soft tensor effective field theory at leading order in the gradient expansion by integrating out small-scale scalar fluctuations in a general time-dependent background over the Schwinger-Keldysh contour, i.e., we perform loop calculations in the soft limit of external momentum. The absence of scale-invariant corrections originates from the diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity and is therefore unavoidable.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Gravity through Realistic 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: General Algorithm and a Pilot Study with HARPS Radial Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When 3D relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{G/G_{\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm N}&gt;10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\Gamma=0.134_{-0.036}^{+0.056}$ (thermal prior on eccentricity) or $0.115_{-0.028}^{+0.048}$ (flat prior) for 8 binaries with $g_{\rm N}&lt;10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$. The $&gt;3.7\sigma$ discrepancy with Newton is significantly contributed by one system whose relative 3D velocity between the pair exceeds the Newtonian escape velocity. This system is not likely to be a chance association but may be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquid behaviour of CDW instabilities in fractionally-filled moir\'e flatbands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin- and valley-polarized fractionally-filled moir\'e flatbands are known to host emergent Fermi-liquid phases, when analyzed with the help of a dual description in terms of holes. The dominant Coulomb interactions in an almost flatband endow the fermions with a nontrivial dispersion, when the system is described in terms of the hole operators (rather than the particle operators). In particular, for one-fourth filling, the Fermi surface takes a quasi-triangular shape, which brings about the possibility of charge-density-wave (CDW) ordering in the ground state, characterized by the nesting vectors ($ \mathbf{Q}_n $). The $\mathbf{Q}_n$'s connect antipodal points of the Fermi surface (designated as hot-spots) and are found to belong to the space of reciprocal vectors of the underlying honeycomb structure. The resulting CDW order can be described in terms of instabilities caused by bosonic fields with momenta centred at $\lbrace \mathbf{Q}_n \rbrace $, coupling with the fermions residing in the vicinity of a pair of antipodal hot-spots. When there is a transition from a Fermi liquid to a CDW state, the bosons become massless (or critical), effectuating a non-Fermi liquid behaviour. We set out to identify such non-Fermi liquid phases after constructing a minimal effective action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19822v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel gravitational configuration formed by a massless real phantom field and an axion scalar field, minimally coupled to gravity. This system describes an Ellis-type wormhole situated at the center of an axion star. By normalizing the mass of the axion field to unity, the physical properties of the model are determined by three independent parameters: the potential's decay constant, the frequency of the axion field, and the wormhole's throat parameter. We assess the traversability of this wormhole by examining the curvature scalars and energy conditions of the static solution. Our analysis of the wormhole's embedding diagrams indicates that, although the wormhole typically exhibits a single-throat geometry, a double-throat configuration featuring an equatorial plane may arise under specific conditions. Finally, an analysis of the null-geodesics reveals the existence of at least one unstable light ring at the wormhole throat.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we discuss the conditions that allow the establishment of an equivalence between $f(R,T)=R+\lambda h(T)$ gravity models and General Relativity (GR) coupled to a modified matter sector. We do so by considering a $D$-dimensional spacetime and the matter sector to be described by nonlinear electrodynamics and/or a scalar field. We find that, for this particular family of models, the action and field equations can indeed be written in terms of a modified matter source within GR. However, when several matter sources are combined, this interpretation is no longer possible if $h(T)$ is a nonlinear function, due to the emergence of crossed terms that mix together the scalar and vector sectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11656v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two body tunneling problems are hard to treat analytically due to the incompatibility between tunneling and perturbation theory. The lack of classical solutions of the Euclidean Lagrangian of continuous systems further thwarts semi-classical expansions. To develop an analytic theory which provides insight on interacting two-particle tunneling, we use new results to derive the Bethe-Salpeter equation of a tunneling field theory with Yukawa coupling. We show that in the one plus one dimensional case a closed form solution in the instantaneous positive-energy regime is permitted. We then compute the scattering amplitude by perturbing on interparticle interaction and recover the Lippmann-Schwinger equation to confirm physical consistency and relevancy.</description>

      <title>Nearly Monochromatic Primordial Black Holes as total Dark Matter from Bubble Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-field model where the inflaton $\chi$ is non-minimally coupled to the instanton $\phi$. By choosing an appropriate coupling function, we realize the scenario where the difference of the values of potential between false vacuum (FV) and true vacuum (TV) is maximized during inflation. Most of the bubbles are created at this time. After inflation ends, the potential value of FV drops below that of TV so that these bubbles collapse to form primordial black holes (PBHs). By tuning the parameters of our model, we analyze the Coleman-de Luccia (CDL) and Hawking-Moss (HM) process, finding that the corresponding mass function of PBHs is sharply peaked, implying that we can realize either PBHs as cold dark matter, sub-solar PBHs, or supermassive PBHs in this scenario without enhancement of primordial curvature perturbations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Structure of Nonlocal Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal interactions are known to generate volume-law entanglement entropy. However, their deeper impact on the fine structure of quantum correlations remains a key open question. In this work, we explore a bosonic nonlocal field theory, examining correlation measures beyond entanglement entropy, namely, mutual information and tripartite information. Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \(A\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement. Through holographic duality, we verify that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula correctly captures the volume-law scaling of entropy. Yet, a significant tension emerges: while the field theory reveals rich spatial correlations, the holographic model predicts a complete suppression of both mutual and tripartite information in the volume-law phase. This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory. Our results demonstrate that nonlocality gives rise to quantum states of such complexity that conventional geometric models of spacetime fall short. This points to the need for a new framework that goes beyond geometry to fully capture the nature of these correlations.</description>

Abstract: For SU(3) lattice QCD calculations at finite baryon-number densities, we propose the ``SO(3) real algebra method'', in which the SU(3) gauge variable is divided into the SO(3) and SU(3)/SO(3) parts. In this method, we introduce the ``maximal SO(3) gauge'' by minimizing the SU(3)/SO(3) part of the SU(3) gauge variable. In the Monte Carlo calculation, the SO(3) real algebra method employs the SO(3) fermionic determinant, i.e., the fermionic determinant of the SO(3) part of the SU(3) gauge variable, in the maximal SO(3) gauge, as well as the positive SU(3) gauge action factor $e^{-S_G}$. Here, the SO(3) fermionic determinant is real, and it is non-negative for the even-number flavor case ($N_f=2n$) of the same quark mass, e.g., $m_u=m_d$. The SO(3) real algebra method alternates between the maximal SO(3) gauge fixing and Monte Carlo updates on the SO(3) determinant and $e^{-S_G}$. After the most importance sampling, the ratio of the SU(3) and SO(3) fermionic determinants is treated as a weight factor. If the phase factor of the ratio does not fluctuate significantly among the sampled gauge configurations for a set of parameters (e.g., volume, chemical potential, and quark mass), then SU(3) lattice QCD calculations at finite densities would be feasible.</description>
