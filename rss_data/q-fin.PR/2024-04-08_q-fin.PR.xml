      <title>StockGPT: A GenAI Model for Stock Prediction and Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces StockGPT, an autoregressive "number" model pretrained directly on the history of daily U.S. stock returns. Treating each return series as a sequence of tokens, the model excels at understanding and predicting the highly intricate stock return dynamics. Instead of relying on handcrafted trading patterns using historical stock prices, StockGPT automatically learns the hidden representations predictive of future returns via its attention mechanism. On a held-out test sample from 2001 to 2023, a daily rebalanced long-short portfolio formed from StockGPT predictions earns an annual return of 119% with a Sharpe ratio of 6.5. The StockGPT-based portfolio completely explains away momentum and long-/short-term reversals, eliminating the need for manually crafted price-based strategies and also encompasses most leading stock market factors. This highlights the immense promise of generative AI in surpassing human in making complex financial investment decisions and illustrates the efficacy of the attention mechanism of large language models when applied to a completely different domain.</description>

      <title>The credit spread curve. I: Fundamental concepts, fitting, par-adjusted spread, and expected return</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.01330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of a credit spread curve is fundamental in fixed income investing, but in practice it is not `given' and needs to be constructed from bond prices either for a particular issuer, or for a sector rating-by-rating. Rather than attempting to fit spreads -- and as we discuss here, the Z-spread is unsuitable -- we fit parametrised survival curves. By deriving a valuation formula for a risky bond, we explain and avoid the problem that bonds with a high dollar price trade at a higher yield or spread than those with low dollar price (at the same maturity point), even though they do not necessarily offer better value. In fact, a concise treatment of this effect is elusive, and much of the academic literature on risky bond pricing, including a well-known paper by Duffie and Singleton (1997), is fundamentally incorrect. We then proceed to show how to calculate carry, rolldown and relative value for bonds/CDS. Also, once curve construction has been programmed and automated we can run it historically and assess the way a curve has moved over time. This provides the necessary grounding for econometric and arbitrage-free models of curve dynamics, which will be pursued in later work, as well as assessing how the perceived relative value of a particular instrument varies over time.</description>

      <title>Equity Protection Swaps: A New Type of Investment Insurance for Holders of Superannuation Accounts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to develop a new class of investment insurance products for holders of superannuation accounts in Australia, which we tentatively call equity protection swaps (EPSs). An EPS is a standalone financial derivative, which is reminiscent of a total return swap but also shares some features with the variable annuity known as the registered index-linked annuity (RILA). The buyer of an EPS obtains partial protection against losses on a reference portfolio and, in exchange, agrees to share portfolio gains with the insurance provider if the realized return on a reference portfolio is above a predetermined threshold. Formally, a generic EPS consists of protection and fee legs with participation rates agreed upon by the provider and holder. A general fair pricing formula for an EPS is obtained by considering a static hedging strategy based on traded European options. It is argued that to make the contract appealing to holders, the provider should select appropriate protection and fee rates that make the fair premium at the contract's inception equal to zero. A numerical study based on the Black-Scholes model and empirical tests based on market data for S\&amp;P~500 and S&amp;P/ASX~200 indices for 2020-2022 demonstrates the benefits of an EPS as an efficient investment insurance tool for superannuation accounts.</description>

      <title>On short-time behavior of implied volatility in a market model with indexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates short-term behaviors of implied volatility of derivatives written on indexes in equity markets when the index processes are constructed by using a ranking procedure. Even in simple market settings where stock prices follow geometric Brownian motion dynamics, the ranking mechanism can produce the observed term structure of at-the-money (ATM) implied volatility skew for equity indexes. Our proposed models showcase the ability to reconcile two seemingly contradictory features found in empirical data from equity markets: the long memory of volatilities and the power law of ATM skews. Furthermore, the models allow for the capture of a novel phenomenon termed the quasi-blow-up phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Economic Complexity Limits Accuracy of Price Probability Predictions by Gaussian Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the economic reasons why the predictions of price and return statistical moments in the coming decades, in the best case, will be limited by their averages and volatilities. That limits the accuracy of the forecasts of price and return probabilities by Gaussian distributions. The economic origin of these restrictions lies in the fact that the predictions of the market-based n-th statistical moments of price and return for n=1,2,.., require the description of the economic variables of the n-th order that are determined by sums of the n-th degrees of values or volumes of market trades. The lack of existing models that describe the evolution of the economic variables determined by the sums of the 2nd degrees of market trades results in the fact that even predictions of the volatilities of price and return are very uncertain. One can ignore existing economic barriers that we highlight but cannot overcome or resolve them. The accuracy of predictions of price and return probabilities substantially determines the reliability of asset pricing models and portfolio theories. The restrictions on the accuracy of predictions of price and return statistical moments reduce the reliability and veracity of modern asset pricing and portfolio theories.</description>
