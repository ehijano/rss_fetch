      <title>DeViNE: A Decentralized Virtual Network Embedding Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) is a technique for mapping virtual networks onto a physical network infrastructure, enabling multiple virtual networks to coexist on a shared physical network. Previous works focused on implementing centralized VNE algorithms, which suffer from lack of scalability and robustness. This project aims to implement a decentralized virtual network embedding algorithm that addresses the challenges of network virtualization, such as scalability, single point of failure, and DoS attacks. The proposed approach involves selecting L leaders from the physical nodes and embedding a virtual network request (VNR) in the local network of each leader using a simple algorithm like BFS. The algorithm then uses a leader-election mechanism for determining the node with the lowest cost and highest revenue and propagates the embedding to other leaders. By utilizing decentralization, we improve the scalability and robustness of the solution. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our fully decentralized algorithm by comparing it with existing approaches. Our algorithm performs $12\%$ better in terms of acceptance rate and improves the revenue-to-cost ratio by roughly $21\%$ to compared approaches.</description>

      <title>Scalable 3D Gaussian Splatting-Based RF Signal Spatial Propagation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective network planning and sensing in wireless networks require resource-intensive site surveys for data collection. An alternative is Radio-Frequency (RF) signal spatial propagation modeling, which computes received signals given transceiver positions in a scene (e.g.s a conference room). We identify a fundamental trade-off between scalability and fidelity in the state-of-the-art method. To address this issue, we explore leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), an advanced technique for the image synthesis of 3D scenes in real-time from arbitrary camera poses. By integrating domain-specific insights, we design three components for adapting 3DGS to the RF domain, including Gaussian-based RF scene representation, gradient-guided RF attribute learning, and RF-customized CUDA for ray tracing. Building on them, we develop RFSPM, an end-to-end framework for scalable RF signal Spatial Propagation Modeling. We evaluate RFSPM in four field studies and two applications across RFID, BLE, LoRa, and 5G, covering diverse frequencies, antennas, signals, and scenes. The results show that RFSPM matches the fidelity of the state-of-the-art method while reducing data requirements, training GPU-hours, and inference latency by up to 9.8\,$\times$, 18.6\,$\times$, and 84.4\,$\times$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Performing Load Balancing under Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Join-the-shortest queue (JSQ) and its variants have often been used in solving load balancing problems. JSQ minimizes the average system occupation, e.g., the customer's system time. In this paper, we extend the load balancing setting to include constraints that may be imposed due to the communication network. In particular, we cast the problem in the framework of constrained MDPs: this permit us to address both action-dependent constraints, such as, e.g, bandwidth constraints, and state-dependent constraints, such as, e.g., minimum queue utilization constraints. Unlike the state-of-the-art approaches in load balancing, our policies satisfy the constraints while delivering favorable results in terms of system occupancy. We derive policies that provably satisfy the constraints and evaluate their performance through extensive simulations.</description>

      <title>Design and Simulation of the Adaptive Continuous Entanglement Generation Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating and distributing remote entangled pairs (EPs) is the most important responsibility of quantum networks, because entanglement serves as the fundamental resource for important quantum networks applications. A key performance metric for quantum networks is the time-to-serve (TTS) for users' EP requests, which is the time to distribute EPs between the requesting users. Reducing the TTS is critically important given the limited qubit coherence time. In this paper, we study the Adaptive Continuous entanglement generation Protocol (ACP), which enables quantum network nodes to continuously generate EPs with their neighbors, while adaptively selecting the neighbors to reduce the TTS. Meanwhile, entanglement purification is used to mitigate the idling decoherence of the EPs generated by the ACP prior to the arrival user requests. We extend the capability of the SeQUeNCe simulator to allow the implementation of the ACP with full support. Then through extensive simulations, we evaluate the ACP at different network scales, demonstrating significant improvements in both the TTS (up to 94% decrease) and the fidelity (up to 0.05 increase) of distributed entanglement.</description>

      <title>Efficient Laser Frequency Allocation in Packet-Optical Nodes with Coherent Transceivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of silicon chipsets with the capability of processing incoming optical packet traffic, creates a new generation of packet-optical nodes, the whiteboxes. Their inherent functionality of carrying pluggable coherent transceiver modules, extends their scope in the field of transport optical networks. Also, their hybrid nature improves the overall efficiency since higher layer functionality is now performed at wire speed. This is feasible by embedding in the computational logic, apart from the typical packet inspection routines and security features, Machine Learning-based traffic engineering as well. In this work, a topology based on multiple packet-optical nodes residing at the edges (ingress and egress) of a ROADM network, is evaluated according to the average laser frequency configuration time. This is achieved by exploiting telemetry analytics which are collected by the CMIS driver of the pluggable transceivers, for allocating efficient frequency slots to the source and destination of connectivity requests traversing through the ROADM network. This pair of nodes is supervised by the packet SDN controller which is part of the control plane of the optical transport network. This controller receives telemetry feedback from the whiteboxes and uses it to execute efficient ML techniques locally, for finding efficient frequency slots for the incoming transport requests. Next, it applies them to request's edge nodes. The decrease of the average laser configuration time is achieved in the evaluated topology, improving the overall efficiency of the control plane.</description>

      <title>NFV-Enabled Service Recovery in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks: A Matching Game Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve ubiquitous connectivity of the sixth generation communication, the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) is a popular topic. However, the dynamic nodes in SAGIN such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles, may be fragile and out of operation, which can potentially cause service failure. Therefore, the research on service recovery in SAGIN under situations of resource failure is critical. In order to facilitate the flexible resource utilization of SAGIN, the network function virtualization technology (NFV) is proposed to be employed. Firstly, the task management is transformed into the deployment of service function chains (SFCs). Then, we design an NFV-based SFC recovery model in SAGIN in the face of resource failure, so that tasks can quickly select alternative resources to complete deployments. Moreover, the problem of SFC recovery is formulated to minimize the total time consumption for all completed SFCs. Since it is an NP-hard integer linear programming problem, we propose the efficient recovery algorithm based on the matching game. Finally, via various simulations, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its advantages are verified, where the total time consumption is optimized by about 25%, compared with other benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for O-RAN Mobility Management: A Link Prediction Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobility performance has been a key focus in cellular networks up to 5G. To enhance handover (HO) performance, 3GPP introduced Conditional Handover (CHO) and Layer 1/Layer 2 Triggered Mobility (LTM) mechanisms in 5G. While these reactive HO strategies address the trade-off between HO failures (HOF) and ping-pong effects, they often result in inefficient radio resource utilization due to additional HO preparations. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a proactive HO framework for mobility management in O-RAN, leveraging user-cell link predictions to identify the optimal target cell for HO. We explore various categories of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for link prediction and analyze the complexity of applying them to the mobility management domain. Two GNN models are compared using a real-world dataset, with experimental results demonstrating their ability to capture the dynamic and graph-structured nature of cellular networks. Finally, we present key insights from our study and outline future steps to enable the integration of GNN-based link prediction for mobility management in 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Network Digital Twin for 5G-Enabled Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maturity and commercial roll-out of 5G networks and its deployment for private networks makes 5G a key enabler for various vertical industries and applications, including robotics. Providing ultra-low latency, high data rates, and ubiquitous coverage and wireless connectivity, 5G fully unlocks the potential of robot autonomy and boosts emerging robotic applications, particularly in the domain of autonomous mobile robots. Ensuring seamless, efficient, and reliable navigation and operation of robots within a 5G network requires a clear understanding of the expected network quality in the deployment environment. However, obtaining real-time insights into network conditions, particularly in highly dynamic environments, presents a significant and practical challenge. In this paper, we present a novel framework for building a Network Digital Twin (NDT) using real-time data collected by robots. This framework provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring, controlling, and optimizing robotic operations in dynamic network environments. We develop a pipeline integrating robotic data into the NDT, demonstrating its evolution with real-world robotic traces. We evaluate its performances in radio-aware navigation use case, highlighting its potential to enhance energy efficiency and reliability for 5Genabled robotic operations.</description>

      <title>CReIS: Computation Reuse through Image Similarity in ICN-Based Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the edge, there is a high level of similarity in computing. One approach that has been proposed to enhance the efficiency of edge computing is computation reuse, which eliminates redundant computations. Edge computing is integrated with the ICN architecture, capitalizing on its inherent intelligence to facilitate computation reuse and reduce redundancies in computing operations. In many past works, ICN's ability to enable computation reuse through caching has been limited. In this context, a new approach is proposed that considers computation requests with similar input data, which yield identical results, as equivalent. This method facilitates computation reuse through caching in ICN. The use of approximate results to reduce redundant computations without requiring high accuracy in input matching is provided. This concept is termed the Similarity Index, which effectively considers images to be similar despite minor changes in the angle of photography. The Similarity Index is determined through an algorithm known as HNSW and utilizes the SIFT descriptor to identify similar data. This approach helps reduce user latency times by providing quick access to results. The evaluation, simulated using the ndnSIM tool, showed an 86% improvement in completion time compared to scenarios without computation reuse, whereas previous works reported only a 70% improvement. To strengthen this method, an analytical model for computing request transfer considering computation reuse in ICN-based edge computing is provided. To assess the accuracy of the model, several evaluations have been conducted in the simulator by varying the parameters, resulting in a maximum error percentage of approximately 16%.</description>

Abstract: As the field of the quantum internet advances, the necessity for a comprehensive guide to navigate its complexities has become increasingly crucial. Quantum computing, a more established relative, shares foundational principles with the quantum internet; however, distinguishing between the two is essential for further development and deeper understanding. This work systematically introduces the quantum internet by addressing fundamental questions: Why is it important? What are its core components? How does it function? When will it be viable? Who are the key players? What are the challenges and future directions? Through elucidating these aspects along with a comprehensive introduction to the basic concepts, we aim to provide a clear and accessible overview of the quantum internet, facilitating the groundwork for future innovations and research in the field.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization for Repeater Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiently distributing secret keys over long distances remains a critical challenge in the development of quantum networks. "First-generation" quantum repeater chains distribute entanglement by executing protocols composed of probabilistic entanglement generation, swapping and distillation operations. However, finding the protocol that maximizes the secret-key rate is difficult for two reasons. First, calculating the secretkey rate for a given protocol is non-trivial due to experimental imperfections and the probabilistic nature of the operations. Second, the protocol space rapidly grows with the number of nodes, and lacks any clear structure for efficient exploration. To address the first challenge, we build upon the efficient machinery developed by Li et al. [1] and we extend it, enabling numerical calculation of the secret-key rate for heterogeneous repeater chains with an arbitrary number of nodes. For navigating the large, unstructured space of repeater protocols, we implement a Bayesian optimization algorithm, which we find consistently returns the optimal result. Whenever comparisons are feasible, we validate its accuracy against results obtained through brute-force methods. Further, we use our framework to extract insight on how to maximize the efficiency of repeater protocols across varying node configurations and hardware conditions. Our results highlight the effectiveness of Bayesian optimization in exploring the potential of near-term quantum repeater chains.</description>

      <title>PACIFISTA: Conflict Evaluation and Management in Open RAN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The O-RAN ALLIANCE is defining architectures, interfaces, operations, and security requirements for cellular networks based on Open Radio Access Network (RAN) principles. In this context, O-RAN introduced the RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs) to enable dynamic control of cellular networks via data-driven applications referred to as rApps and xApps. RICs enable for the first time truly intelligent and self-organizing cellular networks. However, enabling the execution of many Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms making autonomous control decisions to fulfill diverse (and possibly conflicting) goals poses unprecedented challenges. For instance, the execution of one xApp aiming at maximizing throughput and one aiming at minimizing energy consumption would inevitably result in diametrically opposed resource allocation strategies. Therefore, conflict management becomes a crucial component of any functional intelligent O-RAN system. This article studies the problem of conflict mitigation in O-RAN and proposes PACIFISTA, a framework to detect, characterize, and mitigate conflicts generated by O-RAN applications that control RAN parameters. PACIFISTA leverages a profiling pipeline to tests O-RAN applications in a sandbox environment, and combines hierarchical graphs with statistical models to detect the existence of conflicts and evaluate their severity. Experiments on Colosseum and OpenRAN Gym demonstrate PACIFISTA's ability to predict conflicts and provide valuable information before conflicting xApps are deployed on production. We demonstrate that users can experience a 16% throughput loss even in the case of xApps with similar goals, and that applications with conflicting goals might cause instability and result in up to 30% performance degradation. We also show that PACIFISTA can help operators to identify conflicting applications and maintain performance degradation at bay.</description>

      <title>Less is More: Simplifying Network Traffic Classification Leveraging RFCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of encryption has significantly enhanced privacy and security while posing challenges for network traffic classification. Recent approaches address these challenges by transforming network traffic into text or image formats to leverage deep-learning models originally designed for natural language processing, and computer vision. However, these transformations often contradict network protocol specifications, introduce noisy features, and result in resource-intensive processes. To overcome these limitations, we propose NetMatrix, a minimalistic tabular representation of network traffic that eliminates noisy attributes and focuses on meaningful features leveraging RFCs (Request for Comments) definitions. By combining NetMatrix with a vanilla XGBoost classifier, we implement a lightweight approach, LiM ("Less is More") that achieves classification performance on par with state-of-the-art methods such as ET-BERT and YaTC. Compared to selected baselines, experimental evaluations demonstrate that LiM improves resource consumption by orders of magnitude. Overall, this study underscores the effectiveness of simplicity in traffic representation and machine learning model selection, paving the way towards resource-efficient network traffic classification.</description>
