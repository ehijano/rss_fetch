      <title>A generalized hand-eye calibration dual quaternion matrix equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of robotics research, a crucial applied problem is the hand-eye calibration issue. The corresponding matrix equation $AX=YB$ in hand-eye calibration can be equivalently transformed into the dual quaternion equation $q_Aq_X=q_Yq_B$. However, the dual quaternion equation $q_Aq_X=q_Yq_B$ is merely a specific case of the more general dual quaternion matrix equation $AX-YB=C$, which also holds significant applications in system and control theory. Therefore, we in this paper establish the solvability conditions of the dual quaternion matrix equation $AX-YB=C$ and provide a general expression for its solutions when it is solvable. As an application, we investigate the analytical solutions of the dual quaternion matrix equation $AX=YB$. Finally, we validate the main results of this paper through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Types of Irreducible Divisor Graphs of Noncommutative Domains, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue investigation of the directed and undirected irreducible divisor graph concepts $G(x)$ and $\Gamma (x)$ of $x\in D^{\ast} \backslash U(D)$, respectively, which were introduced in [7]. Consequently, we introduce two generalizations of these concepts. The first one is the irreducible divisor simplicial complex $S(x)$ of $x\in D^{\ast} \backslash U(D)$ in a noncommutative atomic domain $D$, which simultaneously extends the commutative case that was introduced by R. Baeth and J. Hobson in [3]. The second one is the directed and undirected $\tau $-irreducible divisor graphs $G_{\tau }(x)$ and $\Gamma _{\tau }(x)$ of $x\in D^{\ast} \backslash U(D)$, respectively, in a noncommutative $\tau $-atomic domain $D$ with a symmetric and associate preserving relation $\tau $ on $D^{\ast} \backslash U(D)$. Those graphs also extend the commutative case that was introduced by C. P. Mooney in [5]. Furthermore, we extend the results of [3] and [5] to give a characterization of n-unique factorization domains via those two generalizations.</description>

      <title>On the first-order theories of quaternions and octonions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ be the language of rings. We provide an axiomatization of the $L$-theories of quaternions and octonions and we characterize the models of mentioned theories: they coincide, up to isomorphism, to quaternion and octonion algebras over a real closed field, respectively. We prove these theories are complete, model complete and they do not have quantifier elimination. Then, we focus on the class of ordered polynomials. Over $\mathbb{H}$ and $\mathbb{O}$ these polynomials are of special interest in hypercomplex analysis slice they are slice regular. We deduce some fundamental properties of the zero locus of ordered polynomials from completeness and we prove the failure of qantifier elimination for the fragment of ordered formulas as well.</description>

      <title>Dynkin abelianisations of flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cerulli Irelli and Lanini have shown that PBW degenerations of flag varieties in type A and C are actually Schubert varieties of higher rank. We introduce Dynkin cones to parameterise specific abelianisations of classical Lie algebras. Within this framework, we generalise their result to all degenerations of flag varieties defined by degree vectors originating from a Dynkin cone. This framework allows us to determine the extent to which a flag variety can be degenerate while still naturally being a Schubert variety of the same Lie type. Furthermore, we compute the defining relations for the corresponding degenerate simple modules in all classical types.</description>

      <title>Spectrum in alternative topological algebras and a new look at old theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00985v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider real and complex algebras as well as algebras over general fields. In Section 2, we revisit and prove several results on (quadratic) algebras over general fields. In Section 3, we show how to develop the spectral theory in the context of complex (resp. real) one-sided alternative topological algebras. As an application of the existence of spectrum, we prove the existence of nontrivial hyperinvariant linear manifolds for nonscalar (resp. nonquadratic) continuous linear operators acting on complex (resp. real) Fr\'echet spaces. Along the way, spectral theory is used to prove several topological counterparts of the well-known theorems of Frobenius, Hurwitz, Gelfand-Mazur, and Zorn. This is done, for example, in the context of left (resp. right) alternative topological algebras whose duals separate their elements. In Section 4, we consider real and complex algebras in various topological settings and reconsider and prove several results. For instance, it is shown that given a $ 1 &lt; k \in \mathbb{N}$, on any locally complex algebra, there exists a unique nonzero vector space norm, say, $\|.\|$, satisfying the identity $\|a^k\| = \|a\|^k$ on the algebra. In Section 5, among other things, we revisit the celebrated theorems of Frobenius, Zorn, Gelfand-Mazur, and Hurwitz, and give slight extensions of their topological counterparts, e.g., theorems of Albert, Kaplansky, and Urbanik-Wright to name a few, in several settings.</description>

      <title>On matrix invertible extensions over commutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the class E2 (resp. SE2) of commutative rings R with the property that each unimodular 2 x 2 matrix with entries in R extends to an invertible 3 x 3 matrix (resp. invertible 3 x 3 matrix whose (3, 3) entry is 0). Among noetherian domains of dimension 1, polynomial rings over Z or Hermite rings, only EDRs belong to the class. Using this, stable ranges, and units and projective modules interpretations, we reobtain (often refine) criteria due to Kaplansky, McGovern, Roitman, Shchedryk, Wiegand and obtain new criteria for a Hermite ring to be an EDR. For instance, we characterize Hermite rings which are EDRs by (1) means of equations involving unimodular triples and (2) surjectivity of some maps involving units of factor rings by principal ideals. We use these criteria to show that each Bezout ring R that is either a J2,1 domain or an (SU)2 ring (as introduced by Lorenzini) such that for each nonzero a 2 R there exists no nontrivial self-dual projective R/Ra-module of rank 1 generated by 2 elements (e.g., all its elements are squares), is an EDR, thus solving or partially solving problems raised by Lorenzini. Many other classes of rings are introduced and studied. To ease the reading, this version concentrates only on extendability properties of unimodular 2 x 2 matrices and hence does not consider the case n &gt; 2.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal braidings and pre-Cartier bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an infinitesimal counterpart to the notion of braided category. The corresponding infinitesimal braidings are natural transformations which are compatible with an underlying braided monoidal structure in the sense that they constitute a first-order deformation of the braiding. This extends previously considered infinitesimal symmetric or Cartier categories, where involutivity of the braiding and an additional commutativity of the infinitesimal braiding with the symmetry are required. The generalized pre-Cartier framework is then elaborated in detail for the categories of (co)quasitriangular bialgebra (co)modules and we characterize the resulting infinitesimal $\mathcal{R}$-matrices (resp. $\mathcal{R}$-forms) on the bialgebra. It is proven that the latter are Hochschild $2$-cocycles and that they satisfy an infinitesimal quantum Yang-Baxter equation, while they are Hochschild $2$-coboundaries under the Cartier (co)triangular assumption in the presence of an antipode. We provide explicit examples of infinitesimal braidings, particularly on quantum $2\times 2$-matrices, $\mathrm{GL}_q(2)$, Sweedler's Hopf algebra and via Drinfel'd twist deformation. As conceptual tools to produce examples of infinitesimal braidings we prove an infinitesimal version of the FRT construction and we provide a Tannaka-Krein reconstruction theorem for pre-Cartier coquasitriangular bialgebras. We comment on the deformation of infinitesimal braidings and construct a quasitriangular structure on formal power series of Sweedler's Hopf algebra.</description>

Abstract: We define the cluster characters for 2-Calabi-Yau Frobenius extriangulated categories with cluster tilting objects. This provides a unified framework of cluster characters in 2-Calabi-Yau triangulated categories and 2-Calabi-Yau Frobenius exact categories given by Palu and Fu-Keller, respectively</description>

      <title>On algebras of Dirichlet series invariant under permutations of coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr O_u$ be the algebra of holomorphic functions on ${\bf C}_+:=\{s\in{\bf C}:\text{Re }s&gt;0\}$ that are limits of Dirichlet series $D=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n n^{-s}$, $s\in \bf{C}_+$, that converge uniformly on proper half-planes of $\bf{C}_+$. We study algebraic-topological properties of subalgebras of $\mathscr O_u$: the Banach algebras $\mathscr W, \mathscr A, \mathscr H^\infty$ and the Frechet algebra $\mathscr O_b$. Here $\mathscr W$ consists of functions in $\mathscr O_u$ of absolutely convergent Dirichlet series on the closure of $\bf{C}_+$, $\mathscr A$ is the uniform closure of $\mathscr W$, $\mathscr H^\infty$ is the algebra of all bounded functions in $\mathscr O_u$, and $\mathscr O_b$ is set of all $f(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n n^{-s}$ in $\mathscr O_u$ so that $f_r\in \mathscr H^\infty$, $r\in (0,1)$, where $f_r(s):=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n r^{\Omega(n)} n^{-s}$ and $\Omega(n)$ is the number of prime factors of $n$. Let $S_\bf{N}$ be the group of permutations of $\bf{N}$. Each $\sigma\in S_\bf{N}$ determines a permutation $\hat\sigma\in S_\bf{N}$ (i.e., such that $\hat\sigma(mn)=\hat\sigma(n)\hat\sigma(m)$ for all $m,n\in \bf{N}$) via the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. For a Dirichlet series $D=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n n^{-s}$, and $\sigma \in S_\bf{N}$, $S_\sigma(D)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_{\hat{\sigma}^{-1}(n)} n^{-s}$ determines an action of $S_\bf{N}$ on the set of all Dirichlet series. It is shown that each of the algebras above is invariant with respect to this action. Given a subgroup $G$ of $S_\bf{N}$, the set of $G$-invariant subalgebras of these algebras are studied, and their maximal ideal spaces are described, and used to characterise groups of units and of invertible elements having logarithms, find the stable rank, show projective freeness, and describe when the special linear group is generated by elementary matrices, with bounds on the number of factors.</description>
