      <title>Kinetic Scale Energy Budget in Turbulent Plasmas: Role of Electron to Ion Temperature Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dissipation mechanisms in weakly collisional plasmas have been a longstanding topic of investigation, where significant progress has been made in recent years. A recent promising development is the use of the "scale-filtered" Vlasov-Maxwell equations to fully quantify the scale-by-scale energy balance, a feature that was absent when using fluid models in kinetic plasmas. In particular, this method reveals that the energy transfer in kinetic scales is fully accounted for by the scale-filtered pressure-strain interaction. Despite this progress, the influence of ion-electron thermal disequilibrium on the kinetic-scale energy budget remains poorly understood. Using two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of decaying plasma turbulence, we systematically investigate the pressure-strain interaction and its components at sub-ion scales by varying electron-to-ion temperature ratios. Our analysis focuses on three key ingredients of the pressure-strain interaction: the normal and shear components of Pi-D and pressure dilatation. Our results demonstrate that the scale-filtered pressure-strain interaction is dominated by scale-filtered Pi-D across the kinetic range, with the shear component consistently providing the dominant contribution. We find that the scale-filtered normal and shear contributions of Pi-D exhibit persistent anticorrelation and opposite signs across all kinetic scales. We also discover that the amplitude of both anisotropic components for each species scales directly with their temperature and inversely with the temperature of the other species, while the scale-filtered pressure dilatation remains negligible compared to the Pi-D terms but shows enhanced compressibility effects as plasma temperatures decrease. We discuss the implications of these findings in thermally non-equilibrated plasmas, such as in the turbulent magnetosheath and solar wind.</description>

      <title>A Neural Symbolic Model for Space Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we unveil a new AI model, termed PhyE2E, to discover physical formulas through symbolic regression. PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Effects of Parameters in Widespread SEP Events with EPREM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Model (EPREM) solves the focused transport equation (FTE) on a Lagrangian grid in a frame co-moving with the solar wind plasma and simulates the acceleration and transport of solar energetic particles (SEP) in the heliosphere. When not coupled to an external magnetohydrodynamic model, EPREM functions in an uncoupled mode where an ideal cone-shock is injected into a homogeneous background solar wind. We carried out an analysis of the effects of multiple physical parameters in producing widespread SEP events simulated by the uncoupled EPREM using a relatively simple model of a strong magnetized shock propagating radially outward through the inner heliosphere to produce the requisite MHD quantities for EPREM's sophisticated model of proton acceleration and transport. We compared a baseline simulation with seven variations in which the value of a single parameter differed from its baseline value. All simulations exhibit complex profiles of SEP flux as a function of time and energy, with clear dependence on parameters related to diffusion, mean free path, and shock profile. Moreover, while all simulations exhibit significant longitudinal spread in SEP flux, for certain parameter values there exists a decrease or absence in SEP flux at observers located $\geq 90^\circ$ from the shock origin. Relating the differences in SEP flux to the specific values of each parameter in the simulations provides insight into the morphology of observed SEP events and the state of the solar wind through which the driving CME propagates.</description>
