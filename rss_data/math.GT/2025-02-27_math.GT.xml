      <title>Colored Jones Polynomials and the Volume Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the vertex model approach for braid representations, we compute polynomials for spin-1 placed on hyperbolic knots up to 15 crossings. These polynomials are referred to as 3-colored Jones polynomials or adjoint Jones polynomials. Training a subset of the data using a fully connected feedforward neural network, we predict the volume of the knot complement of hyperbolic knots from the adjoint Jones polynomial or its evaluations with 99.34% accuracy. A function of the adjoint Jones polynomial evaluated at the phase $q=e^{ 8 \pi i / 15 }$ predicts the volume with nearly the same accuracy as the neural network. From an analysis of 2-colored and 3-colored Jones polynomials, we conjecture the best phase for $n$-colored Jones polynomials, and use this hypothesis to motivate an improved statement of the volume conjecture. This is tested for knots for which closed form expressions for the $n$-colored Jones polynomial are known, and we show improved convergence to the volume.</description>

      <title>The bracket polynomial of bonded knots and applications to entangles proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model proteins with intramolecular bonds, such as disulfide bridges, using the concept of bonded knots -- closed loops in three-dimensional space equipped with additional bonds that connect different segments of the knot. We extend the Kauffman bracket polynomial (which is closely related to the Jones polynomial) to bonded knots through the introduction of the bonded version of the Kauffman bracket skein module. We show that this module is infinitely generated and torsion-free for both the rigid and topological case of bonded knots, providing an invariant of such structures.</description>

      <title>Some closed hyperbolic 5-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an explicit construction of a family of closed arithmetic hyperbolic 5-manifolds, tessellated by $117 964 800 = 512 \cdot 16 \cdot 14400$ copies of a Coxeter simplicial prism. We proceed to study various properties of these manifolds, such as the volume and the first Betti number. We also describe a related family of 5-manifolds with a larger volume, but a simpler construction.</description>

      <title>On Stein spaces with finite homotopy rank-sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A topological space (not necessarily simply connected) is said to have finite homotopy rank-sum if the sum of the ranks of all higher homotopy groups (from the second homotopy group onward) is finite. In this article, we consider Stein spaces of arbitrary dimension satisfying the above rational homotopy theoretic property, although most of this article focuses on Stein surfaces only. We characterize all Stein surfaces satisfying the finite homotopy rank-sum property. In particular, if such a Stein surface is affine and every element of its fundamental group is finite, it is either simply connected or has a fundamental group of order $2$. A detailed classification of the smooth complex affine surfaces of the non-general type satisfying the finite homotopy rank-sum property is obtained. It turns out that these affine surfaces are Eilenberg--MacLane spaces whenever the fundamental group is infinite.</description>

      <title>Non-smoothable homeomorphisms of $4$-manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the first examples of non-smoothable self-homeomorphisms of smooth $4$-manifolds with boundary that fix the boundary and act trivially on homology. As a corollary, we construct self-diffeomorphisms of $4$-manifolds with boundary that fix the boundary and act trivially on homology but cannot be isotoped to any self-diffeomorphism supported in a collar of the boundary and, in particular, are not isotopic to any generalised Dehn twist.</description>

      <title>Geometry of fully augmented links in doubled 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical fully augmented links have explicit hyperbolic geometry, and have diagrams on the 2-sphere in the 3-sphere. We generalise to construct fully augmented links projected to the reflection surface of any 3-manifold obtained by doubling a compact 3-manifold and show that the results of the classical setting extend to these links. When the resulting manifolds are hyperbolic, we find bounds on their cusp shapes and volumes. Note these links include virtual fully augmented links, and thus our bounds apply to such links when they are hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>The Dehn twist on a connected sum of two homology tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kronheimer-Mrowka shows that the Dehn twist along a $3$-sphere in the neck of two $K3$ surfaces is not smoothly isotopic to the identity. Their result requires that the manifolds are simply connected and the signature of one of them is $16 \mod 32$. We generalize the Pin$(2)$-equivariant family Bauer-Furuta invariant to nonsimply connected manifolds, and construct a refinement of this invariant. We use it to show that, if $X_1,X_2$ are two homology tori such that the determinants $r_1,r_2$ of them are odd, then the Dehn twist along a $3$-sphere in the neck of $X_1\# X_2$ is not smoothly isotopic to the identity.</description>

      <title>Parametric inequalities and Weyl law for the volume spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.11805v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Weyl law for the volume spectrum in a compact Riemannian manifold conjectured by Gromov can be derived from parametric generalizations of two famous inequalities: isoperimetric inequality and coarea inequality. We prove two such generalizations in low dimensions and obtain the Weyl law for 1-cycles in 3-manifolds. We also give a new proof of the Almgren isomorphism theorem.</description>

      <title>On residues and conjugacies for germs of 1-D parabolic diffeomorphisms in finite regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study conjugacy classes of germs of non-flat diffeomorphisms of the real line fixing the origin. Based on the work of Takens and Yoccoz, we establish results that are sharp in terms of differentiability classes and order of tangency to the identity. The core of all of this lies in the invariance of residues under low-regular conjugacies. This may be seen as an extension of the fact (also proved in this article) that the value of the Schwarzian derivative at the origin for germs of $C^3$ parabolic diffeomorphisms is invariant under $C^2$ parabolic conjugacy, though it may vary arbitrarily under parabolic $C^1$ conjugacy.</description>
