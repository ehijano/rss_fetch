      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonian for inhomogeneous free fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement Hamiltonian for the ground state of one-dimensional free fermions in the presence of an inhomogeneous chemical potential. In particular, we consider a lattice with a linear, as well as a continuum system with a quadratic potential. It is shown that, for both models, conformal field theory predicts a Bisognano-Wichmann form for the entangement Hamiltonian of a half-infinite system. Furthermore, despite being nonrelativistic, this result is inherited by our models in the form of operators that commute exactly with the entanglement Hamiltonian. After appropriate rescaling, they also yield an excellent approximation of the entanglement spectra, which becomes asymptotically exact in the bulk of the trapped Fermi gas. For the gradient chain, however, the conformal result is recovered only after taking a proper continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Faithfulness of Real-Space Renormalization Group Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of $b=2$ real-space renormalization group (RSRG) maps like the majority rule and the decimation map was examined by numerically applying RSRG steps to critical $q=2,3,4$ Potts spin configurations. While the majority rule is generally believed to work well, a more thorough investigation of the action of the map has yet to be considered in the literature. When fixing the size of the renormalized lattice $L_g$ and allowing the source configuration size $L_0$ to vary, we observed that the RG flow of the spin and energy correlation under the majority rule map appear to converge to a nontrivial model-dependent curve. We denote this property as "faithfulness", because it implies that some information remains preserved by RSRG maps that fall under this class. Furthermore, we show that $b=2$ weighted majority-like RSRG maps acting on the $q=2$ Potts model can be divided into two categories, maps that behave like decimation and maps that behave like the majority rule.</description>

      <title>Validity of annealed approximation in a high-dimensional system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the suitability of the annealed approximation in high-dimensional systems characterized by dense networks with quenched link disorder, employing models of coupled oscillators. We demonstrate that dynamic equations governing dense-network systems converge to those of the complete-graph version in the thermodynamic limit, where link disorder fluctuations vanish entirely. Consequently, the annealed-network systems, where fluctuations are attenuated, also exhibit the same dynamic behavior in the thermodynamic limit. However, a significant discrepancy arises in the incoherent (disordered) phase wherein the finite-size behavior becomes critical in determining the steady-state pattern. To explicitly elucidate this discrepancy, we focus on identical oscillators subject to competitive attractive and repulsive couplings. In the incoherent phase of dense networks, we observe the manifestation of random irregular states. In contrast, the annealed approximation yields a symmetric (regular) incoherent state where two oppositely coherent clusters of oscillators coexist, accompanied by the vanishing order parameter. Our findings imply that the annealed approximation should be employed with caution even in dense-network systems, particularly in the disordered phase.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Sachdev-Ye Models with Read-Saleur Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an SU(M)-symmetric disordered bipartite spin model with unusual characteristics. Although superficially similar to the Sachdev-Ye model, it has several markedly different properties for M&gt;2. In particular, it has a large non-trivial nullspace whose dimension grows exponentially with system size. The states in this nullspace are frustration-free, and are ground states when the interactions are ferromagnetic. The exponential growth of the nullspace leads to Hilbert-space fragmentation and a violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We demonstrate that the commutant algebra responsible for this fragmentation is a non-trivial subalgebra of the Read-Saleur commutant algebra of certain nearest-neighbour models such as the spin-1 biquadratic spin chain. We also discuss the low-energy behaviour of correlations for the disordered version of this model in the limit of a large number of spins and large M, using techniques similar to those applied to the SY model. We conclude by generalizing the Shiraishi-Mori embedding formalism to non-local models, and apply it to turn some of our nullspace states into quantum many-body scars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lagrangians can differ by a total derivative without altering the equations of motion, thus encoding the same physics. This is in general true both classically and quantum mechanically. We show, however, that in the context of open quantum systems, two Lagrangians that differ by a total derivative can lead to different physical predictions. We then discuss the criterion that allows one to choose between such Lagrangians. Further, starting from the appropriate QED Lagrangian, we derive the master equation for the non-relativistic electron interacting with thermal photons upto second order in the interactions. This case study lends further phenomenological support to our proposed criterion.</description>

      <title>Generalized Spin Helix States as Quantum Many-Body Scars in Partially Integrable Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are highly excited eigenstates of non-integrable Hamiltonians which violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and are embedded in a sea of thermal eigenstates. We provide a general mechanism to construct partially integrable models with arbitrarily large local Hilbert space dimensions, which host exact many-body scars. We introduce designed integrability-breaking terms to several exactly solvable spin chains, whose integrable Hamiltonians are composed of the generators of the Temperley-Lieb algebra. In the non-integrable subspace of these models, we identify a special kind of product states -- the generalized spin helix states as exact quantum many-body scars, which lie in the common null space of the non-Hermitian generators of the Temperley-Lieb algebra and are annihilated by the integrability-breaking terms. Our constructions establish an intriguing connection between integrability and quantum many-body scars, meanwhile provide a systematic understanding of scarred Hamiltonians from the perspective of non-Hermitian projectors.</description>

      <title>Identifying Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder through the electroencephalogram complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are reasons to suggest that a number of mental disorders may be related to alteration in the neural complexity (NC). Thus, quantitative analysis of NC could be helpful in classifying mental conditions and clarifying our understanding about them. Here, we have worked with youths, typical and with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), whose neural complexity was assessed using q-statistics applied to the electroencephalogram (EEG). The EEG was recorded while subjects performed the visual Attention Network Test (ANT) based on the OddBall paradigm and during a shortpretask period of resting state. Time intervals of the EEG amplitudes that passed a threshold (signal regularity indicator) were collected from task and pretask signals from each subject. The data were satisfactorily fitted with a stretched $q$-exponential including a power-law prefactor(characterized by the exponent c), thus determining the best $(c, q)$ for each subject, indicative of their individual complexity. We found larger values of $q$ and $c$ in ADHD subjects as compared with the typical subjects both at task and pretask periods, the task values for both groups being larger than at rest. The $c$ parameter was highly specific in relation to DSM diagnosis for inattention, where well-defined clusters were observed. The parameter values were organized in four well-defined clusters in $(c, q)$-space. As expected, the tasks apparently induced greater complexity in neural functional states with likely greater amount of internal information processing. The results suggest that complexity is higher in ADHD subjects than in typical pairs. The distribution of values in the $(c, q)$-space derived from $q$-statistics seems to be a promising biomarker for ADHD diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Exact Markovian Dynamics in Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems is a challenging frontier of physics. In this work, we systematically construct solvable non-integrable quantum circuits that exhibit exact Markovian subsystem dynamics. This feature thus enables accurately calculating local observables for arbitrary evolution time. Utilizing the influence matrix method, we show that the effect of the time-evolved global system on a finite subsystem can be analytically described by sequential, time-local quantum channels acting on the subsystem boundary. The realization of exact Markovian property is facilitated by a solvable condition on the underlying two-site gates in the quantum circuit. We further present several concrete examples with varying local Hilbert space dimensions to demonstrate our approach.</description>

      <title>Consensus formation in quality-sensitive interdependent agent systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of a collective decision-making model inspired by honeybee behavior. This model integrates individual exploration for option discovery and social interactions for information sharing, while also considering option qualities. Our assessment of the decision process outcome employs standard consensus metrics and investigates its correlation with convergence time, revealing common trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Furthermore, we investigate fluctuations arising from finite-size effects.
  In scenarios with strong interdependence, we identify an absorbing phase transition and scrutinize its key features, including critical fluctuations in finite spatial systems. We find that fluctuations play a significant role in the collective decision-making process, particularly when options have similar qualities.
  Our findings are especially relevant for finite adaptive systems, as they provide insights into navigating decision-making scenarios with similar options more effectively. Finally, we show that this model also fulfills Weber's Law of perception, aligning with previous analyses of collective-decision problems in their adherence to different psychophysical laws.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Resistivity upon Freezing of Vortex Liquid in Clean Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting transition, defined as vanishing of the resistivity, under a magnetic field in a clean bulk type II superconductor with weak sample disorder is believed to be a reflection of freezing of the vortex liquid to a kind of vortex solids. This fundamental issue on superconductivity is examined in detail. Based on the Ginzburg-Landau fluctuation theory for a three-dimensional (3D) system and through a supplementary study in 2D case, we find that the resistivity in the weakly disordered 3D case vanishes in a nearly discontinuous way, reflecting growth of the Bragg peaks on approaching the vortex lattice melting transition. In contrast, such a sharp decrease of the resistivity does not clearly appear in the corresponding 2D case. The consequences of this difference in the vanishing behavior of the resistivity between the 2D and 3D systems are discussed in relation to available experimental facts.</description>

      <title>Symmetry, Superposition and Fragmentation in Classical Spin Liquids: A General Framework and Applications to Square Kagome Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical magnets offer glimpses of quantum-like features like spin liquids and fractionalization, promising an analogous construction of superposition and projective symmetry in classical field theory. While models based on system-specific spin-ice or soft-spin rules exist, a formal theory for general classical magnets remains elusive. Here, we introduce a mutatis mutandis symmetry group construction built from a vector field in a plaquette of classical spins, demonstrating how classical spins superpose in irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetry group. The corresponding probability amplitudes serve as order parameters and local spins as fragmented excitations. The formalism offers a many-body vector field representation of diverse ground states, including spin liquids and fragmented phases described as degenerate ensembles of irreps. We apply the theory specifically to a frustrated square Kagome lattice, where spin-ice or soft spin rules are inapt, to describe spin liquids and fragmented phases, all validated through irreps ensembles and unbiased Monte Carlo simulation. Our work sheds light on previously unknown aspects of spin-liquid phases and fragmentation and broadens their applications to other branches of field theory.</description>

      <title>Frequency-dependent covariance reveals critical spatio-temporal patterns of synchronized activity in the human brain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses combining advanced theoretical techniques and high-quality data from thousands of simultaneously recorded neurons provide strong support for the hypothesis that neural dynamics operate near the edge of instability across regions in the brain. However, these analyses, as well as related studies, often fail to capture the intricate temporal structure of brain activity as they primarily rely on time-integrated measurements across neurons. In this study, we present a novel framework designed to explore signatures of criticality across diverse frequency bands and construct a much more comprehensive description of brain activity. Additionally, we introduce a method for projecting brain activity onto a basis of spatio-temporal patterns, facilitating time-dependent dimensionality reduction. Applying this framework to a magnetoencephalography dataset, we observe significant differences in both criticality signatures and spatio-temporal activity patterns between healthy subjects and individuals with Parkinson's disease.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a statistical physical derivation of thermodynamically consistent fluid mechanical equations is presented for non-isothermal viscous molecular fluids. The coarse-graining process is based on (i) the adiabatic expansion of the one-particle probability density function around Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, (ii) the assumption of decoupled particle positions and momenta, and (iii) the variational principle. It is shown that there exists a class of free energy functionals for which the conventional thermodynamic formalism can be naturally adopted for non-equilibrium scenarios, and describes entropy monotonic fluid flow in isolated systems. Furthermore, the analysis of the general continuum equations revealed the possibility of a non-local transport mode of energy in highly compressible dense fluids.</description>

      <title>Prethermal stability of eigenstates under high frequency Floquet driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systems subject to high-frequency driving exhibit Floquet prethermalization, that is, they heat exponentially slowly on a time scale that is large in the drive frequency, $\tau_{\rm h} \sim \exp(\omega)$. Nonetheless, local observables can decay much faster via energy conserving processes, which are expected to cause a rapid decay in the fidelity of an initial state. Here we show instead that the fidelities of eigenstates of the time-averaged Hamiltonian, $H_0$, display an exponentially long lifetime over a wide range of frequencies -- even as generic initial states decay rapidly. When $H_0$ has quantum scars, or highly excited-eigenstates of low entanglement, this leads to long-lived non-thermal behavior of local observables in certain initial states. We present a two-channel theory describing the fidelity decay time $\tau_{\rm f}$: the interzone channel causes fidelity decay through energy absorption i.e. coupling across Floquet zones, and ties $\tau_{\rm f}$ to the slow heating time scale, while the intrazone channel causes hybridization between states in the same Floquet zone. Our work informs the robustness of experimental approaches for using Floquet engineering to generate interesting many-body Hamiltonians, with and without scars.</description>

      <title>Antipersistent energy current correlations in strong long-ranged Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou type models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study heat transfer in one-dimensional Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou type systems with long-range (LR) interactions. The strength of the LR interaction between two lattice sites decays as a power $\sigma$ of the inverse of their distance. We focus on the strong LR regime ($0\leq \sigma \leq1$) and show that the thermal transport behaviors are remarkably nuanced. Specifically, we observe that the antipersistent (negative) energy current correlation in this regime is intricately dependent on $\sigma$, displaying a nonmonotonic variation. Notably, a significant qualitative change occurs at $\sigma_c=0.5$, where with respect to other $\sigma$ values, the correlation shows a minimum negative value. Furthermore, our findings also demonstrate that within the long-time range considered, these antipersistent correlations will eventually vanish for certain $\sigma &gt;0.5$. The underlying mechanisms behind these intriguing phenomena are related to the crossover of two diverse space-time scaling properties of equilibrium heat correlations and the various scattering processes of phonons and discrete breathers.</description>

Abstract: In statistical physics, one of the standard methods to study second order phase transitions is the renormalization group that usually leads to an expansion around the corresponding fully connected solution. Unfortunately, often in disordered models, some important finite dimensional second-order phase transitions are qualitatively different or absent in the corresponding fully connected model: in such cases the standard expansion fails. Recently, a new method, the $M$-layer one, has been introduced that performs an expansion around a different soluble mean field model: the Bethe lattice one. This new method has been already used to compute the upper critical dimension $D_U$ of different disordered systems such as the Random Field Ising model or the Spin glass model with field. If then one wants to go beyond and construct an expansion around $D_U$ to understand how critical quantities get renormalized, the actual computation of all the numerical factors is needed. This next step has still not been performed, being technically more involved. In this paper we perform this computation for the ferromagnetic Ising model without quenched disorder, in finite dimensions: we show that, at one-loop order inside the $M$-layer approach, we recover the continuum quartic field theory and we are able to identify the coupling constant $g$ and the other parameters of the theory, as a function of macroscopic and microscopic details of the model such as the lattice spacing, the physical lattice dimension and the temperature. This is a fundamental step that will help in applying in the future the same techniques to more complicated systems, for which the standard field theoretical approach is impracticable.</description>

      <title>Classical action for the height within the Kardar-Parizi-Zhang (KPZ) equation for surface growth</title>

Abstract: In this work we write down a classical (not quantum) action for the surface height for the Kardar-Parizi-Zhang (KPZ) equation for surface growth. We dos so starting with the regular Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) action and integrate out the quantum constraint field. We analyze the classical action within the gaussian and one loop approximations and find various instabilities to rough surfaces. The gaussian analysis predicts instabilities to rough surfaces below 2d while one loop predicts stronger surface stability to roughness and instabilities to roughness below 1d rather then 2d. In the supplement we also modify the KPZ equation for growing surfaces to include the effect of surface tilton the noise (that is have multiplicatively coupled noise).</description>

      <title>Effective light cone and digital quantum simulation of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The speed limit of information propagation is one of the most fundamental features in non-equilibrium physics. The region of information propagation by finite-time dynamics is approximately restricted inside the effective light cone that is formulated by the Lieb-Robinson bound. To date, extensive studies have been conducted to identify the shape of effective light cones in most experimentally relevant many-body systems. However, the Lieb-Robinson bound in the interacting boson systems, one of the most ubiquitous quantum systems in nature, has remained a critical open problem for a long time. This study reveals a tight effective light cone to limit the information propagation in interacting bosons, where the shape of the effective light cone depends on the spatial dimension. To achieve it, we prove that the speed for bosons to clump together is finite, which in turn leads to the error guarantee of the boson number truncation at each site. Furthermore, we applied the method to provide a provably efficient algorithm for simulating the interacting boson systems. The results of this study settle the notoriously challenging problem and provide the foundation for elucidating the complexity of many-body boson systems.</description>

      <title>Negative moment of inertia and rotational instability of gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using first-principle numerical simulations of the lattice SU(3) gauge theory, we calculate the isothermal moment of inertia of the rigidly rotating gluon plasma. We find that the moment of inertia unexpectedly takes a negative value below the "supervortical temperature" $T_s = 1.50(10) T_c$, vanishes at $T = T_s$, and becomes a positive quantity at higher temperatures. The negative moment of inertia indicates a thermodynamic instability of rigid rotation. We derive the condition of thermodynamic stability of the vortical plasma and show how it relates to the scale anomaly and the magnetic gluon condensate. The rotational instability of gluon plasma shares a striking similarity with the rotational instabilities of spinning Kerr and Myers-Perry black holes.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Otto Engine Performance in Generalized External Potential on Bose-Einstein Condensation Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine a quantum Otto engine using both Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) and normal Bose gas as working medium trapped in generalized external potential. We treated the engine quasi-statically and endoreversibly. Since the expansion and compression in both quasi-static and endoreversible take place isentropic, the expression of efficiency is similar. However, the power output in the quasi-static cycle is zero due to infinite and long stroke time. In contrast, with an endoreversible cycle, thermalization with two reservoirs takes place at a finite time. We use Fourier's law in conduction to formulate the relation between temperature of medium and reservoir, making work depend on heating and cooling stroke time. Moreover, we maximized the power with respect to compression ratio $\kappa$ to obtain efficiency at maximum power (EMP). We found that EMP is significantly higher when using BEC as a working medium, meanwhile EMP with normal Bose gas is just Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency. We also investigate the effect of thermal contact time $\tau$ with hot $(\tau_{h})$ and cold $(\tau_{l})$ reservoir on EMP. We found that when complete thermalization, $\tau_{h}=\tau_{l}$, stroke time occurs, there are no significant differences. Nevertheless, while incomplete thermalization arise, by adjusting various cooling and heating stroke time, provides a significant result on EMP, which is much higher at $\tau_{h}&lt;\tau_{l}$ stroke time whilst lower at $\tau_{h}&gt;\tau_{l}$ stroke time. We conclude this incomplete thermalization leads to the condition where residual coherence emerges which enhances the EMP of the engine.</description>

      <title>Leading-logarithmic approximation by one-loop renormalization group within Matsubara formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how to devise a Matsubara-formalism-based one-loop approximation to the flow of the functional renormalization group (FRG) that reproduces identically the leading-logarithmic parquet approximation. This construction of a controlled fermionic FRG approximation in a regime not accessible by perturbation theory generalizes a previous study from the real-time zero-temperature formalism to the Matsubara formalism and thus to the de facto standard framework used for condensed-matter FRG studies. Our investigation is based on a simple model for the absorption of x rays in metals. It is a core part of our construction to exploit that in a suitable leading-logarithmic approximation the values of the particle-hole susceptibility on the real- and on the imaginary-frequency axes are identical.</description>

      <title>Origin of Symmetry Breaking in the Grasshopper Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The planar grasshopper problem, originally introduced in (Goulko &amp; Kent 2017 Proc. R. Soc. A 473, 20170494), is a striking example of a model with long-range isotropic interactions whose ground states break rotational symmetry. In this work we analyze and explain the nature of this symmetry breaking with emphasis on the importance of dimensionality. Interestingly, rotational symmetry is recovered in three dimensions for small jumps, which correspond to the non-isotropic cogwheel regime of the two-dimensional problem. We discuss simplified models that reproduce the symmetry properties of the original system in N dimensions. For the full grasshopper model in two dimensions we obtain quantitative predictions for optimal perturbations of the disk. Our analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Topological Data Analysis of Monopoles in $U(1)$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In $4$-dimensional pure compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory, we analyse topological aspects of the dynamics of monopoles across the deconfinement phase transition. We do this using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). We demonstrate that observables constructed from the zeroth and first homology groups of monopole current networks may be used to quantitatively and robustly locate the critical inverse coupling $\beta_{c}$ through finite-size scaling. Our method provides a mathematically robust framework for the characterisation of topological invariants related to monopole currents, putting on firmer ground earlier investigations. Moreover, our approach can be generalised to the study of Abelian monopoles in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>On the choice of non-linear terms in blocking cat states by energy conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] I considered the problem of wavefunction ensembles for spin models. To observe magnetization at finite temperature, I had to add macroscopic nonlinear terms blocking macroscopic superpositions by energy conservation. The nonlinear terms were of the kind introduced in [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] to block spatial cats by energy conservation as solution to the Measurement Problem. Reviewing the theory from [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:1908.02352 (2019)], I derive a commutation relation that these nonlinear terms have to satisfy to be admitted and show that the terms of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:2008.08663 (2020)] restricting the wavefunctions in space satisfies such relations. I generalize the terms of [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] for non-pure spin models and check if they also satisfy the constraints, concluding with a negative answer. An experimental estimate to test the proposal of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] is described at the end.</description>
