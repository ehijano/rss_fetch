      <title>Improving Estimation of Portfolio Risk Using New Statistical Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for new effective risk factors on stock returns is an important research topic in asset pricing. Factor modeling is an active research topic in statistics and econometrics, with many new advances. However, these new methods have not been fully utilized in asset pricing application. In this paper, we adopt the factor models, especially matrix factor models in various forms, to construct new statistical factors that explain the variation of stock returns. Furthermore, we evaluate the contribution of these statistical factors beyond the existing factors available in the asset pricing literature. To demonstrate the power of the new factors, U.S. monthly stock data are analyzed and the partial F test and double selection LASSO method are conducted. The results show that the new statistical factors bring additional information and add explanatory power in asset pricing. Our method opens a new direction for portfolio managers to seek additional risk factors to improve the estimation of portfolio returns.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Potential of Graph Neural Networks in SME Credit Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper takes the graph neural network as the technical framework, integrates the intrinsic connections between enterprise financial indicators, and proposes a model for enterprise credit risk assessment. The main research work includes: Firstly, based on the experience of predecessors, we selected 29 enterprise financial data indicators, abstracted each indicator as a vertex, deeply analyzed the relationships between the indicators, constructed a similarity matrix of indicators, and used the maximum spanning tree algorithm to achieve the graph structure mapping of enterprises; secondly, in the representation learning phase of the mapped graph, a graph neural network model was built to obtain its embedded representation. The feature vector of each node was expanded to 32 dimensions, and three GraphSAGE operations were performed on the graph, with the results pooled using the Pool operation, and the final output of three feature vectors was averaged to obtain the graph's embedded representation; finally, a classifier was constructed using a two-layer fully connected network to complete the prediction task. Experimental results on real enterprise data show that the model proposed in this paper can well complete the multi-level credit level estimation of enterprises. Furthermore, the tree-structured graph mapping deeply portrays the intrinsic connections of various indicator data of the company, and according to the ROC and other evaluation criteria, the model's classification effect is significant and has good "robustness".</description>

      <title>The Elasticity of Quantitative Investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What is the demand elasticity of statistical arbitrageurs that invest according to the advice of modern cross-sectional asset pricing models? Thirteen models from the literature exhibit strikingly inelastic demand, in contrast to classical models that rely on statistical arbitrageurs to create elastic market demand for assets. This inelasticity arises from the difficulty of trading against price changes. A quantitative equilibrium model shows that aggregate demand remains inelastic even with these statistical arbitrageurs in the market.</description>
