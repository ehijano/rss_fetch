      <title>Efficient computation of stationary measures and the Lyapunov Landscape for families random dynamical systems with smooth additive noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient and validated method for approximating the stationary measures of random dynamical systems with smooth additive noise. The approach leverages the strong regularizing properties of the associated transfer operator through a finite-dimensional reduction based on Fourier approximation. Explicit error bounds make the method suitable for use in computer-assisted proofs and rigorous numerical investigations; in particular, its efficiency {\em enables systematic explorations of parameter space}.
  The method provides access to the stationary measure and supports the analysis of key statistical properties of the system. As an application, we study noise-induced phenomena, focusing on the transition from positive to negative Lyapunov exponent (commonly known as Noise Induced Order) in families of random unimodal maps with Gaussian additive noise.
  By analyzing the Lyapunov exponent as a function of the system parameters, we identify transitions along a hypersurface in parameter space. The parameters we consider include the standard deviation (intensity) of the Gaussian noise and the shape of the unimodal map.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of singularly perturbed sliding flow in Filippov systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present an analysis of the effects of singular perturbations on the sliding motion in Filippov systems. We show that singular perturbations may lead to qualitatively distinct topologies of phase space on the switching manifold, which we classify into six distinct topologies. Five of these topologies imply that singularly perturbed trajectory includes a segment (or segments) of sliding, and one topology, which we study here, implies the evolution characterised by switchings between trajectory segments along the switching surface, but without any sliding. In particular, we show that in the case of $n$-dimensional Filippov systems with one switching surface and $m$-dimensional fast dynamics, which plays the role of a stable singular perturbation, the flow follows sliding motion of the reduced system, but the perturbation becomes time dependent and may create a micro chaotic behaviour. However, a significant change in the flow direction is not possible. In the particular case of $1$-dimensional fast dynamics, the singular perturbation implies regular perturbation of $O(\varepsilon)$ of the perturbed flow at the points of switching between vector fields.</description>

      <title>Dichotomies for triangular systems on Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the relationship between the exponential dichotomy properties of a triangular system of linear difference equations and its associated diagonal system on Hilbert spaces. We stress that all previous results in this direction were restricted to the finite-dimensional case. As in the previous work of the first two authors, we rely on the relationship between exponential dichotomies and the so-called admissibility properties. However, this approach requires nontrivial changes when passing from the finite-dimensional to the infinite-dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of specification for the $(\alpha,\beta)$-shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Specification is an important concept in dynamical systems introduced by Bowen. Schmeling proved that the set of $\beta&gt;1$ such that the corresponding $\beta$-shift has specification is of Hausdorff dimension $1$. Hu et al. proved that the set of $\beta&gt;1$ such that the corresponding $(-\beta)$-shift has specification is of Hausdorff dimension $1$. We show that the set of $(\alpha,\beta)\in[0,1)\times(1,\infty)$ such that the corresponding $(\alpha,\beta)$-shift has specification is of Hausdorff dimension $2$. A new difficulty is a simultaneous control of two critical symbol sequences that determine the ambient shift space. We achieve this by taking intersections of two thick Cantor sets in parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify real-analytic $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})$-actions on closed manifolds of dimension m for $3\leq n\leq m\leq2n-3$, which extends Fisher--Melnick's work for $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})$-actions on closed n-manifolds. Additionally, we classify smooth $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})$-actions on closed m-manifolds that are fixed-point free. As a corollary, we obtain the density or non-density of structural stability of fixed-point free $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})$-actions.</description>

      <title>Trichotomy for the HRT Conjecture for mixed integer configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda$ consist of $N-1$ lattice points in $\mathbb{Z}^d \times \mathbb{Z}^d$ together with a single off-lattice point $(\alpha,\beta)$.
  We prove that the finite Gabor system ${M_y T_x f : (x,y) \in \Lambda}$ is linearly independent for every non-zero window $f \in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^d)$. A supposed dependence gives rise, via the Zak transform, to a system of modulus and phase equations driven by the torus translation $z \mapsto z + (-\alpha,\beta)$.
  Classifying the resulting orbits as dense, finite, or infinite-non-dense yields a sharp trichotomy: (i) dense orbits force $f=0$, (ii) finite orbits reduce to Linnell's lattice theorem, and (iii) a new rigidity argument excludes the infinite non-dense case.</description>

      <title>Attitude Motion of Unbalanced Partial-Spin Spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the attitude motion of spacecraft systems featuring asymmetric spacecraft platforms and unbalanced rotors. Through perturbation expansion, the spacecraft dynamic equation is simplified as a linear periodically time-varying (LPTV) system, and analytical solutions of angular velocities are derived. A novel stability criterion is proposed, providing insights into stability transitions and dynamic behavior. Furthermore, the characteristic motions of precession and nutation are analytically investigated, highlighting their dependence on system inertia properties. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the analytical results, showing excellent agreement within defined operational domains and offering error bounds for linearization. The findings advance the understanding of unbalanced partial-spin spacecraft dynamics and provide practical guidance for the design and optimization of such systems.</description>

      <title>Next Generation Equation-Free Multiscale Modelling of Crowd Dynamics via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bridging the microscopic and the macroscopic modelling scales in crowd dynamics constitutes an important, open challenge for systematic numerical analysis, optimization, and control. We propose a combined manifold and machine learning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent crowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The proposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation Equation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and multiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the mass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first step, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete microscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based on manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space into the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the corresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning reduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning techniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the crowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density profiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density distribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this "embed-&gt;learn in latent space-&gt;lift back to the ambient space" pipeline, we create an effective solution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution. For our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a corridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions. The numerical results demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, thus allowing for fast and accurate modelling/simulation of crowd dynamics from agent-based simulations.</description>

      <title>Connectedness of independence attractors of graphs with independence number three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An independent set in a simple graph $G$ is a set of pairwise non-adjacent vertices in $G$. The independence polynomial of $G$, denoted by $I_G$ is defined as $1 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2+\cdots+a_d z^{d}$, where $a_i$ denotes the number of independent sets with cardinality $i$ and $d$ is the cardinality of a largest independent set in $G$. This $d$ is known as the independence number of $G$. Let $G^m$ denote the $m$-times lexicographic product of $G$ with itself. The independence attractor of $G$, denoted by $\mathcal{A}(G)$ is defined as $\mathcal{A}(G) = \lim\limits_{m\rightarrow \infty} \{z: I_{G^m}(z)=0\}$, where the limit is taken with respect to the Hausdorff metric defined on the space of all compact subsets of the plane. This paper investigates the connectedness of the independence attractors of all graphs with independence number three. Let the independence polynomial of $G$ be $1+a_1 z +a_2 z^2 +a_3 z^3$. For $a_1 =3$, $\mathcal{A}(G)$ turns out to be $ \{-1\} \cup \{z: |z+1|=1\} $. For $a_1 &gt;3$, we prove the following.
  If $a_2 ^2 \leq 3 a_1 a_3$, or $3 a_1 a_3 &lt; a_2 ^2 &lt; 4a_3 (a_1 -1)$ then $\mathcal{A}(G)$ is totally disconnected. For $a_2 ^2 =4a_3 (a_1 -1) $, $\mathcal{A}(G)$ is connected when $a_1 =5$ and is disconnected but not totally disconnected for all other values of $a_1$. If $a_2 ^2 &gt; 4a_3 (a_1 -1)$ then $\mathcal{A}(G)$ can be connected, totally disconnected or disconnected but not totally disconnected depending on further conditions involving $a_1, a_2$ and $a_3$. Examples of graphs exhibiting all the possibilities are provided.</description>

      <title>Green\'s Mapping and Julia Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In March 1999, the first named author (Binder) posed the problem of showing that a ``good direction'' $\psi\in [0,2]$ exists, for any Green's mapping $T:H\rightarrow\tilde \Omega$, i.e., \begin{equation}\label{binder}
  \int\limits_0\limits^{1} |T''(re^{i\pi\psi})|dr &lt;\infty, \quad\text{ for at least one }
  \quad \psi\in [0,2]. \end{equation} Presently this problem is open even in the special case where $\partial \Omega $ is a uniformly perfect subset of the real line. In this paper we obtain a positive solution when $\Omega = \overline{C} \setminus E_0$ where $E_0 \subset R $ is the Julia set of an expanding quadratic polynomial.</description>

      <title>Extreme Event Precursor Prediction in Turbulent Dynamical Systems via CNN-Augmented Recurrence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework to predict precursors to extreme events in turbulent dynamical systems. The approach combines phase-space reconstruction techniques with recurrence matrices and convolutional neural networks to identify precursors to extreme events. We evaluate the framework across three distinct testbed systems: a triad turbulent interaction model, a prototype stochastic anisotropic turbulent flow, and the Kolmogorov flow. This method offers three key advantages: (1) a threshold-free classification strategy that eliminates subjective parameter tuning, (2) efficient training using only $\mathcal{O}(100)$ recurrence matrices, and (3) ability to generalize to unseen systems. The results demonstrate robust predictive performance across all test systems: 96\% detection rate for the triad model with a mean lead time of 1.8 time units, 96\% for the anisotropic turbulent flow with a mean lead time of 6.1 time units, and 93\% for the Kolmogorov flow with a mean lead time of 22.7 units.</description>

      <title>Algebraically Observable Physics-Informed Neural Network and its Application to Epidemiological Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is a deep learning framework that integrates the governing equations underlying data into a loss function. In this study, we consider the problem of estimating state variables and parameters in epidemiological models governed by ordinary differential equations using PINNs. In practice, not all trajectory data corresponding to the population described by models can be measured. Learning PINNs to estimate the unmeasured state variables and epidemiological parameters using partial measurements is challenging.
  Accordingly, we introduce the concept of algebraic observability of the state variables. Specifically, we propose augmenting the unmeasured data based on algebraic observability analysis. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments under three scenarios in the context of epidemiological modelling. Specifically, given noisy and partial measurements, the accuracy of unmeasured states and parameter estimation of the proposed method is shown to be higher than that of the conventional methods. The proposed method is also shown to be effective in practical scenarios, such as when the data corresponding to certain variables cannot be reconstructed from the measurements.</description>

      <title>Multitask Learning with Stochastic Interpolants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for learning maps between probability distributions that broadly generalizes the time dynamics of flow and diffusion models. To enable this, we generalize stochastic interpolants by replacing the scalar time variable with vectors, matrices, or linear operators, allowing us to bridge probability distributions across multiple dimensional spaces. This approach enables the construction of versatile generative models capable of fulfilling multiple tasks without task-specific training. Our operator-based interpolants not only provide a unifying theoretical perspective for existing generative models but also extend their capabilities. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the zero-shot efficacy of our method on conditional generation and inpainting, fine-tuning and posterior sampling, and multiscale modeling, suggesting its potential as a generic task-agnostic alternative to specialized models.</description>

      <title>Extended Dynamic Programming Principle and Applications to Time-Inconsistent Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.14274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since Peng (1993) established a local maximum principle for a general stochastic control problem governed by forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs), the corresponding partial differential equation (PDE) characterization has not been developed yet. The main difficulty stems from the potential time inconsistency inherent in this class of control problems. In a dimension-augmented space, we first establish an extended dynamic programming principle (DPP). Consequently, an extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is derived. The existence and uniqueness of a new type of viscosity solution is also investigated for this extended HJB equation. Compared to extant research on the stochastic maximum principle, the present paper is the first normal work on the PDE method for a control system with states evolving in both forward and backward manners. Interestingly, our extended DPP provides an equilibrium solution for general time-inconsistent control problems associated with the traditional mean-variance model, risk-sensitive control and utility optimization for narrow framing investors, among others.</description>

      <title>Linear dynamics of the adjoint of a unilateral weighted shift operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is a sequel to our work in \cite{Das-Mundayadan}. Here, we primarily study the dynamics of the adjoint of a weighted forward shift operator $F_w$ on the analytic function space $\ell^p_{a,b}$ having a normalized Schauder basis of the form $\{(a_n+b_nz)z^n:~n \geq 0\}$. We obtain sufficient conditions for $F_w$ to be continuous, and show, under certain conditions, that the operator $F_w$ is similar to a compact perturbation of a weighted forward shift on $\ell^p(\mathbb{N}_0)$. This also allows us to obtain the essential spectrum of $F_w$. Further, we study when adjoint $F_w^*$ is hypercyclic, mixing, and chaotic, and provide a class of chaotic operators that are compact perturbations of weighted shifts on $\ell^p(\mathbb{N}_0)$. Finally, it is proved that the adjoint of a shift on the dual of $\ell^p_{a,b}$ can have non-trivial periodic vectors, without being even hypercyclic. Also, the zero-one law of orbital limit points fails for $F_w^*$.</description>

      <title>Learning the Simplest Neural ODE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of the ``Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE)'' paper, learning ODEs with deep learning has been applied to system identification, time-series forecasting, and related areas. Exploiting the diffeomorphic nature of ODE solution maps, neural ODEs has also enabled their use in generative modeling. Despite the rich potential to incorporate various kinds of physical information, training Neural ODEs remains challenging in practice. This study demonstrates, through the simplest one-dimensional linear model, why training Neural ODEs is difficult. We then propose a new stabilization method and provide an analytical convergence analysis. The insights and techniques presented here serve as a concise tutorial for researchers beginning work on Neural ODEs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Training of Physics-enhanced Neural ODEs via Direct Collocation and Nonlinear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for training Physics-enhanced Neural ODEs (PeN-ODEs) by expressing the training process as a dynamic optimization problem. The full model, including neural components, is discretized using a high-order implicit Runge-Kutta method with flipped Legendre-Gauss-Radau points, resulting in a large-scale nonlinear program (NLP) efficiently solved by state-of-the-art NLP solvers such as Ipopt. This formulation enables simultaneous optimization of network parameters and state trajectories, addressing key limitations of ODE solver-based training in terms of stability, runtime, and accuracy. Extending on a recent direct collocation-based method for Neural ODEs, we generalize to PeN-ODEs, incorporate physical constraints, and present a custom, parallelized, open-source implementation. Benchmarks on a Quarter Vehicle Model and a Van-der-Pol oscillator demonstrate superior accuracy, speed, generalization with smaller networks compared to other training techniques. We also outline a planned integration into OpenModelica to enable accessible training of Neural DAEs.</description>

      <title>A nonstandard finite difference scheme for an SEIQR epidemiological PDE model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) approach to a reaction-diffusion SEIQR epidemiological model, which captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious disease transmission. Formulated as a system of semilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), the model extends classical compartmental models by incorporating spatial diffusion to account for population movement and spatial heterogeneity. The proposed NSFD discretization is designed to preserve the continuous model's essential qualitative features, such as positivity, boundedness, and stability, which are often compromised by standard finite difference methods. We rigorously analyze the model's well-posedness, construct a structure-preserving NSFD scheme for the PDE system, and study its convergence and local truncation error. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the scheme's effectiveness in preserving biologically consistent dynamics.</description>
