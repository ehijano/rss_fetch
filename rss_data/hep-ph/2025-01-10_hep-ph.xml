      <title>Dark Matter Ultraviolet Freeze-in in General Reheating Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of cosmic reheating, that is, on how the energy stored in the inflaton is transferred to the standard model (SM) thermal bath, is largely unknown. In this work, we show that the phenomenology of the nonbaryonic dark matter (DM) ultraviolet freeze-in production strongly depends on the dynamics of the cosmic-reheating era. Using a general parametrization for the Hubble expansion rate and SM temperature, we thoroughly investigate DM production during reheating, not only recovering earlier findings that focused on specific cases, but also exploring alternative scenarios. Additionally, we derive a generalized framework for DM production via inflaton decays and identify the viable parameter space, while simultaneously addressing constraints from CMB observations. As illustrative examples, we explore gravitational DM production through scatterings of SM particles or inflatons, deriving well-defined parameter regions for these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Bell Nonlocality in $\tau^+ \tau^-$ at the BEPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality are two phenomena that occur only in quantum systems. In both cases, these are correlations between two subsystems that are classically absent. Traditionally, these phenomena have been measured in low-energy photon and electron experiments, but more recently they have also been measured in high-energy particle collider environments. In this work, we propose measuring the entanglement and Bell nonlocality in the $\tau^+\tau^-$ state near and above its kinematic threshold at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPC). We find that in the existing dataset, entanglement is observable if systematic uncertainties are kept to 1%. In the upcoming run between 4.0 and 5.6 GeV, the entanglement is predicted to be measurable with a precision better than 4% and Bell nonlocality can be established at $5\sigma$ as long as systematic uncertainty can be controlled at level of 0.5% - 2.0%, depending on the center-of-mass energy.</description>

      <title>Proposal for simplified template cross-sections extension using $\cal{CP}$ observables in $t\overline{t}H$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) offers a unique opportunity to investigate $\cal{CP}$ violation in the Yukawa coupling between the Higgs boson and the top quark by studying Higgs production in association with top quarks; this is of fundamental importance, seeing that the $\cal{CP}$ properties of the Higgs boson are yet to measure with high precision. To address this, the focus of this work has been an extension of the simplified template cross-section (STXS) framework, devised to be sensitive to $\cal{CP}$ effects. Our study focused on $\cal{CP}$-sensitive observables across multiple Higgs decay channels, comparing their performances. The result indicates that the most efficient extension of the current binning used in the STXS framework, which currently uses the Higgs boson's transverse momentum $p_{T,H}$, requires adding one further split using $\cal{CP}$-sensitive observables. Between these observables, one of the best is the Collins-Soper angle $|\cos\theta^*|$, a variable derived from momenta information of the top quarks. We have investigated the improvement brought by our two-dimensional STXS setup and compared it to the currently employed methodologies, finding an increase in performances at an integrated luminosity of $300$ fb$^{-1}$. Moreover, our results highlight that this advantage seems to be present also at $3000$ fb$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading-order time-like rho electromagnetic form factors in ${k_{\rm T}}$ factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the time-like $\rho$ electromagnetic (EM) form factor in the $k_T$ factorization formalism by including the next-to-leading-order (NLO) corrections of the leading-twist and sub-leading twist contributions. It's observed that the NLO correction to the magnitude of the LO leading-twist form factor is lower than $30\%$ at large invariant mass squared $Q^2 &gt; 30 \text{GeV}^2$. It is found that the $\rho$ meson EM form factor is dominated by twist-3 contribution instead of by twist-2 one because of the end-point enhancement. The theoretical predictions of the moduli of three helicity amplitudes and total cross section are analyzed at $\sqrt{s}=10.58$ GeV, which are consistent with measurements from BABAR Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit correlation and spatial distributions for spin-0 hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-orbit correlation in spin-0 hadrons can be investigated through the kinetic energy-momentum tensor form factor $\tilde F^q(t)$. We observe that the latter is also related to a torque about the radial direction, which we interpret as a chiral stress. If we neglect the quark mass contribution, then $\tilde F^q(t)$ is simply proportional to the electromagnetic form factor for spin-0 hadrons, and the spin-orbit correlation is equal to minus half of the valence quark number. Given the extensive studies on the electromagnetic form factor for spin-0 hadrons such as pions, kaons, and the $\alpha$ particle, we present the spatial distributions of chiral stress and kinetic spin-orbit correlation based on current parametrizations of the pion electromagnetic form factor.</description>

      <title>Hierarchies from deterministic non-locality in theory space Anderson localisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nearest-neighbour or local mass terms in theory space among quantum fields, with their generic disordered values, are known to lead to the localisation of mass eigenstates, analogous to Anderson localisation in a one-dimensional lattice. This mechanism can be used to create an exponential hierarchy in the coupling between two fields by placing them at opposite ends of the lattice chain. Extending this mechanism, we show that when copies of such fields are appropriately attached to the lattice chain, it leads to the emergence of multiple massless modes. These vanishing masses are a direct consequence of the locality of interactions in theory space. The latter may break down in an ordered and deterministic manner through quantum effects if additional interactions exist among the chain fields. Such non-locality can induce small masses for the otherwise massless modes without necessarily delocalising the mass eigenstates. We provide examples of interactions that preserve or even enhance localisation. Applications to flavour hierarchies, neutrino mass, and the $\mu$-problem in supersymmetric theories are discussed.</description>

      <title>Existence of dynamical fluctuation in AMPT generated data for Au+Au collisions at 10 AGeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the intermittency behavior of emitted particles produced in heavy ion collisions has been studied using both modes (default $\&amp;$ string melting) of A Multi Phase Transport (AMPT) model-generated data. We adopted one of the most conventional and successful techniques, the Scaled Factorial Moment (SFM) method, using Monte Carlo (MC) data for 10 AGeV Au+Au collisions in search of intermittency in the model-generated data. Our interest is to search for intermittency behavior of particles that leads to multiplicity fluctuations and that would reveal a phase transition from hadronic matter to QGP. In this article, the intermittency values for both modes of AMPT data are presented. The results obtain some insight into the dynamics of heavy ion collisions and the formation of QGP.</description>

      <title>On the Calculation of Pressure Derivatives in Mean-Field Thermal Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate determination of higher-order pressure derivatives with respect to temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\mu$ is essential for analyzing critical phenomena, transport properties, and phase transitions in strongly interacting matter. However, standard numerical differentiation methods often suffer from large numerical instabilities, especially in more complex mean-field thermal field theories. In this work, we present an approach that systematically derives symbolic expressions for these higher-order derivatives, bypassing the numerical instabilities commonly encountered in conventional methods. Our formalism is based on a Jacobian technique, which ensures that the dependence of internal mean-field parameters is fully incorporated into the final symbolic expressions. We illustrate the effectiveness of this method using the two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model as an example and show that it is particularly advantageous near phase transitions and at low temperatures, where numerical differentiation becomes highly sensitive.</description>

      <title>Automation of Electroweak Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This dissertation addresses a topic that I have worked on over the past decade: the automation of next-to-leading order electroweak corrections in the Standard Model of particle physics. After introducing the basic concepts and techniques of next-to-leading order QCD calculations that underpin the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework, I present a few key features relevant to the automated next-to-leading order electroweak contributions to short-distance cross sections, with an emphasis on the mixed QCD and electroweak coupling expansions. These include the FKS subtraction, the renormalization and electroweak input parameter schemes, and the complex mass scheme for dealing with unstable particles. Issues related to the initial or final photons and leptons are also discussed. Two remaining challenges are highlighted if one wishes to go beyond next-to-leading order computations. Some phenomenological applications at the LHC are given to demonstrate the relevance of electroweak corrections at colliders. Finally, an outlook on future studies concludes the dissertation.</description>

      <title>Nonextensive aspects of gluon distribution and the implications to QCD phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents new insights into gluon transverse momentum distributions through nonextensive statistical mechanics, addressing their implications for QCD phenomenology. The saturation physics and scaling laws present in high energy collision data are investigated as a consequence of gluon distribution modification at high density regime. The analysis explores how these modifications influence observables across different collision systems, such as proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Both high and low $p_T$ regions are successfully described in hadron production.</description>

      <title>New Physics contamination to precision luminosity measurements at future $e^+e^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several key observables of the high-precision physics program at future lepton colliders will critically depend on the knowledge of the absolute machine luminosity. The determination of the luminosity relies on the precise knowledge of some reference process, which is in principle not affected by unknown physics, so that its cross section can be computed within a well-established theory, like the Standard Model. Quantifying the uncertainties induced by possible New Physics effects on such processes is therefore crucial. We present an exploratory investigation of light and heavy New Physics contributions to the small-angle Bhabha process at future $e^+e^-$ colliders and we discuss possible strategies to remove potential uncertainties originating from such contaminations by relying on observables that are independent of the absolute luminosity.</description>

      <title>(3+1)d boundary topological order of (4+1)d fermionic SPT state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate (3+1)d topological orders in fermionic systems with an anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\mathrm{F}}$ symmetry, where its $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathrm{F}}$ subgroup is the fermion parity. Such an anomalous symmetry arises as the discrete subgroup of the chiral U(1) symmetry of $\nu$ copies of Weyl fermions of the same chirality. Guided by the crystalline correspondence principle, we construct (3+1)d symmetry-preserving gapped states on the boundary of a closely related (4+1)d $C_N\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathrm{F}}$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state (with $C_N$ being the $N$-fold rotation), whenever it is possible. In particular, for $\nu=N$, we show that the (3+1)d symmetric gapped state admits a topological $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory description at low energy, and propose that a similar theory saturates the corresponding $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^\mathrm{F}$ anomaly. For $N\nmid \nu$, our construction cannot produce any topological quantum field theory (TQFT) symmetric gapped state; but for $\nu=N/2$, we find a non-TQFT symmetric gapped state via stacking lower-dimensional (2+1)d non-discrete-gauge-theory topological orders inhomogeneously. For other values of $\nu$, no symmetric gapped state is possible within our construction, which is consistent with the theorem by Cordova-Ohmori.</description>

      <title>Dirac-Schwinger Quantization for Emergent Magnetic Monopoles?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Refs.[1-4] Dirac and Schwinger showed the existence of a magnetic monopole required a charge quantization condition which we write following Dirac as $\frac{eg}{4\pi\hbar}=\frac{n}{2},\; n=0,\pm 1,\; \pm 2, \ldots$. Here, $g$ is the magnetic monopole charge and $e$ is the electric charge of the positron. Recently, in Refs. [5,6], it has been shown experimentally that frustrated spin-ice systems exhibit 'emergent' magnetic monopoles. We show that, within the experimental errors, the respective magnetic charges obey the Dirac-Schwinger quantization condition. Possible implications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Lyman Alpha Forest - Halo Cross-Correlations in Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a perturbative effective field theory (EFT) description for anisotropic (redshift-space) correlations between the Lyman alpha forest and a generic biased tracer of matter, which could be represented by quasars, high-redshift galaxies, or dark matter halos. We compute one-loop EFT power spectrum predictions for the combined analysis of the Lyman alpha and biased tracers' data and test them on the publicly available high fidelity Sherwood simulations. We use massive and light dark matter halos at redshift $z=2.8$ as proxies for quasars and high-redshift galaxies, respectively. In both cases, we demonstrate that our EFT model can consistently describe the complete data vector consisting of the Lyman alpha forest auto spectrum, the halo auto spectrum, and the Lyman alpha -- halo cross spectrum. We show that the addition of cross-correlations significantly sharpens constraints on EFT parameters of the Lyman alpha forest and halos. In the combined analysis, our EFT model fits the simulated cross-spectra with a percent level accuracy at $k_{\rm max}= 1~h$Mpc$^{-1}$, which represents a significant improvement over previous analytical models. Thus, our work provides precision theoretical tools for full-shape analyses of Lyman alpha - quasar cross-correlations with ongoing and upcoming spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Many body gravity and the bullet cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many body gravity (MBG) is an alternate theory of gravity, which has been able to explain the galaxy rotation curves, the radial acceleration relation (RAR) and the wide binary stars (WBS). The genesis of MBG is a novel theory, which models systems with thermal gradients, by recasting the variation in the temperature as a variation in the metric. Merging the above concept with Einstein's gravity, leads to the theory of thermal gravity in 5-D space-time-temperature. Thermal gravity when generalized for partially thermalized systems, results in the theory of many body gravity. The bullet cluster is supposed to be a smoking gun evidence for the presence of dark matter. However, this work demonstrates that the MBG theory can explain the weak gravitational lensing effect of the bullet cluster, without the need for yet undiscovered baryonic matter or dark matter.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores ideas and provides a potential roadmap for the development and evaluation of physics-specific large-scale AI models, which we call Large Physics Models (LPMs). These models, based on foundation models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) - trained on broad data - are tailored to address the demands of physics research. LPMs can function independently or as part of an integrated framework. This framework can incorporate specialized tools, including symbolic reasoning modules for mathematical manipulations, frameworks to analyse specific experimental and simulated data, and mechanisms for synthesizing theories and scientific literature. We begin by examining whether the physics community should actively develop and refine dedicated models, rather than relying solely on commercial LLMs. We then outline how LPMs can be realized through interdisciplinary collaboration among experts in physics, computer science, and philosophy of science. To integrate these models effectively, we identify three key pillars: Development, Evaluation, and Philosophical Reflection. Development focuses on constructing models capable of processing physics texts, mathematical formulations, and diverse physical data. Evaluation assesses accuracy and reliability by testing and benchmarking. Finally, Philosophical Reflection encompasses the analysis of broader implications of LLMs in physics, including their potential to generate new scientific understanding and what novel collaboration dynamics might arise in research. Inspired by the organizational structure of experimental collaborations in particle physics, we propose a similarly interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to building and refining Large Physics Models. This roadmap provides specific objectives, defines pathways to achieve them, and identifies challenges that must be addressed to realise physics-specific large scale AI models.</description>

      <title>Probing the Nature of Heavy Neutral Leptons in Direct Searches and Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs) are a popular extension of the Standard Model to explain the lightness of neutrino masses and the matter-antimatter asymmetry through leptogenesis. Future direct searches, such as fixed target setups like DUNE, and neutrinoless double beta decay are both expected to probe the regime of active-sterile neutrino mixing in a standard Seesaw scenario of neutrino mass generation for HNL masses around m_N &lt;~ 1 GeV. Motivated by this, we analyse the complementarity between future direct searches and neutrinoless double beta decay to probe the nature of HNLs, i.e., whether they are Majorana or quasi-Dirac states, and CP-violating phases in the sterile neutrino sector. Following an analytic discussion of the complementarity, we implement a generic fixed target experiment modelling DUNE. We perform a statistical study in how a combined search for HNLs in direct searches and neutrinoless double beta decay, using DUNE and LEGEND-1000 as representative examples, can probe the nature of sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Proposal to use LHC general-purpose detectors in "beam-dump" measurements for long-lived particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for performing a beam-dump-like experiment with the general-purpose detectors (ATLAS and CMS) at the LHC. Collisions of high-energy protons result in jets containing a number of energetic hadrons and electromagnetic objects that are essentially "dumped" to hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters, respectively, and induce the production of secondary hadrons, electrons, and photons in calorimetric showers. We envision a situation where new physics particles are produced by the interactions of these secondary particles inside the calorimeters. For proof of principles, we consider the axion-like particles (ALPs) produced via the Primakoff process in the presence of their interaction with photons at CMS. We argue that the drift tube chambers and the ME0 module of the muon system can serve as detectors to record the photons from the ALP decay, demonstrating that assuming the background level can be controlled as discussed in this work, the resulting sensitivity reach is competitive due to their close proximity to the signal source points. We further show that the LHC does not suffer from a barrier, dubbed beam-dump "ceiling", that typical beam-dump experiments hardly surpass. This gives the LHC great potential to explore a wide range of parameter space. This analysis can be extended to investigate various types of light mediators with couplings to the Standard Model leptons and quarks.</description>

      <title>Vector Space Integration for Dark Matter Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present a highly efficient integration method for scattering calculations, and a ``partial rate matrix'' that encodes the scattering rate as a function of the $SO(3)$ orientation of the detector. This replaces the original multidimensional rate integral with a simple exercise in vector multiplication, speeding up the rate calculation by a factor of around $10^8$. I include a scheme to fully factorize the dark matter particle model, its astrophysical velocity distribution, and the properties of the target material from each other, enabling efficient calculation of the partial rate matrix even in studies comparing large sets of these input functions. This is now the only sensible way to evaluate the dark matter scattering rate in anisotropic detector materials. It is straightforward to generalize this method to other difficult but linear problems.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Harmonic Integration Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new integration method drastically improves the efficiency of the dark matter direct detection calculation. In this work I introduce a complete, orthogonal basis of spherical wavelet-harmonic functions, designed for the new vector space integration method. This factorizes the numeric calculation into a ``vector'' that depends only on the astrophysical velocity distribution; a second vector, depending only on the detector form factor; and a scattering matrix defined on the basis functions, which depends on the details of the dark matter (DM) particle model (e.g.~its mass). For common spin-independent DM--Standard Model interactions, this scattering matrix can be evaluated analytically in the wavelet-harmonic basis. This factorization is particularly helpful for the more complicated analyses that have become necessary in recent years, especially those involving anisotropic detector materials or more realistic models of the local DM velocity distribution. With the new method, analyses studying large numbers of detector orientations and DM particle models can be performed more than 10~million times faster.
  This paper derives several analytic results for the spherical wavelets, including an extrapolation in the space of wavelet coefficients, and a generalization of the vector space method to a much broader class of linear functional integrals. Both results are highly relevant outside the field of DM direct detection.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Implications of $\boldsymbol{\Delta(54)}$ Flavor Symmetry with Triple Inverse Seesaw</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11611v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extension of the $\Delta(54)$ flavor symmetry model by incorporating two Standard Model Higgs fields. We generated the neutrino mass matrices with the Triple Inverse Seesaw mechanism. Our numerical analysis reveals deviations from tribimaximal neutrino mixing resulting in a nonzero reactor angle ($\theta_{13}$). The atmospheric oscillation parameter ($\theta_{23}$) occupies the upper octant. The model predicts Normal Hierarchy (NH) for neutrino masses. The best-fit value is obtained with minimum $\chi^2$ analysis. The prediction of the modified model on CP-violating parameters, effective Majorana mass, and Neutrinoless double beta decay phenomenological investigations are found to be in congruous with the current neutrino oscillation data.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we develop a numerical technique for the optimal estimation of the new physics (NP) couplings applicable to any collider process without any simplifying assumptions. This approach also provides a way to measure the quality of the NP estimates derived using standard $\chi^2$ analysis and can be used to gauge the advantages of various modalities of collider design. We illustrate the techniques and arguments by considering the pair production of heavy charged fermions at an $e^+e^-$ collider.</description>

      <title>Nonthermal Heavy Dark Matter from a First-Order Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonthermal production of heavy dark matter from the dynamics of the background scalar field during a first-order phase transition, predominantly from bubble collisions. In scenarios where bubble walls achieve runaway behavior and get boosted to very high energies, we find that it is possible to produce dark matter with mass several orders of magnitude above the symmetry breaking scale or the highest temperature ever reached by the thermal plasma. We also demonstrate that the existing formalism for calculating particle production from bubble dynamics in a first-order phase transition is not gauge invariant, and can lead to spurious results. While a rigorous and complete resolution of this problem is still lacking, we provide a practical prescription for the computation that avoids unphysical contributions and should provide reliable order-of-magnitude estimates of this effect. Furthermore, we point out the importance of three-body decays of the background field excitations into scalars and gauge bosons, which provide the dominant contributions at energy scales above the scale of symmetry breaking. Using our improved results, we find that scalar, fermion, and vector dark matter are all viable across a large range of mass scales, from O(10) TeV to a few orders of magnitude below the Planck scale, and the corresponding phase transitions can be probed with current and future gravitational wave experiments.</description>

Abstract: Amid the uncertainty regarding the fundamental nature of neutrinos, we adhere to the Dirac description, and construct a model in the framework of $\Delta(27)$ symmetry. The model successfully accounts for the hierarchical patterns of both charged lepton and neutrino masses. The neutrino mass matrix exhibits four texture zeroes, and the associated mixing scheme aligns with the experimental data, notably controlled by a single parameter.</description>

Abstract: We study some phenomenological aspects of Lee-Wick (LW) QED. In particular, we show that LW QED implies charge dequantization and a flavor-dependent LW scale. We study the implications of the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) in LW QED and calculate the modified electric force and potential and use the former to reformulate the WGC in LW QED. We also calculate the photon self-energy and the Uehling potential in LW QED. We show that bounds on milli-charged particles from matter neutrality experiments and from Cavendish-type experiments set stringent limits on the LW scale of fermions and of the photon.</description>

      <title>Electroweak hierarchy from conformal and custodial symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present "Custodial Naturalness" as a new mechanism to explain the separation between the electroweak (EW) scale and the scale of potential ultraviolet completions of the Standard Model (SM). We assume classical scale invariance as well as an extension of the SM scalar sector custodial symmetry to $\mathrm{SO}(6)$. This requires a single new complex scalar field charged under a new $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{X}$ gauge symmetry which partially overlaps with $B-L$. Classical scale invariance and the high-scale scalar sector $\mathrm{SO}(6)$ custodial symmetry are radiatively broken by quantum effects that generate a new intermediate scale by dimensional transmutation. The little hierarchy problem is solved because the Higgs boson arises as an elementary (i.e. non-composite) pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) of the spontaneously broken $\mathrm{SO}(6)$ custodial symmetry. The minimal setting has the same number of parameters as the SM and predicts new physics in the form of a heavy $Z'$ with fixed couplings to the SM and a mass of $m_{Z'}\approx4-100\,\mathrm{TeV}$, as well as a light but close-to invisible dilaton with a mass $m_{h_\Phi}\approx75\,\mathrm{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>$\rho$ meson transverse momentum dependent parton distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the light-front wave functions (LFWFs) of $\rho$ meson are evaluated in the framework of Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model using the proper time regularization scheme. The transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDs) of the $\rho$ meson are derived from the overlap representations of the LFWFs. We investigate the $\bm{k}_{\perp}$-weighted moments and the $x$-dependent average transverse momentum $\langle k_{\perp}^n(x)\rangle_{\alpha}$ of $\rho$ meson TMDs, $\langle k_{\perp}^n(x)\rangle_{\alpha}$ shows the typical transverse momenta of quark TMDs in our model. Our findings indicate that the average transverse momenta of $\langle k_{\perp}(x)\rangle_{\alpha}$ fall within the range of $[0.3, 0.45]$ GeV, while $\langle k_{\perp}^2(x)\rangle_{\alpha}$ are in the region of $[0.15, 0.30]$ GeV$^2$. Our TMDs and parton distribution function (PDFs) exhibit excellent adherence to positive constraints. The investigation of spin densities within the $\rho$ meson in transverse momentum space reveals axially symmetric distributions for quarks and targets polarized in either longitudinal or transverse directions. Conversely, unpolarized symmetric distributions occur when the quark is longitudinally polarized and the target is transversely polarized, while exhibiting dipolar distortions in the opposite scenario. A comparison between TMDs from LFWFs and those from a covariant approach demonstrates that TMDs from LFWFs more effectively satisfy positive constraints than their counterparts from the covariant approach. Furthermore, the $x$-moments of $\rho$ meson PDFs indicate that $\langle x\rangle_{g_L}$ is larger using LFWFs compared to the covariant approach.</description>

      <title>T-Model Higgs Inflation and Metastable Cosmic Strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the formation of metastable cosmic strings (CSs) in the context of a supersymmetric (SUSY) left-right model. The SU(2)R symmetry breaking occurs during a stage of T-model (Higgs) inflation (TI) driven by an SU(2)R triplet superfield which inflates away the produced monopoles. The subsequent breaking of the remaining U(1)R x U(1)B-L symmetry, triggered due to an instability arising in the system of a pair of SU(2)R doublet superfields, leads to the production of CSs. TI is based on a quartic potential, is consistent with data thanks to the adopted hyperbolic Kaehler geometry and may be followed by successful non-thermal leptogenesis. The decay of produced CSs interprets the recent observations from PTA experiments on the stochastic background of gravitational waves with values of the superpotential coupling constants close to 10^-6-10^-8 and symmetry-breaking scales a little lower than the SUSY grand unified theory scale. A solution to the mu problem of the MSSM is also accommodated provided that mu is two to three orders of magnitude lower than the gravitino mass. The issue of the gauge coupling unification is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We present a methodology to streamline implementation of massive-quark radiative contributions in calculations with a variable number of active partons in proton-proton collisions. The methodology introduces \textit{subtraction} and \textit{residual} heavy-quark parton distribution functions (PDFs) to implement calculations in the Aivazis-Collins-Olness-Tung (ACOT) factorization scheme and its simplified realization in various processes up to the next-to-the-next-to-leading order in the QCD coupling strength. Interpolation tables for bottom-quark subtraction and residual distributions for CT18 NLO and NNLO PDF ensembles are provided in the common LHAPDF6 format. A numerical calculation of $Z$-boson production with at least one $b$ jet at the Large Hadron Collider beyond the lowest order in QCD is considered for illustration purposes.</description>

      <title>NLO QCD predictions for $\boldsymbol{t\bar{t}\gamma}$ with realistic photon isolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a complete description of top quark pair production in association with a hard photon in the di-lepton decay channel. The calculation is performed at NLO QCD and includes all resonant and non-resonant Feynman diagrams, interferences, and finite-width effects of the top quarks and $W^\pm/Z$ gauge bosons. We provide the results for the $pp\to e^+\nu_e \,\mu^- \bar{\nu}\, b\bar{b}\,\gamma+X$ process using the fixed-cone, smooth-cone and hybrid-photon isolation criteria. The fixed-cone isolation criterion allows contributions from collinear photon radiation off QCD partons, which requires the inclusion of parton-to-photon fragmention processes. To this end, we include the latter contributions into our computational framework. We quantify the impact of different photon-isolation prescriptions on the integrated and differential cross-section predictions for the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV. Our state-of-the-art NLO QCD results with the fixed-cone criterion allow us to reproduce the photon-isolation prescription employed in ATLAS and CMS. This will help to improve future comparisons with the LHC data.</description>

      <title>Axial-vector and scalar contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results for single axial-vector and scalar meson pole contributions to the hadronic light-by-light scattering (HLbL) part of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment. In the dispersive approach to these quantities (in narrow width approximation) the central inputs are the corresponding space-like electromagnetic transition form factors. We determine these directly using a functional approach to QCD by Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations in the very same setup we used previously to determine pseudo-scalar meson exchange ($\pi$, $\eta$ and $\eta'$) as well as meson ($\pi$ and $K$) box contributions. Particular care is taken to preserve gauge invariance and to comply with short distance constraints in both the form factors and the HLbL tensor. Our result for the contributions from a tower of axial-vector states including short distance constraints is { $a_\mu^{\text{HLbL}}[\text{AV-tower+SDC}] = 24.8 \,(6.1) \times 10^{-11}$}. For the combined contributions from $f_0(980), a_0(980), f_0(1370)$ and $a_0(1450)$ we find $a_\mu^{\text{HLbL}}[\text{scalar}] = -1.6 \,(5) \times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Study of large extra dimension and neutrino decay at P2SO experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore two intriguing new physics scenarios: the theory of Large Extra Dimensions (LED) and the theory of neutrino decay. We analyze the impact of LED on neutrino oscillations in the contexts of P2SO, DUNE, and T2HK, with a particular emphasis on P2SO. In contrast, the effects of neutrino decay are examined exclusively in the context of P2SO. For the LED scenario, we find that combining data from P2SO, DUNE, and T2HK can yield tighter constraints than current bounds, but only if all oscillation parameters are measured with high precision. In the case of neutrino decay, P2SO can achieve slightly better bounds compared to ESSnuSB and MOMENT, although its bounds remain weaker than those provided by DUNE and T2HK. Regarding sensitivities to unresolved oscillation parameters, the existence of LED has a minimal impact on the determination of CP violation, mass ordering and octant. However, neutrino decay can significantly influence the sensitivities related to CP violation and octant in a non-trivial manner.</description>

      <title>Four loop Green's functions involving the $n$ $=$ $2$ moment of the Wilson operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the Green's function for the insertion of the second moment of the twist-$2$ flavour nonsinglet Wilson operator in a quark $2$-point function in all three different single scale external momentum configurations at four loops in the MSbar scheme and the chiral limit. One configuration is where the operator is inserted at zero momentum while the other two are where a non-zero momentum flows out through the operator itself with one external quark momentum nullified. In the latter two configurations mixing of the operator with a total derivative twist-$2$ operator is included for renormalization group consistency. In addition we compute the correlation functions of both gauge invariant operators to four loops in the same scheme.</description>

      <title>Left-right asymmetry calculation comparisons and projected sensitivity to the weak mixing angle in polarized Bhabha scattering at 10.58 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16592v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consideration is being given to upgrading the SuperKEKB electron-positron collider with the introduction of electron-beam polarization. This would enable a unique precision electroweak physics program that opens new ways to search for physics beyond the Standard Model. The upgrade would enable Belle II to make a number of high precision measurements, one of which is the left-right cross-section asymmetry in the $e^+e^-\rightarrow e^+e^-$ Bhabha scattering process. The expected level of precision in such a measurement will require the theoretical values of the asymmetry to be calculated at least to the next-to-leading order (NLO) level, and the implementation of simulation event generators with a similar level of precision. In this study, we compare the calculations of the ReneSANCe Monte Carlo generator with those of an independent NLO calculation to determine the level of agreement in this process. A 2.3% difference between the calculations is found and attributed to some higher-order effects being accounted for in the ReneSANCe generator. Using the published Belle II efficiency for selecting Bhabha events and assuming a 40 ab$^{-1}$ dataset having 70% polarization, the projected uncertainty on the weak mixing angle, sin$^2\theta_W$ , is calculated using ReneSANCe to be $\pm$0.00032 or better. Combining this with left-right asymmetry measurements from muons and taus under the assumption of lepton universality yields a projected overall uncertainty of $\pm$0.00019 on sin$^2\theta_W$ with SuperKEKB upgraded to have polarized electron beams.</description>

      <title>Analysis of anomalous $H\gamma\gamma$ coupling in light-by-light collision at future muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, the process $\gamma\gamma \to \gamma\gamma$ is investigated to establish constraints on anomalous Higgs boson couplings at $H\gamma\gamma$ vertice within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The study is performed for a future muon collider operating at CoM energies of 10 and 30 TeV with integrated luminosities of 10 and 90 ab$^{-1}$, respectively, where the incoming photons are modeled using the Weizs\"acker-Williams approximation. Signal and background events are simulated using MadGraph, with the SMEFT Lagrangian implemented via FeynRules and UFO frameworks. Parton showering is evaluated with PYTHIA 8, and detector effects are accounted for using Delphes. Limits on the Wilson coefficients $\bar{c}_\gamma$ and $\tilde{c}_\gamma$ of the dim-6 operators are reported at the 95% confidence level, demonstrating the potential of a high-energy muon collider to provide precise constraints on these couplings and presenting a significant improvement over experimental and related phenomenological results.</description>

      <title>Tribute to Henry Primakoff: Tests of Chiral Perturbation Theory via Primakoff Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03669v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Henry Primakoff founded a field of study based on the scattering of very high energy particles (pions, kaons, $\gamma$ gamma-rays) from the Coulomb field of an atomic nucleus. Effectively, the Coulomb field acts like a target of $\gamma^*$ virtual photons, with target density proportional to $Z^2$. Primakoff was the first to describe how to determine the $\pi^0$ lifetime by measuring the $\gamma\gamma^*\to\pi^0$ production cross section. For the case that a high energy (190 GeV/c) pion beam is used, Primakoff scattering, viewed in the rest frame of the pion, is effectively low-energy soft scattering of $\approx$ 250 MeV gamma rays from a pion at rest. Together, low-energy soft scattering and high-energy hard scattering studies play crucial complementary roles in testing the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) framework. OBJECTIVES: This article presents a short description of Primakoff's scientific career and personal life. It reviews Primakoff scattering studies of pion polarizability and the chiral anomaly $\gamma \rightarrow \pi \pi \pi$ at CERN COMPASS and the $\pi^0$ lifetime study at Jefferson Laboratory (JLab). A review of Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) is presented. RESULTS: We discuss the good agreement of these studies with 2-flavor (u,d) ChPT predictions. CONCLUSIONS: We discuss why Primakoff studies at CERN AMBER and JLab will be important for validating the theoretical framework of 3-flavor (u, d, s) ChPT. These include the kaon polarizability, $\gamma\to\pi\pi\eta$ and $\gamma\to KK\pi$ chiral anomalies, kaonic hybrid states, and $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ lifetimes. DISCUSSION: By comparing 3-flavor ChPT predictions with data for kaons, $\pi^0$ and $\eta$, it will be possible to assess how well the model captures the interplay of the additional flavor and the effects of strange quarks.</description>

      <title>Detecting the Coupling of Axion Dark Matter to Neutron Spins at Spallation Sources via Rabi Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel detection method for axion dark matter using the Rabi oscillation of neutron spins in beam-based measurements. If axions couple to neutron spins, a background oscillating axion dark matter field would drive transitions between spin-up and spin-down neutron states in a magnetic field when the axion particle energy matches the energy gap between the spin states. The transition can be detected in a double-Stern-Gerlach-type apparatus, with the first splitter producing a pure spin-polarized neutron beam and the second splitter selecting spin-flipped signals. Our approach offers enhanced detection capability for axions within the $10^{-12} - 10^{-10} \,$eV mass window with the capability to surpass the sensitivity of current laboratory experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of neutrino-nucleus scattering processes is important for the new generation neutrino experiments for better understanding of the neutrino oscillation phenomenon. A significant source of uncertainty in the cross-section comes from limitations in our knowledge of nucleon and nuclear effects in the scattering process. Here we present a fully analytic implementation of the Correlated Fermi Gas nuclear model for the quasi-elastic lepton nucleus scattering. The implementation is then used to separately compare form factor effects and nuclear model effects, specifically the Relativistic Fermi Gas nuclear model, for both electron-carbon and neutrino-carbon scattering data.</description>

Abstract: The gauge covariance of the quark gap equation is compared for three quark-gluon vertices: the bare vertex, a Ball-Chiu like vertex constrained by the corresponding Slavnov-Taylor identity, and a full vertex including the transverse components derived from transverse Slavnov-Taylor identities. The covariance properties are verified with the chiral quark condensate and the pion decay constant in the chiral limit.</description>

      <title>Isospin strikes back</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming isospin conservation, the decay of a $c\bar c$ vector meson into the $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ final state is purely electromagnetic. At the leading order, the $c\bar c$ vector meson first converts into a virtual photon that, then produces the $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ final state. Moreover, such a mechanism, i.e., the virtual photon coupling to $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$, is the solely intermediate process through which, in Born approximation, the reaction $e^+e^-\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ does proceed. It follows that any significant difference between the amplitudes of the processes $c\bar c\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ and $e^+e^-\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ at the $c\bar c$ mass must be ascribed to an isospin-violating contribution in the $c\bar c$ decay. In Eur. Phys. J. C $\boldsymbol{80}$, 903 (2020) we studied the decay of the $\psi(2S)$ vector meson into $\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.}$ and, on the light of the large branching fraction ${\rm BR}_{18}(\psi(2S)\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.})=(1.23\pm0.24)\times 10^{-5}$, published in the 2018 edition of the Review of Particle Physics Phys. Rev. D $\boldsymbol{98}$, 030001 (2018), we claimed either the presence of a significant isospin-violating contribution or, with a lesser emphasis, a "not complete reliability of the only available datum". In any case, we propose a new measurement. Apparently, our second and considered less serious hypothesis was the right one, indeed the branching fraction published in the 2024 edition of the Review of Particle Physics Phys. Rev. D $\boldsymbol{110}$, 030001 (2024) is $ {\rm BR}(\psi(2S)\to\Lambda\bar\Sigma^0+\mathrm{c.c.})=(1.6\pm0.7)\times 10^{-6}$, more than seven times lower with the error that increased from $\sim 20\%$ to $\sim 45\%$.</description>

      <title>Superradiant growth anomaly magnification in evolution of vector bosonic condensates bounded by a Kerr black hole with near-horizon reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight vector particles can form evolving condensates around a Kerr black hole (BH) due to superradiant instability. We study the effect of near-horizon reflection on the evolution of this system: by matching three pieces of asymptotic expansions of the Proca equation in Kerr metric and considering the leading order in the electric mode, we present explicit analytical expressions for the corrected spectrum and the superradiant instability rates. Particularly, in high-spin BH cases, we identify an anomalous situation where the superadiance rate is temporarily increased by the reflection parameter $\mathcal{R}$, which also occurs in the scalar scenario, but is largely magnified in vector condensates due to a faster growth rate in dominant mode. We point out the condition for the growth anomaly in the adiabatic case is that information carried per particle exceeds a certain value $\delta I/\delta N&gt;2\pi k_\text{B} \sqrt{(1+\mathcal{R})/(1-\mathcal{R})}$. We further construct several featured quantities to illustrate it, and formalize the anomaly-induced gravitational wave strain deformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze Planck scale induced modifications of the relativistic time dilation using data from the Muon Storage Ring experiment at CERN. By examining the lifetimes of muons, we establish, for the first time, a constraint on such quantum gravity-inspired deformations using this channel. The magnitude of the effect indicates that the study of cosmic rays is a well suited arena for this scenario. We show, that the spectrum of muons would be significantly affected for particles at the PeV scale. Since this later observation of the effect of time dilation is more indirect compared to a direct lifetime measurement, we encourage to perform a high precision measurement of the muon lifetime as a function of the muons energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of stationary axisymmetric solutions of Einstein's equations for isolated differentially rotating matter sources is presented. The low-energy asymptotic regime is extracted, requiring a self-consistent coupling of quasilocal energy and angular momentum. The Raychaudhuri equation reduces to a balance equation, with two important limits. These limits can be interpreted empirically for rotationally supported configurations such as galaxies. The net energy including quasilocal kinetic contributions vanishes on the inner vortex surface, and the outer rotosurface. These new geometrical objects potentially shed light on virialization. Whether or not abundant collisionless dark matter exists, the new solutions very strongly support previous suggestions that the phenomenology of galactic rotation curves be fundamentally reconsidered, for consistency with general relativity.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves in Sneutrino Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15082v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition in a supersymmetric scenario where sneutrino is the inflaton in a hybrid inflationary framework. We obtain a spectral index ($n_s \simeq 0.966$), and a tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r\simeq 0.0056-10^{-11}$), consistent with the current Planck data satisfying PBH as dark matter (DM) and detectable Gravitational Wave (GW) signal. Our findings show that the mass of PBH and the peak in the GW spectrum is correlated with the right-handed (s)neutrino mass. We identify parameter space where PBHs can be the entire DM candidate of the universe (with mass $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$) or a fraction of it. This can be tested in future observatories, for example, with amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2$ $\sim 10^{-9}$ and peak frequency $f\sim 0.1$ Hz in LISA and $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2 \sim 10^{-11}$ and peak frequency of $\sim 10$ Hz in ET via second-order GW signals. We study two models of sneutrino inflation: Model$-1$ involves canonical sneutrino kinetic term which predicts the sub-Planckian mass parameter $M$, while the coupling between a gauge singlet and the waterfall field, $\beta$, needs to be quite large whereas, for the model$-2$ involving $\alpha-$attractor canonical sneutrino kinetic term, $\beta$ can take a natural value. Estimating explicitly, we show that both models have mild fine-tuning. We also derive an analytical expression for the power spectrum in terms of the microphysics parameters of the model like (s)neutrino mass, etc. that fits well with the numerical results. The typical reheat temperature for both the models is around $10^{7}-10^{8}$~GeV suitable for non-thermal leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Quasilocal Newtonian limit of general relativity and galactic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new Newtonian limit of general relativity is established for stationary axisymmetric gravitationally bound differentially rotating matter distributions with internal pressure. The self-consistent coupling of quasilocal gravitational energy and angular momentum leads to a modified Poisson equation. The coupled equations of motion of the effective fluid elements are also modified, with quasilocal angular momentum and frame-dragging leading to novel dynamics. The solutions of the full system reproduce the phenonomenology of collisionless dark matter for disc galaxies. The demonstration that general relativity possesses a new alternative low-energy limit different from the conventional post-Newtonian limit may have major consequences for all gravitational physics on galactic and cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Matching current observational constraints with nonminimally coupled dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a Universe with a nonminimally coupled scalar field can fit current measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe better than the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model or other minimally coupled dark energy models. In particular, the nonminimal coupling in this model allows for the dark energy model to exhibit stable phantom crossing behavior, which seems to be suggested by the constraints on the dark energy equation of state coming from the most recent data. While we find a clear improvement in the goodness of fit for this dark energy model with respect to others that have been considered in the recent literature, using information theoretic criteria, we show that the evidence for it is still inconclusive.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics in the Carrollian regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Carroll hydrodynamics arises in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics. Instances of its relevance include the Bjorken and Gubser flow models of heavy-ion collisions, where the ultrarelativistic nature of the flow makes the physics effectively Carrollian. In this paper, we explore the structure of hydrodynamics in what can be termed as the Carrollian regime, where instead of keeping only the leading terms in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics, we perform a small-$c$ expansion and retain the subleading terms as well. We do so both for perfect fluids as well as viscous fluids incorporating first order derivative corrections. As apposite applications of the formalism, we utilize the subleading terms to compute modifications to the Bjorken and Gubser flow equations which bring in, in particular, dependence on rapidity.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Driven by the Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we confront the bound on an ultraviolet cutoff (UV) of a quantum field theory (QFT) proposed by Cohen, Kaplan, and Nelson (CKN) with the latest results of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The former relates the UV cutoff with an infrared (IR) cutoff of the theory by excluding all states describing a black hole. Identifying now the IR cutoff with the Hubble horizon yields a time-varying contribution of the vacuum energy to the dark energy density of the universe. At the same time the DESI results in combination with other cosmological data point towards a preference of time-varying dark energy models over $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of finite-volume effect on hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to muon g-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-energy spectrum relevant to the lattice calculation of hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to muon anomalous magnetic moment a_\mu is dominantly given by two-pion states satisfying L\"uscher's finite-volume quantization condition. Finite-volume effects from those states may exhibit power-law dependence on the volume, contrary to an exponential suppression as suggested by chiral effective theory. Employing the finite-volume state decomposition of Euclidean correlators, we systematically investigate the volume dependence. Phenomenological inputs are used for \pi\pi phase shift and time-like pion form factor. Our estimate for the finite-volume effects on a_\mu is larger than previous works and has a different volume scaling. Numerical results are given for the ``window'' observables of a_\mu.</description>

      <title>Scattering of wave dark matter by supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent simulations of wave dark matter around black hole binaries revealed the formation of a universal density profile that co-rotates with the binary. We derive this profile from first principles, interpreting it as the steady state of a scattering process. We find that the scattering becomes particularly efficient when the ratio of the binary separation to the dark matter's de Broglie wavelength assumes certain discrete values, which can be interpreted as bound state resonances. After estimating the amount of dark matter that undergoes this type of scattering off supermassive black hole binaries at galactic centers, we demonstrate that the process can induce an observable modification of the slope of the Pulsar Timing Array spectrum. This opens up a new possibility to gain insights on the nature of dark matter from observations of low-frequency gravitational waves.</description>
