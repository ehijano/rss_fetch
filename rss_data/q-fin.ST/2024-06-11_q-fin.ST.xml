      <title>The Theory of Intrinsic Time: A Primer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of time mostly plays a subordinate role in finance and economics. The assumption is that time flows continuously and that time series data should be analyzed at regular, equidistant intervals. Nonetheless, already nearly 60 years ago, the concept of an event-based measure of time was first introduced. This paper expands on this theme by discussing the paradigm of intrinsic time, its origins, history, and modern applications. Departing from traditional, continuous measures of time, intrinsic time proposes an event-based, algorithmic framework that captures the dynamic and fluctuating nature of real-world phenomena more accurately. Unsuspected implications arise in general for complex systems and specifically for financial markets. For instance, novel structures and regularities are revealed, otherwise obscured by any analysis utilizing equidistant time intervals. Of particular interest is the emergence of a multiplicity of scaling laws, a hallmark signature of an underlying organizational principle in complex systems. Moreover, a central insight from this novel paradigm is the realization that universal time does not exist; instead, time is observer-dependent, shaped by the intrinsic activity unfolding within complex systems. This research opens up new avenues for economic modeling and forecasting, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the invisible forces that guide the evolution and emergence of market dynamics and financial systems. An exciting and rich landscape of possibilities emerges within the paradigm of intrinsic time.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic models and statistics for electronic financial markets in the digital age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07388</link>

Abstract: The scope of this manuscript is to review some recent developments in statistics for discretely observed semimartingales which are motivated by applications for financial markets. Our journey through this area stops to take closer looks at a few selected topics discussing recent literature. We moreover highlight and explain the important role played by some classical concepts of probability and statistics. We focus on three main aspects: Testing for jumps; rough fractional stochastic volatility; and limit order microstructure noise. We review jump tests based on extreme value theory and complement the literature proposing new statistical methods. They are based on asymptotic theory of order statistics and the R\'{e}nyi representation. The second stage of our journey visits a recent strand of research showing that volatility is rough. We further investigate this and establish a minimax lower bound exploring frontiers to what extent the regularity of latent volatility can be recovered in a more general framework. Finally, we discuss a stochastic boundary model with one-sided microstructure noise for high-frequency limit order prices and its probabilistic and statistical foundation.</description>
