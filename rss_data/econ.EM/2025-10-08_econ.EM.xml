      <title>Estimating Treatment Effects Under Bounded Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers often use specifications that correctly estimate the average treatment effect under the assumption of constant effects. When treatment effects are heterogeneous, however, such specifications generally fail to recover this average effect. Augmenting these specifications with interaction terms between demeaned covariates and treatment eliminates this bias, but often leads to imprecise estimates and becomes infeasible under limited overlap. We propose a generalized ridge regression estimator, $\texttt{regulaTE}$, that penalizes the coefficients on the interaction terms to achieve an optimal trade-off between worst-case bias and variance in estimating the average effect under limited treatment effect heterogeneity. Building on this estimator, we construct confidence intervals that remain valid under limited overlap and can also be used to assess sensitivity to violations of the constant effects assumption. We illustrate the method in empirical applications under unconfoundedness and staggered adoption, providing a practical approach to inference under limited overlap.</description>

      <title>Correcting sample selection bias with categorical outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for correcting sample selection bias when the outcome of interest is categorical, such as occupational choice, health status, or field of study. Classical approaches to sample selection rely on strong parametric distributional assumptions, which may be restrictive in practice. While the recent framework of Chernozhukov et al. (2023) offers a nonparametric identification using a local Gaussian representation (LGR) that holds for any bivariate joint distributions. This makes this approach limited to ordered discrete outcomes. We therefore extend it by developing a local representation that applies to joint probabilities, thereby eliminating the need to impose an artificial ordering on categories. Our representation decomposes each joint probability into marginal probabilities and a category-specific association parameter that captures how selection differentially affects each outcome. Under exclusion restrictions analogous to those in the LGR model, we establish nonparametric point identification of the latent categorical distribution. Building on this identification result, we introduce a semiparametric multinomial logit model with sample selection, propose a computationally tractable two-step estimator, and derive its asymptotic properties. This framework significantly broadens the set of tools available for analyzing selection in categorical and other discrete outcomes, offering substantial relevance for empirical work across economics, health sciences, and social sciences.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Effects of Monetary Shocks on Macroeconomic Stars: A SMUC-IV Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a structural multivariate unobserved components model with external instrument (SMUC-IV) to investigate the effects of monetary policy shocks on key U.S. macroeconomic "stars"-namely, the level of potential output, the growth rate of potential output, trend inflation, and the neutral interest rate. A key feature of our approach is the use of an external instrument to identify monetary policy shocks within the multivariate unob- served components modeling framework. We develop an MCMC estimation method to facilitate posterior inference within our proposed SMUC-IV frame- work. In addition, we propose an marginal likelihood estimator to enable model comparison across alternative specifications. Our empirical analysis shows that contractionary monetary policy shocks have significant negative effects on the macroeconomic stars, highlighting the nonzero long-run effects of transitory monetary policy shocks.</description>

      <title>Robust Inference for Convex Pairwise Difference Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops distribution theory and bootstrap-based inference methods for a broad class of convex pairwise difference estimators. These estimators minimize a kernel-weighted convex-in-parameter function over observation pairs that are similar in terms of certain covariates, where the similarity is governed by a localization (bandwidth) parameter. While classical results establish asymptotic normality under restrictive bandwidth conditions, we show that valid Gaussian and bootstrap-based inference remains possible under substantially weaker assumptions. First, we extend the theory of small bandwidth asymptotics to convex pairwise estimation settings, deriving robust Gaussian approximations even when a smaller than standard bandwidth is used. Second, we employ a debiasing procedure based on generalized jackknifing to enable inference with larger bandwidths, while preserving convexity of the objective function. Third, we construct a novel bootstrap method that adjusts for bandwidth-induced variance distortions, yielding valid inference across a wide range of bandwidth choices. Our proposed inference method enjoys demonstrable more robustness, while retaining the practical appeal of convex pairwise difference estimators.</description>

      <title>Can language models boost the power of randomized experiments without statistical bias?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomized experiments or randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are gold standards for causal inference, yet cost and sample-size constraints limit power. Meanwhile, modern RCTs routinely collect rich, unstructured data that are highly prognostic of outcomes but rarely used in causal analyses. We introduce CALM (Causal Analysis leveraging Language Models), a statistical framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) predictions with established causal estimators to increase precision while preserving statistical validity. CALM treats LLM outputs as auxiliary prognostic information and corrects their potential bias via a heterogeneous calibration step that residualizes and optimally reweights predictions. We prove that CALM remains consistent even when LLM predictions are biased and achieves efficiency gains over augmented inverse probability weighting estimators for various causal effects. In particular, CALM develops a few-shot variant that aggregates predictions across randomly sampled demonstration sets. The resulting U-statistic-like predictor restores i.i.d. structure and also mitigates prompt-selection variability. Empirically, in simulations calibrated to a mobile-app depression RCT, CALM delivers lower variance relative to other benchmarking methods, is effective in zero- and few-shot settings, and remains stable across prompt designs. By principled use of LLMs to harness unstructured data and external knowledge learned during pretraining, CALM provides a practical path to more precise causal analyses in RCTs.</description>

      <title>Shrinkage Methods for Treatment Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17063v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the problem of determining whether to treat individuals based on observed covariates. The most common decision rule is the conditional empirical success (CES) rule proposed by Manski (2004), which assigns individuals to treatments that yield the best experimental outcomes conditional on the observed covariates. Conversely, using shrinkage estimators, which shrink unbiased but noisy preliminary estimates toward the average of these estimates, is a common approach in statistical estimation problems because it is well-known that shrinkage estimators may have smaller mean squared errors than unshrunk estimators. Inspired by this idea, we propose a computationally tractable shrinkage rule that selects the shrinkage factor by minimizing an upper bound of the maximum regret. Then, we compare the maximum regret of the proposed shrinkage rule with those of the CES and pooling rules when the space of conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) is correctly specified or misspecified. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the shrinkage rule performs well in many cases and these findings are further supported by numerical experiments. Specifically, we show that the maximum regret of the shrinkage rule can be strictly smaller than those of the CES and pooling rules in certain cases when the space of CATEs is correctly specified. In addition, we find that the shrinkage rule is robust against misspecification of the space of CATEs. Finally, we apply our method to experimental data from the National Job Training Partnership Act Study.</description>

      <title>The Identification Power of Combining Experimental and Observational Data for Distributional Treatment Effect Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the identification power gained by combining experimental data, in which treatment is randomized, with observational data, in which treatment is self-selected, for distributional treatment effect (DTE) parameters. While experimental data identify average treatment effects, many DTE parameters, such as the distribution of individual treatment effects, are only partially identified. We examine whether and how combining these two data sources tightens the identified set for such parameters. For broad classes of DTE parameters, we derive nonparametric sharp bounds under the combined data and clarify the mechanism through which data combination improves identification relative to using experimental data alone. Our analysis highlights that self-selection in observational data is a key source of identification power. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which the combined data shrink the identified set, showing that such shrinkage generally occurs unless selection-on-observables holds in the observational data. We also propose a linear programming approach to compute sharp bounds that can incorporate additional structural restrictions, such as positive dependence between potential outcomes and the generalized Roy model. An empirical application using data on negative campaign advertisements in the 2008 U.S. presidential election illustrates the practical relevance of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>FARS: Factor Augmented Regression Scenarios in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of macroeconomic/financial time series, the FARS package provides a comprehensive framework in R for the construction of conditional densities of the variable of interest based on the factor-augmented quantile regressions (FA-QRs) methodology, with the factors extracted from multi-level dynamic factor models (ML-DFMs) with potential overlapping group-specific factors. Furthermore, the package also allows the construction of measures of risk as well as modeling and designing economic scenarios based on the conditional densities. In particular, the package enables users to: (i) extract global and group-specific factors using a flexible multi-level factor structure; (ii) compute asymptotically valid confidence regions for the estimated factors, accounting for uncertainty in the factor loadings; (iii) obtain estimates of the parameters of the FA-QRs together with their standard deviations; (iv) recover full predictive conditional densities from estimated quantiles; (v) obtain risk measures based on extreme quantiles of the conditional densities; and (vi) estimate the conditional density and the corresponding extreme quantiles when the factors are stressed.</description>
