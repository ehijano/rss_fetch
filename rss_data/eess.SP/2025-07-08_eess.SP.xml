      <title>Iterative Sparse Asymptotic Minimum Variance Based Channel Estimation in Fluid Antenna System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With fluid antenna system (FAS) gradually establishing itself as a possible enabling technology for next generation wireless communications, channel estimation for FAS has become a pressing issue. Existing methodologies however face limitations in noise suppression. To overcome this, in this paper, we propose a maximum likelihood (ML)-based channel estimation approach tailored for FAS systems, designed to mitigate noise interference and enhance estimation accuracy. By capitalizing on the inherent sparsity of wireless channels, we integrate an ML-based iterative tomographic algorithm to systematically reduce noise perturbations during the channel estimation process. Furthermore, the proposed approach leverages spatial correlation within the FAS channel to optimize estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency. Simulation results confirm the efficacy of the proposed method, demonstrating superior channel estimation accuracy and robustness compared to existing benchmark techniques.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Linear Detection under Noise-Dependent Fast-Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a performance analysis framework for linear detection in fast-fading channels with possibly correlated channel and noise. The framework is both accurate and adaptable, making it well-suited for analyzing a wide range of channel and noise models. As such, it serves as a valuable tool for the design and evaluation of detection algorithms in next-generation wireless communication systems. By characterizing the distribution of the effective noise after zero-forcing filtering, we derive a semi-analytical and asymptotic expression for the symbol error rate under Rayleigh fading and channel-dependent additive circular complex Gaussian noise. The proposed approach demonstrates excellent agreement with integration-based benchmarks as confirmed by numerical simulations thus validating its accuracy. The framework is flexible and can be extended to various channel and noise models, offering a valuable tool for the design and analysis of detection algorithms in next-generation communication systems.</description>

      <title>A Differential Evolution Algorithm with Neighbor-hood Mutation for DOA Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Multiple Signal Classification algorithm is a powerful technique for high-resolution direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in array signal processing. However, the exhaustive search over the 2D an-gular domain leads to high computa-tional cost, limiting its applicability in real-time scenarios. In this work, we reformulate the peak-finding process as a multimodal optimization prob-lem, and propose a Differential Evolu-tion algorithm with Neighborhood Mutation (DE-NM) to efficiently lo-cate multiple spectral peaks without requiring dense grid sampling. Simu-lation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable estimation accuracy to the traditional grid search, while significantly reduc-ing computation time. This strategy presents a promising solution for real-time, high-resolution DOA estimation in practical applications. The imple-mentation code is available at https://github.com/zzb-nice/DOA_multimodel_optimize.</description>

      <title>RIS-Enabled Transmitter Design for Joint Radar and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving efficient and cost-effective transmit beampattern control for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems is a significant challenge. This paper addresses this by proposing a dual-function radar communication (DFRC) transmitter based on a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) illuminated by a limited number of active sources. We formulate and solve the joint design of source waveforms and RIS phase shifts to match a desired space-frequency radiation pattern, and we evaluate the resulting ISAC system's performance in terms of radar detection probability and data transmission rate. Numerical results demonstrate the promising capabilities of this RIS-enabled transmitter for ISAC applications.</description>

      <title>Secure Communication of UAV-mounted STAR-RIS under Phase Shift Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the secure communication capabilities of a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network supported by a STAR-RIS (simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface) deployed on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), in the presence of passive eavesdroppers. The STAR-RIS facilitates concurrent signal reflection and transmission, allowing multiple legitimate users-grouped via NOMA-to be served efficiently, thereby improving spectral utilization. Each user contends with an associated eavesdropper, creating a stringent security scenario. Under Nakagami fading conditions and accounting for phase shift inaccuracies in the STAR-RIS, closed-form expressions for the ergodic secrecy rates of users in both transmission and reflection paths are derived. An optimization framework is then developed to jointly adjust the UAV's positioning and the STAR-RIS power splitting coefficient, aiming to maximize the system's secrecy rate. The proposed approach enhances secure transmission in STAR-RIS-NOMA configurations under realistic hardware constraints and offers valuable guidance for the design of future 6G wireless networks.</description>

      <title>AI-based Environment-Aware XL-MIMO Channel Estimation with Location-Specific Prior Knowledge Enabled by CKM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient acquisition of wireless channel state information (CSI) is crucial to enhance the communication performance of wireless systems. However, with the continuous densification of wireless links, increased channel dimensions, and the use of higher-frequency bands, channel estimation in the sixth generation (6G) and beyond wireless networks faces new challenges, such as insufficient orthogonal pilot sequences, inadequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for channel training, and more sophisticated channel statistical distributions in complex environment. These challenges pose significant difficulties for classical channel estimation algorithms like least squares (LS) and maximum a posteriori (MAP). To address this problem, we propose a novel environment-aware channel estimation framework with location-specific prior channel distribution enabled by the new concept of channel knowledge map (CKM). To this end, we propose a new type of CKM called channel score function map (CSFM), which learns the channel probability density function (PDF) using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. To fully exploit the prior information in CSFM, we propose a plug-and-play (PnP) based algorithm to decouple the regularized MAP channel estimation problem, thereby reducing the complexity of the optimization process. Besides, we employ Tweedie's formula to establish a connection between the channel score function, defined as the logarithmic gradient of the channel PDF, and the channel denoiser. This allows the use of the high-precision, environment-aware channel denoiser from the CSFM to approximate the channel score function, thus enabling efficient processing of the decoupled channel statistical components. Simulation results show that the proposed CSFM-PnP based channel estimation technique significantly outperforms the conventional techniques in the aforementioned challenging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Introducing Image-Space Preconditioning in the Variational Formulation of MRI Reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of the present article is to enrich the comprehension of iterative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstructions, including compressed sensing (CS) and iterative deep learning (DL) reconstructions, by describing them in the general framework of finite-dimensional inner-product spaces. In particular, we show that image-space preconditioning (ISP) and data-space preconditioning (DSP) can be formulated as non-conventional inner-products. The main gain of our reformulation is an embedding of ISP in the variational formulation of the MRI reconstruction problem (in an algorithm-independent way) which allows in principle to naturally and systematically propagate ISP in all iterative reconstructions, including many iterative DL and CS reconstructions where preconditioning is lacking. The way in which we apply linear algebraic tools to MRI reconstructions as presented in this article is a novelty.
  A secondary aim of our article is to offer a certain didactic material to scientists who are new in the field of MRI reconstruction. Since we explore here some mathematical concepts of reconstruction, we take that opportunity to recall some principles that may be understood for experts, but which may be hard to find in the literature for beginners. In fact, the description of many mathematical tools of MRI reconstruction is fragmented in the literature or sometimes missing because considered as a general knowledge. Further, some of those concepts can be found in mathematic manuals, but not in a form that is oriented toward MRI. For example, we think of the conjugate gradient descent, the notion of derivative with respect to non-conventional inner products, or simply the notion of adjoint. The authors believe therefore that it is beneficial for their field of research to dedicate some space to such a didactic material.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Deep Learning for Denoising in Ultrasound Microvascular Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound microvascular imaging (UMI) is often hindered by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), especially in contrast-free or deep tissue scenarios, which impairs subsequent vascular quantification and reliable disease diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Half-Angle-to-Half-Angle (HA2HA), a self-supervised denoising framework specifically designed for UMI. HA2HA constructs training pairs from complementary angular subsets of beamformed radio-frequency (RF) blood flow data, across which vascular signals remain consistent while noise varies. HA2HA was trained using in-vivo contrast-free pig kidney data and validated across diverse datasets, including contrast-free and contrast-enhanced data from pig kidneys, as well as human liver and kidney. An improvement exceeding 15 dB in both contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and SNR was observed, indicating a substantial enhancement in image quality. In addition to power Doppler imaging, denoising directly in the RF domain is also beneficial for other downstream processing such as color Doppler imaging (CDI). CDI results of human liver derived from the HA2HA-denoised signals exhibited improved microvascular flow visualization, with a suppressed noisy background. HA2HA offers a label-free, generalizable, and clinically applicable solution for robust vascular imaging in both contrast-free and contrast-enhanced UMI.</description>

      <title>Baton: Compensate for Missing Wi-Fi Features for Practical Device-free Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wi-Fi contact-free sensing systems have attracted widespread attention due to their ubiquity and convenience. The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology utilizes off-the-shelf Wi-Fi communication signals for sensing, which further promotes the deployment of intelligent sensing applications. However, current Wi-Fi sensing systems often require prolonged and unnecessary communication between transceivers, and brief communication interruptions will lead to significant performance degradation. This paper proposes Baton, the first system capable of accurately tracking targets even under severe Wi-Fi feature deficiencies. To be specific, we explore the relevance of the Wi-Fi feature matrix from both horizontal and vertical dimensions. The horizontal dimension reveals feature correlation across different Wi-Fi links, while the vertical dimension reveals feature correlation among different time slots. Based on the above principle, we propose the Simultaneous Tracking And Predicting (STAP) algorithm, which enables the seamless transfer of Wi-Fi features over time and across different links, akin to passing a baton. We implement the system on commercial devices, and the experimental results show that our system outperforms existing solutions with a median tracking error of 0.46m, even when the communication duty cycle is as low as 20.00%. Compared with the state-of-the-art, our system reduces the tracking error by 79.19% in scenarios with severe Wi-Fi feature deficiencies.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Specific Neural Response and Cross-Correlation Analysis of Envelope Following Responses to Native Speech and Music Using Multichannel EEG Signals: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although native speech and music envelope following responses (EFRs) play a crucial role in auditory processing and cognition, their frequency profile, such as the dominating frequency and spectral coherence, is largely unknown. We have assumed that the auditory pathway - which transmits envelope components of speech and music to the scalp through time-varying neurophysiological processes - is a linear time-varying system, with the envelope and the multi-channel EEG responses as excitation and response, respectively. This paper investigates the transfer function of this system through two analytical techniques - time-averaged spectral responses and cross-spectral density - in the frequency domain at four different positions of the human scalp. Our findings suggest that alpha (8-11 Hz), lower gamma (53-56 Hz), and higher gamma (78-81 Hz) bands are the peak responses of the system. These frequently appearing dominant frequency responses may be the key components of familiar speech perception, maintaining attention, binding acoustic features, and memory processing. The cross-spectral density, which reflects the spatial neural coherence of the human brain, shows that 10-13 Hz, 27-29 Hz, and 62-64 Hz are common for all channel pairs. As neural coherences are frequently observed in these frequencies among native participants, we suggest that these distributed neural processes are also dominant in native speech and music perception.</description>

      <title>An Effective Equivalence Model of Analyzing PLS of Multiple Eavesdroppers Facing Low-altitude Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In low-altitude wireless communications, the increased complexity of wireless channels and the uncertainty of eavesdroppers (Eves)--caused by diverse altitudes, speeds, and obstacles--pose significant challenges to physical layer security (PLS) technologies based on fixed-position antennas (FPAs), particularly in terms of beamforming capabilities and spatial efficiency. In contrast, movable antennas (MAs) offer a flexible solution by enabling channel reconstruction through antenna movement, effectively compensating for the limitations of FPAs. In this paper, we aim to derive a closed-form expression for the secrecy rate, a key metric in PLS, which is often unattainable in current studies due to the uncertainty of Eves. We construct an equivalent model that leverages the reconfigurable nature of MAs, equating the secrecy rates obtained by multiple Eves with single FPAs to those achieved by a single virtual Eve equipped with an MA array. To minimize the gap between these two types of secrecy rates, we formulate and solve an optimization problem by jointly designing the equivalent distance between the transmitter and the virtual Eve} and the antenna positions of MAs at the virtual Eve. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed equivalent model, offering a new perspective for PLS strategies. This work provides significant insights for network designers on how system parameters affect PLS performance.</description>

      <title>Bi-Linear Homogeneity Enforced Calibration for Pipelined ADCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pipelined analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are key enablers in many state-of-the-art signal processing systems with high sampling rates. In addition to high sampling rates, such systems often demand a high linearity. To meet these challenging linearity requirements, ADC calibration techniques were heavily investigated throughout the past decades. One limitation in ADC calibration is the need for a precisely known test signal. In our previous work, we proposed the homogeneity enforced calibration (HEC) approach, which circumvents this need by consecutively feeding a test signal and a scaled version of it into the ADC. The calibration itself is performed using only the corresponding output samples, such that the test signal can remain unknown. On the downside, the HEC approach requires to accurately scale the test signal, impeding an on-chip implementation. In this work, we provide a thorough analysis of the HEC approach, including limitations such as the effects of an inaccurately scaled test signal. Furthermore, the bi-linear homogeneity enforced calibration (BL-HEC) approach is introduced and suggested to account for an inaccurate scaling and, therefore, to facilitate an on-chip implementation. In addition, a comprehensive stability analysis of the BL-HEC approach is carried out. Finally, we verify our concept with behavioral Matlab simulations and measurements conducted on 24 integrated ADCs.</description>

      <title>Multi-model Stochastic Particle-based Variational Bayesian Inference for Multiband Delay Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joint utilization of multiple discrete frequency bands can enhance the accuracy of delay estimation. Although some unique challenges of multiband fusion, such as phase distortion, oscillation phenomena, and high-dimensional search, have been partially addressed, further challenges remain. Specifically, under conditions of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), insufficient data, and closely spaced delay paths, accurately determining the model order-the number of delay paths-becomes difficult. Misestimating the model order can significantly degrade the estimation performance of traditional methods. To address joint model selection and parameter estimation under such harsh conditions, we propose a multi-model stochastic particle-based variational Bayesian inference (MM-SPVBI) framework, capable of exploring multiple high-dimensional parameter spaces. Initially, we split potential overlapping primary delay paths based on coarse estimates, generating several parallel candidate models. Then, an auto-focusing sampling strategy is employed to quickly identify the optimal model. Additionally, we introduce a hybrid posterior approximation to improve the original single-model SPVBI, ensuring overall complexity does not increase significantly with parallelism. Simulations demonstrate that our algorithm offers substantial advantages over existing methods.</description>

      <title>A Quantum-Empowered SPEI Drought Forecasting Algorithm Using Spatially-Aware Mamba Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the intensifying impacts of extreme climate changes, drought forecasting (DF), which aims to predict droughts from historical meteorological data, has become increasingly critical for monitoring and managing water resources. Though drought conditions often exhibit spatial climatic coherence among neighboring regions, benchmark deep learning-based DF methods overlook this fact and predict the conditions on a region-by-region basis. Using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), we designed and trained a novel and transformative spatially-aware DF neural network, which effectively captures local interactions among neighboring regions, resulting in enhanced spatial coherence and prediction accuracy. As DF also requires sophisticated temporal analysis, the Mamba network, recognized as the most accurate and efficient existing time-sequence modeling, was adopted to extract temporal features from short-term time frames. We also adopted quantum neural networks (QNN) to entangle the spatial features of different time instances, leading to refined spatiotemporal features of seven different meteorological variables for effectively identifying short-term climate fluctuations. In the last stage of our proposed SPEI-driven quantum spatially-aware Mamba network (SQUARE-Mamba), the extracted spatiotemporal features of seven different meteorological variables were fused to achieve more accurate DF. Validation experiments across El Ni\~no, La Ni\~na, and normal years demonstrated the superiority of the proposed SQUARE-Mamba, remarkably achieving an average improvement of more than 9.8% in the coefficient of determination index (R^2) compared to baseline methods, thereby illustrating the promising roles of the temporal quantum entanglement and Mamba temporal analysis to achieve more accurate DF.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time CRLB-based Power Allocation for CF MIMO-ISAC with Joint Localization and Velocity Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in a cell-free (CF) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network, where each access point functions either as an ISAC transmitter or as a sensing receiver. We devote into the ISAC sensing metric using the discrete-time signal-based Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for joint location and velocity estimation under arbitrary power allocation ratios under the deterministic radar cross section assumption (RCS). Then, we consider the power allocation optimization problem for the CF MIMO-ISAC as the maximization of the communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), subject to CRLB-based sensing constraints and per-transmitter power limits. To solve the resulting nonlinear and non-convex problem, we propose a penalty function and projection-based modified conjugate gradient algorithm with inexact line search (PP-MCG-ILS), and an alternative method based on a modified steepest descent approach (PP-MSD-ILS). We show that the proposed algorithms are scalable and can be extended to a broad class of optimization problems involving nonlinear inequality constraints and affine equality constraints. In addition, we extend the PP-MCG-ILS algorithm to the pure sensing scenario, where a penalty function-based normalized conjugate gradient algorithm (P-NCG-ILS) is developed for sensing power minimization. Finally, we analyze the convergence behavior and qualitatively compare the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the derived CRLBs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed power allocation strategies in enhancing both sensing and overall ISAC performance.</description>

      <title>Copula Density Neural Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probability density estimation from observed data constitutes a central task in statistics. In this brief, we focus on the problem of estimating the copula density associated to any observed data, as it fully describes the dependence between random variables. We separate univariate marginal distributions from the joint dependence structure in the data, the copula itself, and we model the latter with a neural network-based method referred to as copula density neural estimation (CODINE). Results show that the novel learning approach is capable of modeling complex distributions and can be applied for mutual information estimation and data generation.</description>

      <title>Robustness in Wireless Distributed Learning: An Information-Theoretic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in wireless communications has demonstrated inherent robustness against wireless channel distortions. Most existing works empirically leverage this robustness to yield considerable performance gains through AI architectural designs. However, there is a lack of direct theoretical analysis of this robustness and its potential to enhance communication efficiency, which restricts the full exploitation of these advantages. In this paper, we adopt an information-theoretic approach to evaluate the robustness in wireless distributed learning by deriving an upper bound on the task performance loss due to imperfect wireless channels. Utilizing this insight, we define task outage probability and characterize the maximum transmission rate under task accuracy guarantees, referred to as the task-aware $\epsilon$-capacity resulting from the robustness. To achieve the utility of the theoretical results in practical settings, we present an efficient algorithm for the approximation of the upper bound. Subsequently, we devise a robust training framework that optimizes the trade-off between robustness and task accuracy, enhancing the robustness against channel distortions. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed upper bound and task-aware $\epsilon$-capacity and demonstrate that the proposed robust training framework achieves high robustness, thus ensuring a high transmission rate while maintaining inference performance.</description>

      <title>MEIT: Multimodal Electrocardiogram Instruction Tuning on Large Language Models for Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04945v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the primary non-invasive diagnostic tool for monitoring cardiac conditions and is crucial in assisting clinicians. Recent studies have concentrated on classifying cardiac conditions using ECG data but have overlooked ECG report generation, which is time-consuming and requires clinical expertise. To automate ECG report generation and ensure its versatility, we propose the Multimodal ECG Instruction Tuning (MEIT) framework, the first attempt to tackle ECG report generation with LLMs and multimodal instructions. To facilitate future research, we establish a benchmark to evaluate MEIT with various LLMs backbones across two large-scale ECG datasets. Our approach uniquely aligns the representations of the ECG signal and the report, and we conduct extensive experiments to benchmark MEIT with nine open-source LLMs using more than 800,000 ECG reports. MEIT's results underscore the superior performance of instruction-tuned LLMs, showcasing their proficiency in quality report generation, zero-shot capabilities, resilience to signal perturbation, and alignment with human expert evaluation. These findings emphasize the efficacy of MEIT and its potential for real-world clinical application.</description>

      <title>Robust Score-Based Quickest Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11094v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methods in the field of quickest change detection rapidly detect in real-time a change in the data-generating distribution of an online data stream. Existing methods have been able to detect this change point when the densities of the pre- and post-change distributions are known. Recent work has extended these results to the case where the pre- and post-change distributions are known only by their score functions. This work considers the case where the pre- and post-change score functions are known only to correspond to distributions in two disjoint sets. This work selects a pair of least-favorable distributions from these sets to robustify the existing score-based quickest change detection algorithm, the properties of which are studied. This paper calculates the least-favorable distributions for specific model classes and provides methods of estimating the least-favorable distributions for common constructions. Simulation results are provided demonstrating the performance of our robust change detection algorithm.</description>

      <title>MARS: Radio Map Super-resolution and Reconstruction Method under Sparse Channel Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.</description>

      <title>Movable-Antenna-Enhanced Physical-Layer Service Integration: Performance Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) have drawn increasing attention in wireless communications due to their capability to create favorable channel conditions via local movement within a confined region. In this letter, we investigate its application in physical-layer service integration (PHY-SI), where a multi-MA base station (BS) simultaneously transmits both confidential and multicast messages to two users. The multicast message is intended for both users, while the confidential message is intended only for one user and must remain perfectly secure from the other. Our goal is to jointly optimize the secrecy and multicast beamforming, as well as the MAs' positions at the BS to maximize the secrecy rate for one user while satisfying the multicast rate requirement for both users. To gain insights, we first conduct performance analysis of this MA-enhanced PHY-SI system in two special cases, revealing its unique characteristics compared to conventional PHY-SI with fixed-position antennas (FPAs). To address the secrecy rate maximization problem, we propose a two-layer optimization framework that integrates the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique and a discrete sampling algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that MAs can greatly enhance the achievable secrecy rate region for PHY-SI compared to FPAs.</description>
