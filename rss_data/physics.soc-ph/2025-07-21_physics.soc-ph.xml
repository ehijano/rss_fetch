      <title>Can Quantum Physics Help Fight Climate Change? A Thematic Analysis of Press Release Narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The climate crisis demands innovative solutions and quantum technologies are considered by some a potential solution (Berger et al., 2021; Calvin et al., 2023). The United Nations declared 2025 the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology (United Nations, 2024), focusing on applications for quantum technologies. Quantum technologies, leveraging quantum mechanics, offer unprecedented computational power (Ajagekar &amp; You, 2022) and sensitivity (Schleich et al., 2016) that could revolutionize various sectors, including climate action. However, an understanding of how discourse from academia, government, and industry frames quantum technologies as a climate solution is lacking (Suter, Ma, &amp; P\"ohlmann, 2024). This research aims to fill this gap by analyzing the narratives in press releases and helping inform a successful democratization of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Impact of homophily in adherence to anti-epidemic measures on the spread of infectious diseases in social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how homophily in adherence to anti-epidemic measures affects the final size of epidemics in social networks. Using a modified SIR model, we divide agents into two behavioral groups-compliant and non-compliant-and introduce transmission probabilities that depend asymmetrically on the behavior of both the infected and susceptible individuals. We simulate epidemic dynamics on two types of synthetic networks with tunable inter-group connection probability: stochastic block models (SBM) and networks with triadic closure (TC) that better capture local clustering. Our main result reveals a counterintuitive effect: under conditions where compliant infected agents significantly reduce transmission, increasing the separation between groups may lead to a higher fraction of infections in the compliant population. This paradoxical outcome emerges only in networks with clustering (TC), not in SBM, suggesting that local network structure plays a crucial role. These findings highlight that increasing group separation does not always confer protection, especially when behavioral traits amplify within-group transmission.</description>

      <title>Fractal Social Dynamics as a Driver of Consensus and Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human social behavior is organized in stratified, hierarchical networks, with a support group with about 5 members, expanding proportionally at each layer up to a maximum of approximately 150 frequent interactions per individual. This is known as Social Brain Hypothesis, and its findings are supported by psychological and neurological evidence. The fractal network framework provides valuable insights into social phenomena such as the spread of fake news and the development of technology. This study models socioeconomic interactions using fractal networks, where group sizes scale by a fixed factor, to analyze how consensus is formed. Using $q$-calculus, the model reveals how hierarchical structures influence information spread, highlighting universal features governed by power laws.. The results follow $q$-Gaussian distributions, showing heavy-tails that align with observed inequalities in societies worldwide. The results show that inequalities arise from the fractal structure of the socioeconomic network.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Dynamics of Conspiracy Related German Telegram Conversations during COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conspiracy theories have long drawn public attention, but their explosive growth on platforms like Telegram during the COVID-19 pandemic raises pressing questions about their impact on societal trust, democracy, and public health. We provide a geographical, temporal and network analysis of the structure of of conspiracy-related German-language Telegram chats in a novel large-scale data set. We examine how information flows between regional user groups and influential broadcasting channels, revealing the interplay between decentralized discussions and content spread driven by a small number of key actors.
  Our findings reveal that conspiracy-related activity spikes during major COVID-19-related events, correlating with societal stressors and mirroring prior research on how crises amplify conspiratorial beliefs. By analysing the interplay between regional, national and transnational chats, we uncover how information flows from larger national or transnational discourse to localised, community-driven discussions. Furthermore, we find that the top 10% of chats account for 94% of all forwarded content, portraying the large influence of a few actors in disseminating information. However, these chats operate independently, with minimal interconnection between each other, primarily forwarding messages to low-traffic groups. Notably, 43% of links shared in the data set point to untrustworthy sources as identified by NewsGuard, a proportion far exceeding their share on other platforms and in other discourse contexts, underscoring the role of conspiracy-related discussions on Telegram as vector for the spread of misinformation.</description>

      <title>Higher-order dissimilarity measures for hypergraph comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, networks with higher-order interactions have emerged as a powerful tool to model complex systems. Comparing these higher-order systems remains however a challenge. Traditional similarity measures designed for pairwise networks fail indeed to capture salient features of hypergraphs, hence potentially neglecting important information. To address this issue, here we introduce two novel measures, Hyper NetSimile and Hyperedge Portrait Divergence, specifically designed for comparing hypergraphs. These measures take explicitly into account the properties of multi-node interactions, using complementary approaches. They are defined for any arbitrary pair of hypergraphs, of potentially different sizes, thus being widely applicable. We illustrate the effectiveness of these metrics through clustering experiments on synthetic and empirical higher-order networks, showing their ability to correctly group hypergraphs generated by different models and to distinguish real-world systems coming from different contexts. Our results highlight the advantages of using higher-order dissimilarity measures over traditional pairwise representations in capturing the full structural complexity of the systems considered.</description>

      <title>Where do Germany's electricity imports come from?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2023, Germany's electricity trade balance shifted from net exports to net imports for the first time since 2002, resulting in an increasing discussion of these imports in the public debate. This study discusses different data driven approaches for the analysis of Germany's cross-border trade, with a focus on the methodological challenges to determine the origin of imported electricity within the framework of European electricity market coupling. While scheduled commercial flows from ENTSO-E are often used as indicators, generally these do not correspond to bilateral exchanges between different market actors. In particular, for day-ahead market coupling only net positions have an economically reasonable interpretation, and scheduled commercial exchanges are defined through ex-post algorithmic calculations. Any measure of the origin of electricity imports thus depends on some underlying interpretation and corresponding method, ranging from local flow patterns to correlations in net positions. To illustrate this dependence on methodological choices, we compare different approaches to determine the origin of electricity imports for hourly European power system data for 2024.</description>

      <title>Modelling the spillover from online engagement to offline protest: stochastic dynamics and mean-field approximations on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media is transforming various aspects of offline life, from everyday decisions such as dining choices to the progression of conflicts. In this study, we propose a coupled modelling framework with an online social network layer to analyse how engagement on a specific topic spills over into offline protest activities. We develop a stochastic model and derive several mean-field models of varying complexity. These models allow us to estimate the reproductive number and anticipate when surges in activity are likely to occur. A key factor is the transmission rate between the online and offline domains; for offline outbursts to emerge, this rate must fall within a critical range, neither too low nor too high. Additionally, using synthetic networks, we examine how network structure influences the accuracy of these approximations. Our findings indicate that low-density networks need more complex approximations, whereas simpler models can effectively represent higher-density networks. When tested on two real-world networks, however, increased complexity did not enhance accuracy.</description>

      <title>You Don't Have to Live Next to Me: Towards Demobilizing Individualistic Bias in Computational Approaches to Urban Segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global surge in social inequalities is one of the most pressing issues of our times. The spatial expression of social inequalities at city scale gives rise to urban segregation, a common phenomenon across different local and cultural contexts. The increasing popularity of Big Data and computational models has inspired a growing number of computational social science studies that analyze, evaluate, and issue policy recommendations for urban segregation. Today's wealth in information and computational power could inform urban planning for equity. However, as we show here, segregation research is epistemologically interdependent with prevalent economic theories which overfocus on individual responsibility while neglecting systemic processes. This individualistic bias is also engrained in computational models of urban segregation. Through several contemporary examples of how Big Data -- and the assumptions underlying its usage -- influence (de)segregation patterns and policies, our essay tells a cautionary tale. We highlight how a lack of consideration for data ethics can lead to the creation of computational models that have a real-life, further marginalizing impact on disadvantaged groups. With this essay, our aim is to develop a better discernment of the pitfalls and potentials of computational approaches to urban segregation, thereby fostering a conscious focus on systemic thinking about urban inequalities. We suggest setting an agenda for research and collective action that is directed at demobilizing individualistic bias, informing our thinking about urban segregation, but also more broadly our efforts to create sustainable cities and communities.</description>

      <title>On the class of coding optimality of human languages and the origins of Zipf's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20015v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we present a new class of optimality for coding systems. Members of that class are displaced linearly from optimal coding and thus exhibit Zipf's law, namely a power-law distribution of frequency ranks. Within that class, Zipf's law, the size-rank law and the size-probability law form a group-like structure. We identify human languages that are members of the class. All languages showing sufficient agreement with Zipf's law are potential members of the class. In contrast, there are communication systems in other species that cannot be members of that class for exhibiting an exponential distribution instead but dolphins and humpback whales might. We provide a new insight into plots of frequency versus rank in double logarithmic scale. For any system, a straight line in that scale indicates that the lengths of optimal codes under non-singular coding and under uniquely decodable encoding are displaced by a linear function whose slope is the exponent of Zipf's law. For systems under compression and constrained to be uniquely decodable, such a straight line may indicate that the system is coding close to optimality. We provide support for the hypothesis that Zipf's law originates from compression and define testable conditions for the emergence of Zipf's law in compressing systems.</description>
