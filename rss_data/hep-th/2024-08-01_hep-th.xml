      <title>Bulk Black Hole Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark dimension provides a mechanism to resolve the cosmological hierarchy problem and assembles a colosseum for dark matter contenders. In a series of recent publications we investigated whether primordial black holes (PBHs) perceiving the dark dimension could constitute all of the dark matter in the universe. A key assumption of these investigations is that PBHs remain confined to the brane during the entire evaporation process. As a consequence, the abundance of PBHs evaporating at the present epoch is severely constrained by observations of both the extragalactic and Galactic $\gamma$-ray backgrounds. As a natural outgrowth of these investigations, herein we relax the assumption of brane localized PBHs and reexamine the evaporation process of PBHs which are allowed to escape into the dark dimension. We show that the escape of PBHs from the brane is almost instantaneous. Armed with this pivotal finding we reassess the allowed mass range of PBHs to assemble all cosmological dark matter, which is estimated to be $10^{11} \lesssim M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \lesssim 10^{21}$.</description>

      <title>Curvature-induced moduli stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss FLRW-cosmologies with negatively-curved spatial slices that induce a late-time stabilization of all the moduli of an effective field theory through Hubble friction, independently of the moduli-space curvature. This holds for pure moduli, which appear ubiquitously in string compactifications. Crucially, the cosmological solutions approach a Milne universe. Hence, the mechanism we describe in fact corresponds to late-time moduli stabilization in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Position space equations for generic Feynman graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the extension of the position space approach to Feynman integrals from the banana family to generic Feynman diagrams. Our approach is based on getting rid of integration in position space and then writing differential equations for the products of propagators defined for any graph. We employ the so-called ''bananization'' to start with simple Feynman graphs and further substituting each edge with a multiple one. We explain how the previously developed theory of banana diagrams can be used to describe what happens to the differential equations (Ward identities) on Feynman diagrams after this transformation. Our approach works for generic enough (large enough) dimension and masses. We expect that after Fourier transform our equations should be related to the Picard-Fuchs equations. Therefore, we describe the challenges of Fourier transform that arise in our approach.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many new renormalization group flows between Virasoro minimal models from non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the study of non-invertible symmetries, we propose there exist infinitely many new renormalization group flows between Virasoro minimal models $\mathcal{M}(kq + I, q) \to\mathcal{M}(kq-I, q)$ induced by $\phi_{(1,2k+1)}$. They vastly generalize the previously proposed ones $k=I=1$ by Zamolodchikov, $k=1, I&gt;1$ by Ahn and L\"assig, and $k=2$ by Dorey et al. All the other $\mathbb{Z}_2$ preserving renormalization group flows sporadically known in the literature (e.g. $\mathcal{M}(10,3) \to \mathcal{M}(8,3)$ studied by Klebanov et al) fall into our proposal (e.g. $k=3, I=1$). We claim our new flows give a complete understanding of the renormalization group flows between Virasoro minimal models that preserve a modular tensor category with the $SU(2)_{q-2}$ fusion ring.</description>

      <title>Hairy dyonic Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in an Einstein-Maxwell-Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin type model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct spherically symmetric dyonic black holes in a generalized Maxwell-Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin type model with a complex scalar doublet and a symmetry breaking potential {for the real scalar field}, minimally coupled to Einstein gravity in asymptotically flat space.
  We analyze the properties of the hairy black holes and determine their domain of existence. Our discussion focuses mostly on the case of a long-ranged massless real scalar field.
  Our results indicate that in this case, depending on the coupling constants, the resonant hairy dyonic black holes may bifurcate from Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes at maximal chemical potential, while the limiting solutions at minimal chemical potential may be related to the Penney solution.</description>

      <title>Towards $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal higher-spin theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three years ago, we proposed free off-shell models for ${\mathcal N}=2$ superconformal higher-spin multiplets in arbitrary conformally flat backgrounds, constructed conserved conformal higher-spin supercurrents for a massless hypermultiplet, and sketched the Noether procedure to generate its cubic couplings to the superconformal higher-spin multiplets. This paper is devoted to completing the Noether procedure. Specifically, we: (i) describe the unique off-shell primary extensions of the conformal higher-spin supercurrents; (ii) embed the off-shell superconformal prepotentials given in arXiv:2104.10416 into primary unconstrained isotwistor multiplets; and (iii) present the unique gauge transformations of the hypermultiplet and the isotwistor prepotentials. An extension of the Noether procedure beyond the cubic level is also sketched, following the earlier ${\mathcal N}=1$ superconformal approach of arXiv:2208.07783. Our construction is based on making use of the polar hypermultiplet within the projective-superspace setting.</description>

      <title>Non-extremal Island in de Sitter Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the challenges and resolutions in computing the entanglement entropy for the quantum field theory coupled to de Sitter (dS) gravity along a timelike boundary. The conventional island formula, originally designed to calculate the fine-grained entropy for a non-gravitational system coupled to anti-de Sitter (AdS) gravity, encounters difficulties in de Sitter gravitational spacetime, failing to provide a physically plausible extremal island. To overcome these problems, we introduce a doubly holographic model by embedding a dS$_2$ braneworld in an AdS$_3$ bulk spacetime. This approach facilitates the computation of entanglement entropy through holographic correlation functions, effectively circumventing the constraints of the island formula. We demonstrate that the correct recipe for calculating entanglement entropy with dS gravity involves the non-extremal island, whose boundary is instead defined at the edge of the dS gravitational region. Our findings indicate that, during the island phase, the entanglement wedge of the non-gravitational bath includes the entire dS gravitational space. Using the second variation formula, we further show that the existence of a locally minimal surface anchored on the gravitational brane is intrinsically linked to the extrinsic curvature of the brane.</description>

      <title>Half-BPS Janus solutions in AdS$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study half-BPS flows in gauged minimal 7d supergravity featured by an AdS$_3\times S^3$ slicing of the metric, supported by a dyonic three-form field. We first present a novel strategy for analytic integration of the BPS equations, which makes use of the integrals of motion. Subsequently, we discuss the suitable choice of integration constants that gives rise to smooth geometries. These flows are asymptotically locally AdS$_7$ in their UV limit, while their IR geometry is AdS$_3\times \mathbb{R}^4$. We then discuss their uplifts to 11d and massive IIA supergravity and observe that they describe one-parameter deformations of their AdS$_7\times S^4$ and AdS$_7\times S^3$ vacua, respectively, their holographic interpretation being as conformal defect CFT$_2$'s within the corresponding dual SCFT$_6$'s. We conclude with the computation of the holographic central charge, by focussing on the M-theory interpretation.</description>

      <title>Deconstruction and surface defects in 6d CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the two families of AdS$_3\times S^3\times S^2\times \Sigma_2$ solutions to massive Type IIA supergravity with small and large $(0,4)$ supersymmetries constructed recently in the literature, in connection with the AdS$_7\times S^2\times I$ solutions to massive Type IIA, to which they asymptote locally. Based on our analysis of various observables, that we study holographically, we propose an interpretation of the first class of solutions as dual to deconstructed 6d (1,0) CFTs dual to AdS$_7$, and of the second class as dual to surface defects in the same 6d theories. Among the observables that we study are baryon vertices and giant graviton configurations in quiver-like constructions.</description>

      <title>The surprising structure of non-relativistic 11-dimensional supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a non-relativistic limit of 11-dimensional supergravity. This limit leads to a theory with an underlying membrane Newton-Cartan geometry. Consistency of the non-relativistic limit requires the imposition of constraints, requiring that certain bosonic and fermionic torsions and curvatures vanish. We investigate the implications of two versions of these constraints. In one version, we keep only 16 supersymmetry transformations, leading to a simple (purely bosonic) constraint structure but an unusual realisation of the supersymmetry algebra which does not close into diffeomorphisms. In the other, we keep all 32 supersymmetry transformations. This requires a complicated sequence of bosonic and fermionic constraints, eventually involving three derivatives of bosonic fields. We argue, with a linearised calculation, that this sequence of constraints terminates. Furthermore, we show that there exists a family of supersymmetric solutions satisfying these constraints, containing the non-relativistic limit of the M2 supergravity solution recently obtained by Lambert and Smith as a background relevant for non-relativistic holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study in detail various solutions, especially kink ones, in different nonlocal scalar field theories, whose kinetic term is described by an arbitrary non-polynomial analytic function of the d'Alembertian operator, and the potential is chosen either to be quadratic or to allow for the kink-like solution. Using the perturbative method, we find corrections of first and second orders in the nonlocality parameter around local solutions for several form factors and generate analytic expressions for the energy density up to the first order in this parameter. Additionally, we also address an inverse problem, that is, we reconstruct the potential corresponding to the given solution obtaining restrictions for the form factor.</description>

      <title>Energy-time uncertainty relation from entropy measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) modifies the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) between position and momentum by introducing a nonzero minimum uncertainty in position. In a previous study, we demonstrated the emergence of GUP from non-extensive entropies, particularly for $S_\pm$ dependent only on the probability. In this new research, we derive a generalized energy-time uncertainty relation from these entropies. Consequently, we observe that the dispersion relation undergoes modification due to the non-extensivity introduced by the entropies $S_{+}$ and $S_{-}$. These modifications play a significant role at the Planck scale, but are negligible in the classical regime of large distances and low energies. Moreover, the modified uncertainty relation results in a maximum uncertainty in energy, attributed to the negative deformation parameter associated with entropy $S_{+}$. Conversely, the deformation parameter linked with $S_{-}$ leads to the emergence of a minimum time interval. In the Planck regime, the minimum time interval is on the order of the Planck time, while the maximum uncertainty in energy reaches the Planck energy. These findings imply that quantum gravity effects can be connected with non-extensive statistics.</description>

Abstract: Factorization algebras play a central role in the formulation of quantum field theories given by Kevin Costello and his collaborators. In this paper, we propose a concrete construction of a topological operator in their formulation. We focus on a shift symmetry of a one-dimensional massless scalar theory. And we give some discussions of $\mathbb{Z}$-gauging of it, i.e., compact scalar theory and its $\theta$-vacuum.</description>

      <title>Causality and stability in relativistic hydrodynamic theory -- a choice to be endured</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, it has been indicated that the key features requisite for preserving causality and stability of the popularly existing relativistic hydrodynamic theories, can be translated into each other. It has been shown here, that a generic `fluid frame transformation' including all orders of gradient corrections can recast a stable-causal hydrodynamic theory that (i) only includes fundamental fluid variables (velocity and temperature) but requires to be in a general hydrodynamic frame other than the Landau or Eckart, to a theory that is (ii) pathology free in Landau frame but needs newer degrees of freedom. Since frame choice provides the first principle field definitions and degrees of freedom indicate the number of conserved quantities, the causality and stability of a theory seem to require a consensus between the two unless the derivative correction goes to infinity. The key finding of this work is to indicate a connection between these different formalisms, that lead to a causal and stable hydrodynamic theory.</description>

      <title>Linear-Quadratic GUP and Thermodynamic Dimensional Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the statistical mechanics within the Linear-Quadratic GUP (LQGUP, i.e, GUP with linear and quadratic terms in momentum) models in the semiclassical regime. Then, some thermodynamic properties of a system of 3-dimensional harmonic oscillators are investigated by calculating the deformed partition functions. According to the equipartition theorem, we show that the number of accessible microstates decreases sharply in the very high temperatures regime. When the thermal de Broglie wavelength is of the order of the Planck length, three degrees of freedom are frozen in this setup. In other words, it is observed that there is an effective reduction of the degrees of freedom from 6 to 3 for a system of 3D harmonic oscillators in this framework. The calculations are carried out using both approximate analytical and exact numerical methods. The results of the analytical method are also presented in the form of thermal wavelengths for better understanding. Finally, the case of a 2-dimensional harmonic is treated as another example to comprehend the results, leading to a reduction of the degrees of freedom from 4 to 2.</description>

      <title>Holographic dark energy in Barrow cosmology with Granda-Oliveros IR cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying the modified Barrow entropy, inspired by the quantum fluctuation effects, to the cosmological background, and using thermodynamics-gravity conjuncture, the Friedmann equations get modified as well. In this paper, we explore the holographic dark energy with Granda-Oliveros (GO) IR cutoff, in the context of the modified Barrow cosmology. First, we assume two dark components of the universe evolves independently and obtain the cosmological parameters and explore the cosmic evolution. Second, we consider an interaction term between dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM). We observe that the Barrow parameter $\delta$ crucially affects the cosmic dynamics, causes the transition from the decelerating phase to the accelerating phase occurs later. We find out that the equation of state parameter is in the quintessence region in the past and crosses the phantom divide at the present time. Finally, we examine the squared speed of sound analysis for this model. According to the squared sound speed diagrams, the results indicate that the presence of interaction between DM and DE as well as increasing in the value of $\delta$ leads to the manifestation of signs of instability in the past $(v_s^2&lt;0)$. Furthermore, by examining the statefinder, we find that presence of $\delta$ also makes a distinction between holographic dark energy in Barrow cosmology with GO-IR cutoff and the $\Lambda$CDM model. In fact, increasing $\delta$ causes the statefinder diagram move away from the point of $\left\lbrace r,s\right\rbrace= \left\lbrace 1,0\right\rbrace$ at $z=0$.</description>

      <title>Non-singular naked solutions in quantum spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymer models have been used to describe non-singular quantum black holes, where the classical singularity is replaced by a transition from a black hole to a white hole. In a previous letter, in the context of a uni-parametric model with asymptotic flat exterior metric, we fixed the radius of the transition surface through the identification of its area with the area gap of Loop Quantum Gravity. This revealed a dependence of the polymerisation parameter on the black hole mass, where the former increases as the latter decreases, and it also enabled the extension of the model to Planck-scale black holes. We have identified the existence of limiting states with masses $m \geq \sqrt{2}/4$ and zero surface gravity, showing that Hawking evaporation asymptotically leads to remnant black holes of Planck size. In the present paper we consider solutions with $m &lt; \sqrt{2}/4$, observing again the presence of a minimal radius, but without formation of horizons. Diversely from the previous mass range, only charged solutions are allowed in this case.</description>

      <title>Entropy, Thermodynamics and the Geometrization of the Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss how pure mathematics and theoretical physics can be applied to the study of language models. Using set theory and analysis, we formulate mathematically rigorous definitions of language models, and introduce the concept of the moduli space of distributions for a language model. We formulate a generalized distributional hypothesis using functional analysis and topology. We define the entropy function associated with a language model and show how it allows us to understand many interesting phenomena in languages. We argue that the zero points of the entropy function and the points where the entropy is close to 0 are the key obstacles for an LLM to approximate an intelligent language model, which explains why good LLMs need billions of parameters. Using the entropy function, we formulate a conjecture about AGI.
  Then, we show how thermodynamics gives us an immediate interpretation to language models. In particular we will define the concepts of partition function, internal energy and free energy for a language model, which offer insights into how language models work. Based on these results, we introduce a general concept of the geometrization of language models and define what is called the Boltzmann manifold. While the current LLMs are the special cases of the Boltzmann manifold.</description>

      <title>Quantum Effects in 3+1 Schwarzschild-de Sitter Spacetime: Properties of the Hadamard Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a four-dimensional Schwarzschild-de Sitter background, the spherically symmetric ($\ell=0$) contribution to the Hadamard two-point correlation function is computed for a massless minimally-coupled scalar field in the Unruh state. Consideration is given to spacetime points located exterior to the black hole horizon, but within the cosmological horizon. Previously it was found in two dimensions for spatially separated points that the Hadamard function exhibits unbounded linear growth at late times, with a rate of growth proportional to the sum of the black hole and cosmological surface gravities. Here it is shown numerically that this behavior persists in four dimensions, where scattering effects associated with the scalar field modes lead to a modification of the two-dimensional result. An analytic approximation is derived for the growth rate in four dimensions and, in the limit that the black hole vanishes, the leading order contribution is equivalent to the rate of growth for the Hadamard function found previously for de Sitter space in cosmological coordinates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational form factors (GFFs) of pions has been calculated from a top-down holographic QCD approach with momentum transfer dependence for the first time. It is important because the GFFs of hadrons have information on the internal stress distribution that may provide insight into the mechanism of how QCD forms hadrons. The forward limit value of this GFFs, i.e. the D-term, was also obtained. Furthermore, in this approach, we observe the so-called glueball dominance, in which pions have gravitational interactions via infinite glueball spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hawking temperature of a Schwarzschild black hole can be heuristically derived by identifying the temperature with the inverse radius of the horizon up to a multiplicative constant. This does not work for more general black holes such as the Kerr and Reissner-Nordstr\"om solutions. Expounding on the details of how it fails to work nevertheless uncovers interesting connections with the "spring constant" of black holes and with black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamical generation of electroweak scale from the conformal sector: A strongly coupled Higgs via the Dyson--Schwinger approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel pathway to generate the electroweak (EW) scale via non-perturbative dynamics of a conformally invariant scalar sector at the classical level. We provide a method to estimate the non-perturbative EW scale generation using the exact solution of the background equations of motion in a scalar theory via the Dyson-Schwinger approach. Particularly, we find an analytical result for the Higgs mass in the strongly coupled regime in terms of its quartic self interaction term and the cut-off scale of the theory. We also show that the Higgs sector is an essential part of the Standard Model as, without it, a Yang--Mills gauge theory cannot acquire mass even if a self-interaction term is present. Our analysis lead to a more realistic model building with possible solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem and, in general, to the dynamical generation of any scales scales in nature, be it the visible sector or the dark sector.</description>

      <title>A framework for semi-universality: Semi-universality of 3-qudit SU(d)-invariant gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuits with symmetry-respecting gates have attracted broad interest in quantum information science. While recent work has developed a theory for circuits with Abelian symmetries, revealing important distinctions between Abelian and non-Abelian cases, a comprehensive framework for non-Abelian symmetries has been lacking. In this work, we develop novel techniques and a powerful framework that is particularly useful for understanding circuits with non-Abelian symmetries. Using this framework we settle an open question on quantum circuits with SU(d) symmetry. We show that 3-qudit SU(d)-invariant gates are semi-universal, i.e., generate all SU(d)-invariant unitaries, up to certain constraints on the relative phases between sectors with inequivalent representation of symmetry. Furthermore, we prove that these gates achieve full universality when supplemented with 3 ancilla qudits. Interestingly, we find that studying circuits with 3-qudit gates is also useful for a better understanding of circuits with 2-qudit gates. In particular, we establish that even though 2-qudit SU(d)-invariant gates are not themselves semi-universal, they become universal with at most 11 ancilla qudits. Additionally, we investigate the statistical properties of circuits composed of random SU(d)-invariant gates. Our findings reveal that while circuits with 2-qudit gates do not form a 2-design for the Haar measure over SU(d)-invariant unitaries, circuits with 3-qudit gates generate a t-design, with t that is quadratic in the number of qudits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers can efficiently solve problems which are widely believed to lie beyond the reach of classical computers. In the near-term, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, which efficiently embed quantum hardware in classical frameworks, are crucial in bridging the vast divide in the performance of the purely-quantum algorithms and their classical counterparts. Here, a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm is presented for the computation of non-perturbative characteristics of quantum field theories. The presented algorithm relies on a universal parametrized quantum circuit ansatz based on Euler and Cartan's decompositions of single and two-qubit operators. It is benchmarked by computing the energy spectra of lattice realizations of quantum field theories with both short and long range interactions. Low depth circuits are provided for false vacua as well as highly excited states corresponding to mesonic and baryonic excitations occurring in the analyzed models. The described algorithm opens a hitherto-unexplored avenue for the investigation of mass-ratios, scattering amplitudes and false-vacuum decays in quantum field theories.</description>

Abstract: We compare light propagation through an intense electromagnetic background as described by three different nonlinear electrodynamics: Born-Infeld (BI), Euler-Heisenberg (EH), and Modified Maxwell (MM). We use the concept of effective metric to determine the phase velocities of a propagating wave from the BI and EH nonlinear electrodynamics and use them to set constraints on the MM nonlinear parameter. In a second part of the paper, we consider the black hole solutions of the nonlinear electrodynamics coupled with General Relativity and determine the shadows cast by the static black holes. Confronting the observations of the shadows of M87$^*$ and Sagittarius A$^*$ with our theoretical results allows us to set restrictions on the nonlinear parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider accelerating black holes in four-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime and investigate the extremality relations by examining perturbative corrections to both the entropy of black holes and their extremality bounds. It is shown that the so-called Goon and Penco (univeral) relation is also valid for accelerating black holes. Furthermore, it is found that an appropriate matching condition is necessary between the perturbation parameter of the relation with the perturbative correction to such black holes, and the parameter with information about the conical deficits on the north and south poles with the cosmic string tensions in order to satisfy the extremality relations. This result indicates that the extremality (univeral) relation of a class of accelerating black holes holds exhibit behavior similar to the Weak Gravity Conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Starobinsky model of cosmological inflation in four spacetime dimensions is reviewed with the emphasis on impact of quantum gravity corrections. As a specific example of the quantum corrections, the Grisaru-Zanon quartic curvature terms in the gravitational effective action of closed superstrings are chosen. Those quartic curvature terms are compared to the Bel-Robinson tensor squared in a flat Friedman universe, and the upper bound on the effective string coupling constant is found by demanding unitarity (causality) and the absence of ghosts. It is found that the quantum corrections to the observables (tilts) of the cosmic microwave background radiation in the Starobinsky inflation may be of the same order of magnitude as the next-to-next-to-next classical contributions in the Starobinsky model with respect to the inverse powers of the e-folding number at the horizon crossing.</description>

Abstract: Comparison of the gauge-invariant formulation for $l=0,1$-mode perturbations on the Schwarzschild background spacetime proposed in [K.~Nakamura, Class. Quantum Grav. {\bf 38} (2021), 145010.] and a ``conventional complete gauge-fixing approach'' in which we use the spherical harmonic functions $Y_{lm}$ as the scalar harmonics from the starting point is discussed. Although it is often said that ``gauge-invariant formulations in general-relativistic perturbations are equivalent to complete gauge-fixing approaches,'' as the result of this comparison, we conclude that the derived solutions through the proposed gauge-invariant formulation and those through a ``conventional complete gauge-fixing approach'' are different. It is pointed out that there is a case where the boundary conditions and initial conditions are restricted in a conventional complete gauge-fixing approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the stability of the chameleon screening mechanism in the Brans-Dicke scalar-tensor model. We define a constraint on the Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega_{BD}^*$ identifying two stability groups, $\omega_{BD}&gt;\omega_{BD}^*$ and $0&lt;\omega_{BD}&lt;\omega_{BD}^*$. The first group achieves stability with both appropriate eigenvalues and a density profile consistent with dark energy dominance. The second exhibits eigenvalue stability but contradicts conditions for a stable universe. We explore the impact of variations in the scalar field potential and matter coupling by analyzing different parameter sets. Each unique set of parameters results in a distinct $\omega_{BD}^*$. Dynamic analysis reveals that stability is achieved when the scalar field dominates, highlighting the importance of the kinetic and potential terms while minimizing the influence of matter density. In high matter density regions, the scalar field's negligible presence aligns with standard gravitational behavior, whereas in low matter density regions, the scalar field grows exponentially, driving dark energy and cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scalar mode describing the fluctuation of the 3-brane (the observable universe) in a five-dimensional bulk spacetime compactified on a circle is absorbed by the Kaluza-Klein U(1) gauge field, leading to a massive brane-vector living on the 3-brane. The brane-vector can be responsible for dark matter because it is odd under a $\mathrm{Z}_2$ symmetry, neutral under the Standard Model (SM) symmetries, and couples extremely weak to the SM particles due to its gravitational origin. Interestingly, the brane-vector dark matter could leave particular imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the primordial gravitational waves. Hence, the precise measurements of the CMB and the observations of the primordial gravitational waves generated during the inflation can provide a potential way to probe the extra-dimensions and branes which are the main ingredients of string/M theory.</description>

      <title>Axion-like Particle Effects on Photon Polarization in High-Energy Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review, we present a self-contained introduction to axion-like particles (ALPs) with a particular focus on their effects on photon polarization: both theoretical and phenomenological aspects are discussed. We derive the photon survival probability in the presence of photon--ALP interaction, the corresponding final photon degree of linear polarization, and the polarization angle in a wide energy interval. The presented results can be tested by current and planned missions such as IXPE (already operative), eXTP, XL-Calibur, NGXP, XPP in the X-ray band and like COSI (approved to launch), e-ASTROGAM, and AMEGO in the high-energy range. Specifically, we describe ALP-induced polarization effects on several astrophysical sources, such as galaxy clusters, blazars, and gamma-ray bursts, and we discuss their real detectability. In particular, galaxy clusters appear as very good observational targets in this respect. Moreover, in the very-high-energy (VHE) band, we discuss a peculiar ALP signature in photon polarization, in principle capable of proving the ALP existence. Unfortunately, present technologies cannot detect photon polarization up to such high energies, but the observational capability of the latter ALP signature in the VHE band could represent an interesting challenge for the future. As a matter of fact, the aim of this review is to show new ways to make progress in the physics of ALPs, thanks to their effects on photon polarization, a topic that has aroused less interest in the past, but which is now timely with the advent of many new polarimetric missions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the real-time dynamics of the chiral magnetic effect (CME) at a finite temperature in the (1+1)-dimensional QED, the massive Schwinger model. By introducing a chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$ through a quench process, we drive the system out of equilibrium and analyze the induced vector currents and their evolution over time. The Hamiltonian is modified to include the time-dependent chiral chemical potential, thus allowing the investigation of the CME within a quantum computing framework. We employ the quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm to study the thermal states, and utilize the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition for the real-time evolution. This study provides insights into the quantum simulation capabilities for modeling the CME and offers a pathway for studying chiral dynamics in low-dimensional quantum field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rates of flavor-changing weak processes are crucial in determining the conditions of beta equilibrium in neutron stars and mergers, influencing the damping of oscillations, the stability of rotating pulsars, and the emission of gravitational waves. We derive a formula for these rates at nonzero temperature, to leading order in the Fermi coupling and exact in the QCD coupling. Utilizing a simple phenomenological holographic model dual to QCD, we study massless unpaired quark matter at high densities. We numerically compute the rate for small deviations from beta equilibrium and derive an analytic approximation for small temperatures.

      <title>Relaxation Fluctuations of Correlation Functions: Spin and Random Matrix Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral statistics and correlations are the usual way to study the presence or absence of quantum chaos in quantum systems. We present our investigation on the study of the fluctuation average and variance of certain correlation functions as a diagnostic measure of quantum chaos and to possibly characterize quantum systems based on it. These quantities are related to eigenvector distribution and eigenvector correlation. Using the Random Matrix Theory certain analytical expressions of these quantities, for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble case, were calculated before. So as a first step, we study these quantities for the Gaussian unitary ensemble case numerically, and deduce certain analytical results for the same. We then carry out our investigations in physical system, such as the mixed-field Ising model. For this model, we find that although the eigenvalue statistics follow the behaviour of corresponding random matrices, the fluctuation average and variance of these correlation functions deviate from the expected random matrix theory behaviour. We then turn our focus on the Rosenzweig-Porter model of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble and Gaussian Unitary Ensemble types. By using the fluctuation average and variance of these correlations, we identify the three distinct phases of these models: the ergodic, the fractal, and the localized phases. We provide an alternative way to study and distinguish the three phases and firmly establish the use of these correlation fluctuations as an alternative way to characterize quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Black bounces in Cotton gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, J. Harada proposed a theory relating gravity to the Cotton tensor, dubbed as ''Cotton gravity'' (CG). This is an extension of General Relativity such that every solution of the latter turns out to be a solution of the former (but the converse is not true) and, furthermore, it is possible to derive the cosmological constant as an integration constant within it. In this work we investigate CG by coupling it to both non-linear electrodynamics (NLED) and scalar fields. We study static and spherically symmetric solutions implementing a bouncing behaviour in the radial function so as to avoid the development of singularities, inspired by the Simpson-Visser black bounce and the Bardeen model, both interpreted as magnetic monopoles. We identify the NLED Lagrangian density and the scalar field potential generating such solutions, and investigate the corresponding gravitational configurations in terms of horizons, behaviour of the metric functions, and regularity of the Kretchsman curvature scalar. Our analysis extends the class of non-singular geometries found in the literature and paves the ground for further analysis of black holes in CG.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the $\gamma$-parameter for the vacuum solution of Cotton gravity with geodesics and shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently introduced extension of General Relativity dubbed as Cotton gravity (CG), based on the use of the Cotton tensor, to estimate the size of a new constant $\gamma$ appearing within a spherically symmetric, vacuum solution of the theory. Taking into account its non-asymptotically flat character, we use the inferred size of the central brightness depression of the supermassive object at the heart of the Milky Way galaxy (Sgr A*) by the Event Horizon Telescope to constrain at $2\sigma$ the CG parameter as $\gamma M \approx 3.5 \times 10^{-12}$. We study the potential observational consequences from the smallness of such a value using exact and numerical expressions for the deflection angle, optical images from optically and geometrically thin accretion disks, isoradials, and instability scales (Lyapunov index) of nearly bound geodesics associated to photon rings. Our results point towards the impossibility to distinguish between these two geometries using current and foreseeable techniques in the field of interferometric detection of optical sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A confining extension of the quark model with nonlocal currents is proposed. The quark propagator is modified by introducing a cut in {\alpha}-space, which in momentum space corresponds to the subtraction of pole singularities. A two-phase phase structure is proposed for modeling the confinement-deconfinement phase transition. In the confined phase, the quark propagator does not have any pole singularities, while in the deconfined phase, there is a single quark pole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between symmetries and entanglement in out-of-equilibrium quantum systems is currently at the centre of an intense multidisciplinary research effort. Here we introduce a setting where these questions can be characterised exactly by considering dual-unitary circuits with an arbitrary number of $U(1)$ charges. After providing a complete characterisation of these systems we show that one can introduce a class of solvable states, which extends that of generic dual unitary circuits, for which the non-equilibrium dynamics can be solved exactly. In contrast to the known class of solvable states, which relax to the infinite temperature state, these states relax to a family of non-trivial generalised Gibbs ensembles. The relaxation process of these states can be simply described by a linear growth of the entanglement entropy followed by saturation to a non-maximal value but with maximal entanglement velocity. We then move on to consider the dynamics from non-solvable states, combining exact results with the entanglement membrane picture we argue that the entanglement dynamics from these states is qualitatively different from that of the solvable ones. It shows two different growth regimes characterised by two distinct slopes, both corresponding to sub-maximal entanglement velocities. Moreover, we show that non-solvable initial states can give rise to the quantum Mpemba effect, where less symmetric initial states restore the symmetry faster than more symmetric ones.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a framework for internal topological symmetries in quantum field theory, including "noninvertible symmetries" and "categorical symmetries". This leads to a calculus of topological defects which takes full advantage of well-developed theorems and techniques in topological field theory. Our discussion focuses on finite symmetries, and we give indications for a generalization to other symmetries. We treat quotients and quotient defects (often called "gauging" and "condensation defects"), finite electromagnetic duality, and duality defects, among other topics. We include an appendix on finite homotopy theories, which are often used to encode finite symmetries and for which computations can be carried out using methods of algebraic topology. Throughout we emphasize exposition and examples over a detailed technical treatment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explain why Tseytlin's off-shell formulation of string theory is well-defined. Although quantizing strings on an off-shell background requires an arbitrary choice of Weyl frame, this choice is not physically significant since it can be absorbed into a field redefinition of the target space fields. The off-shell formalism is particularly subtle at tree-level, due to the treatment of the noncompact conformal Killing group SL(2,$\mathbb{C}$) of the sphere. We prove that Tseytlin's sphere prescriptions recover the standard tree-level Lorentzian S-matrix, and show how to extract the stringy $i\varepsilon$ prescription from the UV cutoff on the worldsheet. We also demonstrate that the correct tree-level equations of motion are obtained to all orders in perturbation theory in $g_s$ and $\alpha^{\prime}$, and illuminate the close connection between the string action and the c-theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1994, Susskind and Uglum argued that it is possible to derive the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $A/4G_N$ from string theory. In this article we explain the conceptual underpinnings of this argument, while elucidating its relationship to induced gravity and ER=EPR. Following an off-shell calculation by Tseytlin, we explicitly derive the classical closed string effective action from sphere diagrams at leading order in $\alpha^{\prime}$. We then show how to use this to obtain black hole entropy from the RG flow of the NLSM on conical manifolds. (We also briefly discuss the more problematic ``open string picture'' of Susskind and Uglum, in which strings end on the horizon.) We then compare these off-shell results with the rival ``orbifold replica trick'' using the on-shell $\mathbb{C}/Z_{N}$ background, which does not account for the leading order Bekenstein-Hawking entropy -- unless perhaps tachyons are allowed to condense on the orbifold. Possible connections to the ER=EPR conjecture are explored. Finally, we discuss prospects for various extensions, including prospects for deriving holographic entanglement entropy in the bulk of AdS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel study of Kerr Compton amplitudes in a partial wave basis in terms of the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) function of the confluent Heun equation (CHE). Remarkably, NS-functions enjoy analytic properties and symmetries that are naturally inherited by the Compton amplitudes. Based on this, we characterize the analytic dependence of the Compton phase-shift in the Kerr spin parameter and provide a direct comparison to the standard post-Minkowskian (PM) perturbative approach within General Relativity (GR). We also analyze the universal large frequency behavior of the relevant characteristic exponent of the CHE -- also known as the renormalized angular momentum -- and find agreement with numerical computations. Moreover, we discuss the analytic continuation in the harmonics quantum number $\ell$ of the partial wave, and show that the limit to the physical integer values commutes with the PM expansion of the observables. Finally, we obtain the contributions to the tree level, point-particle, gravitational Compton amplitude in a covariant basis through $O(a_{\text{BH}}^8)$, without the need to take the super-extremal limit for Kerr spin.</description>

Abstract: We present a new vacuum of the bosonic higher-spin gauge theory in $d+1$ dimensions, which has leftover symmetry of the Poincar\'{e} algebra in $d$ dimensions. Its structure is very simple: the space-time geometry is that of $AdS$, while the only nonzero field is a scalar. The scalar extends along the Poincar\'{e} radial coordinate $z$ and is shown to be linearly exact for an arbitrary mixture of its two $\Delta=2$ and $\Delta=d-2$ conformal branches. The obtained vacuum breaks the global higher-spin symmetry leading to a broken phase that lives in the Minkowski space-time.</description>

Abstract: We construct a regular bound state of two extremal black holes in type IIB supergravity with opposite charges. The bound state resembles the Schwarzschild black hole from the asymptotics to the photon ring and has the same mass and charges as the Schwarzschild black hole. On the one hand, we show that the bound-state entropy admits a microscopic description in terms of branes and antibranes in string theory. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the entropy approaches half of the Schwarzschild entropy as the mass becomes significantly larger than the Kaluza-Klein scales used to regularize the geometry. This opens up the possibility of a brane/antibrane interpretation of the Schwarzschild entropy in string theory.</description>

We also discuss projections over string field spaces that might be needed for a consistent off-shell implementation of picture changing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a large class of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ low-energy realizations of the axiverse satisfying various quantum gravity constraints. We propose a novel upper bound on the ultimate UV cutoff of the effective theory, namely the species scale, which only depends on data available at the two-derivative level. Its dependence on the moduli fields and the number $N$ of axions matches expectations from other independent considerations. After an assessment of the regime of validity of the effective field theory, we investigate the non-perturbative gravitational effects therein. We identify a set of axionic charges supported by extremal and non-extremal wormhole configurations. We present a universal class of analytic wormhole solutions, explore their deformations, and analyze the relation between wormhole energy scales and species scale. The connection between these wormholes and a special subclass of BPS fundamental instantons is discussed, and an argument in favor of the genericity of certain axion-dependent effective superpotentials is provided. We find a lower bound increasing with $N\gg 1$ on the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient, resulting in an exponential suppression of non-extremal wormhole effects. Our claims are illustrated and tested in concrete string theory models.</description>

Abstract: We compute the Lyapunov exponents for test particles orbiting in unstable circular trajectories around D-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black holes, scrutinizing instances of the chaos bound violation. Notably, we discover that an increase in particle angular momentum exacerbates the breach of the chaos bound. Our research centrally investigates the correlation between black hole thermodynamic phase transitions and the breaking of the chaos limit. Findings suggest that the chaos bound can only be transgressed within thermodynamically stable phases of black holes. Specifically, in the four-dimensional scenario, the critical point of the thermodynamic phase transition aligns with the threshold condition that delineates the onset of chaos bound violation. These outcomes underscore a deep-rooted link between the thermodynamic stability of black holes and the constraints imposed by the chaos bound on particle dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Schwarzschild black hole can be ``resolved'' into bound states of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in four dimensions. These bound states closely resemble the Schwarzschild geometry from the asymptotic region up to an infinitesimal distance away from the Schwarzschild horizon. Below this scale, the horizon is replaced by novel spacetime structures supported by intense and entrapped electromagnetic flux. The flux originates from collinear black holes that can be brought arbitrarily close to extremality. We find that the charge distribution follows a universal pattern, with magnitudes scaling proportionally to the total mass and alternating in sign. Moreover, the bound states always have an entropy that constitutes a fraction of the Schwarzschild entropy. Constructed in four dimensions, the black holes are kept apart by struts, for which we analyze tensions and energies. These solutions pave the way for analogous constructions in supergravity and for a brane/anti-brane description of the Schwarzschild black hole in string theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of Horndeski theory/ Galileons for late time cosmology is heavily constrained by the strict coincidence in the speed of propagation of gravitational and electromagnetic waves. These constraints presuppose that the minimally coupled photon is not modified, not even at the scales where General Relativity (GR) may need modification. We find that the 4D Galileon obtained from a Kaluza-Klein compactification of its higher dimensional version is a natural simultaneous modification of GR and electromagnetism with automatically "luminal" gravitational waves. This property follows without any fine tuning of Galileon potentials for a larger class of theories than previously thought. In particular, the $G_4$ potential is not constrained by the speed test and $G_5$ may also be present. In other words, some Galileon models that have been ruled out since the event GW170817 are, in fact, not necessarily constrained if they arise in 4D from compactifications of their higher dimensional Galileon counterparts. Besides their compelling luminality, the resulting vector Galileons are naturally $U(1)$ gauge invariant. We also argue that the Vainshtein screening that allows to recover GR predictions for solar system tests is also at work for electrodynamics in the dense region of laboratory tests.</description>

We find that there are the profound interrelations between our deformed partition functions and the $4d$ and $5d$ Nekrasov partition functions. Since the corresponding Nekrasov partition functions can be given by vertex operators, the remarkable connection between our $\beta$ and $(q,t)$-deformed $W$-operators and vertex operators is revealed in this paper. In addition, we investigate the higher Hamiltonians for the generalized Jack and Macdonald polynomials.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy for the Black 0-Brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the entanglement entropy between the Black 0-Brane solution to supergravity and its Hawking radiation. The Black 0-Brane admits a dual Gauge theory description in terms of the Matrix model for M-Theory, named BFSS theory, which is the theory of open strings on a collection of N D0-branes. Recent studies of the model have highlighted a mechanism of Black Hole evaporation for this system, based on the chaotic nature of the theory and the existence of flat directions. This paper further explores this idea, through the computation of the von Neumann entropy of Hawking radiation. In particular, we show that the expected Page curve is indeed reproduced, consistently with a complete recovery of information after the Black Hole has fully evaporated. A pivotal step in the computation is the definition of a Hilbert space which allows for a quantum mechanical description of partially evaporated Black Holes. We find that the entanglement entropy depends on the choice of a parameter, which can be interpreted as summarizing the geometric features of the Black Hole, such as the size of the resolved singularity and the size of the horizon.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of quantum black and white hole horizons in an improved dynamic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14535v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quantum geometric effects near the locations where classical black hole horizons used to appear in Einstein's classical theory, within the framework of an improved dynamic approach, in which the internal region of a black hole is modeled by the Kantowski-Sachs (KS) spacetime and the two polymerization parameters are functions of the phase space variables. Our detailed analysis shows that the effects are so strong that black and white hole horizons of the effective quantum theory do not exist at all and instead are replaced by transition surfaces, across which the metric coefficients and their inverses are smooth and remain finite, as are the corresponding curvatures, including the Kretschmann scalar. These surfaces always separate trapped regions from anti-trapped regions. The number of such surfaces is infinite, so the corresponding KS spacetimes become geodesically complete, and no black and white hole-like structures exist in this scheme.</description>

      <title>Bethe vectors and recurrence relations for twisted Yangian based models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Olshanski twisted Yangian based models, known as one-dimensional "soliton non-preserving" open spin chains, by means of algebraic Bethe ansatz. The even case, when the bulk symmetry is $\mathfrak{gl}_{2n}$ and the boundary symmetry is $\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$ or $\mathfrak{gl}_{2n}$, was studied in arXiv:1710.08409. In the present work, we focus on the odd case, when the bulk symmetry is $\mathfrak{gl}_{2n+1}$ and the boundary symmetry is $\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1}$. We explicitly construct Bethe vectors and present a more symmetric form of the trace formula. We use the composite model approach and $Y(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$-type recurrence relations to obtain recurrence relations for twisted Yangian based Bethe vectors, for both even and odd cases.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Geometry of Collider Observations and Forman Ricci Curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the global and local topological properties of multi-lepton patterns reconstructed at the detectors. We investigate the sensitivity of Forman Ricci curvature distributions and persistent homology features to kinematic cuts, integrated luminosity, and scales of maximum filtration. We find that these topological properties are efficient enough in discriminating the BSM scenarios from the SM background, particularly when the BSM scenarios possess a massive invisible particle. We also find that the topological properties exhibit a scaling behaviour with integrated luminosity. This exploratory study suggests that the topological features can potentially supplement the traditional cut-and-count analyses in search of new physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum loop corrections in the modified gravity model of Starobinsky inflation with primordial black hole production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02934v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A modified gravity model of Starobinsky inflation and primordial black hole production was proposed in good (within $1\sigma$) agreement with current measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The model is an extension of the singularity-free Appleby-Battye-Starobinsky model by the $R^4$-term with different values of the parameters whose fine-tuning leads to efficient production of primordial black holes on smaller scales with the asteroid-size masses between $10^{16}$ g and $10^{20}$ g. Those primordial black holes may be part (or the whole) of the current dark matter, while the proposed model can be confirmed or falsified by detection or absence of the induced gravitational waves with the frequencies about $10^{-2}$ Hz. The main purpose of this paper was to estimate the size of quantum (loop) corrections in the model. It was found their relative contribution to the power spectrum of scalar perturbations is about $10^{-3}$ or less, so that the model is not ruled out by the quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>Stability investigations of de Sitter inflationary solutions in power-law extensions of the Starobinsky model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we would like to examine whether stable de Sitter inflationary solutions appear within power-law extensions of the Starobinsky model. In particular, we will address general constraints for the existence along with the stability of de Sitter inflationary solutions in a general case involving not only the Starobinsky $R^2$ term but also an additional power-law $R^n$ one. According to the obtained results, we will be able to identify which extension is more suitable for an early inflationary phase rather than a late-time cosmic acceleration phase. To be more specific, we will consider several values of $n$ to see whether the corresponding de Sitter inflationary solutions are stable or not.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects on the evaporation of PBHs: contributions to dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the relic abundance of dark matter in the presence of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) beyond the semiclassical approximation. We take into account the quantum corrections due to the memory burden effect, which is assumed to suppress the black hole evaporation rate by the inverse power of its own entropy. Such quantum effect significantly enhances the lifetime, rendering the possibility of PBH mass $\lesssim 10^{9}$ g being the sole dark matter (DM) candidate. However, Nature can not rule out the existence of fundamental particles such as DM. We, therefore, include the possibility of populating the dark sector by the decay of PBHs to those fundamental particles, adding the contribution to stable PBH whose lifetime is extended due to the quantum corrections. Depending on the strength of the burden effect, we show that a wide range of parameter space opens up in the initial PBH mass and fundamental dark matter mass plane that respects the correct relic abundance.</description>

      <title>Mapping Cone Connections and their Yang-Mills Functional</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a given closed two-form, we introduce the cone Yang-Mills functional which is a Yang-Mills-type functional for a pair $(A,B)$, a connection one-form $A$ and a scalar $B$ taking value in the adjoint representation of a Lie group. The functional arises naturally from dimensionally reducing the Yang-Mills functional over the fiber of a circle bundle with the two-form being the Euler class. We write down the Euler-Lagrange equations of the functional and present some of the properties of its critical solutions, especially in comparison with Yang-Mills solutions. We show that a special class of three-dimensional solutions satisfy a duality condition which generalizes the Bogomolny monopole equations. Moreover, we analyze the zero solutions of the cone Yang-Mills functional and give an algebraic classification characterizing principal bundles that carry such cone-flat solutions when the two-form is non-degenerate.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Scalarization of Schwarzschild Black Hole in Scalar-Torsion Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a scalar field coupled to the torsion in Teleparallel Gravity with a coupling function that does not allow for a tachyonic instability to occur, and it leads to the formation of new black holes with scalar hair. The scalarized black hole solutions are asymptotically flat, and they are studied under their thermodynamics, and we show that they are meta-stable solutions without phase transitions of first and second order. Also, we demonstrate the existence of distinct branches of solutions classified by the number of nodes of the scalar field. For the branches analysed, the scalarized solutions have lower free energy than the Schwarzschild black hole; therefore, they are always thermodinamically preferred. Also, we show that the scalarized black holes are entropically favoured compared to the Schwarzschild solution.</description>
