      <title>Enabling Leakage Reduction via Fast and High-Fidelity Qutrit Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is key to operating quantum processors effectively at practical scales. QECs are designed for systems comprising two-level systems, such as qubits, as their fundamental building block. Unfortunately, qubits can leak to third and higher energy levels, making these leaks challenging to detect and mitigate. If not addressed promptly, these leakage errors can proliferate and undermine QEC, leading to significant computational inaccuracies. Here, we present a high-fidelity three-level qubit readout protocol that is simple to implement on dedicated hardware such as FPGAs. Our design enables faster and higher-fidelity leakage detection over approaches using conventional qubit-state discriminators.</description>

      <title>ReDas: A Lightweight Architecture for Supporting Fine-Grained Reshaping and Multiple Dataflows on Systolic Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The systolic accelerator is one of the premier architectural choices for DNN acceleration. However, the conventional systolic architecture suffers from low PE utilization due to the mismatch between the fixed array and diverse DNN workloads. Recent studies have proposed flexible systolic array architectures to adapt to DNN models. However, these designs support only coarse-grained reshaping or significantly increase hardware overhead. In this study, we propose ReDas, a flexible and lightweight systolic array that supports dynamic fine-grained reshaping and multiple dataflows. First, ReDas integrates lightweight and reconfigurable roundabout data paths, which achieve fine-grained reshaping using only short connections between adjacent PEs. Second, we redesign the PE microarchitecture and integrate a set of multi-mode data buffers around the array. The PE structure enables additional data bypassing and flexible data switching. Simultaneously, the multi-mode buffers facilitate fine-grained reallocation of on-chip memory resources, adapting to various dataflow requirements. ReDas can dynamically reconfigure to up to 129 different logical shapes and 3 dataflows for a 128x128 array. Finally, we propose an efficient mapper to generate appropriate configurations for each layer of DNN workloads. Compared to the conventional systolic array, ReDas can achieve about 4.6x speedup and 8.3x energy-delay product (EDP) reduction.</description>

      <title>Towards Sustainable Low Carbon Emission Mini Data Centres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mini data centres have become increasingly prevalent in diverse organizations in recent years. They can be easily deployed at large scale, with high resilience. They are also cost-effective and provide highsecurity protection. On the other hand, IT technologies have resulted in the development of ever more energy-efficient servers, leading to the periodic replacement of older-generation servers in mini data centres. However, the disposal of older servers has resulted in electronic waste that further aggravates the already critical e-waste problem. Furthermore, despite the shift towards more energy-efficient servers, many mini data centres still rely heavily on high-carbon energy sources. This contributes to data centres' overall carbon footprint. All these issues are concerns for sustainability. In order to address this sustainability issue, this paper proposes an approach to extend the lifespan of older-generation servers in mini data centres. This is made possible thanks to a novel solar-powered computing technology, named Genesis, that compensates for the energy overhead generated by older servers. As a result, electronic waste can be reduced while improving system sustainability by reusing functional server hardware. Moreover, Genesis does not require server cooling, which reduces energy and water requirements. Analytical reasoning is applied to compare the efficiency of typical conventional mini data centre designs against alternative Genesis-based designs, in terms of energy, carbon emissions and exploitation costs.</description>
