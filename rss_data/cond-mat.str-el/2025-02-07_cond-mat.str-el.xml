      <title>Non-commutative effective field theory of the lowest Landau level superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 2+1D superfluid in a rapidly rotating trap forms an array of vortices, with collective excitations called Tkachenko modes. Du et al. (2024) argued from an effective field theory viewpoint that these excitations are described by a field theory living on a non-commutative space. We elucidate the microscopic origin of these non-commutative fields, and present a novel derivation of the effective field theory for this superfluid using a lowest Landau level projected coherent state path integral approach. Besides conceptual clarity, this approach makes quantitative predictions about the long-wavelength, low-energy behavior in terms of the microscopic parameters of the weakly interacting lowest Landau level superfluid -- relevant to trapped Bose-Einstein condensate experiments.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of 3D and quasi-2D Fermi surfaces driven by orbital selective Kondo scattering in UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 3D Fermi surface, along with a chiral in-gap state and a Majorana zero energy state, is suggested to play a crucial role in the topologically nontrivial superconductivity in UTe$_2$. However, conflicting experimental observations of the 2D Fermi surface raise questions about topological superconductivity. By combining ab initio many-body perturbation GW theory and dynamical mean-field theory based on Feynman diagrams, we discovered the coexistence of two orbital dependent Fermi surfaces, both centered at the $\Gamma$ point in the Brillouin zone, which are heavily influenced by the orbital-selective Kondo effect. At high temperature, both Fermi surfaces exhibit 3D nature with weak spectral weight due to incoherent Kondo hybridization. Upon cooling down to 25 K, due to the pronounced Kondo coherence, while one Fermi surface remains a robust 3D Fermi surface, the other transforms surprisingly into a quasi-2D Fermi surface, which should be responsible for the experimental observation of 2D character. Our results suggest that the 3D Fermi surface should exist at low temperature for the topological superconductivity. Our findings call for further investigation of the interplay between the two orbital-dependent $\Gamma$-centered Fermi surfaces.</description>

      <title>Out-of-phase Plasmon Excitations in the Trilayer Cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within a homologous series of cuprate superconductors, variations in the stacking of CuO$_2$ layers influence the collective charge dynamics through the long-range Coulomb interactions. We use O $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering to reveal plasmon excitations in the optimally-doped trilayer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$. The observed plasmon exhibits nearly $q_z$-independent dispersion and a large excitation gap of approximately 300 meV. This mode is primarily ascribed to the $\omega_{-}$ mode, where the charge density on the outer CuO$_2$ sheets oscillates out of phase while the density in the inner sheet remains unaltered at $q_z=0$. The intensity of the acoustic $\omega_3$ mode is relatively weak and becomes vanishingly small near $(q_x, q_y)=(0, 0)$. This result highlights a qualitative change in the eigenmode of the dominant low-energy plasmon with the number of CuO$_2$ layers.</description>

      <title>Raman signature of multiple phase transitions and quasi-particle excitations in putative Kitaev spin liquid candidate Na2Co2TeO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional cobalt-based honeycomb oxide Na2Co2TeO6 is an important candidate for the realization of Kitaev physics and may provide future platform for the quantum computation and quantum technology. Here, we report an in-depth temperature as well as polarization dependent inelastic light scattering (Raman) measurements on the single crystals of quasi-two-dimensional Na2Co2TeO6. Our study reveal signature of multiple phase transitions i.e. long-range zigzag antiferromagnetic transition (TN) at ~ 30 K, ferroelectric transition (TFE) at ~ 70 K, and a crossover from pure paramagnetic phase to a quantum paramagnetic phase around ~ 150 K reflected in the renormalized self-energy parameters of the Raman active phonon modes. A distinct signature of spin reorientation deep into the AFM phase around TSR ~ 17 K is observed, marked by the clear change in the frequency and linewidth slopes. We also observed an asymmetric phonon mode in the low frequency region, and it appears below the transition temperature ~ 50 K, attributed to the magnetic excitations other than the magnon. The Raman signature of multiple crystal-field excitations at low temperature along with lifting of the Kramers degeneracy is also observed. Signature of the underlying broad magnetic continuum in the quantum paramagnetic phase and its temperature dependence suggest presence of frustrated magnetic interaction in the quantum paramagnetic phase below ~ 150 K.</description>

      <title>Search for Stable States in Two-Body Excitations of the Hubbard Model on the Honeycomb Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present one- and two-body measurements for the Hubbard model on the honeycomb (graphene) lattice from ab-initio quantum monte carlo simulations. Of particular interest is excitons, which are particle/hole excitations in low-dimensional systems. They are analogous to the pion in QCD, but without confinement, the question of whether they are bound and stable is of great interest in the condensed matter arena. By measuring one- and two-body correlators across various spin and isospin channels we can compute two-body energies relative to their thresholds, ultimately allowing us to check for stable states.</description>

      <title>An inelastic neutron scattering study of the magnetic field dependence of the quantum dipolar garnet: Yb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The garnet compound Yb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ is a fascinating material that is considered highly suitable for low-temperature refrigeration, via the magnetocaloric effect, in addition to enabling the exploration of quantum states with long-range dipolar interactions. It has previously been theorized that the magnetocaloric effect can be enhanced, in Yb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ , via magnetic soft mode excitations which in the hyperkagome structure would be derived from an emergent magnetic structure formed from nanosized 10-spin loops. We study the magnetic field dependence of bands of magnetic soft mode excitations in the effective spin $S = 1/2$ hyperkagome compound Yb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ using single crystal inelastic neutron scattering. We probe the magnetically short ranged ordered state, in which we determine magnetic nanoscale structures coexisting with a fluctuating state, and the magnetically saturated state. We determine that Yb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ can be described as a quantum dipolar magnet with perturbative weak near-neighbor and inter-hyperkagome exchange interaction. The magnetic excitations, under the application of a magnetic field, reveal highly robust soft modes with distinctive signatures of the quantum nature of the Yb3+ spins. Our results enhance our understanding of soft modes in topological frustrated magnets that drive both the unusual physics of quantum dipolar systems and future refrigerant material design.</description>

      <title>Continuously varying critical exponents in an exactly solvable long-range cluster XY mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a generalized antiferromagnetic cluster XY model in a transverse magnetic field, where long-range interactions decay algebraically with distance. This model can be exactly solvable within a free fermion framework. By analyzing the gap, we explicitly derive the critical exponents $\nu$ and $z$, finding that the relationship $\nu z = 1$ still holds. However, the values of $\nu$ and $z$ depend on the decaying exponent $\alpha$, in contrast to those for the quantum long-range antiferromagnetic Ising chain. To optimize scaling behavior, we verify these critical exponents using correlation functions and fidelity susceptibility, achieving excellent data collapse across various system sizes by adjusting fitting parameters. Finally, we compute the entanglement entropy at the critical point to determine the central charge $c$, and find it also varies with $\alpha$. This study provides insights into the unique effect of long-range cluster interactions on the critical properties of quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Pressure suppresses the density wave order in kagome metal LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dancing tins pair up,
  But compressing the framework
  Thwarts the displacements.
  The density waves that develop in kagome metals ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ and LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$ at low temperature appear to arise from under-filled atomic columns within a V-Sn or Nb-Sn scaffolding. Compressing this network with applied pressure in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ suppressed the structural transition temperature by constraining atomic rattling and inhibiting the shifts that define the structural modulation. We predicted that the density wave transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$ at 68 K would be suppressed by pressure as well. In this brief study we examine the pressure dependence of the density wave transition by remeasuring resistance vs temperature up to 2.26 GPa. We found the transition temperature is smoothly depressed and disappears around 1.9 GPa. This result not only addresses our prediction, but strengthens the rattling chains origin of structural instabilities in the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Elasto-Hall conductivity and the anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets break time-reversal symmetry, preserve the crystal translation invariance, and have a spin density with $d$-wave, $g$-wave, etc. momentum dependencies which do not contribute to the magnetization. When an $s$-wave spin-density contribution cannot be excluded by symmetry a small magnetization and an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) emerge. However, for so-called "pure" altermagnets, where the $s$-wave component is symmetry forbidden even in the presence of SOC, both the zero-field magnetization and the AHE vanish. We show that altermagnets generally exhibit a non-zero elasto-Hall-conductivity, by which application of strain leads to a non-zero AHE. For pure altermagnets it is the only contribution to the AHE. This elasto-Hall-conductivity is caused by strain coupling to the Berry curvature quadrupole that characterizes altermagnets and allows for the determination of the altermagnetic order using transport measurements that are linear in the electrical field. We further show that the emergence of a non-zero magnetization in the presence of strain arises from a different response function: piezomagnetism. While this magnetization gives rise to an additional contribution to the elasto-Hall conductivity, the corresponding Berry curvature is qualitatively different from the distorted Berry curvature quadrupole originating from the altermagnetic order parameter. This insight also helps to disentangle AHE and weak ferromagnetism for systems with symmetry-allowed $s$-wave contribution. Quantitatively, the elasto-Hall conductivity is particularly pronounced for systems with a Dirac spectrum in the altermagnetic state. The same mechanism gives rise to anomalous elasto-thermal Hall, Nernst, and Ettinghausen effects.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to Analog Preparation of Non-Equilibrium Quantum Lakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamical preparation of exotic many-body quantum states is a persistent goal of analog quantum simulation, often limited by experimental coherence times. Recently, it was shown that fast, non-adiabatic Hamiltonian parameter sweeps can create finite-size ``lakes'' of quantum order in certain settings, independent of what is present in the ground state phase diagram. Here, we show that going further out of equilibrium via external driving can substantially accelerate the preparation of these quantum lakes. Concretely, when lakes can be prepared, existing counterdiabatic driving techniques -- originally designed to target the ground state -- instead naturally target the lakes state. We demonstrate this both for an illustrative single qutrit and a model of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Rydberg quantum spin liquid. In the latter case, we construct experimental drive sequences that accelerate preparation by almost an order of magnitude at fixed laser power. We conclude by using a Landau-Ginzburg model to provide a semi-classical picture for how our method accelerates state preparation.</description>

      <title>Generic Hilbert Space Fragmentation in Kogut--Susskind Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the heart of quantum many-body physics lies the understanding of mechanisms that avoid quantum thermalization in an isolated system quenched far from equilibrium. A prominent example is Hilbert space fragmentation, which has recently emerged as an ergodicity-breaking mechanism in constrained spin models. Here, we show that Kogut--Susskind formulations of lattice gauge theories in $d+1$D ($d$ spatial and one temporal dimensions) give rise to Hilbert space fragmentation, and discuss possible implications for understanding continuum physics. Our findings not only prove that lattice gauge theories are a natural platform for Hilbert space fragmentation, they also serve as a guide to the conditions under which these models can be faithfully used to infer the thermalization properties of quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Many-body non-Hermitian skin effect with exact steady states in dissipative lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dissipative lattice gauge model that exhibits the many-body version of the non-Hermitian skin effect. The dissipative couplings between dynamical gauge fields on the lattice links and the surrounding environment generate chiral motions of particles residing on lattice sites. Although the system involves many-body interactions, the local gauge symmetries offer a flexible approach to exactly constructing the steady state that demonstrates the many-body non-Hermitian skin effect. Furthermore, our approach can be generalized to realize a new type of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect, dubbed the hierarchical skin effect, where different subsystem degrees of freedom exhibit boundary accumulation of multiple moments at different orders. Our findings can be readily observed by engineering dissipation in state-of-the-art lattice gauge simulators.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Dynamics on Near-Term Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of quantum dynamics are a key application of near term quantum computing, but are hindered by the twin challenges of noise and small device scale, which limit the executable circuit depths and the number of qubits the algorithm can be run on. Towards overcoming these obstacles we develop and implement a distributed variant of the projected Variational Quantum Dynamics which we dub dp-VQD, which allows to simultaneously alleviate circuit depth and width limitations. We employ the wire cutting technique, which can be executed on the existing devices without quantum or classical communication. We demonstrate the full variational training on noisy simulators, and execute and perform the reconstruction on real IBM quantum devices. The algorithm allows to execute Hamiltonian evolution simulations for problem sizes exceeding devices' nominal qubit counts, and to combine multiple small devices in a distributed computation. We test our approach on the Heisenberg and Hubbard model dynamics.</description>

      <title>Page Curve and Entanglement Dynamics in an Interacting Fermionic Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generic non-equilibrium many-body systems display a linear growth of bipartite entanglement entropy in time, followed by a volume law saturation. In stark contrast, the Page curve dynamics of black hole physics shows that the entropy peaks at the Page time $t_{\text{Page}}$ and then decreases to zero. Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von Neumann entropy in a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions in a typical system-environment setup, and characterize the properties of the Page curve dynamics in the presence of interactions using numerically exact matrix product states methods. The two phases of growth, namely the linear growth and the bending down, are shown to be separated by a non-analyticity in the min-entropy before $t_{\text{Page}}$, which separates two different quantum phases, realized as the respective ground states of the corresponding entanglement (or equivalently, modular) Hamiltonian. We confirm and generalize, by introducing interactions, the findings of \href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.224308}{Phys. Rev. B 109, 224308 (2024)} for a free spinless fermionic chain where the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonian undergoes a quantum phase transition at the point of non-analyticity. However, in the presence of interactions, a scaling analysis gives a non-zero critical time for the non-analyticity in the thermodynamic limit only for weak to intermediate interaction strengths, while the dynamics leading to the non-analyticity becomes \textit{instantaneous} for interactions large enough. We present a physical picture explaining these findings.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-breaking induced surface magnetization in non-magnetic RuO$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a newly identified phase of magnetism distinct from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. RuO$_2$ has been considered a prototypical metallic altermagnet with a critical temperature higher than room temperature. Previous interpretations of the unusual magnetic properties of RuO$_2$ relied on the theoretical prediction that local moments on two Ru sublattices, which are connected by four-fold rotational symmetry, are quite significant (approximately 1 $\mu_B$), leading to long-range antiferromagnetic order. However, accumulated experimental data suggest that local moments on Ru in RuO$_2$ are vanishingly small, indicating that the bulk material is likely non-magnetic. This observation is consistent with the delocalized nature of the 4$d$ electrons of Ru and the strong screening effect in the metallic state. In this work, we show that despite the non-magnetic bulk, the RuO$_2$(110) surface exhibits spontaneous magnetization. We attribute this effect to the breaking of local symmetry, which results in electronic redistribution and magnetic moment enhancement. The emergence of surface magnetism gives rise to interesting spectroscopic phenomena, including spin-polarized surface states, spin-polarized scanning probe microscopy images, and potentially spin-dependent transport effects. These findings highlight the important role of surface magnetic structures in the otherwise non-magnetic bulk RuO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Oxygen sublattice disorder and valence state modulation in infinite-layer nickelate superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The family of infinite-layer nickelates promises important insights into the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity. Since superconductivity has so far only been observed in epitaxial thin films, heteroepitaxy with the substrate or a capping layer possibly plays an important role. Here, we use soft x-ray spectroscopy to investigate superlattices as a potential approach for a targeted material design of high-temperature superconductors. We observe modulations in valence state and oxygen coordination in topotactically reduced artificial superlattices with repeating interfaces between nickelate layers and layers of materials commonly used as substrates and capping layers. Our results show that depending on the interlayer material metallic conductivity akin to the parent infinite-layer compounds is achieved. Depth-resolved electronic structure measured by resonant x-ray reflectivity reveals a reconstructed ligand field and valence state at the interface, which is confined to one or two unit cells. The central layers show characteristics of monovalent nickel, but linear dichroism analysis reveals considerable disorder in the oxygen removal sites. We observe a quantitative correlation of this disorder with the interlayer material that is important for future modeling and design strategies.</description>

      <title>Exploring Group Convolutional Networks for Sign Problem Mitigation via Contour Deformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sign problem that arises in Hybrid Monte Carlo calculations can be mitigated by deforming the integration manifold. While simple transformations are highly efficient for simulation, their efficacy systematically decreases with decreasing temperature and increasing interaction. Machine learning models have demonstrated the ability to push further, but require additional computational effort and upfront training. While neural networks possess the capacity to learn physical symmetries through proper training, there are anticipated advantages associated with encoding them into the network's structure. These include enhanced accuracy, accelerated training, and improved stability. The objective of the present study is twofold. First, we investigate the benefits of group convolutional models in comparison to fully connected networks, with a specific focus on the effects on the sign problem and on computational aspects. Second, we examine their capabilities for transfer learning, demonstrating the ability to further reduce training cost. We perform our investigations on the Hubbard model on select low-dimensional systems.</description>

Abstract: Coupled-cluster and Green's function theories are highly successful in treating many-body electron correlation and there has been significant interest in identifying and leveraging connections between them. Here we present a diagrammatic definition of the irreducible coupled-cluster self-energy that directly embeds coupled-cluster theory within the framework of many-body field theory. The EOM-CC treatment emerges naturally from our definition via the Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations, providing a unified description of RPA, $GW$-BSE and CC theory for ground state and excitation energies. This clarifies the origin of previously established connections between RPA, $GW$-BSE and coupled-cluster theory, and exposes the relationship between vertex corrections and the coupled-cluster amplitude equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study the impact of light-driven structural changes via nonlinear phononics on the magnetic order of untwisted bilayer van der Waals materials. We consider an illustrative example of the AA-stacked bilayer honeycomb lattice and show that high-intensity light in resonance with selected phonons induces large amplitude phonon displacements that modify the magnetic Hamiltonian of the system. We performed a group theory analysis to identify the vibrational modes of the honeycomb bilayer and the nonlinear couplings among them in the strongly driven regime. We find that the structural changes in the strongly driven regime lower the symmetry relative to the equilibrium lattice and produce changes in the magnetic interactions between the local moments. In particular, the lattice symmetry changes permit a non-zero interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that induces a magnetic state with canted local moments. Using a spin-wave analysis about the new magnetic configuration we study the corresponding changes in the magnon spectrum and identify a protocol for engineering topological band transitions using a combination of nonlinear phononics and an external magnetic field. Our work suggests a strategy to induce and control interlayer Dyzaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a class of layered van der Waals materials, the effect of which is to modify the magnetic ground state, magnon dispersions, and related band geometric properties, including topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Correlation Effects in a Simplified Bilayer Two-Orbital Hubbard Model at Half Filling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, we investigate the ground-state phase diagram and correlation effects using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations in a simplified bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model at half filling. Our results reveal the emergence of a nonmagnetic weakly insulating phase at weak on-site Hubbard interactions, transitioning to an antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase as the interaction strength exceeds a critical value $U/t_1^x\approx 4.15$. This phase transition is consistent with the 3D O(3) Heisenberg universality class. Additionally, we analyze dynamical properties such as the single-particle spectral function and dynamic spin structure factor. The pronounced inter-layer correlation of $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals results in a downward trend and an extended flatness in the $\gamma$ band, mirroring the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy findings under ambient pressure. Our numerical results provide important clues for understanding the strong correlation effects in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Self-organised magnon condensation in quasi-1D edge-shared cuprates without external fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimagnon bound states were predicted nearly a century ago and have since been a key topic in condensed matter physics due to their intriguing quantum properties. However, their realization in natural materials remains elusive, especially in low-dimensional quantum magnets, where stabilizing them is particularly challenging due to the traditionally required extreme external magnetic fields. Therefore, we introduce a novel mechanism that enables the stabilization of multimagnon bound states in quasi-one-dimensional edge-shared cuprates. Our theoretical framework, supported by numerical simulations and experimental data, demonstrates that small antiferromagnetic interchain couplings act as effective internal magnetic fields, promoting a collinear antiferromagnetic order and enabling magnon condensation even at zero external field. This intrinsic stabilisation mechanism eliminates the need for high external fields, offering a platform that is more accessible for experimental realization. We validate this concept by applying it to representative materials such as Li$_2$CuO$_2$, Ca$_2$Y$_2$Cu$5$O$_{10}$, LiCuSbO$_4$, and PbCuSO$_4$(OH)$_2$. Beyond its experimental feasibility, this mechanism could drive advancements in magnon-based quantum computing, low-power spintronic devices, and high-speed magnonic circuits. Moreover, our findings reveal that small interchain and/or interlayer couplings can generally unlock previously overlooked magnetic phenomena, redefining the nature of magnetically ordered states and expanding the frontiers of quantum magnetism.</description>

      <title>Hallmarks of Spin Textures for High-Harmonic Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling and quantum geometry are fundamental aspects in modern condensed matter physics, with their primary manifestations in momentum space being spin textures and Berry curvature. In this work, we investigate their interplay with high-harmonic generation (HHG) in two-dimensional non-centrosymmetric materials, with an emphasis on even-order harmonics. Our analysis reveals that the emergence of finite even-order harmonics necessarily requires a broken twofold rotational symmetry in the spin texture, as well as a non-trivial Berry curvature in systems with time-reversal invariance. This symmetry breaking can arise across various degrees of freedom and impact both spin textures and optical response via spin-orbit interactions. These findings underscore the potential of HHG as a powerful tool for exploring electronic phases with broken rotational symmetry, as well as the associated phase transitions in two-dimensional materials. This approach provides novel perspectives for designing symmetry-dependent nonlinear optical phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Teleportation of quantum information over long distances requires robust entanglement on the macroscopic scale. The construction of highly energetic eigenstates with tunable long-range entanglement can provide a new medium for information transmission. Using a symmetric superposition of the antipodal triplet states, we construct polynomially many exact zero-energy eigenstates for a class of non-integrable spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with two-body interactions. These states exhibit non-thermal correlations, and by tuning the distribution of triplets we induce extensive, logarithmic, or area-law entanglement. Quasiparticle excitations in this manifold converge to be exact quantum many-body scars in the thermodynamic limit. This framework has a natural extension to higher dimensions, where entangled states controlled by lattice geometry and internal symmetries can result in new classes of correlated out-of-equilibrium quantum matter. Our results provide a new avenue for entanglement control and quantum state constructions.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical dynamics of N\'eel vector and magnetization accompanied by THz and high-harmonic radiation from ultrafast-light-driven NiO antiferromagnet insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast-light-driven strongly correlated antiferromagnetic insulators, such as prototypical NiO with large energy gap 4 eV, have recently attracted experimental attention using either above-gap [K. Gillmeister et al., Nat. Commun. 11, 4095 (2020)] or subgap [H. Qiu et al., Nat. Phys. 17, 388 (2021)] energy photons that are of fundamental interest in far-from-equilibrium quantum matter or spintronic applications, respectively. In the latter context, emission of THz radiation is also observed from NiO/Pt bilayers, where heavy metal (HM) Pt introduces strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, microscopic mechanisms of such emission remain obscure because spintronic THz emitters have been amply studied using FM/HM (FM-ferromagnetic metal of conventional type) bilayers, where ultrafast demagnetization takes place and is directly related to THz emission. Conversely, in NiO total magnetization is zero prior to the fs laser pulse (fsLP) application. Here we employ the two-orbital Hubbard-Hund-Heisenberg model and study, via numerically exact nonequilibrium quantum many-body methods, the dynamics of its Neel vector and nonequilibrium magnetization. Additionally, we compute electromagnetic radiation by both time-dependent magnetization and local charge currents arising in either plain NiO or NiO with proximity SOC introduced by HM layer. Our analysis reveals nonclassical dynamics of Neel vector and nonequilibrium magnetization, changing only in length while not rotating, where the former is substantially reduced only in the case above-gap fsLP. In the plain NiO case, THz radiation of interest to applications is insignificant, but adding SOC enhances both current and magnetic dipole contributions to it. Above THz range, we find integer high-harmonic generation, as well as unusual noninteger harmonics for above-gap fsLP pump.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Quantum Advantage of Trotterized MERA for Strongly-Correlated Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems are difficult to study and simulate classically. We recently proposed a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based on the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) with tensors constrained to certain Trotter circuits. Here, we determine the scaling of computation costs for various critical spin chains which substantiates a polynomial quantum advantage in comparison to classical MERA simulations based on exact energy gradients or variational Monte Carlo. Algorithmic phase diagrams suggest an even greater separation for higher-dimensional systems. Hence, the Trotterized MERA VQE is a promising route for the efficient investigation of strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems on quantum computers. Furthermore, we show how the convergence can be substantially improved by building up the MERA layer by layer in the initialization stage and by scanning through the phase diagram during optimization. For the Trotter circuits being composed of single-qubit and two-qubit rotations, it is experimentally advantageous to have small rotation angles. We find that the average angle amplitude can be reduced considerably with negligible effect on the energy accuracy. Benchmark simulations suggest that the structure of the Trotter circuits for the TMERA tensors is not decisive; in particular, brick-wall circuits and parallel random-pair circuits yield very similar energy accuracies.</description>

Abstract: In this Letter, we report first exact volume-entangled Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen--type scar states hosted by PXP and related Hamiltonians corresponding to various geometric configurations of Rydberg-blockaded atom systems, including the most extensively studied ones such as the chain with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) and square lattice. We start by introducing a new zero-energy eigenstate of the PBC chain and proceed by generalizing it to a wide variety of geometries and Hamiltonians. We point out the potential experimental relevance of our states by providing a protocol for their preparation on near-term Rydberg quantum devices, which relies only on strictly local measurements and evolution under native Hamiltonians. We also demonstrate the utility of these states for the study of quantum dynamics by describing a protocol for measuring infinite-temperature out-of-time-order correlator functions.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnetism, a kind of collinear magnetism that is characterized by a momentum-dependent band and spin splitting without net magnetization, has recently attracted considerable interest. Finding altermagnetic materials with large splitting near the Fermi level necessarily requires three-dimensional k-space mapping. While this is crucial for spintronic applications and emergent phenomena, it remains challenging. Here, using synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), spin-resolved ARPES and model calculations, we uncover a large altermagnetic splitting, up to ~1.0 eV, near the Fermi level in CrSb. We verify its bulk-type g-wave altermagnetism through systematic three-dimensional k-space mapping, which unambiguously reveals the altermagnetic symmetry and associated nodal planes. Spin-resolved ARPES measurements further verify the spin polarizations of the split bands near Fermi level. Tight-binding model analysis indicates that the large altermagnetic splitting arises from strong third-nearest-neighbor hopping mediated by Sb ions. The large band/spin splitting near Fermi level in metallic CrSb, together with its high TN (up to 705 K) and simple spin configuration, paves the way for exploring emergent phenomena and spintronic applications based on altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum chaos through singular-value correlations in sparse non-Hermitian SYK model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing singular value decomposition, our investigation focuses on the spectrum of the singular values within a sparse non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Unlike the complex eigenvalues typical of non-Hermitian systems, singular values are inherently real and positive. Our findings reveal a congruence between the statistics of singular values and those of the analogous Hermitian Gaussian ensembles. An increase in sparsity results in the non-Hermitian SYK model deviating from its chaotic behavior, a phenomenon precisely captured by the singular value ratios. Our analysis of the singular form factor ({\upsigma}FF), analogous to the spectral form factor (SFF) indicates the disappearance of the linear ramp with increased sparsity. Additionally, we define singular complexity, inspired by the spectral complexity in Hermitian systems, whose saturation provides a critical threshold of sparseness. Such disintegration is likely associated with the breakdown of the existing holographic dual for non-Hermitian systems.</description>

Abstract: Fractonic superfluids are featured by the interplay of spontaneously broken charge symmetry and mobility constraints on single-particle kinematics due to the conservation of higher moments, such as dipoles, angular charge moments, and quadrupoles. Building on prior studies by Yuan et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023267 (2020)] and Chen et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 3, 013226 (2021)], we study a class of fractonic superfluids, termed \textit{hybrid fractonic superfluids} (HFS), in which bosons of multiple species interact while moment hybridization is conserved. We explore the consequences of hybridization via two model series: \textit{Model Series A}, conserving total moments of the same order across species, and \textit{Model Series B}, conserving total moments of different orders. In Model Series A, we analyze dipole moment hybridization and extend the discussion to higher-order moments, examining the ground state, Goldstone modes, correlation functions, and so on. We compute the minimal spatial dimensions, where the total charge symmetry begins to get partially broken via particle-hole condensation, leading to true off-diagonal long-range order. In Model Series B, we focus on HFS with hybrid dipole-quadrupole conservation. For both series, we introduce Bose-Hubbard-type lattice models that reduce to either of both series in the weak Hubbard interaction regime. We perform a mean-field analysis on the global phase diagram and discuss experimental realizations in strongly tilted optical lattices via a third-order perturbation theory. This work, alongside prior studies, completes a trilogy on fractonic superfluids, uncovering symmetry-breaking physics emerging from higher moment conservation, leaving various promising studies for future investigation.</description>
