      <title>Application of Machine Learning and Convex Limiting to Subgrid Flux Modeling in the Shallow-Water Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a combination of machine learning and flux limiting for property-preserving subgrid scale modeling in the context of flux-limited finite volume methods for the one-dimensional shallow-water equations. The numerical fluxes of a conservative target scheme are fitted to the coarse-mesh averages of a monotone fine-grid discretization using a neural network to parametrize the subgrid scale components. To ensure positivity preservation and the validity of local maximum principles, we use a flux limiter that constrains the intermediate states of an equivalent fluctuation form to stay in a convex admissible set. The results of our numerical studies confirm that the proposed combination of machine learning with monolithic convex limiting produces meaningful closures even in scenarios for which the network was not trained.</description>

      <title>Numerical evaluation of orientation averages and its application to molecular physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In molecular physics, it is often necessary to average over the orientation of molecules when calculating observables, in particular when modelling experiments in the liquid or gas phase. Evaluated in terms of Euler angles, this is closely related to integration over two- or three-dimensional unit spheres, a common problem discussed in numerical analysis. The computational cost of the integration depends significantly on the quadrature method, making the selection of an appropriate method crucial for the feasibility of simulations. After reviewing several classes of spherical quadrature methods in terms of their efficiency and error distribution, we derive guidelines for choosing the best quadrature method for orientation averages and illustrate these with three examples from chiral molecule physics. While Gauss quadratures allow for achieving numerically exact integration for a wide range of applications, other methods offer advantages in specific circumstances. Our guidelines can also by applied to higher-dimensional spherical domains and other geometries. We also present a Python package providing a flexible interface to a variety of quadrature methods.</description>

      <title>Dispersion Characteristics of a Glide-Symmetric Square Patch Metamaterial with Giant Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dispersion characteristics of a highly anisotropic metamaterial comprised of metal square patches arranged in a glide symmetry pattern and submerged in vacuum. Theoretical formulas are proposed to describe the electromagnetic tensors of a corresponding uniaxial effective medium with dielectric and magnetic responses. In addition, this work employs theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to examine the interaction between the metamaterial and electromagnetic waves across a broad spectral range. Band diagrams and isofrequency contours show good agreement between theoretical and numerical results for low frequencies and certain directions of propagation at higher frequencies. The ease of designing the metamaterial structure for various applications is facilitated by the derived theoretical formulas, which enable accurate prediction of the electromagnetic response across a wide range of frequencies based on geometric parameters.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Polaritonic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polaritons, arising from the strong coupling between excitons and photons within microcavities, hold promise for optoelectronic and all-optical devices. They have found applications in various domains, including low-threshold lasers and quantum information processing. To realize complex functionalities, non-intuitive designs for polaritonic devices are required. In this contribution, we use finite-difference time-domain simulations of the dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation, written in a differentiable manner, and combine it with an adjoint formulation. Such a method allows us to use topology optimization to engineer the potential landscape experienced by polariton condensates to tailor its characteristics on demand. The potential directly translates to a blueprint for a functional device, and various fabrication and optical control techniques can experimentally realize it. We inverse-design a selection of polaritonic devices, i.e., a structure that spatially shapes the polaritons into a flat-top distribution, a metalens that focuses a polariton, and a nonlinearly activated isolator. The functionalities are preserved when employing realistic fabrication constraints such as minimum feature size and discretization of the potential. Our results demonstrate the utility of inverse design techniques for polaritonic devices, providing a stepping stone toward future research in optimizing systems with complex light-matter interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active particles under soft confinement such as droplets or vesicles present intriguing phenomena, as collective motion emerges alongside the deformation of the environment. A model is employed to systematically investigate droplet morphology and particle distribution in relation to activity and concentration,revealing that active particles have the capacity to induce enhanced shape fluctuations in the droplet interface with respect to the thermal fluctuations, aligning with recent experimental observations. A rich phase behaviour can be identified with two different mechanism of droplet breakage.</description>

      <title>The case for adopting the sequential Jacobi's diagonalization algorithm in neutrino oscillation physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino flavor oscillations and conversion in the presence of an interacting background may offer the missing evidence for charge-parity violation in the leptonic sector of the Standard Model, as well as yet undiscovered new interactions. The usual approach for simulating these effects is by numerically integrating the Schrodinger equation over the neutrino trajectory, arriving at the conversion and survival probabilities for each flavor. From these, the neutrino mixing matrix and its parameters are recovered. This work makes the case for a different numerical approach, which starts by recognizing how Jacobi's diagonalization algorithm is the most suitable for neutrino oscillations in general. By switching from physical space to a parameter space of choice, Jacobi's algorithm results in both eigenvalues and eigenvectors simultaneously, with only local round-off errors. This approach is trivially parallelizable, making it a suitable choice for concurrent computation. Moreover, the freedom to build a parameter space allows for quasi-model-independent solutions, which in turn eliminates the necessity of repeating the simulation for every change in the model's parameters. Benchmarks and efficiency analyses are discussed, as well as a concrete neutrino oscillation example.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-PFC: coupling the phase-field crystal model and its amplitude-equation formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase-field crystal (PFC) model describes crystal structures at diffusive timescales through a periodic, microscopic density field. It has been proposed to model elasticity in crystal growth and encodes most of the phenomenology related to the mechanical properties of crystals like dislocation nucleation and motion, grain boundaries, and elastic or interface-energy anisotropies. To overcome limitations to small systems, a coarse-grained formulation focusing on slowly varying complex amplitudes of the microscopic density field has been devised. This amplitude-PFC (APFC) model describes well elasticity and dislocations while approximating microscopic features and being limited in describing large-angle grain boundaries. We present here seminal concepts for a hybrid multiscale PFC-APFC framework that combines the coarse-grained description of the APFC model in bulk-like crystallites while exploiting PFC resolution at dislocations, grain boundaries, and interfaces or surfaces. This is achieved by coupling the two models via an advanced discretization based on the Fourier spectral method and allowing for local solution updates. This discretization also generalizes the description of boundary conditions for PFC models. We showcase the framework capabilities through two-dimensional benchmark simulations. We also show that the proposed formulation allows for overcoming the limitations of the APFC model in describing large-angle grain boundaries.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of alkali feldspar solid solutions with varying Al-Si order: atomistic simulations using a neural network potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamic mixing properties of alkali feldspar solid solutions between the Na and K end members were computed through atomistic simulations using a neural network potential. We performed combined molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations in the semi-grand canonical ensemble at 800 {\deg}C and considered three quenched disorder states in the Al-Si-O framework ranging from fully ordered to fully disordered. The excess Gibbs energy of mixing, excess enthalpy of mixing and excess entropy of mixing are in good agreement with literature data. In particular, the notion that increasing disorder in the Al-Si-O framework correlates with increasing ideality of Na-K mixing is successfully predicted. Finally, a recently proposed short range ordering of Na and K in the alkali sublattice is observed, which may be considered as a precursor to exsolution lamellae, a characteristic phenomenon in alkali feldspar of intermediate composition leading to perthite formation during cooling.</description>

      <title>$\Phi$-DVAE: Physics-Informed Dynamical Variational Autoencoders for Unstructured Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating unstructured data into physical models is a challenging problem that is emerging in data assimilation. Traditional approaches focus on well-defined observation operators whose functional forms are typically assumed to be known. This prevents these methods from achieving a consistent model-data synthesis in configurations where the mapping from data-space to model-space is unknown. To address these shortcomings, in this paper we develop a physics-informed dynamical variational autoencoder ($\Phi$-DVAE) to embed diverse data streams into time-evolving physical systems described by differential equations. Our approach combines a standard, possibly nonlinear, filter for the latent state-space model and a VAE, to assimilate the unstructured data into the latent dynamical system. Unstructured data, in our example systems, comes in the form of video data and velocity field measurements, however the methodology is suitably generic to allow for arbitrary unknown observation operators. A variational Bayesian framework is used for the joint estimation of the encoding, latent states, and unknown system parameters. To demonstrate the method, we provide case studies with the Lorenz-63 ordinary differential equation, and the advection and Korteweg-de Vries partial differential equations. Our results, with synthetic data, show that $\Phi$-DVAE provides a data efficient dynamics encoding methodology which is competitive with standard approaches. Unknown parameters are recovered with uncertainty quantification, and unseen data are accurately predicted.</description>

      <title>Fourier-MIONet: Fourier-enhanced multiple-input neural operators for multiphase modeling of geological carbon sequestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geologic carbon sequestration (GCS) is a safety-critical technology that aims to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which also places high demands on reliability. Multiphase flow in porous media is essential to understand CO$_2$ migration and pressure fields in the subsurface associated with GCS. However, numerical simulation for such problems in 4D is computationally challenging and expensive, due to the multiphysics and multiscale nature of the highly nonlinear governing partial differential equations (PDEs). It prevents us from considering multiple subsurface scenarios and conducting real-time optimization. Here, we develop a Fourier-enhanced multiple-input neural operator (Fourier-MIONet) to learn the solution operator of the problem of multiphase flow in porous media. Fourier-MIONet utilizes the recently developed framework of the multiple-input deep neural operators (MIONet) and incorporates the Fourier neural operator (FNO) in the network architecture. Once Fourier-MIONet is trained, it can predict the evolution of saturation and pressure of the multiphase flow under various reservoir conditions, such as permeability and porosity heterogeneity, anisotropy, injection configurations, and multiphase flow properties. Compared to the enhanced FNO (U-FNO), the proposed Fourier-MIONet has 90% fewer unknown parameters, and it can be trained in significantly less time (about 3.5 times faster) with much lower CPU memory ($&lt;$ 15%) and GPU memory ($&lt;$ 35%) requirements, to achieve similar prediction accuracy. In addition to the lower computational cost, Fourier-MIONet can be trained with only 6 snapshots of time to predict the PDE solutions for 30 years. The excellent generalizability of Fourier-MIONet is enabled by its adherence to the physical principle that the solution to a PDE is continuous over time.</description>

      <title>Minimum tracking linear response Hubbard and Hund corrected Density Functional Theory in CP2K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the implementation of the Hubbard ($U$) and Hund ($J$) corrected Density Functional Theory (DFT+$U$+$J$) functionality in the Quickstep program, which is part of the CP2K suite. The tensorial and L\"owdin subspace representations are implemented and compared. Full analytical DFT+$U$+$J$ forces are implemented and benchmarked for the tensorial and L\"owdin representations. We also present the implementation of the recently proposed minimum-tracking linear-response method that enables the $U$ and $J$ parameters to be calculated on first principles basis without reference to the Kohn-Sham eigensystem. These implementations are benchmarked against recent results for different materials properties including DFT+$U$ band gap opening in NiO, the relative stability of various polaron distributions in TiO$_2$, the dependence of the calculated TiO$_2$ band gap on +$J$ corrections, and, finally, the role of the +$U$ and +$J$ corrections for the computed properties of a series of the hexahydrated transition metals. Our implementation provides results consistent with those already reported in the literature from comparable methods. We conclude the contribution with tests on the influence of the L\"owdin orthonormalization on the occupancies, calculated parameters, and derived properties.</description>
