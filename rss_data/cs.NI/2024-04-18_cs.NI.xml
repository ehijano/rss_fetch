      <title>Image Generative Semantic Communication with Multi-Modal Similarity Estimation for Resource-Limited Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reduce network traffic and support environments with limited resources, a method for transmitting images with low amounts of transmission data is required. Machine learning-based image compression methods, which compress the data size of images while maintaining their features, have been proposed. However, in certain situations, reconstructing a part of semantic information of images at the receiver end may be sufficient. To realize this concept, semantic-information-based communication, called semantic communication, has been proposed, along with an image transmission method using semantic communication. This method transmits only the semantic information of an image, and the receiver reconstructs the image using an image-generation model. This method utilizes one type of semantic information, but reconstructing images similar to the original image using only it is challenging. This study proposes a multi-modal image transmission method that leverages diverse semantic information for efficient semantic communication. The proposed method extracts multi-modal semantic information from an image and transmits only it. Subsequently, the receiver generates multiple images using an image-generation model and selects an output based on semantic similarity. The receiver must select the output based only on the received features; however, evaluating semantic similarity using conventional metrics is challenging. Therefore, this study explored new metrics to evaluate the similarity between semantic features of images and proposes two scoring procedures. The results indicate that the proposed procedures can compare semantic similarities, such as position and composition, between semantic features of the original and generated images. Thus, the proposed method can facilitate the transmission and utilization of photographs through mobile networks for various service applications.</description>

      <title>What-if Analysis Framework for Digital Twins in 6G Wireless Network Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores implementing a digital twin network (DTN) for efficient 6G wireless network management, aligning with the fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security (FCAPS) model. The DTN architecture comprises the Physical Twin Layer, implemented using NS-3, and the Service Layer, featuring machine learning and reinforcement learning for optimizing carrier sensitivity threshold and transmit power control in wireless networks. We introduce a robust "What-if Analysis" module, utilizing conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN) for synthetic data generation to mimic various network scenarios. These scenarios assess four network performance metrics: throughput, latency, packet loss, and coverage. Our findings demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed what-if analysis framework in managing complex network conditions, highlighting the importance of the scenario-maker step and the impact of twinning intervals on network performance.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Edge Hardware for Intelligent IDS: Systematic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are crucial security measures nowadays to enforce network security. Their task is to detect anomalies in network communication and identify, if not thwart, possibly malicious behavior. Recently, machine learning has been deployed to construct intelligent IDS. This approach, however, is quite challenging particularly in distributed, highly dynamic, yet resource-constrained systems like Edge setups. In this paper, we tackle this issue from multiple angles by analyzing the concept of intelligent IDS (I-IDS) while addressing the specific requirements of Edge devices with a special focus on reconfigurability. Then, we introduce a systematic approach to constructing the I-IDS on reconfigurable Edge hardware. For this, we implemented our proposed IDS on state-of-the-art Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) technology as (1) a purely FPGA-based dataflow processor (DFP) and (2) a co-designed approach featuring RISC-V soft-core as FPGA-based soft-core processor (SCP). We complete our paper with a comparison of the state of the art (SoA) in this domain. The results show that DFP and SCP are both suitable for Edge applications from hardware resource and energy efficiency perspectives. Our proposed DFP solution clearly outperforms the SoA and demonstrates that required high performance can be achieved without prohibitively high hardware costs. This makes our proposed DFP suitable for Edge-based high-speed applications like modern communication technology.</description>

      <title>Top-k Multi-Armed Bandit Learning for Content Dissemination in Swarms of Micro-UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In communication-deprived disaster scenarios, this paper introduces a Micro-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)- enhanced content management system. In the absence of cellular infrastructure, this system deploys a hybrid network of stationary and mobile UAVs to offer vital content access to isolated communities. Static anchor UAVs equipped with both vertical and lateral links cater to local users, while agile micro-ferrying UAVs, equipped with lateral links and greater mobility, reach users in various communities. The primary goal is to devise an adaptive content dissemination system that dynamically learns caching policies to maximize content accessibility. The paper proposes a decentralized Top-k Multi-Armed Bandit (Top-k MAB) learning approach for UAV caching decisions, accommodating geotemporal disparities in content popularity and diverse content demands. The proposed mechanism involves a Selective Caching Algorithm that algorithmically reduces redundant copies of the contents by leveraging the shared information between the UAVs. It is demonstrated that Top-k MAB learning, along with selective caching algorithm, can improve system performance while making the learning process adaptive. The paper does functional verification and performance evaluation of the proposed caching framework under a wide range of network size, swarm of micro-ferrying UAVs, and heterogeneous popularity distributions.</description>

      <title>Approximate Wireless Communication for Lossy Gradient Updates in IoT Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a distributed machine learning (ML) technique that can protect local data privacy for participating clients and improve system efficiency. Instead of sharing raw data, FL exchanges intermediate learning parameters, such as gradients, among clients. This article presents an efficient wireless communication approach tailored for FL parameter transmission, especially for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, to facilitate model aggregation. Our study considers practical wireless channels that can lead to random bit errors, which can substantially affect FL performance. Motivated by empirical gradient value distribution, we introduce a novel received bit masking method that confines received gradient values within prescribed limits. Moreover, given the intrinsic error resilience of ML gradients, our approach enables the delivery of approximate gradient values with errors without resorting to extensive error correction coding or retransmission. This strategy reduces computational overhead at both the transmitter and the receiver and minimizes communication latency. Consequently, our scheme is particularly well-suited for resource-constrained IoT devices. Additionally, we explore the inherent protection of the most significant bits (MSBs) through gray coding in high-order modulation. Our simulations demonstrate that our proposed scheme can effectively mitigate random bit errors in FL performance, achieving similar learning objectives, but with the 50% air time required by existing methods involving error correction and retransmission.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of RIS-assisted Networks with HQAM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the application of hexagonal quadrature amplitude modulation (HQAM) in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted networks, specifically focusing on its efficiency in reducing the number of required reflecting elements. Specifically, we present analytical expressions for the average symbol error probability (ASEP) and propose a new metric for conditioned energy efficiency, which assesses the network energy consumption while ensuring the ASEP remains below a certain threshold. Additionally, we introduce an innovative detection algorithm for HQAM constellations that implements sphere decoding in O(1) complexity. Finally, our study reveals that HQAM significantly enhances both the ASEP and energy efficiency compared to traditional quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes.</description>

      <title>SERENE: A Collusion Resilient Replication-based Verification Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology is accompanied by substantial challenges, particularly the reliance on remote task execution without ensuring a reliable and accurate returned results. This reliance on external compute servers, which may be malicious or rogue, represents a major security threat. While researchers have been exploring verifiable computing, and replication-based task verification as a simple, fast, and dependable method to assess the correctness of results. However, colluding malicious workers can easily defeat this method. Existing collusion detection and mitigation solutions often require the use of a trusted third party server or verified tasks which may be hard to guarantee, or solutions that assume the presence of a minority of colluding servers. We propose SERENE a collusion resilient replication-based verification framework that detects, and mitigates colluding workers. Unlike state-of-the-art solutions, SERENE uses a lightweight detection algorithm that detects collusion based on a single verification task. Mitigation requires a two stage process to group the workers and identifying colluding from honest workers. We implement and compare SERENE's performance to Staab et. al, resulting in an average of 50\% and 60\% accuracy improvement in detection and mitigation accuracy respectively.</description>

      <title>AROW: V2X-based Automated Right-of-Way Algorithm for Cooperative Intersection Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research in Cooperative Intersection Management (CIM), utilizing Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication among Connected and/or Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), is crucial for enhancing intersection safety and driving experience. CAVs can transceive basic and/or advanced safety information, thereby improving situational awareness at intersections. The focus of this study is on unsignalized intersections, particularly Stop Controlled-Intersections (SC-Is), where one of the main reasons involving crashes is the ambiguity among CAVs in SC-I crossing priority upon arriving at similar time intervals. Numerous studies have been performed on CIM for unsignalized intersections based on centralized and distributed systems in the presence and absence of Road-Side Unit (RSU), respectively. However, most of these studies are focused towards replacing SC-I where the scheduler provides spatio-temporal or sequence-based reservation to CAVs, or where it controls CAVs via kinematic commands. These methods cause CAVs to arrive at the intersection at non-conflicting times and cross without stopping. This logic is severely limited in real-world mixed traffic comprising human drivers where kinematic commands and other reservations cannot be implemented as intended. Thus, given the existence of SC-Is and mixed traffic, it is significant to develop CIM systems incorporating SC-I rules while assigning crossing priorities and resolving the related ambiguity. In this regard, we propose a distributed Automated Right-of-Way (AROW) algorithm for CIM to assign explicit SC-I crossing turns to CAVs and mitigate hazardous scenarios due to ambiguity towards crossing priority. The algorithm is validated with extensive experiments for its functionality, scalability, and robustness towards CAV non-compliance, and it outperforms the current solutions.</description>

      <title>Cost Minimization in Multi-cloud Systems with Runtime Microservice Re-orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-cloud systems facilitate a cost-efficient and geographically-distributed deployment of microservice-based applications by temporary leasing virtual nodes with diverse pricing models. To preserve the cost-efficiency of multi-cloud deployments, it is essential to redeploy microservices onto the available nodes according to a dynamic resource configuration, which is often performed to better accommodate workload variations. However, this approach leads to frequent service disruption since applications are continuously shutdown and redeployed in order to apply the new resource assignment. To overcome this issue, we propose a re-orchestration scheme that migrates microservice at runtime based on a rolling update scheduling logic. Specifically, we propose an integer linear optimization problem that minimizes the cost associated to multi-cloud virtual nodes and that ensures that delay-sensitive microservices are co-located on the same regional cluster. The resulting rescheduling order guarantees no service disruption by repacking microservices between the available nodes without the need to turn off the outdated microservice instance before redeploying the updated version. In addition, we propose a two-step heuristic scheme that effectively approximates the optimal solution at the expense of close-to-zero service disruption and QoS violation probability. Results show that proposed schemes achieve better performance in terms of cost mitigation, low service disruption and low QoS violation probability compared to baseline schemes replicating Kubernetes scheduler functionalities.</description>

      <title>Off-Path TCP Hijacking in Wi-Fi Networks: A Packet-Size Side Channel Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12716v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we unveil a fundamental side channel in Wi-Fi networks, specifically the observable frame size, which can be exploited by attackers to conduct TCP hijacking attacks. Despite the various security mechanisms (e.g., WEP and WPA2/WPA3) implemented to safeguard Wi-Fi networks, our study reveals that an off path attacker can still extract sufficient information from the frame size side channel to hijack the victim's TCP connection. Our side channel attack is based on two significant findings: (i) response packets (e.g., ACK and RST) generated by TCP receivers vary in size, and (ii) the encrypted frames containing these response packets have consistent and distinguishable sizes. By observing the size of the victim's encrypted frames, the attacker can detect and hijack the victim's TCP connections. We validate the effectiveness of this side channel attack through two case studies, i.e., SSH DoS and web traffic manipulation. Precisely, our attack can terminate the victim's SSH session in 19 seconds and inject malicious data into the victim's web traffic within 28 seconds. Furthermore, we conduct extensive measurements to evaluate the impact of our attack on real-world Wi-Fi networks. We test 30 popular wireless routers from 9 well-known vendors, and none of these routers can protect victims from our attack. Besides, we implement our attack in 80 real-world Wi-Fi networks and successfully hijack the victim's TCP connections in 75 (93.75%) evaluated Wi-Fi networks. We have responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to the Wi-Fi Alliance and proposed several mitigation strategies to address this issue.</description>

      <title>ESFL: Efficient Split Federated Learning over Resource-Constrained Heterogeneous Wireless Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple parties (distributed devices) to train a machine learning model without sharing raw data. How to effectively and efficiently utilize the resources on devices and the central server is a highly interesting yet challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an efficient split federated learning algorithm (ESFL) to take full advantage of the powerful computing capabilities at a central server under a split federated learning framework with heterogeneous end devices (EDs). By splitting the model into different submodels between the server and EDs, our approach jointly optimizes user-side workload and server-side computing resource allocation by considering users' heterogeneity. We formulate the whole optimization problem as a mixed-integer non-linear program, which is an NP-hard problem, and develop an iterative approach to obtain an approximate solution efficiently. Extensive simulations have been conducted to validate the significantly increased efficiency of our ESFL approach compared with standard federated learning, split learning, and splitfed learning.</description>
