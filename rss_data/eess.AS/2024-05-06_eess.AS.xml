      <title>Converting Anyone's Voice: End-to-End Expressive Voice Conversion with a Conditional Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expressive voice conversion (VC) conducts speaker identity conversion for emotional speakers by jointly converting speaker identity and emotional style. Emotional style modeling for arbitrary speakers in expressive VC has not been extensively explored. Previous approaches have relied on vocoders for speech reconstruction, which makes speech quality heavily dependent on the performance of vocoders. A major challenge of expressive VC lies in emotion prosody modeling. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a fully end-to-end expressive VC framework based on a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). We utilize speech units derived from self-supervised speech models as content conditioning, along with deep features extracted from speech emotion recognition and speaker verification systems to model emotional style and speaker identity. Objective and subjective evaluations show the effectiveness of our framework. Codes and samples are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Real-time multichannel deep speech enhancement in hearing aids: Comparing monaural and binaural processing in complex acoustic scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has the potential to enhance speech signals and increase their intelligibility for users of hearing aids. Deep models suited for real-world application should feature a low computational complexity and low processing delay of only a few milliseconds. In this paper, we explore deep speech enhancement that matches these requirements and contrast monaural and binaural processing algorithms in two complex acoustic scenes. Both algorithms are evaluated with objective metrics and in experiments with hearing-impaired listeners performing a speech-in-noise test. Results are compared to two traditional enhancement strategies, i.e., adaptive differential microphone processing and binaural beamforming. While in diffuse noise, all algorithms perform similarly, the binaural deep learning approach performs best in the presence of spatial interferers. Through a post-analysis, this can be attributed to improvements at low SNRs and to precise spatial filtering.</description>

      <title>TIPAA-SSL: Text Independent Phone-to-Audio Alignment based on Self-Supervised Learning and Knowledge Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach for text independent phone-to-audio alignment based on phoneme recognition, representation learning and knowledge transfer. Our method leverages a self-supervised model (wav2vec2) fine-tuned for phoneme recognition using a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss, a dimension reduction model and a frame-level phoneme classifier trained thanks to forced-alignment labels (using Montreal Forced Aligner) to produce multi-lingual phonetic representations, thus requiring minimal additional training. We evaluate our model using synthetic native data from the TIMIT dataset and the SCRIBE dataset for American and British English, respectively. Our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art (charsiu) in statistical metrics and has applications in language learning and speech processing systems. We leave experiments on other languages for future work but the design of the system makes it easily adaptable to other languages.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel convolutional neural networks (CNN) framework tailored for end-to-end audio deep learning models, presenting advancements in efficiency and explainability. By benchmarking experiments on three standard speech emotion recognition datasets with five-fold cross-validation, our framework outperforms Mel spectrogram features by up to seven percent. It can potentially replace the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) while remaining lightweight. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficiency and interpretability of the front-end layer using the PhysioNet Heart Sound Database, illustrating its ability to handle and capture intricate long waveform patterns. Our contributions offer a portable solution for building efficient and interpretable models for raw waveform data.</description>

      <title>Joint sentiment analysis of lyrics and audio in music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sentiment or mood can express themselves on various levels in music. In automatic analysis, the actual audio data is usually analyzed, but the lyrics can also play a crucial role in the perception of moods. We first evaluate various models for sentiment analysis based on lyrics and audio separately. The corresponding approaches already show satisfactory results, but they also exhibit weaknesses, the causes of which we examine in more detail. Furthermore, different approaches to combining the audio and lyrics results are proposed and evaluated. Considering both modalities generally leads to improved performance. We investigate misclassifications and (also intentional) contradictions between audio and lyrics sentiment more closely, and identify possible causes. Finally, we address fundamental problems in this research area, such as high subjectivity, lack of data, and inconsistency in emotion taxonomies.</description>

      <title>Can We Identify Unknown Audio Recording Environments in Forensic Scenarios?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio recordings may provide important evidence in criminal investigations. One such case is the forensic association of the recorded audio to the recording location. For example, a voice message may be the only investigative cue to narrow down the candidate sites for a crime. Up to now, several works provide tools for closed-set recording environment classification under relatively clean recording conditions. However, in forensic investigations, the candidate locations are case-specific. Thus, closed-set tools are not applicable without retraining on a sufficient amount of training samples for each case and respective candidate set. In addition, a forensic tool has to deal with audio material from uncontrolled sources with variable properties and quality.
  In this work, we therefore attempt a major step towards practical forensic application scenarios. We propose a representation learning framework called EnvId, short for environment identification. EnvId avoids case-specific retraining. Instead, it is the first tool for robust few-shot classification of unseen environment locations. We demonstrate that EnvId can handle forensically challenging material. It provides good quality predictions even under unseen signal degradations, environment characteristics or recording position mismatches.
  Our code and datasets will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Potential of LLM-Based ASR on Chinese Open-Source Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated unparalleled effectiveness in various NLP tasks, and integrating LLMs with automatic speech recognition is becoming a mainstream paradigm. Building upon this momentum, our research delves into an indepth examination of this paradigm on a large opensource Chinese dataset. Specifically, our research aims to evaluate the impact of various configurations of speech encoders, LLMs, and projector modules in the context of the speech foundation encoderLLM ASR paradigm. Furthermore, we introduce a threestage training approach, expressly developed to enhance the model's ability to align auditory and textual information. The implementation of this approach, alongside the strategic integration of ASR components, enabled us to achieve the SOTA performance on the AISHELL1, TestNet, and TestMeeting test sets. Our analysis presents an empirical foundation for future research in LLMbased ASR systems and offers insights into optimizing performance using Chinese datasets. We will publicly release all scripts used for data preparation, training, inference, and scoring, as well as pretrained models and training logs to promote reproducible research.</description>

      <title>GMP-ATL: Gender-augmented Multi-scale Pseudo-label Enhanced Adaptive Transfer Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition via HuBERT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous evolution of pre-trained speech models has greatly advanced Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). However, there is still potential for enhancement in the performance of these methods. In this paper, we present GMP-ATL (Gender-augmented Multi-scale Pseudo-label Adaptive Transfer Learning), a novel HuBERT-based adaptive transfer learning framework for SER. Specifically, GMP-ATL initially employs the pre-trained HuBERT, implementing multi-task learning and multi-scale k-means clustering to acquire frame-level gender-augmented multi-scale pseudo-labels. Then, to fully leverage both obtained frame-level and utterance-level emotion labels, we incorporate model retraining and fine-tuning methods to further optimize GMP-ATL. Experiments on IEMOCAP show that our GMP-ATL achieves superior recognition performance, with a WAR of 80.0\% and a UAR of 82.0\%, surpassing state-of-the-art unimodal SER methods, while also yielding comparable results with multimodal SER approaches.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Deepfake Voice Recognition by Leveraging Large-Scale Pre-Trained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalization is a main issue for current audio deepfake detectors, which struggle to provide reliable results on out-of-distribution data. Given the speed at which more and more accurate synthesis methods are developed, it is very important to design techniques that work well also on data they were not trained for.In this paper we study the potential of large-scale pre-trained models for audio deepfake detection, with special focus on generalization ability. To this end, the detection problem is reformulated in a speaker verification framework and fake audios are exposed by the mismatch between the voice sample under test and the voice of the claimed identity. With this paradigm, no fake speech sample is necessary in training, cutting off any link with the generation method at the root, and ensuring full generalization ability. Features are extracted by general-purpose large pre-trained models, with no need for training or fine-tuning on specific fake detection or speaker verification datasets. At detection time only a limited set of voice fragments of the identity under test is required. Experiments on several datasets widespread in the community show that detectors based on pre-trained models achieve excellent performance and show strong generalization ability, rivaling supervised methods on in-distribution data and largely overcoming them on out-of-distribution data.</description>

      <title>Point to the Hidden: Exposing Speech Audio Splicing via Signal Pointer Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05641v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verifying the integrity of voice recording evidence for criminal investigations is an integral part of an audio forensic analyst's work. Here, one focus is on detecting deletion or insertion operations, so called audio splicing. While this is a rather easy approach to alter spoken statements, careful editing can yield quite convincing results. For difficult cases or big amounts of data, automated tools can support in detecting potential editing locations. To this end, several analytical and deep learning methods have been proposed by now. Still, few address unconstrained splicing scenarios as expected in practice. With SigPointer, we propose a pointer network framework for continuous input that uncovers splice locations naturally and more efficiently than existing works. Extensive experiments on forensically challenging data like strongly compressed and noisy signals quantify the benefit of the pointer mechanism with performance increases between about 6 to 10 percentage points.</description>

      <title>Towards Unconstrained Audio Splicing Detection and Localization with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14682v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Freely available and easy-to-use audio editing tools make it straightforward to perform audio splicing. Convincing forgeries can be created by combining various speech samples from the same person. Detection of such splices is important both in the public sector when considering misinformation, and in a legal context to verify the integrity of evidence. Unfortunately, most existing detection algorithms for audio splicing use handcrafted features and make specific assumptions. However, criminal investigators are often faced with audio samples from unconstrained sources with unknown characteristics, which raises the need for more generally applicable methods.
  With this work, we aim to take a first step towards unconstrained audio splicing detection to address this need. We simulate various attack scenarios in the form of post-processing operations that may disguise splicing. We propose a Transformer sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) network for splicing detection and localization. Our extensive evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms existing dedicated approaches for splicing detection [3, 10] as well as the general-purpose networks EfficientNet [28] and RegNet [25].</description>

      <title>SelfVC: Voice Conversion With Iterative Refinement using Self Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose SelfVC, a training strategy to iteratively improve a voice conversion model with self-synthesized examples. Previous efforts on voice conversion focus on factorizing speech into explicitly disentangled representations that separately encode speaker characteristics and linguistic content. However, disentangling speech representations to capture such attributes using task-specific loss terms can lead to information loss. In this work, instead of explicitly disentangling attributes with loss terms, we present a framework to train a controllable voice conversion model on entangled speech representations derived from self-supervised learning (SSL) and speaker verification models. First, we develop techniques to derive prosodic information from the audio signal and SSL representations to train predictive submodules in the synthesis model. Next, we propose a training strategy to iteratively improve the synthesis model for voice conversion, by creating a challenging training objective using self-synthesized examples. We demonstrate that incorporating such self-synthesized examples during training improves the speaker similarity of generated speech as compared to a baseline voice conversion model trained solely on heuristically perturbed inputs. Our framework is trained without any text and achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot voice conversion on metrics evaluating naturalness, speaker similarity, and intelligibility of synthesized audio.</description>

      <title>Stateful Conformer with Cache-based Inference for Streaming Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate streaming speech recognition model based on the FastConformer architecture. We adapted the FastConformer architecture for streaming applications through: (1) constraining both the look-ahead and past contexts in the encoder, and (2) introducing an activation caching mechanism to enable the non-autoregressive encoder to operate autoregressively during inference. The proposed model is thoughtfully designed in a way to eliminate the accuracy disparity between the train and inference time which is common for many streaming models. Furthermore, our proposed encoder works with various decoder configurations including Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and RNN-Transducer (RNNT) decoders. Additionally, we introduced a hybrid CTC/RNNT architecture which utilizes a shared encoder with both a CTC and RNNT decoder to boost the accuracy and save computation. We evaluate the proposed model on LibriSpeech dataset and a multi-domain large scale dataset and demonstrate that it can achieve better accuracy with lower latency and inference time compared to a conventional buffered streaming model baseline. We also showed that training a model with multiple latencies can achieve better accuracy than single latency models while it enables us to support multiple latencies with a single model. Our experiments also showed the hybrid architecture would not only speedup the convergence of the CTC decoder but also improves the accuracy of streaming models compared to single decoder models.</description>
