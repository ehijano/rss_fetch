      <title>Quantized Skeletal Learning (QSL): A Differentiable Programming Approach for Skeletal Reduction of Chemical Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven approach, referred to as Quantized Skeletal Learning (QSL), for generating skeletal mechanisms. The approach has two key components: (1) a weight vector that can be used to eliminate relatively unimportant species and reactions, and (2) an end-to-end differentiable program whose loss-function gradients, with respect to the weight vector, can be used to adjust those weights. To promote sparsity in the weight vector -- and to reduce the influence of certain reactions or species to zero -- an $l_1$-regularized objective is employed alongside the standard mean squared error loss, thus removing the least important components. The proposed QSL approach is validated by generating skeletal mechanisms for methane and ethylene based on the GRI 3.0 and USC II mechanisms, respectively, demonstrating effectiveness in deriving skeletal mechanisms with various levels of fidelity. Two variants of QSL, designated as QSL-R and QSL-S, are tested; these focus on eliminating reactions and species, respectively. Analysis of ignition delay times and species mass fractions demonstrate QSL's capabilities to reliably and efficiently extract data-driven skeletal mechanisms of varying fidelities from detailed mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Shadow Molecular Dynamics for Flexible Multipole Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shadow molecular dynamics provide an efficient and stable atomistic simulation framework for flexible charge models with long-range electrostatic interactions. While previous implementations have been limited to atomic monopole charge distributions, we extend this approach to flexible multipole models. We derive detailed expressions for the shadow energy functions, potentials, and force terms, explicitly incorporating monopole-monopole, dipole-monopole, and dipole-dipole interactions. In our formulation, both atomic monopoles and atomic dipoles are treated as extended dynamical variables alongside the propagation of the nuclear degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that introducing the additional dipole degrees of freedom preserves the stability and accuracy previously seen in monopole-only shadow molecular dynamics simulations. Additionally, we present a shadow molecular dynamics scheme where the monopole charges are held fixed while the dipoles remain flexible. Our extended shadow dynamics provide a framework for stable, computationally efficient, and versatile molecular dynamics simulations involving long-range interactions between flexible multipoles. This is of particular interest in combination with modern artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, which are increasingly used to develop physics-informed and data-driven foundation models for atomistic simulations. These models aim to provide transferable, high-accuracy representations of atomic interactions that are applicable across diverse sets of molecular systems, which requires accurate treatment of long-range charge interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of our semi-empirical irregular dipole-moment functions (2022) and (2025) to predict the intensities of the yet unobserved lines, as well as to describe the observed ones not used in the fitting, is demonstrated by comparison with recent measurements in the 0-0, 1-0, 3-0, and 7-0 bands.</description>

      <title>Herman-Kluk-Like Semi-Classical Initial-Value Representation for Boltzmann Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent-state initial-value representation (IVR) for the semi-classical real-time propagator of a quantum system, developed by Herman and Kluk (HK), is widely used in computational studies of chemical dynamics. On the other hand, the Boltzmann operator $e^{-\hat{H}/(k_B T)}$, with $\hat{H}$,$k_B$, and $T$ representing the Hamiltonian, Boltzmann constant, and temperature, respectively, plays a crucial role in chemical physics and other branches of quantum physics. One might naturally assume that a semi-classical IVR for the matrix element of this operator in the coordinate representation (i.e., $ \langle \tilde{x} | e^{-\hat{H}/(k_B T)} | x \rangle$, or the imaginary-time propagator) could be derived via a straightforward ``real-time $\rightarrow$ imaginary-time transformation'' from the HK IVR of the real-time propagator. However, this is not the case, as such a transformation results in a divergence in the high-temperature limit $(T \rightarrow \infty)$. In this work, we solve this problem and develop a reasonable HK-like semi-classical IVR for $\langle \tilde{x} | e^{-\hat{H}/(k_B T)} | x \rangle$, specifically for systems where the gradient of the potential energy (i.e., the force intensity) has a finite upper bound. The integrand in this IVR is a real Gaussian function of the positions $x$ and $\tilde{x}$, which facilitates its application to realistic problems. Our HK-like IVR is exact for free particles and harmonic oscillators, and its effectiveness for other systems is demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Ehrenfest Dynamics with Topological and Geometric Phase Effects and the curious case of Elliptical intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive computational framework for simulating nonadiabatic molecular dynamics with explicit inclusion of geometric phase (GP) effects. Our approach is based on a generalized two-level Hamiltonian model that can represent various electronic state crossings - conical intersections, avoided crossings, and elliptic intersections - through appropriate parameterization. We introduce a novel prelooping trajectory initialization scheme, allowing us to encode the memory as an initial phase accumulated due to the adiabatic evolution over the potential energy surface. This is a unified framework to handle different types of level crossings by incorporating Berry curvature-based force corrections to Ehrenfest dynamics, ensuring accurate representation of topological effects. For conical intersections, our method incorporates the theoretically expected phase pi, while for elliptic intersections, it yields a parametrically tunable but loop radius (energy) independent phase different from pi. We also include an eccentricity parameter (e) in the diabatic coupling to model more realistic molecular systems. Numerical simulations demonstrate the consistency of our approach with theoretical predictions for mixing of states and inhibition from mixing due to geometric phase effects. This framework provides a valuable tool for studying quantum-classical interactions in molecular systems where geometric phase effects play a significant role. The elliptical intersection and geometric phase effect opens avenue for the design and discovery of degenerate materials. It produces a fresh look to help develop a new kind of spectroscopy and potential qubit applications. This simple Hamiltonian reveals a pathological phase protection effect E = kr, where k is real, that has great utility in a new spectroscopy design.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of Molecular Kernels: When Richer Features Do Not Guarantee Better Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the spectral properties of kernels offers a principled perspective on generalization and representation quality. While deep models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in molecular property prediction, kernel methods remain widely used for their robustness in low-data regimes and transparent theoretical grounding. Despite extensive studies of kernel spectra in machine learning, systematic spectral analyses of molecular kernels are scarce. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive spectral analysis of kernel ridge regression on the QM9 dataset, molecular fingerprint, pretrained transformer-based, global and local 3D representations across seven molecular properties. Surprisingly, richer spectral features, measured by four different spectral metrics, do not consistently improve accuracy. Pearson correlation tests further reveal that for transformer-based and local 3D representations, spectral richness can even have a negative correlation with performance. We also implement truncated kernels to probe the relationship between spectrum and predictive performance: in many kernels, retaining only the top 2% of eigenvalues recovers nearly all performance, indicating that the leading eigenvalues capture the most informative features. Our results challenge the common heuristic that "richer spectra yield better generalization" and highlight nuanced relationships between representation, kernel features, and predictive performance. Beyond molecular property prediction, these findings inform how kernel and self-supervised learning methods are evaluated in data-limited scientific and real-world tasks.</description>

      <title>Modeling Diffusion and Permeation Across the Stratum Corneum Lipid Barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human skin oils are a major sink for ozone in densely occupied indoor environments. Understanding how the resulting volatile and semivolatile organic oxidation products influence indoor air chemistry requires accurate representations not only of their emission into indoor air but also of their transport across the outermost skin barrier, the stratum corneum. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the passive permeation of acetone, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and water -- two representative products of skin-oil oxidation and a reference compound -- through a model stratum corneum lipid membrane. We determine position-dependent diffusivities using two complementary analyses based on the same set of simulations and evaluate their accuracy through a propagator analysis. The two approaches provide upper and lower bounds for the true diffusivity, which, when combined with previously reported free-energy profiles, yield permeabilities relevant for modeling macroscopic skin transport. Our results show that permeation is governed primarily by energetic barriers rather than by molecular mobility, and that the predicted transport coefficients vary by about one order of magnitude depending on the chosen diffusivity estimator. These findings provide molecular-level constraints for parameters used in indoor air chemistry models and establish a transferable framework for linking atomistic transport mechanisms to large-scale simulations of human exposure and indoor air quality.</description>

      <title>VALID-Mol: a Systematic Framework for Validated LLM-Assisted Molecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate substantial promise for advancing scientific discovery, yet their deployment in disciplines demanding factual precision and specialized domain constraints presents significant challenges. Within molecular design for pharmaceutical development, these models can propose innovative molecular modifications but frequently generate chemically infeasible structures. We introduce VALID-Mol, a comprehensive framework that integrates chemical validation with LLM-driven molecular design, achieving an improvement in valid chemical structure generation from 3% to 83%. Our methodology synthesizes systematic prompt optimization, automated chemical verification, and domain-adapted fine-tuning to ensure dependable generation of synthesizable molecules with enhanced properties. Our contribution extends beyond implementation details to provide a transferable methodology for scientifically-constrained LLM applications with measurable reliability enhancements. Computational analyses indicate our framework generates promising synthesis candidates with up to 17-fold predicted improvements in target binding affinity while preserving synthetic feasibility.</description>

      <title>Efficient $GW$ band structure calculations using Gaussian basis functions and application to atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a $GW$ space-time algorithm for periodic systems in a Gaussian basis including spin-orbit coupling. We employ lattice summation to compute the irreducible density response and the self-energy, while we employ $k$-point sampling for computing the screened Coulomb interaction. Our algorithm enables accurate and computationally efficient quasiparticle band structure calculations for atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides. For monolayer MoS$_\text{2}$, MoSe$_\text{2}$, WS$_\text{2}$, and WSe$_\text{2}$, computed $GW$ band gaps agree on average within 50 meV with plane-wave-based reference calculations. $G_0W_0$ band structures are obtained in less than two days on a laptop (Intel i5, 192 GB RAM) or in less than 30 minutes using 1024 cores. Overall, our work provides an efficient and scalable framework for $GW$ calculations on atomically thin materials.</description>
