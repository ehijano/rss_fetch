      <title>Spectral Representation and Simulation of Fractional Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper gives a new representation for the fractional Brownian motion that can be applied to simulate this self-similar random process in continuous time. Such a representation is based on the spectral form of mathematical description and the spectral method. The Legendre polynomials are used as the orthonormal basis. The paper contains all the necessary algorithms and their theoretical foundation, as well as the results of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>The Critical Beta-splitting Random Tree IV: Mellin analysis of Leaf Height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the critical beta-splitting model of a random $n$-leaf rooted tree, clades are recursively split into sub-clades, and a clade of $m$ leaves is split into sub-clades containing $i$ and $m-i$ leaves with probabilities $\propto 1/(i(m-i))$. The height of a uniform random leaf can be represented as the absorption time of a certain {\em harmonic descent} Markov chain. Recent work on these heights $D_n$ and $L_n$ (corresponding to discrete or continuous versions of the tree) has led to quite sharp expressions for their asymptotic distributions, based on their Markov chain description. This article gives even sharper expressions, based on an $n \to \infty$ limit tree structure described via exchangeable random partitions in the style of Haas et al (2008). Within this structure, calculations of moments lead to expressions for Mellin transforms, and then via Mellin inversion we obtain sharp estimates for the expectation, variance, Normal approximation and large deviation behavior of $D_n$.</description>

      <title>Derivation of non-polynomial fractional diffusions from the generalized exclusion with a slow barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we derive in the hydrodynamic limit a generalized fractional porous medium equation, in the sense that the regional fractional Laplacian is applied to a function of the density given in terms of a power series, instead of a polynomial. The hydrodynamic limit is obtained considering a microscopic dynamics of random particles with long range interactions, but the jump rate highly depends on the occupancy near the sites where the interactions take place. This system is also studied in the presence of a "slow barrier" that hinders the flow of mass between two half-spaces.</description>

      <title>The stochastic MHD equations driven by pure jump noise in $L^p$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations driven by additive jump noises on either the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d=2,3$ or a smooth bounded domain $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We establish the local existence and uniqueness of a mild solution in the space $L^q(0,T;\mathbb{L}^{p\otimes}_{\sigma}(D))$ allowing for initial data with less regularity, including the marginal case $u_0\in \mathbb{L}^{d\otimes}_{\sigma}(D)$. In the two-dimensional case, we also prove the global existence of mild solutions.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the QuickVal Residual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QuickSelect (aka Find), introduced by Hoare (1961), is a randomized algorithm for selecting a specified order statistic from an input sequence of $n$ objects, or rather their identifying labels usually known as keys. The keys can be numeric or symbol strings, or indeed any labels drawn from a given linearly ordered set. We discuss various ways in which the cost of comparing two keys can be measured, and we can measure the efficiency of the algorithm by the total cost of such comparisons.
  We define and discuss a closely related algorithm known as QuickVal and a natural probabilistic model for the input to this algorithm; QuickVal searches (almost surely unsuccessfully) for a specified population quantile $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ in an input sample of size $n$. Call the total cost of comparisons for this algorithm $S_n$. We discuss a natural way to define the random variables $S_1, S_2, \ldots$ on a common probability space. For a general class of cost functions, Fill and Nakama (2013) proved under mild assumptions that the scaled cost $S_n / n$ of QuickVal converges in $L^p$ and almost surely to a limit random variable $S$. For a general cost function, we consider what we term the QuickVal residual: \[
  R_n := \frac{S_n}n - S. \] The residual is of natural interest, especially in light of the previous analogous work on the sorting algorithm QuickSort. In the case $\alpha = 0$ of QuickMin with unit cost per key-comparison, we are able to calculate -- \`a la Bindjeme and Fill (2012) for QuickSort -- the exact (and asymptotic) $L^2$-norm of the residual. We take the result as motivation for the scaling factor $\sqrt{n}$ for the QuickVal residual for general population quantiles and for general cost. We then prove in general (under mild conditions on the cost function) that $\sqrt{n}\,R_n$ converges in law to a scale-mixture of centered Gaussians, and we also prove convergence of moments.</description>

      <title>Local expansion properties of paracontrolled systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of concrete regularity structure gives the algebraic backbone of the operations involved in the local expansions used in the regularity structure approach to singular stochastic partial differential equations. The spaces and the details of the structures depend on each equation. We introduce here a parameter-dependent universal algebraic regularity structure that can host all the regularity structures used in the study of singular stochastic partial differential equations. This is done by using the correspondence between the notions of model on a regularity structure and the notion of paracontrolled system. We prove that the iterated paraproducts that form the fundamental bricks of paracontrolled systems have some local expansion properties that are governed by this universal structure.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Localization with Non-Gaussian Tilts and Applications to Tensor Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present generalizations and modifications of Eldan's Stochastic Localization process, extending it to incorporate non-Gaussian tilts, making it useful for a broader class of measures. As an application, we introduce new processes that enable the decomposition and analysis of non-quadratic potentials on the Boolean hypercube, with a specific focus on quartic polynomials. Using this framework, we derive new spectral gap estimates for tensor Ising models under Glauber dynamics, resulting in rapid mixing.</description>

      <title>All spatial random graphs with weak long-range effects have chemical distance comparable to Euclidean distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note provides a sufficient condition for linear lower bounds on chemical distances (compared to the Euclidean distance) in general spatial random graphs. The condition is based on the scarceness of long edges in the graph and weak correlations at large distances and is valid for all translation invariant and locally finite graphs that fulfil these conditions. The proof is based on a renormalisation scheme introduced by Berger [arXiv: 0409021 (2004)].</description>

      <title>Non-Uniqueness Phase in Hyperbolic Marked Random Connection Models using the Spherical Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-uniqueness phase for infinite clusters is proven for a class of marked random connection models on the $d$-dimensional hyperbolic space, ${\mathbb{H}^d}$, in a high volume-scaling regime. The approach taken in this paper utilizes the spherical transform on ${\mathbb{H}^d}$ to diagonalize convolution by the adjacency function and the two-point function and bound their $L^2\to L^2$ operator norms. Under some circumstances, this spherical transform approach also provides bounds on the triangle diagram that allows for a derivation of certain mean-field critical exponents. In particular, the results are applied to some Boolean and weight-dependent hyperbolic random connection models. While most of the paper is concerned with the high volume-scaling regime, the existence of the non-uniqueness phase is also proven without this scaling for some random connection models whose resulting graphs are almost surely not locally finite.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the stochastic logrithmic Schr\"odinger equation with saturated nonlinear multiplicative L\'evy noise. The global well-posedness is established for the stochastic logrithmic Schr\"odinger equation in an appropriate Orlicz space by construct solutions of a regularized equation converging strongly to a solution to the original equation.</description>

      <title>Large gap asymptotics of the hard edge tacnode process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A special type of geometric situation in ensembles of non-intersecting paths occurs when the non-intersecting trajectories are required to be nonnegative so that the limit shape becomes tangential to the hard-edge $0$. The local fluctuation is governed by the universal hard edge tacnode process, which also arises from some tiling problems. It is the aim of this work to explore the integrable structure and asymptotics for the gap probability of the hard edge thinned/unthinned tacnode process over $(0,s)$. We establish an integral representation of the gap probability in terms of the Hamiltonian associated with a system of differential equations. With the aids of some remarkable differential identities for the Hamiltonian, we are able to derive the associated large gap asymptotics, up to and including the constant term in the thinned case. Some applications of our results are discussed as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present manuscript we address and solve for the first time a nonlocal discrete isoperimetric problem. We consider indeed a generalization of the classical perimeter, what we call a nonlocal bi-axial discrete perimeter, where, not only the external boundary of a polyomino $\mathcal{P}$ contributes to the perimeter, but all internal and external components of $\mathcal{P}$. Furthermore, we find and characterize its minimizers in the class of polyominoes with fixed area $n$. Moreover, we explain how the solution of the nonlocal discrete isoperimetric problem is related to the rigorous study of the metastable behavior of a long-range bi-axial Ising model.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the directed landscape from the KPZ fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the directed landscape is the unique coupling of the KPZ fixed point from all initial conditions at all times satisfying three natural properties: independent increments, monotonicity, and shift commutativity. Equivalently, we show that the directed landscape is the unique directed metric on $\mathbb R^2$ with independent increments and KPZ fixed point marginals. This gives a framework for proving convergence to the directed landscape given convergence to the KPZ fixed point. We apply this framework to prove convergence to the directed landscape for a range of models, some without exact solvability: asymmetric exclusion processes with potentially non-nearest neighbour interactions, exotic couplings of ASEP, the random walk and Brownian web distance, and directed polymer models. All of our convergence theorems are new except for colored ASEP and the KPZ equation, where we provide alternative proofs.</description>

      <title>Exact simulation of the first-passage time of SDEs to time-dependent thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first-passage time (FPT) is a fundamental concept in stochastic processes, representing the time it takes for a process to reach a specified threshold for the first time. Often, considering a time-dependent threshold is essential for accurately modeling stochastic processes, as it provides a more accurate and adaptable framework. In this paper, we extend an existing Exact simulation method developed for constant thresholds to handle time-dependent thresholds. Our proposed approach utilizes the FPT of Brownian motion and accepts it for the FPT of a given process with some probability, which is determined using Girsanov's transformation. This method eliminates the need to simulate entire paths over specific time intervals, avoids time-discretization errors, and directly simulates the first-passage time. We present results demonstrating the method's effectiveness, including the extension to time-dependent thresholds, an analysis of its time complexity, comparisons with existing methods through numerical examples, and its application to predicting spike times in a neuron.</description>

      <title>Uniform asymptotic estimates for ruin probabilities of a multidimensional risk model with cadlag returns and multivariate heavy tailed claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a multidimensional renewal risk model, with common counting process and cadlag returns. Considering that the claim vectors have common distribution from some multivariate distribution class with heavy tail, are mutually weakly dependent, and each one has arbitrarily dependent components, we obtain uniformly asymptotic estimations for the probability of entrance of discounted aggregate claims into a some rare sets, over a finite time horizon. Direct consequence of the claim behavior is the estimation of the ruin probability of the model in some ruin sets. Further, restricting the distribution class of the claim vectors in the multivariate regular variation, the estimations still hold uniformly over the whole time horizon.</description>

      <title>Time-Biased Random Walks and Robustness of Expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random walks on expanders play a crucial role in Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, derandomization, graph theory, and distributed computing. A desirable property is that they are rapidly mixing, which is equivalent to having a spectral gap $\gamma$ (asymptotically) bounded away from $0$. Our work has two main strands.
  First, we establish a dichotomy for the robustness of mixing times on edge-weighted $d$-regular graphs (i.e., reversible Markov chains) subject to a Lipschitz condition, which bounds the ratio of adjacent weights by $\beta \geq 1$. If $\beta \ge 1$ is sufficiently small, then $\gamma \asymp 1$ and the mixing time is logarithmic in $n$. On the other hand, if $\beta \geq 2d$, there is an edge-weighting such that $\gamma$ is polynomially small in $1/n$.
  Second, we apply our robustness result to a time-dependent version of the so-called $\varepsilon$-biased random walk, as introduced in Azar et al. [Combinatorica 1996]. We show that, for any constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, a bias strategy can be chosen adaptively so that the $\varepsilon$-biased random walk covers any bounded-degree regular expander in $\Theta(n)$ expected time, improving the previous-best bound of $O(n \log \log n)$. We prove the first non-trivial lower bound on the cover time of the $\varepsilon$-biased random walk, showing that, on bounded-degree regular expanders, it is $\omega(n)$ whenever $\varepsilon = o(1)$. We establish this by controlling how much the probability of arbitrary events can be ``boosted'' by using a time-dependent bias strategy.</description>

      <title>The suboptimality ratio of projective measurements restricted to low-rank subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limitations in measurement instruments can hinder the implementation of some quantum algorithms. Understanding the suboptimality of such measurements with restrictions may then lead to more efficient measurement policies. In this paper, we theoretically examine the suboptimality arising from a Procrustes problem for minimizing the average distance between two fixed quantum states when one of the states has been measured by a Projective Measurement (PM). Specifically, we compare optima when we can only use PMs that are aligned with a low-rank subspace where the quantum states are supported, and when we can measure with the full set of PMs. For this problem, we show that the suboptimality ratio is independent of the dimension of the full space, and is at most polylogarithmic in the dimension of the low-rank subspace. In the proof of this result, we use a probabilistic approach and the main techniques include trace inequalities related to projective measurements, and operator norm bounds for equipartitions of Parseval frames, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Improving Numerical Error Bounds Near Sharp Interface Limit for Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of geometric surface evolutions, stochastic reaction-diffusion equation provides a powerful tool for capturing and simulating complex dynamics. A critical challenge in this area is developing numerical approximations that exhibit error bounds with polynomial dependence on $\vv^{-1}$, where the small parameter $\vv&gt;0$ represents the diffuse interface thickness. The existence of such bounds for fully discrete approximations of stochastic reaction-diffusion equations remains unclear in the literature. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging the asymptotic log-Harnack inequality to overcome the exponential growth of $\vv^{-1}$. Furthermore, we establish the numerical weak error bounds under the truncated Wasserstein distance for the spectral Galerkin method and a fully discrete tamed Euler scheme, with explicit polynomial dependence on $\vv^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Index Policy for Restless Bandits with Average Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Lagrangian Index Policy (LIP) for restless multi-armed bandits with long-run average reward. In particular, we compare the performance of LIP with the performance of the Whittle Index Policy (WIP), both heuristic policies known to be asymptotically optimal under certain natural conditions. Even though in most cases their performances are very similar, in the cases when WIP shows bad performance, LIP continues to perform very well. We then propose reinforcement learning algorithms, both tabular and NN-based, to obtain online learning schemes for LIP in the model-free setting. The proposed reinforcement learning schemes for LIP requires significantly less memory than the analogous scheme for WIP. We calculate analytically the Lagrangian index for the restart model, which describes the optimal web crawling and the minimization of the weighted age of information. We also give a new proof of asymptotic optimality in case of homogeneous bandits as the number of arms goes to infinity, based on exchangeability and de Finetti's theorem.</description>

      <title>W-algebras, Gaussian Free Fields and $\mathfrak{g}$-Dotsenko-Fateev integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the intrinsic connection between Gaussian Free Fields and the Heisenberg Vertex Operator Algebra, we study some aspects of the correspondence between probability theory and $W$-algebras. This is first achieved by providing a probabilistic representation of the $W$-algebra associated to any simple and complex Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ by means of Gaussian Free Fields.
  This probabilistic representation has in turn strong implications for free-field correlation functions. Namely we show that this correspondence can be used to translate algebraic statements into actual constraints for free-field correlation functions in the form of Ward identities. This leads to new integrability results concerning Dotsenko-Fateev integrals associated to a simple and complex Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$, such as the derivation of a Fuchsian differential equation satisfied by deformations of $B_2$-Dotsenko-Fateev and Selberg integrals that arise from the Mukhin-Varchenko conjecture.
  Along the proof of this statement we also provide new results concerning representation theory of $W$-algebras such as the description of some singular vectors for the $\mathcal W B_2$ algebra.</description>

Abstract: We study $\mathbb Z^d$-map lattices coupled by collision. We obtain a first order approximation for the first collision rate at a site $\textbf{p}^*\in \mathbb Z^d$ and we prove a distributional convergence for the first collision time to an exponential, with sharp error term. Moreover, we prove that the number of collisions at site $\textbf{p}^*$ converge in distribution to a compound Poisson distributed random variable. Key to our analysis in this infinite dimensional setting is the use of transfer operators associated with the decoupled map lattice at site $\textbf{p}^*$</description>

Abstract: We prove $\mathrm{H}^1$ and $\mathrm{BMO}$ endpoint inequalities for generic cancellative Haar shifts defined with respect to a possibly non-homogeneous Borel measure $\mu$ satisfying a weak regularity condition. This immediately yields a new, highly streamlined proof of the $L^p$-results for the same operators due to L\'opez-Sanchez, Martell, and Parcet. We also prove regularity properties for the Haar shift operators on the natural martingale Lipschitz spaces defined with respect to the underlying dyadic system, and show that the class of measures that we consider is sharp.</description>

      <title>Three-point correlation functions in the $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ Toda theory II: the Fateev-Litvinov formula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Toda Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) form a family of two-dimensional CFTs indexed by semisimple and complex Lie algebras. One of their remarkable features is that they are natural generalizations of Liouville CFT that enjoy an enhanced level of symmetry, prescribed by $W$-algebras. They likewise admit a probabilistic formulation in terms of Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos.
  Based on this probabilistic framework, this second article in a two-part series is dedicated to providing a first step towards integrability of these theories. In this perspective we prove the Fateev-Litvinov formula for a family of three-point correlation functions associated to the $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ Toda CFT. This result is the analog of the celebrated DOZZ formula in Liouville CFT. Our method of proof features techniques inspired by the physics literature together with probabilistic ones that naturally arise within the setting of Toda theories.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis for Wigner matrices uniformly in the entire spectrum, in particular near the spectral edges, with a bound on the fluctuation that is optimal for any observable. This complements earlier works of Cipolloni et. al. (Comm. Math. Phys. 388, 2021; Forum Math., Sigma 10, 2022) and Benigni et. al. (Comm. Math. Phys. 391, 2022; arXiv: 2303.11142) that were restricted either to the bulk of the spectrum or to special observables. As a main ingredient, we prove a new multi-resolvent local law that optimally accounts for the edge scaling.</description>

      <title>Tiny fluctuations of the averaging process around its degenerate steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze nonequilibrium fluctuations of the averaging process on $\mathbb T_\varepsilon^d$, a continuous degenerate Gibbs sampler running over the edges of the discrete $d$-dimensional torus. We show that, if we start from a smooth deterministic non-flat interface, recenter, blow-up by a non-standard CLT-scaling factor $\theta_\varepsilon=\varepsilon^{-(d/2+1)}$, and rescale diffusively, Gaussian fluctuations emerge in the limit $\varepsilon\to 0$. These fluctuations are purely dynamical, zero at times $t=0$ and $t=\infty$, and non-trivial for $t\in (0,\infty)$. We fully determine the correlation matrix of the limiting noise, non-diagonal as soon as $d\ge 2$. The main technical challenge in this stochastic homogenization procedure lies in a LLN for a weighted space-time average of squared discrete gradients. We accomplish this through a Poincar\'e inequality with respect to the underlying randomness of the edge updates, a tool from Malliavin calculus in Poisson space. This inequality, combined with sharp gradients' second moment estimates, yields quantitative variance bounds without prior knowledge of the limiting mean. Our method avoids higher (e.g., fourth) moment bounds, which seem inaccessible with the present techniques.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we establish the existence of large deviation principles of random walk in strongly mixing environments. The quenched and annealed rate functions have the same zero set whose shape is either a singleton point or a line segment, with an illustrative example communicated and given by F. Rassoul-Agha. Whenever the level of disorder is controlled, the two rate functions agree on compact sets at the boundary and in the interior both under strongly mixing conditions. Along the line we also indicate that under slightly more refined monotonicity conditions, there is a phase transition of the difference of two rate functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the stochastic heat equation \begin{equation*} \partial_t u_t(x)=\frac12 \partial^2_{xx}u_t(x) +b(u_t(x))+\dot{W}_{t}(x),\quad t\in(0,T],\, x\in D, \end{equation*} where $b$ is a generalized function, $D$ is either $[0,1]$ or $\mathbb{R}$, and $\dot W$ is space-time white noise on $\mathbb{R}_+\times D$. If the drift $b$ is a sufficiently regular function, then it is well-known that any analytically weak solution to this equation is also analytically mild, and vice versa. We extend this result to drifts that are generalized functions, with an appropriate adaptation of the notions of mild and weak solutions. As a corollary of our results, we show that for $b\in L_p(\mathbb{R})$, $p\ge1$, this equation has a unique analytically weak and mild solution, thus extending the classical results of Gy\"ongy and Pardoux (1993).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the stationary measure of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on a finite interval in $\mathbb{Z}$ with open boundaries. Fixing all the jump rates and letting the system size approach infinity, the height profile of such a sequence of stationary measures satisfies a large deviation principle (LDP), whose rate function was predicted in the physics work arXiv:cond-mat/0205353. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous proof of the large deviation principle in the "fan region" part of the phase diagram. Our proof relies on two key ingredients: a two-layer expression of the stationary measure of open ASEP, arising from the Enaud-Derrida representation arXiv:cond-mat/0307023 of the matrix product ansatz, and the large deviation principle of the open totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) recently established in arXiv:2403.03275.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fractional $\Phi^4_3$-measure (with order $\alpha &gt; 1$) and the dynamical problem of its canonical stochastic quantization: the three-dimensional stochastic damped fractional nonlinear wave equation with a cubic nonlinearity, also called the fractional hyperbolic $\Phi^4_3$-model. We first construct the fractional $\Phi^4_3$-measure via the variational approach by Barashkov-Gubinelli (2020). When $\alpha \leq \frac{9}{8}$, this fractional $\Phi^4_3$-measure turns out to be singular with respect to the base Gaussian measure. We then prove almost sure global well-posedness of the fractional hyperbolic $\Phi^4_3$-model and invariance of the fractional $\Phi^4_3$-measure for all $\alpha &gt; 1$ by further developing the globalization framework due to Oh-Okamoto-Tolomeo (2024) on the hyperbolic $\Phi^3_3$-model. Furthermore, when $\alpha &gt; \frac{9}{8}$ , we prove weak universality of the fractional hyperbolic $\Phi^4_3$-model by utilizing the convergence of Gibbs measures.</description>

      <title>Moving Aggregate Modified Autoregressive Copula-Based Time Series Models (MAGMAR-Copulas)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Copula-based time series models implicitly assume a finite Markov order. In reality a time series may not follow the Markov property. We modify the copula-based time series models by introducing a moving aggregate (MAG) part into the model updating equation. The functional form of the MAG-part is given as the inverse of a conditional copula. The resulting MAG-modified Autoregressive Copula-Based Time Series model (MAGMAR-Copula) is discussed in detail and distributional properties are derived in a D-vine framework. The model nests the classical ARMA model and can be interpreted as a non-linear generalization of the ARMA-model. The modeling performance is evaluated by modeling US inflation. Our model is competitive with benchmark models in terms of information criteria.</description>

      <title>Full error analysis of the random deep splitting method for nonlinear parabolic PDEs and PIDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a randomized extension of the deep splitting algorithm introduced in [Beck, Becker, Cheridito, Jentzen, and Neufeld (2021)] using random neural networks suitable to approximately solve both high-dimensional nonlinear parabolic PDEs and PIDEs with jumps having (possibly) infinite activity. We provide a full error analysis of our so-called random deep splitting method. In particular, we prove that our random deep splitting method converges to the (unique viscosity) solution of the nonlinear PDE or PIDE under consideration. Moreover, we empirically analyze our random deep splitting method by considering several numerical examples including both nonlinear PDEs and nonlinear PIDEs relevant in the context of pricing of financial derivatives under default risk. In particular, we empirically demonstrate in all examples that our random deep splitting method can approximately solve nonlinear PDEs and PIDEs in 10'000 dimensions within seconds.</description>

      <title>Markov spin models for image generation : explicit large deviations with respect to the number of pixels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the discrete-time or the continuous-time Markov spin models for image generation when each pixel $n=1,..,N$ can take only two values $S_n=\pm 1$, the finite-time forward propagator depends on the initial and on the final configurations of the $N$ spins only via a single global variable, namely the extensive overlap that counts the number of spins that have the same value or not in the two configurations. The joint probability distribution of the overlap and of the magnetization during the forward noising dynamics can be written for any finite number $N$ of pixels and in the limit $N \to + \infty$ to extract the large deviations properties. The consequences for the backward reconstructive dynamics are then analyzed for various initial conditions, namely (i) a single image (ii) a mixture of two images (iii) when the initial condition corresponds to the Curie-Weiss mean-field ferromagnetic model in the microcanonical ensemble, as a simple analog of the manifold-hypothesis concerning continuous generative diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Relative volume of comparable pairs under semigroup majorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ of stochastic matrices induces a semigroup majorization relation $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$ on the set $\Delta_{n-1}$ of probability $n$-vectors. Pick $X,Y$ at random in $\Delta_{n-1}$: what is the probability that $X$ and $Y$ are comparable under $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$? We review recent asymptotic ($n\to\infty$) results and conjectures in the case of majorization relation (when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of doubly stochastic matrices), discuss natural generalisations, and prove a new asymptotic result in the case of majorization, and new exact finite-$n$ formulae in the case of UT-majorization relation, i.e. when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of upper-triangular stochastic matrices.</description>

      <title>Optimal two-parameter portfolio management strategy with transaction costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a simplified model for optimizing a single-asset portfolio in the presence of transaction costs given a signal with a certain autocorrelation and cross-correlation structure. In our setup, the portfolio manager is given two one-parameter controls to influence the construction of the portfolio. The first is a linear filtering parameter that may increase or decrease the level of autocorrelation in the signal. The second is a numerical threshold that determines a symmetric "no-trade" zone. Portfolio positions are constrained to a single unit long or a single unit short. These constraints allow us to focus on the interplay between the signal filtering mechanism and the hysteresis introduced by the "no-trade" zone. We then formulate an optimization problem where we aim to minimize the frequency of trades subject to a fixed return level of the portfolio. We show that maintaining a no-trade zone while removing autocorrelation entirely from the signal yields a locally optimal solution. For any given "no-trade" zone threshold, this locally optimal solution also achieves the maximum attainable return level, and we derive a quantitative lower bound for the amount of improvement in terms of the given threshold and the amount of autocorrelation removed.</description>

      <title>Stably unactivated neurons in ReLU neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The choice of architecture of a neural network influences which functions will be realizable by that neural network and, as a result, studying the expressiveness of a chosen architecture has received much attention. In ReLU neural networks, the presence of stably unactivated neurons can reduce the network's expressiveness. In this work, we investigate the probability of a neuron in the second hidden layer of such neural networks being stably unactivated when the weights and biases are initialized from symmetric probability distributions. For networks with input dimension $n_0$, we prove that if the first hidden layer has $n_0+1$ neurons then this probability is exactly $\frac{2^{n_0}+1}{4^{n_0+1}}$, and if the first hidden layer has $n_1$ neurons, $n_1 \le n_0$, then the probability is $\frac{1}{2^{n_1+1}}$. Finally, for the case when the first hidden layer has more neurons than $n_0+1$, a conjecture is proposed along with the rationale. Computational evidence is presented to support the conjecture.</description>
