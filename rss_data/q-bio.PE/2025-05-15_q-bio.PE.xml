      <title>Sequential Monte Carlo Squared for online inference in stochastic epidemic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective epidemic modeling and surveillance require computationally efficient methods that can continuously update estimates as new data becomes available. This paper explores the application of an online variant of Sequential Monte Carlo Squared (O-SMC$^2$) to the stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model for real-time epidemic tracking. The particularity of O-SMC$^2$ lies in its ability to update the parameters using a particle Metropolis-Hastings kernel, ensuring that the target distribution remains invariant while only utilizing a fixed window of recent observations. This feature enables timely parameter updates and significantly enhances computational efficiency compared to the standard SMC$^2$, which processes the entire dataset. First, we demonstrate the efficiency of O-SMC$^2$ on simulated data, where both the parameters and the observation process are known. We then apply the method to a real-world COVID-19 dataset from Ireland, successfully tracking the epidemic trajectory and estimating the time-dependent reproduction number of the disease. Our results show that O-SMC$^2$ provides highly accurate online estimates of both static and dynamic epidemiological parameters while substantially reducing computational costs. These findings highlight the potential of O-SMC$^2$ for real-time epidemic monitoring and supporting adaptive public health interventions.</description>

      <title>Population dynamics of generalist/specialist strategies in the feast-famine cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microbial populations exhibit a broad spectrum of nutrient utilization strategies, ranging from strategies utilizing diverse nutrients, called "generalist," to ones being highly adapted to specific nutrients, called "specialists." The mathematical conditions for the diversification of nutrient utilization strategies are central questions in theoretical ecology. Previous studies have shown that trade-offs among different resource utilization functions that cells cannot utilize broad types of substrates at near-maximum speed are crucial for the emergence of diverse strategies. However, in natural settings, nutrient availability often fluctuates over time, imposing additional trade-offs on cells. Cells that grow rapidly under nutrient-rich conditions will suffer a higher death rate under nutrient-poor conditions, creating a growth-death trade-off that intersects with the classical resource-use trade-off. Here, we introduce a unified mathematical model that simultaneously incorporates the resource-use trade-off and the growth-death trade-off. The nutrient supply was modeled as discrete stochastic events, capturing realistic temporal fluctuations. We show that the relative balance between growth and death rates critically influences the dominance of either generalist or specialist strategies. Specifically, under conditions of high average growth rates among different environments and a weak trade-off between growth and death rates, generalists prevail. In contrast, when the growth-death trade-off is intense, specialists emerge as the dominant strategy. Our findings reveal that accounting for the growth-death trade-off is crucial for understanding how microbial communities adapt and evolve in temporally varying environments.</description>

      <title>Great Short History of Microbiology Development as a Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of microorganisms, or microbiology, has demonstrated significant development since its inception and is currently a key field of biological sciences that has a huge impact on modern society and scientific research. Over the centuries, this discipline has undergone significant changes, shaping our understanding of infectious diseases and food safety. Starting from the simplest observations of microscopic organisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa, and ending with modern molecular and genomic research methods. This article describes a brief historical path of microbiology development. The heuristic, morphological, physiological, immunological, and molecular genetic stages are the main periods into which the development of this science is traditionally divided, despite the lack of full-fledged and precise boundaries between them.</description>

      <title>Cherry picking in forests: A new characterization for the unrooted hybrid number of two phylogenetic trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08145v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks are a special type of graph which generalize phylogenetic trees and that are used to model non-treelike evolutionary processes such as recombination and hybridization. In this paper, we consider {\em unrooted} phylogenetic networks, i.e. simple, connected graphs $\mathcal{N}=(V,E)$ with leaf set $X$, for $X$ some set of species, in which every internal vertex in $\mathcal{N}$ has degree three. One approach used to construct such phylogenetic networks is to take as input a collection $\mathcal{P}$ of phylogenetic trees and to look for a network $\mathcal{N}$ that contains each tree in $\mathcal{P}$ and that minimizes the quantity $r(\mathcal{N}) = |E|-(|V|-1)$ over all such networks. Such a network always exists, and the quantity $r(\mathcal{N})$ for an optimal network $\mathcal{N}$ is called the hybrid number of $\mathcal{P}$. In this paper, we give a new characterization for the hybrid number in case $\mathcal{P}$ consists of two trees. This characterization is given in terms of a cherry picking sequence for the two trees, although to prove that our characterization holds we need to define the sequence more generally for two forests. Cherry picking sequences have been intensively studied for collections of rooted phylogenetic trees, but our new sequences are the first variant of this concept that can be applied in the unrooted setting. Since the hybrid number of two trees is equal to the well-known tree bisection and reconnection distance between the two trees, our new characterization also provides an alternative way to understand this important tree distance.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous graph neural networks for species distribution modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) are necessary for measuring and predicting occurrences and habitat suitability of species and their relationship with environmental factors. We introduce a novel presence-only SDM with graph neural networks (GNN). In our model, species and locations are treated as two distinct node sets, and the learning task is predicting detection records as the edges that connect locations to species. Using GNN for SDM allows us to model fine-grained interactions between species and the environment. We evaluate the potential of this methodology on the six-region dataset compiled by National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) for benchmarking SDMs. For each of the regions, the heterogeneous GNN model is comparable to or outperforms previously-benchmarked single-species SDMs as well as a feed-forward neural network baseline model.</description>

      <title>Bang-Bang Optimal Control of Vaccination in Metapopulation Epidemics with Linear Cost Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates optimal vaccination strategies in a metapopulation epidemic model. We consider a linear cost to better capture operational considerations, such as the total number of vaccines or hospitalizations, in contrast to the standard quadratic cost assumption on the control. The model incorporates state and mixed control-state constraints, and we derive necessary optimality conditions based on Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. We use Pontryagin's result to rule out the possibility of the occurrence of singular arcs and to provide a full characterization of the optimal control.</description>

      <title>A General Theory of Abiogenesis: Thermodynamic Selection and the Emergence of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17975v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of life is often approached through the lens of replication, heredity, or molecular specificity. This paper proposes a thermodynamic framework in which the emergence of life is driven by the persistence of reaction pathways that align energetically with fluctuating environmental inputs. We define a reaction viability inequality based on energy input, return, resilience, and expenditure, which selects for persistent chemical configurations without invoking heredity or genetic encoding.
  We further incorporate entropic dynamics and spatial constraints into an augmented persistence function, showing that systems far from equilibrium can simultaneously increase global entropy while supporting localized chemical order. These refinements lead to the development of the Thermodynamic Abiogenesis Likelihood Model (TALM), a probabilistic extension that estimates the likelihood of persistence-driven selection under various prebiotic and planetary scenarios.
  This framework redefines the conditions under which life-like organization may emerge and provides a testable, general theory for abiogenesis grounded in physical law.</description>
