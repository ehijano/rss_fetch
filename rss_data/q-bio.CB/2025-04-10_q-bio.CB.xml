      <title>A mass conserved reaction-diffusion system reveals switching between coexisting polar and oscillatory cell motility states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motile eukaryotic cells display distinct modes of migration that often occur within the same cell type. It remains unclear, however, whether transitions between the migratory modes require changes in external conditions, or whether the different modes are coexisting states that emerge from the underlying signaling network. Using a mass-conserved reaction-diffusion model of small GTPase signaling with F-actin mediated feedback, we uncover a bistable regime where a polarized mode of migration coexists with spatiotemporal oscillations. Indeed, experimental observations of D. discoideum show that, upon collision with a rigid boundary, cells may switch from polarized to disordered motion.</description>

      <title>Phenotype structuring in collective cell migration:a tutorial of mathematical models and methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Populations are heterogeneous, deviating in numerous ways. Phenotypic diversity refers to the range of traits or characteristics across a population, where for cells this could be the levels of signalling, movement and growth activity, etc. Clearly, the phenotypic distribution -- and how this changes over time and space -- could be a major determinant of population-level dynamics. For instance, across a cancerous population, variations in movement, growth, and ability to evade death may determine its growth trajectory and response to therapy. In this review, we discuss how classical partial differential equation (PDE) approaches for modelling cellular systems and collective cell migration can be extended to include phenotypic structuring. The resulting non-local models -- which we refer to as phenotype-structured partial integro-differential equations (PS-PIDEs) -- form a sophisticated class of models with rich dynamics. We set the scene through a brief history of structured population modelling, and then review the extension of several classic movement models -- including the Fisher-KPP and Keller-Segel equations -- into a PS-PIDE form. We proceed with a tutorial-style section on derivation, analysis, and simulation techniques. First, we show a method to formally derive these models from underlying agent-based models. Second, we recount travelling waves in PDE models of spatial spread dynamics and concentration phenomena in non-local PDE models of evolutionary dynamics, and combine the two to deduce phenotypic structuring across travelling waves in PS-PIDE models. Third, we discuss numerical methods to simulate PS-PIDEs, illustrating with a simple scheme based on the method of lines and noting the finer points of consideration. We conclude with a discussion of future modelling and mathematical challenges.</description>

      <title>Cell size distributions in lineages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cells actively regulate their size during the cell cycle to maintain volume homeostasis across generations. While various mathematical models of cell size regulation have been proposed to explain how this is achieved, relating these models to experimentally observed cell size distributions has proved challenging. In this paper we present a simple formula for the cell size distribution in lineages as observed in e.g. a mother machine, and provide a new derivation for the corresponding result in populations, assuming exponential cell growth. Our results are independent of the underlying cell size control mechanism and explain the characteristic shape underlying experimentally observed cell size distributions. We furthermore derive universal moment identities for these distributions, and show that our predictions agree well with experimental measurements of E. coli cells, both on the distribution and the moment level.</description>
