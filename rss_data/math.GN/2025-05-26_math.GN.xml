      <title>Resolvability in products and squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces, $|X| = \Delta(X)$ and $|Y| = \Delta(Y)$. We investigate resolvability of the product $X \times Y$. We prove that: I. If $|X| = |Y| = \omega$ and $X,Y$ are Hausdorff, then $X \times Y$ is maximally resolvable; II. If $2^\kappa = \kappa^+$, $\{|X|, \mathrm{cf}|X|\} \cap \{\kappa, \kappa^+\} \ne \emptyset$ and $\mathrm{cf}|Y| = \kappa^+$, then the space $X \times Y$ is $\kappa^+$-resolvable. In particular, under GCH the space $X^2$ is $\mathrm{cf}|X|$-resolvable whenever $\mathrm{cf}|X|$ is an isolated cardinal; III. ($\frak{r} = \frak{c}$) If $\mathrm{cf}|X| = \omega$ and $\mathrm{cf}|Y| = \mathrm{cf}(\frak{c})$, then the space $X \times Y$ is $\omega$-resolvable. If, moreover, $\mathrm{cf}(\frak{c}) = \omega_1$, then the space $X \times Y$ is $\omega_1$-resolvable.</description>

      <title>A pseudometric on $\mathcal{M}(X,\mathscr{A})$ induced by a measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a probability measure space $(X,\mathscr{A},\mu)$, we define a pseudometric $\delta$ on the ring $\mathcal{M}(X,\mathscr{A})$ of real-valued measurable functions on $X$ as $\delta(f,g)=\mu(X\setminus Z(f-g))$ and denote the topological space induced by $\delta$ as $\mathcal{M}_\delta$. We examine several topological properties, such as connectedness, compactness, Lindel\"{o}fness, separability and second countability of this pseudometric space. We realise that the space is connected if and only if $\mu$ is a non-atomic measure and we explicitly describe the components in $\mathcal{M}_\delta$, for any choice of measure. We also deduce that $\mathcal{M}_\delta$ is zero-dimensional if and only if $\mu$ is purely atomic. We define $\mu$ to be bounded away from zero, if every non-zero measurable set has measure greater than some constant. We establish several conditions equivalent to $\mu$ being bounded away from zero. For instance, $\mu$ is bounded away from zero if and only if $\mathcal{M}_\delta$ is a locally compact space. We conclude this article by describing the structure of compact sets and Lindel\"{o}f sets in $\mathcal{M}_\delta$.</description>

      <title>Homotopy Type of Intersections of Real Bruhat Cells in Dimension 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the arbitrary intersection of real Bruhat cells. Such objects have attracted interest from various authors, particularly due to their appearance in different contexts: such as in Kazhdan-Lusztig theory and in the study of locally convex curves. We study the homotopy type of the intersection of two real Bruhat cells. This homotopy type is the same as that of an explicit submanifold of the group of real lower triangular matrices with diagonal entries equal to 1. For $(n+1)\times(n+1)$ matrices with $n\leq4$, these submanifolds are the disjoint union of contractible connected components. Our focus is on such intersections for $6\times6$ real matrices. For this, we study the connected components of Bruhat cells for permutations $\sigma\in\Sn_6$ with at most 12 inversions. We make use of the structure of the dual CW complexes associated with these components. We show that for permutations with at most 12 inversions, with the exception of $\sigma=[563412]$ , all connected components are contractible. Furthermore, for $\sigma=[563412]$, we identify new non-contractible connected components with the homotopy type of the circle.</description>

      <title>Spectral selections, commutativity preservation and Coxeter-Lipschitz maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system whose graph is connected, with no infinite edges. A self-map $\tau$ of $W$ such that $\tau_{\sigma\theta}\in \{\tau_{\theta},\ \sigma\tau_{\theta}\}$ for all $\theta\in W$ and all reflections $\sigma$ (analogous to being 1-Lipschitz with respect to the Bruhat order on $W$) is either constant or a right translation. A somewhat stronger version holds for $S_n$, where it suffices that $\sigma$ range over smaller, $\theta$-dependent sets of reflections.
  These combinatorial results have a number of consequences concerning continuous spectrum- and commutativity-preserving maps $\mathrm{SU}(n)\to M_n$ defined on special unitary groups: every such map is a conjugation composed with (a) the identity; (b) transposition, or (c) a continuous diagonal spectrum selection. This parallels and recovers Petek's analogous statement for self-maps of the space $H_n\le M_n$ of self-adjoint matrices, strengthening it slightly by expanding the codomain to $M_n$.</description>
