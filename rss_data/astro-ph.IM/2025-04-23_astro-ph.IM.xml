      <title>A Mission to Demonstrate Rapid-Response Flyby Reconnaissance for Planetary Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: International and U.S. strategies and protocols have identified the need to develop rapid-response spacecraft reconnaissance capabilities as a priority to advance planetary defense readiness. A space-based reconnaissance response is recommended for potential impactors as small as 50 m, making these small objects the most likely to trigger a space-based response and the ones that drive the reconnaissance capabilities needed. Even following the successful completion of the NEO Surveyor mission and Rubin Observatory survey efforts, roughly half of the 50-m near-Earth object (NEO) population will remain undiscovered. As a result, 50-m impactors may not be found with long warning times, and a rapid-response flyby mission may be the only reconnaissance possible. To develop a robust flyby reconnaissance capability for planetary defense, four major requirements are defined for a demonstration mission. 1. Enable a flyby of greater than 90 percent of the potential asteroid threat population. 2. Demonstrate the flyby reconnaissance for a 50 m NEO. 3. Obtain the information needed to determine if and where it would impact the Earth. 4. Determine key properties of the asteroid to inform decision makers. As commonly noted in the planetary defense community, in planetary defense, you do not pick the asteroid, the asteroid picks you. Thus, a planetary defense flyby reconnaissance demonstration mission is not about just flying by an asteroid, but rather it is about developing a robust capability for the objects that are most likely to require a short-warning-time, space-based response.</description>

      <title>Antenna Technology Readiness for the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) will be the first sub-mm wavelength Space Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) mission. It targets astronomical imaging with the highest ever spatial resolution to enable detection of the photon ring of a supermassive black hole. BHEX is being proposed for launch in 2031 as a NASA Small Explorers mission. BHEX science goals and mission opportunity require a high precision lightweight spaceborne antenna. A survey of the technology landscape for realizing such an antenna is presented. Technology readiness (TRL) for the antenna is discussed and assessed to be at TRL 5. An update on our technology maturation efforts is provided. Design studies leading to the conceptual design of a metallized carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) technology based antenna with a mass of only $\dim 50$ kg, incorporating a 3.4 m primary reflector with a surface precision of &lt; 40 $\mu$m to allow efficient operation up to 320 GHz are outlined. Current plans anticipate attaining TRL6 in 2026 for the BHEX antenna. Completed design studies point to a large margin in surface precision which opens up opportunities for applications beyond BHEX, at significantly higher THz frequencies.</description>

      <title>How to make CLEAN variants faster? Using clustered components informed by the autocorrelation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deconvolution, imaging and calibration of data from radio interferometers is a challenging computational (inverse) problem. The upcoming generation of radio telescopes poses significant challenges to existing, and well proven data reduction pipelines due to the large data sizes expected from these experiments, and the high resolution and dynamic range. In this manuscript, we deal with the deconvolution problem. A variety of multiscalar variants to the classical CLEAN algorithm (the de-facto standard) have been proposed in the past, often outperforming CLEAN at the cost of significantly increasing numerical resources. In this work, we aim to combine some of these ideas for a new algorithm, Autocorr-CLEAN, to accelerate the deconvolution and prepare the data reduction pipelines for the data sizes expected by the upcoming generation of instruments. To this end, we propose to use a cluster of CLEAN components fitted to the autocorrelation function of the residual in a subminor loop, to derive continuously changing, and potentially non-radially symmetric, basis functions for CLEANing the residual. Autocorr-CLEAN allows for the superior reconstruction fidelity achieved by modern multiscalar approaches, and their superior convergence speed. It achieves this without utilizing any substep of super-linear complexity in the minor loops, keeping the single minor loop and subminor loop iterations at an execution time comparable to CLEAN. Combining these advantages, Autocorr-CLEAN is found to be up to a magnitude faster than the classical CLEAN procedure. Autocorr-CLEAN fits well in the algorithmic framework common for radio interferometry, making it relatively straightforward to include in future data reduction pipelines. With its accelerated convergence speed, and smaller residual, Autocorr-CLEAN may be an important asset for the data analysis in the future.</description>

      <title>Plasma Mechanism of Radio Emission Generation at the Bow Shock of the Exoplanet HD 189733b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the possibility of efficient radio emission generation in the bow shock region of hot Jupiter-type exoplanets. As a source of energetic electrons, the shock drift acceleration mechanism at a quasi-perpendicular shock is proposed. Electrons reflected and accelerated by the shock propagate through the relatively dense stellar wind plasma and excite plasma waves; therefore, a plasma emission mechanism is considered as the source of the resulting radio waves. Using the bow shock of the hot Jupiter HD 189733b as a case study, the properties of the energetic electron beam, the excited plasma waves, and the resulting radio frequencies are estimated. An energy-based analysis is carried out to identify the range of stellar wind parameters for which radio emission from the bow shock of the exoplanet HD 189733b could be detectable by modern astronomical instruments.</description>

      <title>Identifying eclipsing binary stars with TESS data based on a new hybrid deep learning model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eclipsing binary systems (EBs), as foundational objects in stellar astrophysics, have garnered significant attention in recent years. These systems exhibit periodic decreases in light intensity when one star obscures the other from the observer's perspective, producing characteristic light curves (LCs). With the advent of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), a vast repository of stellar LCs has become available, offering unprecedented opportunities for discovering new EBs. To efficiently identify such systems, we propose a novel method that combines LC data and generalized Lomb-Scargle periodograms (GLS) data to classify EBs. At the core of this method is CNN Attention LSTM Net (CALNet), a hybrid deep learning model integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and an Attention Mechanism based on the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). We collected 4,225 EB samples, utilizing their 2-minute cadence LCs for model training and validation. CALNet achieved a recall rate of 99.1%, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Applying it to TESS 2-minute LCs from Sectors 1 to 74, we identified 9,351 new EBs after manual visual inspection, significantly expanding the known sample size. This work highlights the potential of advanced deep-learning techniques in large-scale astronomical surveys and provides a valuable resource for further studies on EBs.</description>

      <title>Leveraging differentiable programming in the inverse problem of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) probe the high-density regime of the nuclear equation of state (EOS). However, inferring the EOS from observations of NSs is a computationally challenging task. In this work, we efficiently solve this inverse problem by leveraging differential programming in two ways. First, we enable full Bayesian inference in under one hour of wall time on a GPU by using gradient-based samplers, without requiring pre-trained machine learning emulators. Moreover, we demonstrate efficient scaling to high-dimensional parameter spaces. Second, we introduce a novel gradient-based optimization scheme that recovers the EOS of a given NS mass-radius curve. We demonstrate how our framework can reveal consistencies or tensions between nuclear physics and astrophysics. First, we show how the breakdown density of a metamodel description of the EOS can be determined from NS observations. Second, we demonstrate how degeneracies in EOS modeling using nuclear empirical parameters can influence the inverse problem during gradient-based optimization. Looking ahead, our approach opens up new theoretical studies of the relation between NS properties and the EOS, while effectively tackling the data analysis challenges brought by future detectors.</description>

      <title>Are there Spectral Features in the MIRI/LRS Transmission Spectrum of K2-18b?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the composition of an exoplanet atmosphere relies on the presence of detectable spectral features. The strongest spectral features, including DMS, look approximately Gaussian. Here, I perform a suite of Gaussian feature analyses to find any statistically significant spectral features in the recently published MIRI/LRS spectrum of K2-18b (N. Madhusudhan et al. 2025). In N. Madhusudhan et al. 2025, they claim a 3.4-$\sigma$ detection of spectral features compared to a flat line. In 5 out of 6 tests, I find the data preferred a flat line over a Gaussian model, with a $\chi^{2}_{\nu}$ of 1.06. When centering the Gaussian where the absorptions for DMS and DMDS peak, I find ln(B) = 1.21 in favour of the Gaussian model, with a $\chi^{2}_{\nu}$ of 0.99. With only $\sim$2-$\sigma$ in favour of Gaussian features, I conclude no strong statistical evidence for spectral features.</description>

      <title>A Distribution-Free Approach to Testing Models for Angular Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel goodness-of-fit strategy is introduced for testing models for angular power spectra characterized by unknown parameters. Using this strategy, it is possible to assess the validity of such models without specifying the distribution of the estimators of the angular power spectrum being used. This holds under general conditions, ensuring the applicability of the method across diverse scenarios. Moreover, the proposed solution overcomes the need for case-by-case simulations when testing different models -- leading to notable computational advantages.</description>

      <title>Testing interacting dark energy with Stage IV cosmic shear surveys through differentiable neural emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ a novel framework for accelerated cosmological inference, based on neural emulators and gradient-based sampling methods, to forecast constraints on dark energy models from Stage IV cosmic shear surveys. We focus on dark scattering (DS), an interacting dark energy model with pure momentum exchange in the dark sector, and train COSMOPOWER emulators to accurately and efficiently model the DS non-linear matter power spectrum produced by the halo model reaction framework, including the effects of baryon feedback and massive neutrinos. We embed the emulators within a fully-differentiable pipeline for gradient-based cosmological inference for which the batch likelihood call is up to $O(10^5)$ times faster than with traditional approaches, producing parameter constraints from simulated Stage IV cosmic shear data running on a single graphics processing unit (GPU). We also perform model comparison on the output chains from the inference process, employing the learnt harmonic mean estimator implemented in the software HARMONIC. We investigate degeneracies between dark energy and systematics parameters and assess the impact of scale cuts on the final constraints. Assuming a DS model for the mock data vector, we find that a Stage IV survey cosmic shear analysis can constrain the DS amplitude parameter $A_{\mathrm{ds}}$ with an uncertainty roughly an order of magnitude smaller than current constraints from Stage III surveys, even after marginalising over baryonic feedback, intrinsic alignments and redshift distribution uncertainties. These results show great promise for constraining DS with Stage IV data; furthermore, our methodology can be straightforwardly extended to a wide range of dark energy and modified gravity models.</description>

      <title>Approximating non-Gaussian Bayesian partitions with normalising flows: statistics, inference and application to cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subject of this paper is the simplification of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling as used in Bayesian statistical inference by means of normalising flows, a machine learning method which is able to construct an invertible and differentiable transformation between Gaussian and non-Gaussian random distributions. We use normalising flows to compute Bayesian partition functions for non-Gaussian distributions and show how normalising flows can be employed in finding analytical expressions for posterior distributions beyond the Gaussian limit. Flows offer advantages for the numerical evaluation of the partition function itself, as well as for cumulants and for the information entropy. We demonstrate how normalising flows in conjunction with Bayes partitions can be used in inference problems in cosmology and apply them to the posterior distribution for the matter density $\Omega_m$ and a dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$ on the basis of supernova data.</description>

      <title>The Legacy of Henrietta Leavitt: A Re-analysis of the First Cepheid Period-Luminosity Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Henrietta Swan Leavitt's discovery of the relationship between the period and luminosity (hereafter the Leavitt Law) of 25 variable stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, published in 1912, revolutionized cosmology. These variables, eventually identified as Cepheids, became the first known "standard candles" for measuring extragalactic distances and remain the gold standard for this task today. Leavitt measured light curves, periods, and minimum and maximum magnitudes from painstaking visual inspection of photographic plates. Her work paved the way for the first precise series of distance measurements that helped set the scale of the Universe, and later the discovery of its expansion by Edwin Hubble in 1929. Here, we re-analyze Leavitt's first Period-Luminosity relation using observations of the same set of stars but with modern data and methods of Cepheid analysis. Using only data from Leavitt's notebooks, we assess the quality of her light curves, measured periods, and the slope and scatter of her Period-Luminosity relations. We show that modern data and methods, for the same objects, reduce the scatter of the Period-Luminosity relation by a factor of two. We also find a bias brightward at the short period end, due to the non-linearity of the plates and environmental crowding. Overall, Leavitt's results are in excellent agreement with contemporary measurements, reinforcing the value of Cepheids in cosmology today, a testament to the enduring quality of her work.</description>
