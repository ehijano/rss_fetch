      <title>When a Paper Has 1000 Authors: Rethinking Citation Metrics in the Era of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Author-level citation metrics provide a practical, interpretable, and scalable signal of scholarly influence in a complex research ecosystem. It has been widely used as a proxy in hiring decisions. However, the past five years have seen the rapid emergence of large-scale publications in the field of large language models and foundation models, with papers featuring hundreds to thousands of co-authors and receiving tens of thousands of citations within months. For example, Gemini has 1361 authors and has been cited around 4600 times in 19 months. In such cases, traditional metrics, such as total citation count and the $h$-index, fail to meaningfully distinguish individual contributions. Therefore, we propose the following research question: How can one identify standout researchers among thousands of co-authors in large-scale LLM papers? This question is particularly important in scenarios such as academic hiring and funding decisions. In this paper, we introduce a novel citation metric designed to address this challenge by balancing contributions across large-scale and small-scale publications. We propose the SBCI index, analyze its theoretical properties, and evaluate its behavior on synthetic publication datasets. Our results demonstrate that the proposed metric provides a more robust and discriminative assessment of individual scholarly impact in the era of large-scale collaborations.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Literature Review of Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Techniques, Metrics, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This systematic review of the research literature on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) provides a focused analysis of the most highly cited studies published between 2020 and May 2025. A total of 128 articles met our inclusion criteria. The records were retrieved from ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and the Digital Bibliography and Library Project (DBLP). RAG couples a neural retriever with a generative language model, grounding output in up-to-date, non-parametric memory while retaining the semantic generalisation stored in model weights. Guided by the PRISMA 2020 framework, we (i) specify explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria based on citation count and research questions, (ii) catalogue datasets, architectures, and evaluation practices, and (iii) synthesise empirical evidence on the effectiveness and limitations of RAG. To mitigate citation-lag bias, we applied a lower citation-count threshold to papers published in 2025 so that emerging breakthroughs with naturally fewer citations were still captured. This review clarifies the current research landscape, highlights methodological gaps, and charts priority directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Analysing the coverage of the University of Bologna's bibliographic and citation metadata in OpenCitations collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on analysing the coverage of publications' metadata available in the Current Research Information System (CRIS) infrastructure of the University of Bologna (UNIBO), implemented by the IRIS platform, within an authoritative source of open research information, i.e. OpenCitations. The analysis considers data regarding the publication entities alongside the citation links. We precisely quantify the proportion of UNIBO IRIS publications included in OpenCitations, examine their types, and evaluate the number of citations in OpenCitations that involve IRIS publications. Our methodology filters and transforms data dumps of IRIS and OpenCitations, creating novel datasets used for the analysis. Our findings reveal that only 36% of IRIS is covered in OpenCitations, with journal articles exhibiting the highest coverage. We identified 5,129,406 citation links pointing to UNIBO IRIS publications. From a purely quantitative perspective, comparing our results with broader proprietary services like Scopus and Web of Science reveals a comparable quantitative coverage in the number of IRIS bibliographic resources included in all the systems analysed (OpenCitations, Scopus and Web of Science) as well as in the number of citations received by them.</description>
