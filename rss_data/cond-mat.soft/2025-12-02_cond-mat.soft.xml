      <title>Understanding the Role of Particle Deformability on the Crystal and Glass formation using Two-dimensional Ring Polymer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft matter systems are common in nature and make up nearly all the essential components necessary for life, from cells to the organelles within those cells. The ability of these soft materials to deform is crucial for the proper functioning of various biological processes, such as blood flow in our veins and arteries. It is vital to understand how deformability influences the normal functioning of these processes. We have investigated an assembly of two-dimensional (2D) polymeric non-overlapping rings via extensive molecular dynamics simulations. The main idea is to study an assembly of model particles with anisotropic deformability using polymer rings. By tuning the degree of deformability of these model deformable particles, we study the dynamic and static properties of the assembly at different densities and temperatures. This deformable particle model might correspond to an assembly of epithelial cells or similar biologically soft bodies. In the limit at which the rings are very rigid with very little deformability, one expects to see the formation of a triangular lattice by the centres of these polymer rings. On the other hand, if one increases the deformability of these polymer rings, due to increased disorder, one observes glass-like dynamical behaviour even for identically sized polymer rings. We also show a transition from a crystalline state to a disordered glassy state driven solely by particle deformability. We observe non-trivial finite-size effects in the dynamics of these glass-forming ring polymers, not seen in usual molecular glass-formers.</description>

      <title>Polar and apolar light-induced alignment of ferroelectric nematic at photosensitive polymer substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface alignment of a recently discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal (NF) is usually achieved by buffed polymer films, which produce a unidirectional polar alignment of the spontaneous electric polarization. We demonstrate that photosensitive polymer substrates could provide a wider variety of alignment modes. Namely, a polyvinyl cinnamate polymer film irradiated by linearly polarized ultraviolet (UV) light yields two modes of surface orientation of the NF polarization. (1) A planar apolar mode, in which the equilibrium NF polarization aligns perpendicularly to the polarization of normally impinging UV light; the NF polarization adopts either of the two antiparallel states. (2) A planar polar mode, produced by an additional irradiation with obliquely impinging UV light. In this mode, there is only one stable azimuthal direction of polarization in the plane of the substrate. The two modes differ in their response to an electric field. In the planar apolar mode, polarization can be switched between two states of equal surface energy. In the planar polar mode, the field-perturbed polarization relaxes back to the single photoinduced easy axis once the field is switched off. The versatility of modes and absence of mechanical contact make the photoalignment of the NF attractive for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Bend Instabilities and Topological Turbulence in Shear-Aligned Living Liquid Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flagellated microswimmers B. Subtilis dispersed in a nematic phase of a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal form a living liquid crystal (LLC). The combination of the passive and active components allows us to analyze how the active component transitions from the shear-imposed alignment into topological turbulence. The lateral extension of the experimental cell is 1000 times larger than the 10-micrometer thickness, to avoid the effect of lateral confinement on the dynamic patterns. The surface anchoring is azimuthally degenerate to avoid permanent anisotropy. After the shear cessation, active forces produced by the microswimmers trigger self-amplifying bend undulations. The amplitude of undulations grows with time and then saturates, while the wavelength increases only slightly. Strong bend stresses at the extrema of undulations are released by nucleating disclination pairs, which multiply to produce topological turbulence. The nucleating pairs and the symmetry axes of the +1/2 disclinations are orientationally ordered. In highly active LLCs, this alignment causes a nonmonotonous time dependence of the disclinations' number, as a fast-moving +1/2 disclination of one pair annihilates a -1/2 disclination of the neighboring pair. The spectra of elastic and kinetic energies exhibit distinct wavevector dependencies caused by the energy cost of the deformed passive nematic background. The study demonstrates how applied shears and a passive viscoelastic background affect the dynamics of active matter. Combined with the previously determined viscoelastic properties of the lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal, the results complete a comprehensive description of the experimentally assessable type of active matter.</description>

      <title>Free Energy and Diffusivity in the Fokker-Planck Theory of Polymer Translocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Fokker-Planck based theory of driven polymer translocation through a narrow nanopore. A bead-spring model of a uniformly charged polyelectrolyte chain translocating through a semi-implicit model of a nanopore embedded in a membrane are used to gain insights into the underlying free energy landscape and kinetics of translocation. The free energy landscape is predicted using metadynamics simulation, an enhanced sampling method. A direct comparison with the theoretical free energy formulation proposed in the literature allows us to introduce a modification related to the entropic contribution in the theory. Additional classical Langevin dynamics simulation runs are performed to obtain the translocation time distribution for polymers of lengths $N$ driven by voltages $V$ through nanopores of radii $r_p$. In agreement with earlier reports, a scaling of the mean translocation time $\langle \tau_\text{LD} \rangle \sim N^\alpha/V$ is observed, with $\alpha \sim 1.40 - 1.48$ depending on the nanopore size. Fitting the mean first passage time given by the Fokker-Planck theory, $\langle \tau_\text{FP}\rangle$,to simulation results helps gain insights into the diffusivity $k_\text{FP}$ used in the theory. We report a scaling of $k_\text{FP}\sim N^\beta$. The $r_p-$dependent values of the exponent $\beta$ significantly deviate from the Rouse theory prediction of $\beta = -1$ for center-of-mass diffusivity of a polymer chain.</description>

      <title>Flow of a colloidal solution in an orthogonal rheometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow of a colloidal solution between two parallel disks rotating with the same angular velocity about two non-coincident axes was studied. The problem has been approached from two perspectives, the first wherein the stress is expressed in terms of a power-law of kinematical quantities, and the second wherein we consider a non-standard model where the symmetric part of the velocity gradient is given by a power-law of the stress. For a range of power-law exponents, the class of models are non-invertible. By varying the material and geometric parameters, changes in the flow behaviour at different Reynolds numbers were analysed. We find that pronounced boundary layers develop even at low Reynolds numbers based on the power-law exponents. The new class of stress power-law fluids and fluids that exhibit limiting stress also show the ability to develop boundary layers.</description>

      <title>Avalanches in active glasses with finite persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the statistics of avalanches in glassy systems of active particles with finite persistence, with and without an externally applied shear. In departing from the infinite-persistence limit and exploring the interplay of internal activity and external driving, we uncover when and why active and passive systems display similar avalanche statistics and where these analogies fail. We find that power-law distributed stress drops emerge only when activity builds long enough correlations, controlled by the persistence length, with exponents that vary from the purely strain-driven case, to the purely activity-driven case, in a smooth fashion. The local structure and scaling of avalanches of plastic rearrangements remains universal across both limit cases, supporting an interpretation of activity as increasing the typical size of the regions involved in a given avalanche. Our results bridge quasistatic shear strain and finite-persistence active yielding, showing that avalanches driven by self-propulsion retain the characteristic fingerprints of long-range stress propagation.</description>

      <title>Trainable amorphous matter: tuning yielding by mechanical annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living organisms can demonstrate highly adaptable and sophisticated responses using memory resulting from repeated exposure to external conditions or training. However, realizing similar adaptability in mechanical responses in inanimate, physical materials presents an outstanding challenge in several fields, including soft matter, materials science, and in the domain of soft robotics, to name a few. Our study focuses on disordered solids, which are model systems that resemble granular matter, foam and other disordered, soft solids. Here, combining bulk rheology, in-situ optical imaging, and numerical simulations, we demonstrate how training via cyclic shear can encode memories that tune the yield point in a unique way and over unprecedented ranges. Our study reveals that such tunability is intricately linked to the plasticity, non-affine deformations, and formation of shear bands. Remarkably, our numerical simulations illustrate that systems with identical internal energies, prepared via different protocols (mechanical or thermal), can display markedly different rheological responses, indicating that energy alone does not determine mechanical behavior. Moreover, while the yield strain increases with training amplitude, the material simultaneously softens, contrasting with the thermal case where both quantities increase monotonically with increasing annealing. Our results open up possibilities for memory-induced tuning of mechanical response in trainable amorphous matter, independently or in combination with thermal annealing, far beyond the material--feature space achievable via the latter alone.</description>

      <title>Translational diffusion coefficients of membrane protein aggregates in free and supported lipid membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is increasing evidence that numerous membrane proteins can assemble into aggregates that modulate their function and affect many cellular processes such as signal transduction and endocytosis. Here, we present a theoretical description of the instantaneous translational diffusion coefficients of transmembrane protein aggregates on free and supported lipid membranes using Kirkwood-Riseman theory. We find that hydrodynamic interactions within protein aggregates must be accounted for, as neglecting them yields several times lower diffusion coefficients. By deriving hydrodynamic radii for free and supported lipid membranes, we identify effective length scales that accurately characterize aggregate diffusivities in the presence of hydrodynamic interactions. These findings motivate the approximation of an aggregate by its outline and a random particle distribution inside it. We show that this approach provides a practical method to accurately determine aggregate diffusion coefficients when the particle locations cannot be resolved. The results presented in this article have immediate implications for the formation and function of membrane protein aggregates.</description>

      <title>On the importance of numerical integration details for homogeneous flow simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sllod equations of motion enable modeling of homogeneous flow at the atomic scale, and are commonly used to predict fluid properties such as viscosity. However, few publicly available codes support such simulations, and those that do often do not implement a reversible numerical integration scheme or have other subtle problems. Here, we demonstrate a reversible and energy-conserving integration scheme for the Sllod equations of motion with error on the order of $\delta t^3$, in line with typical operator splitting integrators used in standard molecular dynamics simulations. We discuss various implementation details, and implement the scheme in LAMMPS where we find that our changes enable more accurate simulation of transient responses, mixed flows, and steady states, especially at high rates of flow. Importantly, we show that a lack of energy conservation can manifest as a systematic error in the direct ensemble average of the pressure tensor, leading to an error in the calculated viscosity which becomes significant at high flow rates.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian dynamics in ice nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In simulation studies of crystallisation, the size of the largest crystalline nucleus is often used as a reaction coordinate to monitor the progress of the nucleation process. Here, we investigate, for the case of homogeneous ice nucleation, whether the nucleus size exhibits Markovian dynamics, as assumed in classical nucleation theory. Using 300 independent nucleation trajectories generated by molecular dynamics, we evaluate the mean recurrence time required to reach selected values of the largest nucleus size. Early recurrences consistently take longer than later ones, revealing a clear history dependence and thus non-Markovian dynamics. To identify the slow modes underlying this behaviour, we analyse several structural descriptors of the nucleus, observing subtle but systematic differences between nuclei at early and late recurrences. By training a neural network on 2,700 short trajectories to learn the committor, we identify relevant collective variables. Based on these features, symbolic regression provides a compact approximation of the committor, i.e., an improved reaction coordinate, which we subsequently test for Markovianity.</description>

      <title>Massart iron oxide nanoparticles in mechanobiology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) derived from the Massart coprecipitation method have played a pioneering role in bridging materials science and biology. Their magnetic moment and nanoscale dimensions have long enabled applications in magnetic resonance imaging, targeted drug delivery, separation technologies, and hyperthermia. Beyond these well-established uses, a growing research direction has emerged at the interface of physics and biology: the application of MNPs in mechanobiology, the study of how mechanical forces regulate cellular and tissue functions. This review examines how Massart MNPs can be used to generate, transmit, and measure forces within living systems. Particular attention is given to interfacial control through advanced surface chemistries, which ensure colloidal stability, minimize toxicity, and preserve the nanoscale integrity of the particles. We also show that the robustness and scalability of Massart synthesis make it ideally suited to the production of biocompatible nanomaterials in quantities required for comprehensive biological studies. Two complementary approaches are discussed. The first exploits MNP assemblies that arise spontaneously within cells, in the form of endosomes. These compartments enable the application of controlled magnetic forces to study both the formation of reconstructed tissues and organoids, and their viscoelastic response. The second focuses on micrometric magnetic wires fabricated from MNPs, used in active microrheology to probe the cytoplasm of living cells over a wide frequency range. Together, these approaches illustrate how MNP assemblies can accurately quantify cellular and tissue mechanics, providing new opportunities for mechanobiological studies and enabling the development of novel readouts of cellular mechanics with potential diagnostic applications.</description>

      <title>Cytoplasmic flow induced by a rotating wire in living cells: Magnetic rotational spectroscopy and finite element simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted intracellular viscosity as a key biomechanical property with potential as a biomarker for cancer cell metastasis. In the context of cellular mechanobiology, magnetic rotational spectroscopy (MRS), which employs rotating magnetic wires of length\,! = 2-8 $\mu$m to probe cytoplasmic rheology, has emerged as an effective method for quantifying intracellular viscoelasticity. This study examines microrheology data from three breast epithelial cell lines, MCF-10A, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231, along with new data from HeLa cervical cancer cells. Here, MRS is combined with finite element simulations to characterize the flow field induced by wire rotation in the cytoplasm. COMSOL simulations performed at low Reynolds numbers show that the flow velocity is localized around the wire, and display characteristic dumbbellshaped profiles. For wires representative of MRS experiments in cells, the product of shear rate and cytoplasmic relaxation time (''$ with $ ~ 1 s) remains below unity, indicating that the flow occurs within the linear regime. This outcome confirms that MRS can reliably measure the zeroshear viscosity of the intracellular medium in living cells. This study also demonstrates that integrating MRS intracellular measurements with COMSOL simulations significantly improves the reliability of in vitro assessments of cytoplasmic mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Exact results and instabilities in the harmonic approximation of active crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condensates of active particles such as cells form almost-crystalline lattices which play a central role in many biological systems. Typically, their properties have been determined merely by analogy to the rather trivial one-dimensional case, leaving a gap between experimentally accessible observables and suitable theoretical models. Within a harmonic approximation, we characterise analytically a two-dimensional triangular lattice of active particles that interact with their nearest neighbours through a general pair potential, obtaining exact expressions for the correlators. We study this "active crystal" as a means of characterising active matter in the dense phase. Our treatment correctly approximates arbitrary pair potentials, rather than demanding an unphysical non-singular bilinear form. We retain "off-diagonal" terms that are routinely neglected despite quantifying the anisotropy of the particles' local potential. From the exact expressions for the correlation matrices, we derive exact results that shed light on the presence (or absence) of crystalline order. We further calculate the mean-squared particle separation, energy, entropy production rate and the onset of a pressure-induced instability resulting in the breakdown of the harmonic approximation. The entropy production rate is found to have a general form that is valid for generic active particles and lattice geometries, while resembling that of non-interacting "active modes".</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram and Criticality of the Modified Primitive Electrolyte Model in Bulk and in Inert and Conducting Confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionic fluids under conductive confinement are central to technologies such as batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. Their interfacial behavior governs energy storage and electrochemical processes. Despite their importance, the thermodynamics of even simple models -- such as the charged Lennard-Jones fluid -- remain underexplored in this regime. We present an extended Wang-Landau sampling approach to efficiently compute the density of states of charged mixtures with respect to the particle number. The method supports simulations in both bulk and confined geometries. Combined with the Constant Potential Method, it also enables to study effects due to confining electrodes. We employ this approach to study symmetric, binary mixtures of charged Lennard-Jones particles -- the modified Restricted Primitive Model -- in bulk, in inert confinement, and in conductive confinement at the potential of zero charge. Our results show that confinement shifts the vapor-liquid critical point to lower temperatures and higher densities compared to bulk, in line with the classical concept of capillary condensation. Importantly, conductive boundaries significantly lower the chemical potential of coexistence relative to inert confinement. These findings offer deeper insight into the phase behavior of ionic fluids in energy-relevant porous environments.</description>

      <title>Onsager Condensation in Chiral Active Matter: Universality of Topological Gas Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a thermodynamic phase transition in chiral active matter. Low-frequency disorder triggers global synchronisation and energy dissipation, while high disorder activates a topological heat pump, generating an inverse energy cascade. This drives the system towards an Onsager dipole, which can be arrested into a metastable vortex glass if dispersion is insufficient to overcome the defect lattice. We propose topological gas dynamics as a universality class governed by the interplay of active disorder and topological sorting, unifying active swarms and classical inviscid fluids.</description>

      <title>Order and shape dependence of mechanical relaxation in proliferating active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective dynamics in proliferating anisotropic particle systems arise from an interplay between growth, division, and mechanical interactions, often mediated by particle shape. In classical models of prolate, rod-like growth, flow-induced alignment and division geometry reinforce one another, leading to robust nematic order under confinement. Here we introduce a complementary regime by considering smooth convex particles whose geometry can be oblate for part or all of their growth cycle, creating a tunable competition between these two alignment mechanisms. Using agent-based simulations of elliptical and rounded-rectangular particles in both channel and open-domain geometries, we systematically vary the division aspect ratio to span regimes of cooperation and competition between ordering cues. We find that oblate growth can reverse classical flow-alignment, destabilize microdomain formation in intermediate regimes, and open up new regimes with modified microdomain dynamics in free expansion and sustained orientation dynamics in channel geometry. These findings are explained by an order- and shape-dependent mechanical relaxation interpretation that is supported by explicit measurements. This sheds new light on the available relaxation pathways and therefore provides key ingredients for effective descriptions of collective anisotropic proliferation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Orientational lineage memory and mechanical ordering during diffusion-limited growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growth and shape formation in crowded multicellular assemblies arise from the interplay of chemical gradients, single-cell expansion and mechanical interactions, making it essential to understand how these processes jointly shape collective organization. Using a particle-based model that resolves nutrient fields as well as cellular orientations and their inheritance, we investigate how orientational order emerges within expanding fronts whose morphology is set by nutrient limitation. We identify a transition in nematic order controlled by front morphology, with orientational memory influencing alignment only on one side of this transition. Under strong inheritance, orientational order varies non-monotonically: both thin active layers (fingering morphologies) and thick active layers (flat fronts) produce strong alignment, whereas intermediate cases are less ordered. Analysis of velocities, reorientation statistics, and stress anisotropies shows that this behavior reflects a shift from inheritance-dominated to mechanically driven alignment that overrides lineage memory. The resulting differences in front speed produce a fitness advantage of orientational memory only in the diffusion-limited, memory-dominated regime. These findings elucidate how nutrient supply, mechanical interactions, and single-cell expansion together shape self-organization during growth.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality and confinement reshape competition in cellular renewing active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular renewing active matter - assemblies of proliferating and apoptotic cells - underlies tissue homeostasis, morphogenesis, and clonal competition. Previous work in one-dimensional periodic systems identified a fitness advantage associated with rapid dead-cell clearance, an "opportunistic" competition mechanism. Extending this framework, we study two-dimensional cellular aggregates and show that dimensionality modifies the interplay between competition mechanisms for clones with different clearance rates: in 2D, opportunistic and homeostatic-pressure-based competition jointly shape clonal selection, to varying degrees. We then introduce an explicit circular confinement to probe how boundaries modulate this interplay. While opportunistic competition persists, distinct timescale-dependent behaviors emerge through weakened homeostatic-pressure-based competition near boundaries. Structural analysis reveals that confinement promotes tangential alignment and spatially heterogeneous homeostatic pressure, thereby reshaping competitive outcomes at tissue edges. Our study connects newly discovered competition mechanisms with more realistic biological contexts, highlighting how dimensionality and spatial constraints influence tissue structures and modulate competition in heterogeneous cell populations, with implications for tumor growth dynamics and tissue development.</description>

      <title>Generic rigidity and accidental modes in metal-organic frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) combine high porosity with structural fragility, raising important questions about their mechanical stability. We develop a rigidity-based framework in which spring networks parameterized by UFF4MOF are used to construct rigidity and dynamical matrices. Large-scale analysis of 5,682 MOFs from the CoRE 2019 database shows that most frameworks are formally over-constrained yet cluster sharply near the isostatic threshold, revealing accidental geometric modes and placing many MOFs near mechanical instability. In the representative case of UiO-66, we show that auxiliary long-range constraints introduced by tuning the neighbor cutoff lift these modes into soft, flat, finite-frequency bands. The results show that rigidity-matrix analysis can rapidly identify MOFs likely to remain mechanically stable. This near-criticality mirrors behavior known from topological mechanics and points to a deeper design principle in porous crystals.</description>

      <title>Linearized instability of Couette flow in stress-power law fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the linearized stability of plane Couette flow for stress-power law fluids, which exhibit non-monotonic stress-strain rate behavior. The constitutive model is derived from a thermodynamic framework using a non-convex rate of dissipation potential. Under velocity boundary conditions, the system may admit three steady-state solutions. Linearized stability analysis reveals that the two solutions on ascending constitutive branches are unconditionally stable, while the solution on the descending branch is unconditionally unstable. For mixed traction-velocity boundary conditions, the base state is unique. Stability depends solely on whether the prescribed traction lies on an ascending (stable) or descending (unstable) branch of the constitutive curve. The results demonstrate that flow stability in these complex fluids is fundamentally governed by both boundary conditions and constitutive non-monotonicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a failure of the wide-spread method of images solution to describe the time evolution of probability distribution in diffusive processes with memory. For a path that touches a target during stochastic evolution, we define its conjugate twin of reflected path, and show that their path probability ratio obeys a relation analogous to the fluctuation theorem. With a key quantity properly identified as the heat, the resultant thermodynamic interpretation of the processes provides a quantitative basis as well as an intuitive physical picture on how and why the method of images breaks down for non-Markovian processes.</description>

      <title>Circular current induced by angular dynamics in swarmalator populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a modified swarmalator model that generates collective rotational currents in phase synchronization. Our approach builds on the original swarmalator model [4], introducing a key modification: the phase-dependent terms in the spatial dynamics are replaced with a simpler driving term that depends on both the phase and a specified origin. We investigate the dynamics of this model through extensive numerical simulations. When the origin is fixed, spiral motions of synchronized and clustered swarmalators emerge from a finite fraction of random initial conditions, resulting in collective currents. To prevent the unrealistic divergence of these spirals, we introduce a dynamic origin, defined as the center of the swarmalators' positions. With this dynamic origin, the system evolves into rotating collective currents, where synchronized swarmalators form stable circular patterns. In both the fixed and dynamic origin cases, we also observe no-current states, in which synchronized swarmalators aggregate near the origin. Finally, we find that the formation of collective currents can be facilitated by tuning the phase variables either at initialization or during the system's evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to measure the stochastic degrees of freedom of a thermal system enables the extraction of energy from an equilibrium heat bath. This is the underlying principle of Maxwell's demon and subsequent information engines. Here, we experimentally realize a microscopic information engine configured as a compressible piston containing a thermalized colloidal suspension. The particle positions are recorded to identify when a predefined region near the wall is empty, allowing the piston to compress the colloidal suspension without applying work on the system. We find that the stored compression energy is universally set by the probability of a positive measurement outcome, which in turn is controlled by parameters such as density and compression step size. We further demonstrate that mechanical work can be extracted during the decompression of the piston, thereby closing the engine's operating cycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of an anisotropic surface tension on the late-stage dilute phase separation dynamics, revisiting the seminal Lifshitz-Slyozov (LS) theory, which traditionally relies on the assumption of isotropic surface tension. Using a perturbative treatment for weak anisotropy, we demonstrate that although the characteristic $t^{1/3}$ drop growth law remains unchanged, the anisotropy causes a significant breakdown of morphological universality. Specifically, we calculate explicitly a one-parameter family of nonequilibrium drop shapes that depend on the scaled drop size. These shapes are close to the equilibrium Wulff shape, but the smaller drops are more spherical and the larger drops have an enhanced anisotropy in comparison to the Wulff shape. We also demonstrate that the the drop size distribution is modified from the isotropic LS distribution at second order in the anisotropy strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07726v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hysterons are elementary units of hysteresis that underlie many complex behaviors of non-equilibrium matter. Because models of interacting hysterons can describe disordered matter, this suggests that artificial systems could respond to mechanical inputs in precise and targeted ways. Specifying the properties of hysterons and their interactions could thus be a general method for realizing arbitrary non-equilibrium behaviors. Elastic structures including slender beams, creased sheets, and shells are clear candidates for artificial hysterons, but complete control of their interactions has seemed impractical or impossible. Here we report a mechanical hysteron composed of rigid bars and linear springs, which has controllable properties and tunable interactions of general sign that can be reciprocal or non-reciprocal. We derive a mapping from the system parameters to the hysteron properties, and we show how collective behaviors of multiple hysterons can be targeted by adjusting geometric parameters on the fly. By transforming an abstract hysteron model into a physical design platform, our work demonstrates a route toward designed materials that can sense, compute, and respond to their mechanical environment.</description>

Abstract: Making use of the Griffith criticality condition recently introduced by Shrimali and Lopez-Pamies (Extreme Mechanics Letters 58: 101944, 2023), this work presents a comprehensive analysis of the single edge notch fracture test for viscoelastic elastomers. The results -- comprised of a combination of a parametric study and direct comparisons with experiments -- reveal how the non-Gaussian elasticity, the nonlinear viscosity, and the intrinsic fracture energy of elastomers interact and govern when fracture nucleates from the pre-existing crack in these tests. The results also serve to quantify the limitations of existing analyses, wherein viscous effects and the actual geometries of the pre-existing cracks and the specimens are neglected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) in liquid crystal samples in the dilute limit, in a Landau--de Gennes theoretical framework. The effects of the suspended NPs are captured by a homogenized energy, as outlined in~\cite{canevari2020design}. For spatially homogeneous samples, we explicitly compute the critical points and minimizers of the modified Landau--de Gennes energy and show that the presence of NP eliminates the first-order isotropic-nematic phase transition, stabilises elusive biaxial phases over some temperature ranges and that the symmetry of the NP boundary conditions or surface treatments dictates the bulk equilibrium phase at high temperatures. We also numerically demonstrate structural transitions from twisted helical director profiles to untwisted director profiles in cholesteric-filled channel geometries, driven by the collective effects of the NPs and increasing temperature. These transitions are reversible upon lowering the temperature in sufficiently large domains, where thermal hysteresis can also be observed. This behaviour opens interesting avenues for tuning the optical properties of confined, nano-doped cholesteric systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the Rayleigh-Plateau instability at the interface between two immiscible liquids of equal viscosity using molecular dynamics simulations. Two types of initial conditions were considered, one with an imposed single-mode perturbation at the interface and the other without any imposed perturbation. Under the single-mode perturbation, the growth rate deviated from the theoretical prediction for small cylinder radii, but progressively approached and agreed with classical macroscopic theory as the radius increased. In contrast, for the unperturbed initial condition, we found a systematic relationship between the breakup time and the minimum radius, in which the power-law exponent increased with increasing radius. These results demonstrate that, even in extremely microscopic systems with cylinder radii on the order of only about fifteen atomic diameters, the growth of the instability can follow macroscopic theoretical predictions when appropriate conditions are imposed, and that the influence of thermal fluctuations on the breakup dynamics becomes increasingly significant as the system radius decreases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper builds on a recently introduced dynamical networking framework, applying it to model motor-driven transport along cytoskeletal filament networks. Within this approach, the networking functional describes the periodic binding and unbinding of motors to available filament sites,whilst accounting for all possible pairing, enabling a field-theoretic treatment of constrained motion in complex networks. In this application, the dynamical networking theory is introduced into a Martin-Siggia-Rose representation of the Langevin dynamics describing the motion of a motor protein and its cargo. Results are presented in a collective description of motors on a network, for two different scenarios, namely homogeneous and non-homogeneous networks. A diffusion coefficient is presented for homogeneous networks, whilst it is shown that various possibilities remain for disordered averaging over network densities for non-homogeneous networks.</description>

Abstract: Fitting two different materials is a versatile methodology in manufacturing complex structures. One of the canonical models for fitting is the snap-fit model, in which flexible materials and rigid structures are assembled by pushing their interlocking components together. The assembly via snap-fit is often accompanied by large deformations of flexible structures and abrupt force drops, highlighting the role of elasticity, geometry, and contact friction. Despite several model studies revealing fundamental mechanics for snap-fit, the current snap-fit design relies on prototyping and empirical rules. In this paper, we analyze a snap-fit model in which a naturally curved beam slips into a rigid hole. We construct an analytical model based on the theory of elastica with contact friction and demonstrate that its predictions are in excellent quantitative agreement with both simulations and experiments. We find three distinct sliding modes: Folding, Pinning, and Unfolding. The classification is systematically organized in a phase diagram based on the geometric parameters of the shells and the hole. Our study complements existing approaches by providing a predictive framework for contact-based structures that involve friction, elasticity, and geometry, and sheds light on a unified understanding of the interactions between an elastic and a rigid body.</description>

Abstract: Slow earthquakes differ from regular earthquakes in their slower moment release and size distribution dominated by smaller events. However, the physical origin of these slow earthquake statistics remains controversial. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that their characteristics emerge from low-friction soft granular shear. To model slow-earthquake fault materials under hydrothermal conditions, we use a low-friction soft hydrogel particle layer floating on lubricating fluid and conduct stick-slip experiments. The observed slip events follow the same laws of both moment release rate and size distribution as with slow earthquakes, contrasting with frictional rigid granular shear. Slip size is determined by the competing effects of shear localization and pressure enhancement with decreasing porosity. These findings indicate that low friction and particle softness in sheared granular systems with sparse contact structures cause slow earthquake statistics, which may be driven by pore fluid dynamics and shear localization within hazardous fault zones.</description>
