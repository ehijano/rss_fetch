      <title>Healthcare Utilization Patterns Among Migrant Populations: Increased Readmissions Suggest Poorer Access. A Population-Wide Retrospective Cohort Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equal access to health ensures that all citizens, regardless of socio-economic status, can achieve optimal health, leading to a more productive, equitable, and resilient society. Yet, migrant populations were frequently observed to have lower access to health. The reasons for this are not entirely clear and may include language barriers, a lack of knowledge of the healthcare system, and selective migration (a "healthy migrant" effect). We use extensive medical claims data from Austria (13 million hospital stays of approximately 4 million individuals) to compare the healthcare utilization patterns between Austrians and non-Austrians. We looked at the differences in primary diagnoses and hospital sections of initial hospital admission across different nationalities. We hypothesize that cohorts experiencing the healthy migrant effect show lower readmission rates after hospitalization compared to migrant populations that are in poorer health but show lower hospitalization rates due to barriers in access. We indeed find that all nationalities showed lower hospitalization rates than Austrians, except for Germans, who exhibit a similar healthcare usage to Austrians. Although around 20\% of the population has a migration background, non-Austrian citizens account for only 9.4% of the hospital patients and 9.79% of hospital nights. However, results for readmission rates are much more divergent. Nationalities like Hungary, Romania, and Turkey (females) show decreased readmission rates in line with the healthy migrant effect. Patients from Russia, Serbia, and Turkey (males) show increased readmissions, suggesting that their lower hospitalization rates are more likely due to access barriers. Considering the surge in migration, our findings shed light on healthcare access and usage behaviours across patients with different nationalities, offering new insights and perspectives.</description>

      <title>Chemometrics-aided Surface-enhanced Raman spectrometric detection and quantification of GH and TE hormones in blood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the use of Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) combined with artificial neural network (ANN) models to detect and quantify growth hormone (GH) and testosterone (TE) in the blood of Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. SERS spectra were recorded from blood samples of SD rats injected with GH, TE, both hormones, and non-injected controls using 785 nm laser excitation. The samples were mixed with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized in distilled water, applied onto a microscope slide, and air-dried. The resulting SERS spectra displayed similar profiles with intensity variations depending on the hormone, revealing specific bands at 658, 798, 878, 914, 932, 1064, 1190, 1354, 1410, and 1658 cm-1. PCA analysis indicated time-dependent intensity changes in bands centered around 1378 (all groups), 658 and 1614 cm-1 (GH-injected rats), and others for different hormone combinations. These variations reflect subtle biochemical changes induced by hormone injections. The ANN models, trained with six PCA scores of blood spiked with various hormone concentrations, showed high accuracy, with coefficients of determination greater than 87.71% and low root mean square error (RMSE) values below 0.6436. The hormone levels in injected rats increased initially and later declined, a trend confirmed by ELISA kits. Although ELISA and SERS produced similar results, SERS offered advantages such as rapid analysis (about two minutes), simple sample preparation, small sample volumes, and non-specificity to hormones. This suggests that SERS, combined with ANN models, could be used to detect exogenous sports dopants. These findings expand the potential applications of SERS in sports science, clinical diagnostics, and biomedical research.</description>

      <title>An automated and time efficient framework for simulation of coronary blood flow under steady and pulsatile conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is the gold standard for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD). FFRCT uses computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to evaluate FFR non-invasively by simulating coronary flow in geometries reconstructed from computed tomography (CT). However, it faces challenges related to the cost of computing and uncertainties in defining patient-specific boundary conditions (BCs). We investigated using time-averaged steady BCs instead of pulsatile ones to reduce computational time and deployed a self-adjusting method for tuning BCs to patient clinical data. 133 coronary arteries were reconstructed from CT images of CAD patients. For each vessel, invasive FFR was measured. Steady BCs for CFD were defined in two steps: i) rest BCs were extrapolated from clinical and image-derived data; ii) hyperemic BCs were computed from resting conditions. Flow rate was iteratively adjusted during the simulation until patient aortic pressure was matched. Pulsatile BCs were defined using the convergence values of steady BCs. Lesion-specific hemodynamic indexes were computed and compared between groups of patients indicated for surgery and those not. The whole pipeline was implemented as a straightforward, fully automated process. Steady and pulsatile FFRCT showed a strong correlation (r=0.988) and correlated with invasive FFR (r=0.797). The per-point difference between the pressure and FFRCT field predicted by the two methods was below 0.01 and 0.02, respectively. Both approaches exhibited good diagnostic performance: accuracy was 0.860 and 0.864, with AUCs of 0.923 and 0.912, for steady and pulsatile cases, respectively. Computational time for steady BCs CFD was approximately 30-fold lower than for the pulsatile case. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using steady BCs CFD for computing FFRCT in coronary arteries and its performance in a fully automated pipeline.</description>

      <title>Motion-Driven Neural Optimizer for Prophylactic Braces Made by Distributed Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint injuries, and their long-term consequences, present a substantial global health burden. Wearable prophylactic braces are an attractive potential solution to reduce the incidence of joint injuries by limiting joint movements that are related to injury risk. Given human motion and ground reaction forces, we present a computational framework that enables the design of personalized braces by optimizing the distribution of microstructures and elasticity. As varied brace designs yield different reaction forces that influence kinematics and kinetics analysis outcomes, the optimization process is formulated as a differentiable end-to-end pipeline in which the design domain of microstructure distribution is parameterized onto a neural network. The optimized distribution of microstructures is obtained via a self-learning process to determine the network coefficients according to a carefully designed set of losses and the integrated biomechanical and physical analyses. Since knees and ankles are the most commonly injured joints, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline by designing, fabricating, and testing prophylactic braces for the knee and ankle to prevent potentially harmful joint movements.</description>

      <title>Dual-Domain CLIP-Assisted Residual Optimization Perception Model for Metal Artifact Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal artifacts in computed tomography (CT) imaging pose significant challenges to accurate clinical diagnosis. The presence of high-density metallic implants results in artifacts that deteriorate image quality, manifesting in the forms of streaking, blurring, or beam hardening effects, etc. Nowadays, various deep learning-based approaches, particularly generative models, have been proposed for metal artifact reduction (MAR). However, these methods have limited perception ability in the diverse morphologies of different metal implants with artifacts, which may generate spurious anatomical structures and exhibit inferior generalization capability. To address the issues, we leverage visual-language model (VLM) to identify these morphological features and introduce them into a dual-domain CLIP-assisted residual optimization perception model (DuDoCROP) for MAR. Specifically, a dual-domain CLIP (DuDoCLIP) is fine-tuned on the image domain and sinogram domain using contrastive learning to extract semantic descriptions from anatomical structures and metal artifacts. Subsequently, a diffusion model is guided by the embeddings of DuDoCLIP, thereby enabling the dual-domain prior generation. Additionally, we design prompt engineering for more precise image-text descriptions that can enhance the model's perception capability. Then, a downstream task is devised for the one-step residual optimization and integration of dual-domain priors, while incorporating raw data fidelity. Ultimately, a new perceptual indicator is proposed to validate the model's perception and generation performance. With the assistance of DuDoCLIP, our DuDoCROP exhibits at least 63.7% higher generalization capability compared to the baseline model. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can generate more realistic image structures and outperform other SOTA approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively.</description>
