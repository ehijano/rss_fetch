      <title>Equivariant trisections for group actions on four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $X$ be a smooth, orientable, connected, closed 4-dimensional $G$-manifold.
  Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a smooth, embedded, $G$-invariant surface in $X$.
  We introduce the concept of a $G$-equivariant trisection of $X$ and the notion of $G$-equivariant bridge trisected position for $\mathcal{S}$ and establish that any such $X$ admits a $G$-equivariant trisection such that $\mathcal{S}$ is in equivariant bridge trisected position.
  Our definitions are designed so that $G$-equivariant (bridge) trisections are determined by their spines; hence, the 4-dimensional equivariant topology of a $G$-manifold pair $(X,\mathcal{S})$ can be reduced to the 2-dimensional data of a $G$-equivariant shadow diagram.
  As an application, we discuss how equivariant trisections can be used to study quotients of $G$-manifolds.
  We also describe many examples of equivariant trisections, paying special attention to branched covering actions, hyperelliptic involutions, and linear actions on familiar manifolds such as $S^4$, $S^2\times S^2$, and $\mathbb{CP}^2$.
  We show that equivariant trisections of genus at most one are geometric, and we give a partial classification for genus-two.</description>

      <title>Corks, exotic 4-manifolds and genus functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every 4-dimensional oriented 2-handlebody can be modified to admit infinitely many exotic smooth structures, and further that their genus functions are pairwise equivalent. We also prove that, for any 4-manifold admitting an embedding into a symplectic 4-manifold with weakly convex boundary, its genus function is algebraically realized as those of infinitely many pairwise exotic 4-manifolds. As a byproduct, we show that for any (possibly non-orientable) 4-manifold, every submanifold of codimension less than two satisfying a mild condition can be modified into infinitely many exotically knotted submanifolds. We also show that, for any two 4-manifolds with non-degenerate intersection forms, algebraic inequivalences of genus functions are stable under connected sums and boundary sums with a certain type of 4-manifolds having arbitrarily large second Betti numbers.</description>

      <title>Beyond almost Fuchsian space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.11284v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An almost Fuchsian manifold is a hyperbolic 3-manifold of the type $S\times \mathbb{R}$ which admits a closed minimal surface (homeomorphic to $S$) with the maximum principal curvature $\lambda_0 &lt;1$, while a weakly almost Fuchsian manifold is of the same type but it admits a closed minimal surface with $\lambda_0 &lt;= 1$. We first prove that any weakly almost Fuchsian manifold is geometrically finite, and we construct a Canary-Storm type compactification for the weakly almost Fuchsian space. We use this to prove uniform upper bounds on the volume of the convex core and Hausdorff dimension for the limit set of weakly almost Fuchsian manifolds, and to prove a gap theorem for the principal curvatures of minimal surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds that fiber over the circle. We also give examples of quasi-Fuchsian manifolds which admit unique stable minimal surfaces without being weakly almost Fuchsian.</description>

      <title>Measure equivalence rigidity of the handlebody groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a connected $3$-dimensional handlebody of finite genus at least $3$. We prove that the handlebody group $\mathrm{Mod}(V)$ is superrigid for measure equivalence, i.e. every countable group which is measure equivalent to $\mathrm{Mod}(V)$ is in fact virtually isomorphic to $\mathrm{Mod}(V)$. Applications include a rigidity theorem for lattice embeddings of $\mathrm{Mod}(V)$, an orbit equivalence rigidity theorem for free ergodic measure-preserving actions of $\mathrm{Mod}(V)$ on standard probability spaces, and a $W^*$-rigidity theorem among weakly compact group actions.</description>

      <title>Measure equivalence rigidity among the Higman groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.00884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that all (generalized) Higman groups on at least $5$ generators are superrigid for measure equivalence. More precisely, let $k\ge 5$, and let $H$ be a group with generators $a_1,\dots,a_k$, and Baumslag-Solitar relations given by $a_ia_{i+1}^{m_i}a_i^{-1}=a_i^{n_i}$, with $i$ varying in $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$ and nonzero integers $|m_i|\neq |n_i|$ for each $i$. We prove that every countable group which is measure equivalent to $H$, is in fact virtually isomorphic to $H$. A key ingredient in the proof is a general statement providing measured group theoretic invariants for groups acting acylindrically on $\mathrm{CAT}(-1)$ polyhedral complexes with control on vertex and edge stabilizers.
  Among consequences of our work, we obtain rigidity theorems for generalized Higman groups with respect to lattice embeddings and automorphisms of their Cayley graphs. We also derive an orbit equivalence and $W^*$-superrigidity theorem for all free, ergodic, probability measure-preserving actions of generalized Higman groups.</description>

      <title>Unstable minimal surfaces in symmetric spaces of non-compact type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that if $\Sigma$ is a closed surface of genus at least 3 and $G$ is a split real semisimple Lie group of rank at least $3$ acting faithfully by isometries on a symmetric space $N$, then there exists a Hitchin representation $\rho:\pi_1(\Sigma)\to G$ and a $\rho$-equivariant unstable minimal map from the universal cover of $\Sigma$ to $N$. This follows from a new lower bound on the index of high energy minimal maps into an arbitrary symmetric space of non-compact type. Taking $G=\mathrm{PSL}(n,\mathbb{R})$, $n\geq 4$, this disproves the Labourie conjecture.</description>

      <title>Nested cobordisms, Cyl-objects and Temperley-Lieb algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a discrete cobordism category for nested manifolds and nested cobordisms between them. A variation of stratified Morse theory applies in this case, and yields generators for a general nested cobordism category. Restricting to a low-dimensional example of the ``striped cylinder'' cobordism category Cyl, we give a complete set of relations for the generators. With an eye towards the study of TQFTs defined on a nested cobordism category, we describe functors Cyl$\to\mathcal{C}$, which we call Cyl-objects in $\mathcal{C}$, and show that they are related to known algebraic structures such as Temperley-Lieb algebras and cyclic objects. We moreover define novel algebraic constructions inspired by the structure of Cyl-objects, namely a doubling construction on cyclic objects analogous to edgewise subdivision, and a cylindrical bar construction on self-dual objects in a monoidal category.</description>
