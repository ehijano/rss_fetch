      <title>Computational approaches for virus host prediction: A review of methods and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of virus-host interactions is critical for understanding viral ecology and developing applications like phage therapy. However, the growing number of computational tools has created a complex landscape, making direct performance comparison challenging due to inconsistent benchmarks and varying usability. Here, we provide a systematic review and a rigorous benchmark of 27 virus-host prediction tools. We formulate the host prediction task into two primary frameworks, link prediction and multi-class classification, and construct two benchmark datasets to evaluate tool performance in distinct scenarios: a database-centric dataset (RefSeq-VHDB) and a metagenomic discovery dataset (MetaHiC-VHDB). Our results reveal that no single tool is universally optimal. Performance is highly context-dependent, with tools like CHERRY and iPHoP demonstrating robust, broad applicability, while others, such as RaFAH and PHIST, excel in specific contexts. We further identify a critical trade-off between predictive accuracy, prediction rate, and computational cost. This work serves as a practical guide for researchers and establishes a standardized benchmark to drive future innovation in deciphering complex virus-host interactions.</description>

      <title>Network Community Detection and Novelty Scoring Reveal Underexplored Hub Genes in Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the modular structure and central elements of complex biological networks is critical for uncovering system-level mechanisms in disease. Here, we constructed weighted gene co-expression networks from bulk RNA-seq data of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial tissue, using pairwise correlation and a percolation-guided thresholding strategy. Community detection with Louvain and Leiden algorithms revealed robust modules, and node-strength ranking identified the top 50 hub genes globally and within communities. To assess novelty, we integrated genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with literature-based evidence from PubMed, highlighting five high-centrality genes with little to no prior RA-specific association. Functional enrichment confirmed their roles in immune-related processes, including adaptive immune response and lymphocyte regulation. Notably, these hubs showed strong positive correlations with T- and B-cell markers and negative correlations with NK-cell markers, consistent with RA immunopathology. Overall, our framework demonstrates how correlation-based network construction, modularity-driven clustering, and centrality-guided novelty scoring can jointly reveal informative structure in omics-scale data. This generalizable approach offers a scalable path to gene prioritization in RA and other autoimmune conditions.</description>

      <title>Generalized promotion time cure model: A new modeling framework to identify cell-type-specific genes and improve survival prognosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell technologies provide an unprecedented opportunity for dissecting the interplay between the cancer cells and the associated tumor microenvironment, and the produced high-dimensional omics data should also augment existing survival modeling approaches for identifying tumor cell type-specific genes predictive of cancer patient survival. However, there is no statistical model to integrate multiscale data including individual-level survival data, multicellular-level cell composition data and cellular-level single-cell omics covariates. We propose a class of Bayesian generalized promotion time cure models (GPTCMs) for the multiscale data integration to identify cell-type-specific genes and improve cancer prognosis. We demonstrate with simulations in both low- and high-dimensional settings that the proposed Bayesian GPTCMs are able to identify cell-type-associated covariates and improve survival prediction.</description>
