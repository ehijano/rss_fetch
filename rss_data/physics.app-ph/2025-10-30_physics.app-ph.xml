      <title>A novel approach to modelling the properties of HEMTs operating in the saturation region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, the ASM-HEMT model, QPZD model and EPFL model are all based on the three-terminal potential as the core, and relate the electrical characteristics such as I-V and C-V to Vd, Vs and Vg, so as to accurately build the HEMT model with high accuracy and fast convergence. However, there has not yet been a model based on three-terminal potentials that can quickly model the velocity saturation effect as well as the carrier concentration distribution and the electric field distribution inside the HEMT, which makes the existing models have to rely on a number of empirical parameters in the modelling process, which lacks the actual physical significance. In previous publications, models for the electric field, carrier concentration distribution based on the effective length of the gate were presented. In this paper, the model proposed in previous publications is improved to enable: (1) the calculation of the current Ids without relying on the Newton iterative method with fast simulation convergence behavior; (2) The Vdsat when the HEMT reaches saturation at different Vgo is redefined instead of using Vdsat = Vgo; (3) The expression of the v-E relationship is redefined relying on the different transport of carriers, which solves the problem of the large model error of the electric field distribution in the region below the gate, and makes the model's accuracy of the I-V characteristic further improved. The model was validated by characterising the I-V and E-V of the HEMT through TCAD simulation with RMSE below 5%.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient wideband and polarization-insensitive SMF-ARF coupling strategy with low back-reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a lensed-fiber based coupling strategy for low-loss interconnection between single-mode fibers and anti-resonant fibers. By optimizing structural and geometric parameters, the design simultaneously achieves high coupling efficiency and suppressed back-reflection. Experimental results demonstrate an insertion loss of 1.2 dB and back-reflection of -36.22 dB at 1550 nm, with excellent spectral stability (below 0.72 dB variation across 1500-1600 nm) and polarization insensitivity (below 0.4 dB polarization dependent loss). The compact structure not only facilitates the fabrication process, but also enables seamless ARF integration into existing optical networks, thereby addressing critical demands for high-capacity data transmission.</description>

      <title>Artificial Transmission Line Synthesis Tailored for Traveling-Wave Parametric Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial transmission lines built with lumped-element inductors and capacitors form the backbone of broadband, nearly quantum-limited traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs). However, systematic design methods for TWPAs, and more generally artificial transmission lines, are lacking. Here, I develop a general synthesis framework for lossless artificial transmission lines by borrowing from periodic structure theory and passive network synthesis. These complementary approaches divide the design space: periodic loading synthesis employs spatial modulation of frequency-independent components, while filter synthesis employs frequency-dependent responses in spatially-uniform components. When tailoring transmission lines for parametric processes, nonlinear elements are added, typically nonlinear inductances in superconducting circuits, while ensuring energy and momentum conservation between interacting tones. Applying this framework, I design a kinetic inductance TWPA with a novel phase-matching architecture, and a backward-pumped Josephson TWPA exploiting an ambidextrous i.e., right-left-handed transmission line.</description>

      <title>2D Canonical Approach for Beating the Boltzmann Tyranny Using Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 60 mV$/$decade subthreshold limit at room temperature, coined as the Boltzmann tyranny, remains a fundamental obstacle to the continued down-scaling of conventional transistors. While several strategies have sought to overcome this constraint through non-thermal carrier injection, most rely on ferroelectric-based or otherwise material-specific mechanisms that require complex fabrication and stability control. Here, we develop a universal theoretical framework showing that intrinsic memory effects in nanometric field-effect transistors can naturally bypass this limit. Within the Landauer-B\"uttiker quantum transport formalism, we incorporate charge-trapping mechanisms that dynamically renormalize the conduction band edge. The resulting analytical expression for the subthreshold swing explicitly links memory dynamics to gate efficiency, revealing that a reduced carrier generation rate or enhanced trapping activity leads to sub-thermal switching, thus breaking the Boltzmann barrier. The model captures key experimental features and provides clear, generalizable design principles, establishing memory-assisted transistors as a robust pathway toward ultra-low-power and multifunctional electronic architectures.</description>

      <title>Molecular simulations of Perovskites CsXI3 (X = Pb,Sn) Using Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cesium based halide perovskites, such as CsPbI3 and CsSnI3, have emerged as exceptional candidates for next generation photovoltaic and optoelectronic technologies, but their practical application is limited by temperature dependent phase transitions and structural instabilities. Here, we develop machine learning interatomic potentials within the LATTE framework to simulate these materials with near experimental accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost compared to previous computational studies. Our molecular dynamics simulations based on the trained MLIPs reproduce energies and forces across multiple phases, enabling large scale simulations that capture cubic tetragonal orthorhombic transitions, lattice parameters, and octahedral tilting with unprecedented resolution. We find that Pb based perovskites exhibit larger octahedral tilts and higher phase transition temperatures than Sn based analogues, reflecting stronger bonding and enhanced structural stability, whereas Sn based perovskites display reduced tilts and lower barriers, suggesting tunability through compositional or interface engineering. Beyond these systems, our work demonstrates that MLIPs can bridge first principles accuracy with simulation efficiency, providing a robust framework for exploring phase stability, anharmonicity, and rational design in next generation halide perovskites.</description>

      <title>Improved operating voltage in InGaN-capped AlGaN-based DUV LEDs on bulk AlN substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Better wall plug efficiency of deep-ultraviolet light emitting diodes (DUV-LEDs) requires simultaneous low resistivity p-type and n-type contacts, which is a challenging problem. In this study, the co-optimization of p-InGaN and n- AlGaN contacts for DUV LEDs are investigated. We find that using a thin 7%InGaN cap is effective in achieving ohmic p-contacts with specific contact resistivity of 3.10x10^{-5} Ohm.cm^2. Upon monolithic integration of p- and n- contacts for DUV LEDs, we find that the high temperature annealing of 800C required for the formation of low resistance contacts to n-AlGaN severely degrades the p-InGaN layer, thereby reducing the hole concentration and increasing the specific contact resistivity to 9.72x10^{-4} Ohm.cm^2. Depositing a SiO2 cap by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) prior to high temperature n-contact annealing restores the low p-contact resistivity, enabling simultaneous low-resistance p- and n-contacts. DUV-LEDs emitting at 268 nm fabricated with the SiO2 capping technique exhibit a 3.5 V reduction in operating voltage at a current level of 400 A/cm^2 and a decrease in differential ON-resistance from 6.4 mOhm.cm^2 to 4.5 mOhm.cm^2. This study highlights a scalable route to high-performance, high-Al-content bipolar AlGaN devices.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical spectroscopy based on pump-probe strobe light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a pump-probe strobe light spectroscopy for sensitive detection of magneto-optical dynamics in the context of hybrid magnonics. The technique uses a combinatorial microwave-optical pump-probe scheme, leveraging both the high-energy resolution of microwaves and the high-efficiency detection using optical photons. In contrast to conventional stroboscopy using a continuous-wave light, we apply microwave and optical pulses with varying pulse widths, and demonstrate magnetooptical detection of magnetization dynamics in Y3Fe5O12 films. The detected magneto-optical signals strongly depend on the characteristics of both the microwave and the optical pulses as well as their relative time delays. We show that good magneto-optical sensitivity and coherent stroboscopic character are maintained even at a microwave pump pulse of 1.5 ns and an optical probe pulse of 80 ps, under a 7 megahertz clock rate, corresponding to a pump-probe footprint of ~1% in one detection cycle. Our results show that time-dependent strobe light measurement of magnetization dynamics can be achieved in the gigahertz frequency range under a pump-probe detection scheme.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic emittance properties of an Fe-doped Beta-Ga2O3(010) photocathode: Ultracold electron emission at 300K and the polaron self-energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of the spectral emission properties of an iron-doped Beta-Ga2O3(010) photocathode at 300K reveal the presence of ultracold electron emission with a 6meV mean transverse energy (MTE) in the 3.5-4.4eV photon energy range (282-354nm). This extreme sub-thermal photoemission signal is consistent with direct emission of electrons photoexcited from the Fe dopant states into the low effective mass and positive electron affinity primary conduction band, and it is superimposed on a stronger signal with a larger MTE associated with an (optical)phonon-mediated momentum resonant Franck-Condon (FC) emission process from a thermally populated and negative electron affinity upper conduction band. For photon energies above 4.5eV, a transition from a long to a short transport regime is forced by an absorption depth reduction to below 100nm and both MTE signals exhibit spectral trends consistent with phonon-mediated FC emission if the polaron formation self-energy is included in the initial photoexcited electron thermalization.</description>

      <title>Disclosing the Impact of Local Host Effects on TADF Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Donor-acceptor (D-A) type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), a key technology of proposed Gen3 organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), is highly sensitive to the rigidity and polarity of the local environment. Specifically, the torsional flexibility of the D-A dihedral angle and the dipole character of charge transfer states give rise to a distribution of TADF dynamics across the emitter ensemble. Here, we employ single molecule spectroscopy to access the photophysics of individual emitters, thus overcoming the limitations of ensemble averaging. Using photon correlation measurements and locally resolved spectral data from single D-A type TADF molecules embedded in host materials of different polarity and rigidity, we derive host-dependent characteristics and distributions in the TADF dynamics. These are directly linked to local conformational freedom and dielectric properties, offering new insight into host-emitter interactions and enabling rational design strategies for optimized host-emitter combinations in OLED applications.</description>

      <title>Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier based on low-intrinsic-loss coplanar lumped-element waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier (JTWPA) based on a low-loss coplanar lumped-element waveguide architecture. By employing open-stub capacitors and Manhattan-pattern junctions, our device achieves an insertion loss below 1~dB up to 12~GHz. We introduce windowed sinusoidal modulation for phase matching, demonstrating that a smooth transition in the impedance-modulation strength effectively suppresses intrinsic gain ripples. Using Tukey-windowed modulation with 8\% impedance variation, we achieve 20\text{--}23-dB~gain over 5-GHz bandwidth under ideal matching conditions. In a more practical circuit having impedance mismatches, the device maintains 17\text{--}20-dB gain over 4.8-GHz bandwidth with an added noise of 0.18~quanta above standard quantum limit at 20-dB gain and $-99$-dBm saturation power, while featuring zero to negative backward gain below the band-gap frequency.</description>

      <title>Geometric Features of Higher-Order Networks via the Spectral Triplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our work is concerned with simplicial complexes that describe higher-order interactions in real complex systems. This description allows to go beyond the pairwise node-to-node representation that simple networks provide and to capture a hierarchy of interactions of different orders. The prime contribution of this work is the introduction of geometric measures for these simplicial complexes. We do so by noting the non-commutativity of the algebra associated with their matrix representations and consequently we bring to bear the spectral triplet formalism of Connes on these structures and then notions of associated dimensions, curvature, and distance can be computed to serve as characterizing features in addition to known topological metrics.</description>
