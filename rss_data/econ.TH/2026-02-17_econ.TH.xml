      <title>Comment on `What's the Matter with Tie-Breaking: Improving Efficiency in School Choice'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The code that was used in Erdil &amp; Ergin (2008, AER) to compute stable improvement cycles sometimes generated unstable matchings. I identify the minor bug in their code that caused this issue, and I present a corrected implementation. While the general insights from the computational experiments obtained by Erdil &amp; Ergin (2008) persist, the true fraction of improving students is slightly smaller than reported, while their average improvement in rank is larger than reported. All theoretical findings in Erdil &amp; Ergin (2008) are unaffected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When multiple informative equilibria are possible in a general cheap talk game, how much information can a principal guarantee herself? To answer this question, I define the notion of worst-case implementation-implementation via the worst non-trivial equilibrium of a mechanism. Under this objective, standard full-commitment mechanisms fail, yielding the principal no more than her no-communication payoff. Partial commitment, however, can provide a strict improvement. The possibility of facing a strategic, uncommitted principal disciplines the agent's reporting incentives across all equilibria. I characterize the worst-case optimal mechanism and payoff under weak assumptions on the players' preferences. The optimal mechanism has a simple two-message structure. The agent's messages are polarizing, designed to maximize their strategic impact on the uncommitted principal's actions. If full commitment is interpreted as decision automation, these results highlight a fundamental complementarity between automated and human decision-makers: the presence of a human aligns the agent's incentives to reveal information, while the automated system leverages these informative reports to take accurate actions. This strategic interaction is often overlooked by literature that compares the two based on standalone decision accuracy. Applications of the model include bail-setting automation, fintech lending, delegation, lobbying, and audit design.</description>

      <title>When to Request Evidence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Appropriate decisions depend on information gathered beforehand, yet such information is often obtained through intermediaries with biased preferences. Motivated by settings such as testing and recertification in organ transplantation, we study the problem faced by a decision-maker who can only access costly information through an agent with misaligned preferences. In a dynamic framework with exogenous decision timing, we ask how requests for verifiable information (evidence) should be scheduled and their implications for the quality of attained choices. When the agent's incentives are ignored, evidence requests do not condition on previously reported information. However, such policies may be susceptible to strategic manipulation by the agent. We show that, in these cases, optimal requests should be biased: additional evidence is more likely to be sought when previous reports favor the agent's preferred outcome.</description>

      <title>Existence of Fair Resolute Voting Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among two-candidate elections that treat the candidates symmetrically and never result in a tie, which voting rules are fair? A natural requirement is that each voter exerts an equal influence over the outcome, i.e., is equally likely to swing the election one way or the other. A voter's influence has been formalized in two canonical ways: the Shapley-Shubik (1954) index and the Banzhaf (1964) index. We consider both indices, and ask: Which electorate sizes admit a fair voting rule (under the respective index)?
  For an odd number $n$ of voters, simple majority rule is an example of a fair voting rule. However, when $n$ is even, fair voting rules can be challenging to identify, and a diverse literature has studied this problem under different notions of fairness. Our main results completely characterize which values of $n$ admit fair voting rules under the two canonical indices we consider. For the Shapley-Shubik index, a fair voting rule exists for $n&gt;1$ if and only if $n$ is not a power of $2$. For the Banzhaf index, a fair voting rule exists for all $n$ except $2$, $4$, and $8$. Along the way, we show how the Shapley-Shubik and Banzhaf indices relate to the winning coalitions of the voting rule, and compare these indices to previously considered notions of fairness.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Social Pressure on Fundamental Choices: Indecisiveness and Deferral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mainstream neoclassical economics, utility maximization is the only engine of individual action, and the other or the social, if it is modeled for decisions deemed fundamental, it is done as a tacit externality parameter affecting an agent's maximized payoff. And even when hitched to a social reference point, a fully decisive and immediate response is invariably assumed. In this paper, we propose a non-standard articulation of the trade-off between personal utility and social distance, one motivated by experimental evidence from psychology, management science, and economics. Our approach deconstructs non-recurrent consumer choice to two stages: a non-decisive first stage in which a binary relation, called one-many ordering, yields an interval, the consideration set, to which the deferred choice is confined; a decisive second stage in which the distance from the average social choice, and future social expectations, are taken into account in present utility. Finally, we embed this indecisive consumer in an exploratory game-theoretic setting, and show that indecisiveness and choice deferral may cause social loss.</description>

      <title>Majoritarian Assignment Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central problem in multiagent systems is the fair assignment of objects to agents. In this paper, we initiate the analysis of classic majoritarian social choice functions in assignment. Exploiting the special structure of the assignment domain, we show a number of surprising results with no counterparts in general social choice. In particular, we establish a near one-to-one correspondence between preference profiles and majority graphs. This correspondence implies that key properties of assignments -- such as Pareto-optimality, least unpopularity, and mixed popularity -- can be determined solely by the associated majority graph. We further show that all Pareto-optimal assignments are semi-popular and belong to the top cycle. Elements of the top cycle can thus easily be found via serial dictatorships. Our main result is a complete characterization of the top cycle, which implies the top cycle can only consist of one, two, all but two, all but one, or all assignments. By contrast, we find that the uncovered set contains only very few assignments.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Framework for Human-AI Collaboration: Complementarity and Correlation Neglect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a decision-theoretic model of human-AI interaction to study when AI assistance improves or impairs human decision-making. A human decision-maker observes private information and receives a recommendation from an AI system, but may combine these signals imperfectly. We show that the effect of AI assistance decomposes into two main forces: the marginal informational value of the AI beyond what the human already knows, and a behavioral distortion arising from how the human uses the AI's recommendation. Central to our analysis is a micro-founded measure of informational overlap between human and AI knowledge. We study an empirically relevant form of imperfect decision-making -- correlation neglect -- whereby humans treat AI recommendations as independent of their own information despite shared evidence. Under this model, we characterize how overlap and AI capabilities shape the Human-AI interaction regime between augmentation, impairment, complementarity, and automation, and draw key insights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06753v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Revised proofs of Kenneth Arrow's impossibility theorem have been presented in prose form, incorporating novel ideas such as decisive sets and pivotal voters. This study develops another approach to proving the theorem. Using a proof calculus in formal logic, we construct a proof with a full mathematical representation. While previous proofs emphasize intuitive accessibility, this one focuses on meticulous derivation and reveals the global structure of the social welfare function central to the theorem.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of voting rules based on majority margins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of voting with ranked ballots, an important class of voting rules is the class of margin-based rules (also called pairwise rules). A voting rule is margin-based if whenever two elections generate the same head-to-head margins of victory or loss between candidates, the voting rule yields the same outcome in both elections. Although this is a mathematically natural invariance property to consider, whether it should be regarded as a normative axiom on voting rules is less clear. In this paper, we address this question for voting rules with any kind of output, whether a set of candidates, a ranking, a probability distribution, etc. We prove that a voting rule is margin-based if and only if it satisfies some axioms with clearer normative content. A key axiom is what we call Preferential Equality, stating that if two voters both rank a candidate $x$ immediately above a candidate $y$, then either voter switching to rank $y$ immediately above $x$ will have the same effect on the election outcome as if the other voter made the switch, so each voter's preference for $y$ over $x$ is treated equally.</description>

      <title>Aggregate Efficiency in Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, in large population games, decentralized information aggregation generically corrects for individual-level biases. This establishes a new testable aggregate efficiency benchmark where the behavior of boundedly rational agents mimics that of fully rational agents. However, we find that structural economic forces such as strategic network formation and profit-maximizing platforms can systematically select pathological environments to exploit individuals' biases, thereby causing aggregate inefficiencies. We characterize these inefficiencies in monopoly and labor markets. Our findings therefore suggest that policy should shift focus from correcting individuals' behavior to monitoring and regulating information structures.</description>

      <title>Interactions across multiple games: cooperation, corruption, and organizational design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Teamwork is vital in many settings, and it is socially beneficial for teams to cooperate in some situations (``good games'') and not in others (``bad games;'' e.g., those that allow for corruption). A team's cooperation in any given game depends on expectations of cooperation in future iterations of both good and bad games. We identify when sustaining cooperation on good games necessitates cooperation on bad games. We then characterize how a designer should optimally assign workers to teams and teams to tasks that involve varying arrival rates of good and bad games. Our results show how organizational design can be used to promote cooperation while minimizing corruption.</description>

      <title>Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases -- OPTiMEM and the Heat Conjecture(s)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite well-meaning scenarios that propose global CO2 emissions will decline presented in every IPCC report since 1988, the trend of global CO2 increase continues without significant change. Even if any individual nation manages to flatten its emissions, what matters is the trajectory of the globe. Together the gulf between climate science and climate economics, plus the urgent need for alternative methods of estimation, provided the incentives for development of our Ocean-Heat-Content (OHC) Physics and Time Macro Economic Model (OPTiMEM) system.
  To link NOAA damages to climate required creating a carbon consumption model to drive a physics model of climate. How fast could carbon be burned and how much coal, oil and natural gas was reasonably available? A carbon model driving climate meant burning the carbon, and modelling how the earth heated up. We developed this using the most recent best greenhouse gas equations and production models for CO2, CH4, N2O, and halogenated gases. This developed an ocean heat content model for the globe. Each step is validated against Known carbon consumption, CO2, temperature, and ocean heat content. This allows a physics founded model of climate costs to be projected.</description>

Abstract: I study the welfare-maximizing allocation of heterogeneous goods when monetary transfers are prohibited. Agents have private cardinal values, and the designer chooses a non-monetary mechanism subject to incentive compatibility and aggregate supply constraints. I provide sufficient conditions under which the optimal mechanism coincides with a competitive equilibrium with equal incomes (CEEI). When these conditions fail, I characterize the optimum for two symmetric goods. I show that when narrow preference margins between goods predict greater need, the designer can sometimes benefit from distorting CEEI by offering a menu containing pure options and bundles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24440v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare the total capital efficiency of secure restaking and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocols. First, we consider the sufficient condition for the restaking graph to be secure. The condition implies that it is always possible to transform such a restaking graph into separate secure PoS protocols. Next, we derive two main results: upper and lower bounds on the required extra stakes to add to the validators of the secure restaking graph to be able to transform it into secure PoS protocols. In particular, we show that the restaking savings compared to PoS protocols can be very large and can asymptotically grow as a square root of the number of validators. We also study a complementary question of aggregating secure PoS protocols into a secure restaking graph and provide lower and upper bounds on the PoS savings.</description>

      <title>The Statistical Fairness-Accuracy Frontier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17622v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study fairness-accuracy tradeoffs when a single predictive model must serve multiple demographic groups. A useful tool for understanding this tradeoff is the fairness-accuracy (FA) Pareto frontier, which characterizes the set of models that cannot be improved in either fairness or accuracy without worsening the other. While characterizing the FA frontier requires full knowledge of the data distribution, we focus on the finite-sample regime, quantifying how well a designer can approximate any point on the frontier from limited data and bounding the worst-case gap. In particular, we derive worst-case-optimal estimators that depend on the designer's knowledge of the covariate distribution. For each estimator, we characterize how finite-sample effects asymmetrically impact each group's welfare and identify optimal sample allocation strategies. Finally, we provide uniform finite-sample bounds for the entire FA frontier, yielding confidence bands that quantify the reliability of welfare comparisons across alternative fairness-accuracy tradeoffs.</description>

      <title>From tug-of-war to Brownian Boost: explicit ODE solutions for player-funded stochastic-differential games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07682v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brownian Boost is a one-parameter family of stochastic differential games played on the real line in which players spend at rates of their choosing in an ongoing effort to influence the drift of a randomly diffusing point particle~$X$. One or other player is rewarded, at time infinity, according to whether~$X$ tends to plus or minus infinity. Each player's net receipt is the final reward (only for the victor) minus the player's total spend. We characterise and explicitly compute the time-homogeneous Markov-perfect Nash equilibria of Brownian Boost, finding the derivatives of the players' expected payoffs to solve a pair of coupled first-order non-linear ODE. Brownian Boost is a high-noise limit of a two-dimensional family of player-funded tug-of-war games, one of which was studied in~\cite{LostPennies}. We analyse the discrete games, finding them, and Brownian Boost, to exemplify key features studied in the economics literature of tug-of-war initiated by~\cite{HarrisVickers87}: a battlefield region where players spend heavily;
  stakes that decay rapidly but asymmetrically in distance to the battlefield; and an effect of discouragement that makes equilibria fragile under asymmetric perturbation of incentive.
  Tug-of-war has a parallel mathematical literature derived from~\cite{PSSW09}, which solved the scaled fair-coin game in a Euclidean domain via the infinity Laplacian PDE. By offering an analytic solution to Brownian Boost, a game that models strategic interaction and resource allocation, we seek to build a bridge between the two tug-of-war literatures.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous RBCs via Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current macroeconomic models with agent heterogeneity can be broadly divided into two main groups. Heterogeneous-agent general equilibrium (GE) models, such as those based on Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) or Krusell-Smith (KS) approaches, rely on GE and 'rational expectations', somewhat unrealistic assumptions that make the models very computationally cumbersome, which in turn limits the amount of heterogeneity that can be modelled. In contrast, agent-based models (ABMs) can flexibly encompass a large number of arbitrarily heterogeneous agents, but typically require the specification of explicit behavioural rules, which can lead to a lengthy trial-and-error model-development process. To address these limitations, we introduce MARL-BC, a framework that integrates deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with real business cycle (RBC) models. We demonstrate that MARL-BC can: (1) recover textbook RBC results when using a single agent; (2) recover the results of the mean-field KS model using a large number of identical agents; and (3) effectively simulate rich heterogeneity among agents, a hard task for traditional GE approaches. Our framework can be thought of as an ABM if used with a variety of heterogeneous interacting agents, and can reproduce GE results in limit cases. As such, it is a step towards a synthesis of these often opposed modelling paradigms.</description>

      <title>Broken Symmetry of Stock Returns -- a Modified Jones-Faddy Skew t-Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that negative skew and positive mean of the distribution of stock returns are largely due to the broken symmetry of stochastic volatility governing gains and losses. Starting with stochastic differential equations for stock returns and for stochastic volatility we argue that the distribution of stock returns can be effectively split in two -- for gains and losses -- assuming difference in parameters of their respective stochastic volatilities. A modified Jones-Faddy skew t-distribution utilized here allows to reflect this in a single organic distribution which tends to meaningfully capture this asymmetry. We illustrate its application on distribution of daily S&amp;P500 returns, including analysis of its tails.</description>
