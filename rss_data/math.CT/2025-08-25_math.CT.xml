      <title>How to build a Hopf algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a functor that inputs a retract in an $(\infty,3)$-category satisfying some adjunctibility conditions and outputs a Hopf algebra in a braided monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category. Provided the braided monoidal category is presentable, any Hopf algebra can be obtained in this way. Our functor specializes to - and provides a higher-categorical explanation for - the Tannakian reconstruction of a Hopf algebra from a monoidal category with duals and a fiber functor.
  Towards this end, we review and develop the lax (aka Gray) tensor product $\otimes$ of $(\infty,\infty)$-categories, and we analyze the "lax smash product" of pointed $(\infty,\infty)$-categories. We compute the lax-$\wedge$-square of the "walking adjunction" and show that its $3$-localization corepresents retracts with some adjunctibilty conditions, whereas the $3$-localization of the "walking monad" corepresents bialgebras. In these terms, our functor is restriction along the lax-$\wedge$-square of the inclusion $\{\text{walking monad}\} \to \{\text{walking adjunction}\}$. After $3$-localization, we show that this restriction inverts a certain shear map, proving the existence of an antipode.
  We discuss generalizations of this construction to Hopf monads, analyze additional adjunctibility conditions and their interplay with integrals and cointegrals, and finally explain how variants of classical Tannakian reconstruction fit into our scheme.</description>

      <title>Idempotence for relative monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the concept of idempotence for relative monads, which exhibits several subtleties not present for non-relative monads. In particular, there is a bifurcation of notions of idempotence in the relative setting, which are indistinguishable for idempotent monads. As a special case, we obtain several characterisations of idempotence for monads in extension form.</description>

      <title>The action of an inverse semigroup on its Stone-\v{C}ech compactification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the Stone-\v{C}ech transformation groupoid $\mathcal{G} = \mathcal{S}\ltimes\beta\mathcal{S}$ of an inverse semigroup $\mathcal{S}$. This groupoid occurs as a model for the inverse semigroup Roe algebra $\mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{S}}$ of Lledo and Martinez; in particular, the action of $\mathcal{S}$ on $\beta\mathcal{S}$ is amenable in the sense of Exel and Starling if and only if the reduced C$^*$-algebra $\text{C}^*_r(\mathcal{S})$ is exact. We prove that the properties of being Hausdorff, principal, and effective are all equivalent for $\mathcal{G}$, and give an algebraic condition on $\mathcal{S}$ equivalent to the Hausdorffness of $\mathcal{G}$. Finally, we show that the Hausdorffness of Exel's tight groupoid $\mathcal{G}_{\text{tight}}(\mathcal{S})$ is necessary for the Hausdorffness of $\mathcal{G}$.</description>

      <title>The Balmer spectrum of pseudo-coherent complexes over a discrete valuation ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the derived category of pseudo-coherent complexes over a noetherian commutative ring, building on prior work by Matsui-Takahashi. Our main theorem is a computation of the Balmer spectrum of this category in the case of a discrete valuation ring. We prove that it coincides with the spectral space associated to a bounded distributive lattice of asymptotic equivalence classes of monotonic sequences of natural numbers. The proof of this theorem involves an extensive study of generation behaviour in the derived category of pseudo-coherent complexes. We find that different types of generation are related to different asymptotic boundedness conditions on the growth of torsion in homology. Consequently, we introduce certain distributive lattices of (equivalence classes of) monotonic sequences where the partial orders are defined by different notions of asymptotic boundedness. These lattices, and the spectral spaces corresponding to them via Stone duality, may be of independent interest. The complexity of these spectral spaces shows that, even in the simplest nontrivial case, the spectrum of pseudo-coherent complexes is vastly more complicated than the spectrum of perfect complexes. From a broader perspective, these results demonstrate that the spectrum of a rigid tensor-triangulated category can expand tremendously when we pass to a (non-rigid) tensor-triangulated category which contains it.</description>

      <title>Cartesian differential categories as skew enriched categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.02554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhibit the cartesian differential categories of Blute, Cockett and Seely as a particular kind of enriched category. The base for the enrichment is the category of commutative monoids -- or in a straightforward generalisation, the category of modules over a commutative rig $k$. However, the tensor product on this category is not the usual one, but rather a warping of it by a certain monoidal comonad $Q$. Thus the enrichment base is not a monoidal category in the usual sense, but rather a skew monoidal category in the sense of Szlach\'anyi. Our first main result is that cartesian differential categories are the same as categories with finite products enriched over this skew monoidal base.
  The comonad $Q$ involved is, in fact, an example of a differential modality. Differential modalities are a kind of comonad on a symmetric monoidal $k$-linear category with the characteristic feature that their co-Kleisli categories are cartesian differential categories. Using our first main result, we are able to prove our second one: that every small cartesian differential category admits a full, structure-preserving embedding into the cartesian differential category induced by a differential modality (in fact, a monoidal differential modality on a monoidal closed category -- thus, a model of intuitionistic differential linear logic). This resolves an important open question in this area.</description>

      <title>Fusion 3-Categories for Duality Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fusion 3-categorical symmetries for quantum theories in (3+1)d with self-duality defects. Such defects have been realized physically by half-space gauging in theories with 1-form symmetries $A[1]$ for an abelian group $A$, and have found applications in the continuum and the lattice. These fusion 3-categories will be called (generalized) Tambara-Yamagami fusion 3-categories $(\mathbf{3TY})$. We consider the Brauer-Picard and Picard 4-groupoids to construct these categories using a 3-categorical version of the extension theory introduced by Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik. These two 4-groupoids correspond to the construction of duality defects either directly in 4d, or from the 5d Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT). The Witt group of non-degenerate braided fusion 1-categories naturally appears in the aforementioned 4-groupoids and represents enrichments of standard duality defects by (2+1)d TFTs. Our main objective is to study graded extensions of the fusion 3-category $\mathbf{3Vect}(A[1])$. Firstly, we use invertible bimodule 3-categories and the Brauer-Picard 4-groupoid. Secondly, we use that the Brauer-Picard 4-groupoid of $\mathbf{3Vect}(A[1])$ can be identified with the Picard 4-groupoid of its Drinfeld center. Moreover, the Drinfeld center of $\mathbf{3Vect}(A[1])$, which represents topological defects of the SymTFT, is completely described by a sylleptic strongly fusion 2-category formed by topological surface defects of the SymTFT. These are classified by a finite abelian group equipped with an alternating 2-form. We relate the Picard 4-groupoid of the corresponding braided fusion 3-categories with a generalized Witt group constructed from certain graded braided fusion 1-categories using a twisted Deligne tensor product. We perform explicit computations for $\mathbb{Z}/2$ and $\mathbb{Z}/4$ graded $\mathbf{3TY}$ categories.</description>

      <title>Projective crossed modules in semi-abelian categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize projective objects in the category of internal crossed modules within any semi-abelian category. When this category forms a variety of algebras, the internal crossed modules again constitute a semi-abelian variety, ensuring the existence of free objects, and thus of enough projectives. We show that such a variety is not necessarily Schreier, but satisfies the so-called Condition (P) -- meaning the class of projectives is closed under protosplit subobjects -- if and only if the base variety satisfies this condition. As a consequence, the non-additive left chain-derived functors of the connected components functor are well defined in this context.</description>

      <title>Ultracategories as colax algebras for a pseudo-monad on CAT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show a result inspired by a conjecture by Shulman claiming that ultracategories as defined by Lurie are normal colax algebras for a certain pseudo-monad on the category of categories CAT. Such definition allows us to regard left and right ultrafunctors as defined by Lurie as instances of lax/colax algebras morphisms</description>

      <title>Branching space of precubical set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the notion of short natural directed path, we introduce the homotopy branching space of a precubical set. It is unique only up to homotopy equivalence. We prove that, for any precubical set, it is homotopy equivalent to the branching space of any q-realization, any m-realization and any h-realization of the precubical set as a flow. As an application, we deduce the invariance of the homotopy branching space and of the branching homology up to cubical subdivision. By reversing the time direction, the same results are obtained for the merging space and the merging homology of a precubical set.</description>
