      <title>On arc-density of pushably $3$-critical oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An oriented graph $\overrightarrow{G}$ is pushably $k$-critical if it is not pushably $k$-colorable, but every proper subgraph of $\overrightarrow{G}$ is. The main result of this article is that every pushably $3$-critical oriented graph on $n$ vertices, but for four exceptions, has at least $\frac{15n+2}{13}$ arcs, and that this bound is tight. As an application of this result, we show that the class of oriented graphs with maximum average degree strictly less than $\frac{30}{13}$ and girth at least $5$, which includes all oriented planar and projective planar graphs with girth at least $15$, have pushable chromatic number at most $3$. Moreover, we provide an exhaustive list of pushably $3$-critical graphs with maximum average degree equal to $\frac{30}{13}$ and a pushably $3$-critical orientation of a $4$-cycle to prove the tightness of our bound with respect to both maximum average degree and girth. We also show that these classes of oriented graphs admit a homomorphism to an oriented planar graph on six vertices (an orientation of $K_{2,2,2}$) which (tightly) improves a result due to Borodin \textit{et al.} [Discrete Mathematics 1998]. Furthermore, for these classes of oriented graphs, we prove that the $2$-dipath $L(p,q)$ and the oriented $L(p,q)$ spans are upper bounded by $2p+3q$ for all $q \leq p$. All these implications improve previously known results.</description>

      <title>On the edge expansion of random polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $0/1$-polytope in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the convex hull of a subset of $\{0,1\}^n$. The graph of a polytope $P$ is the graph whose vertices are the zero-dimensional faces of $P$ and whose edges are the one-dimensional faces of $P$. A conjecture of Mihail and Vazirani states that the edge expansion of the graph of every $0/1$-polytope is at least one. We study a random version of the problem, where the polytope is generated by selecting vertices of $\{0,1\}^n$ independently at random with probability $p\in (0,1)$. Improving earlier results, we show that, for any $p\in (0,1)$, with high probability the edge expansion of the random $0/1$-polytope is bounded from below by an absolute constant.</description>

      <title>A Note on Constructive Canonical Splitter Strategies in Nowhere Dense Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radius-$r$ splitter game is played on a graph $G$ between two players: Splitter and Connector. In each round, Connector selects a vertex $v$, and the current game arena is restricted to the radius-$r$ neighborhood of $v$. Then Splitter removes a vertex from this restricted subgraph. The game ends, and Splitter wins, when the arena becomes empty. Splitter aims to end the game as quickly as possible, while Connector tries to prolong it for as long as possible. The splitter game was introduced by Grohe, Kreutzer and Siebertz to characterize nowhere dense graph classes. They showed that a class $\mathscr{C}$ of graphs is nowhere dense if and only if for every radius $r$ there exists a number $\ell$ such that Splitter has a strategy on every $G\in \mathscr{C}$ to win the radius-$r$ splitter game in at most $\ell$ rounds. It was recently proved by Ohlmann et al. that there are only a bounded number of possible Splitter moves that are progressing, that is, moves that lead to an arena where Splitter can win in one less round. The proof of Ohlmann et al. is based on the compactness theorem and does not give a constructive bound on the number of progressing moves. In this work, we give a simple constructive proof, showing that if Splitter can force a win in the radius-$r$ game in $k$ rounds, then there are at most $(2r+1)^{\,2^{k-1}-1}$ progressing moves.</description>

      <title>Toward Minimum Graphic Parity Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuits composed of CNOT and $R_z$ are fundamental building blocks of many quantum algorithms, so optimizing the synthesis of such quantum circuits is crucial. We address this problem from a theoretical perspective by studying the graphic parity network synthesis problem. A graphic parity network for a graph $G$ is a quantum circuit composed solely of CNOT gates where each edge of $G$ is represented in the circuit, and the final state of the wires matches the original input. We aim to synthesize graphic parity networks with the minimum number of gates, specifically for quantum algorithms addressing combinatorial optimization problems with Ising formulations. We demonstrate that a graphic parity network for a connected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges requires at least $m+n-1$ gates. This lower bound can be improved to $m+\Omega(m) = m+\Omega(n^{1.5})$ when the shortest cycle in the graph has a length of at least five. We complement this result with a simple randomized algorithm that synthesizes a graphic parity network with expected $m + O(n^{1.5}\sqrt{\log n})$ gates. Additionally, we begin exploring connected graphs that allow for graphic parity networks with exactly $m+n-1$ gates. We conjecture that all such graphs belong to a newly defined graph class. Furthermore, we present a linear-time algorithm for synthesizing minimum graphic parity networks for graphs within this class. However, this graph class is not closed under taking induced subgraphs, and we show that recognizing it is $\textsf{NP}$-complete, which is complemented with a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm parameterized by the treewidth.</description>

      <title>Directed Temporal Tree Realization for Periodic Public Transport: Easy and Hard Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of the directed periodic temporal graph realization problem. This work is motivated by the design of periodic schedules in public transport with constraints on the quality of service. Namely, we require that the fastest path between (important) pairs of vertices is upper bounded by a specified maximum duration, encoded in an upper distance matrix $D$. While previous work has considered the undirected version of the problem, the application in public transport schedule design requires the flexibility to assign different departure times to the two directions of an edge. A problem instance can only be feasible if all values of the distance matrix are at least shortest path distances. However, the task of realizing exact fastest path distances in a periodic temporal graph is often too restrictive. Therefore, we introduce a minimum slack parameter $k$ that describes a lower bound on the maximum allowed waiting time on each path. We concentrate on tree topologies and provide a full characterization of the complexity landscape with respect to the period $\Delta$ and the minimum slack parameter $k$, showing a sharp threshold between NP-complete cases and cases which are always realizable. We also provide hardness results for the special case of period $\Delta = 2$ for general directed and undirected graphs.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of Bases in Matroid with Exponentially Large Ground Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When we deal with a matroid ${\mathcal M}=(U,{\mathcal I})$, we usually assume that it is implicitly given by means of the independence (IND) oracle. Time complexity of many existing algorithms is polynomially bounded with respect to $|U|$ and the running time of the IND-oracle. However, they are not efficient any more when $U$ is exponentially large in some context. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for enumerating matroid bases such that the time complexity does not depend on $|U|$. For some integer $L$, the first algorithm enumerates the first $L$ minimum-weight bases in incremental-polynomial time and the remaining ones in polynomial-delay. To design the algorithm, we assume two oracles other than the IND-oracle: the MinB-oracle that returns a minimum basis and the REL-oracle that returns a relevant element one by one in non-decreasing order of weight. The proposed algorithm is applicable to enumeration of minimum bases of binary matroids from cycle space and cut space, all of which have exponentially large $U$ with respect to a given graph. The highlight in this context is that, to design the REL-oracle for cut space, we develop the first polynomial-delay algorithm that enumerates all relevant cuts of a given graph in non-decreasing order of weight. The second algorithm enumerates all sets of linearly independent $r$-dimensional $r$ vectors over $\mathit{GF}(2)$ in polynomial-delay, which immediately yields a polynomial-delay algorithm %%with respect to the matroid rank $r$ that enumerates all unweighted bases of a binary matroid such that elements are closed under addition.</description>
