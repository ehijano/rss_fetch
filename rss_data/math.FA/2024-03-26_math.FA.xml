      <title>Uniqueness and convergence of resistance forms on unconstrained Sierpinski carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the uniqueness of self-similar $D_4$-symmetric resistance forms on unconstrained Sierpinski carpets ($\mathcal{USC}$'s). Moreover, on a sequence of $\mathcal{USC}$'s $K_n, n\geq 1$ converging in Hausdorff metric, we show that the associated diffusion processes converge in distribution if and only if the geodesic metrics on $K_n, n\geq 1$ are equicontinuous with respect to the Euclidean metric.</description>

      <title>Some Generalizations of Mercer inequality and its operator extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Mercer inequality and its operator extension for superquadratic functions. In particular, we give a more general form of the Mercer inequality by replacing some constants by positive operators. As some consequences, our results produce a Jensen operator inequality for superquadratic functions. Moreover, we present some Mercer inequalities of Hermite-Hadamard's type.</description>

      <title>Quasi-rigid operators and hyper-recurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study recurrent operators from a new perspective by introducing the notion of hyper-recurrent operators and establish robust connections with quasi-rigid operators. For example, we prove that a recurrent operator on a separable Banach space is quasi-rigid if and only if it is a linear factor of a hyper-recurrent operator, and show that the quasi-rigid operators found in Costakis, Manoussos and Parissis's work, along with many others, are, in fact, hyper-recurrent operators. Furthermore, we provide a negative answer, using a class of operators introduced by Tapia, to the question by Costakis et al. whether $T \oplus T$ is recurrent whenever $T$ is.</description>

      <title>Mass Concentration of Two-Spinless Fermi Systems with Attractive Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the two-spinless mass-critical Fermi systems with attractive interactions and trapping potentials. We prove that ground states of the system exist, if and only if the strength $a$ of attractive interactions satisfies $0&lt;a&lt;a_2^*$, where $0&lt;a_2^*&lt;+\infty$ is the best constant of a dual finite-rank Lieb-Thirring inequality. By the blow-up analysis of many-fermion systems, we show that ground states of the system concentrate at the flattest minimum points of the trapping potential $V(x)$ as $a\nearrow a_2^*$.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet forms on unconstrained Sierpinski carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.01529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct symmetric self-similar Dirichlet forms on unconstrained Sierpinski carpets, which are natural extension of planar Sierpinski carpets by allowing the small cells to live off the $1/k$ grids. The intersection of two cells can be a line segment of irrational length, and the non-diagonal assumption is dropped in this recurrent setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide explicit lower bounds with respect to some quantities of interest (parameters of the underlying distribution, dimension, geometrical characteristics of the domain, position of the origin, etc.) on the spectral gap of log-concave probability measures on convex bodies. Our results are illustrated by some classical and less classical examples.</description>

      <title>Banach Spaces with the Lebesgue Property of Riemann Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Banach space is said to have the Lebesgue property if every Riemann-integrable function $f:[0,1]\to X$ is Lebesgue almost everywhere continuous. We give a characterization of the Lebesgue property in terms of a new sequential asymptotic structure that is strictly between the notions of spreading and asymptotic models. We also reproduce an apparently lost theorem of Pelczynski and da Rocha Filho that a subspace $X\subset L_{1}[0,1]$ has the Lebesgue property if every spreading model of $X$ is equivalent to the unit vector basis of $\ell_{1}$.</description>

      <title>On improvements of the Hardy, Copson and Rellich inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a method of factorization and by introducing a generalized discrete Dirichlet's Laplacian matrix $(-\Delta_{\Lambda})$, we establish an extended improved discrete Hardy's inequality and Rellich inequality in one dimension. We prove that the discrete Copson inequality (E.T. Copson, \emph{Notes on a series of positive terms}, J. London Math. Soc., 2 (1927), 9-12.) in one-dimension admits an improvement. We also prove that the improved Copson's weights are optimal (in fact \emph{critical}). It is shown that improvement of the Knopp inequalities (Knopp in J. London Math. Soc. 3(1928), 205-211 and 5(1930), 13-21) lies on improvement of the Rellich inequalities. Further, an improvement of the generalized Hardy's inequality (Hardy in Messanger of Math. 54(1925), 150-156) in a special case is obtained.</description>

      <title>Analytic Besov functional calculus for several commuting operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates when analytic Besov functions of $n$ variables act on the generators of $n$ commuting $C_0$-semigroups on a Banach space. The theory for $n=1$ has already been published, and the present paper uses a different approach to that case as well as extending to the cases when $n\ge2$. It also clarifies some spectral mapping properties and provides some operator norm estimates.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic order of the quantization error for a class of self-similar measures with overlaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01103v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N$ be a set of equi-contractive similitudes on $\mathbb{R}^1$ satisfying the finite-type condition. We study the asymptotic quantization error for self-similar measures $\mu$ associated with $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N$ and a positive probability vector. With a verifiable assumption, we prove that the upper and lower quantization coefficient for $\mu$ are both bounded away from zero and infinity. This can be regarded as an extension of Graf and Luschgy's result on self-similar measures with the open set condition. Our result is applicable to a significant class of self-similar measures with overlaps, including Erd\"{o}s measure, the $3$-fold convolution of the classical Cantor measure and the self-similar measures on some $\lambda$-Cantor sets.</description>

      <title>Spectral Triples on Thermodynamic Formalism and Dixmier Trace Representations of Gibbs: theory and examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:1804.01362v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study spectral triples and non-commutative expectations associated to expanding and weakly expanding maps. In order to do so, we generalize the Perron-Frobenius-Ruelle theorem and obtain a polynomial decay of the operator, which allows to prove differentiability of a dynamically defined $\zeta$-function at its critical parameter. We then generalize Sharp's construction of spectral triples to this setting and provide criteria when the associated spectral metric is non-degenerate and when the non-commutative expectation of the spectral triple is colinear to the integration with respect to the associated equilibrium state from thermodynamic formalism. Due to our general setting, we are able to simultaneously analyse expanding maps on manifolds or connected fractals, subshifts of finite type as well as the Dyson model from statistical physics, which underlines the unifying character of noncommutative geometry. Furthermore, we derive an explicit representation of the $\zeta$-function associated to a particular class of pathological continuous potentials, giving rise to examples where the representation as a non-commutative expectation via the associated zeta function holds, and others where it does not hold.</description>

      <title>Propagation of anisotropic Gabor wave front sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show a result on propagation of the anisotropic Gabor wave front set for linear operators with a tempered distribution Schwartz kernel. The anisotropic Gabor wave front set is parametrized by a positive parameter relating the space and frequency variables. The anisotropic Gabor wave front set of the Schwartz kernel is assumed to satisfy a graph type criterion. The result is applied to a class of evolution equations that generalizes the Schr\"odinger equation for the free particle. The Laplacian is replaced by any partial differential operator with constant coefficients, real symbol and order at least two.</description>

Abstract: We study the uniform ergodicity property for non-invertible topological and measure-preserving dynamical systems. It is shown that for topological dynamical systems uniform ergodicity is equivalent to eventually periodicity and that for measure preserving systems it is equivalent to periodicity. To obtain our results, we prove a result on the long-term behavior of lattice homomorphisms that have $1$ isolated in its spectrum.</description>
