      <title>Localisation without supersymmetry: towards exact results from Dirac structures in 3D $N = 0$ gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show, by introducing purely auxiliary gluinos and scalars, that the quantum path integral for a class of 3D interacting non-supersymmetric gauge theories localises. The theories in this class all admit a `Manin gauge theory' formulation, that we introduce; it is obtained by enhancing the gauge algebra of the theory to a Dirac structure inside a Manin pair. This machinery allows us to do localisation computations for every theory in this class at once, including for 3D Yang-Mills theory, and for its Third Way deformation; the latter calculation casts the Third Way path integral into an almost 1-loop exact form.</description>

      <title>Waves on Mazes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One way to describe the entropy of black holes comes from partitioning momentum charge across fractionated intersecting brane systems. Here we construct $\frac{1}{8}$-BPS solutions by adding momentum to a maze of M2-brane strips stretched between M5 branes. Before the addition of momentum, the $\frac{1}{4}$-BPS supergravity solution describing the maze is governed by a master function obeying a complicated Monge-Amp\`ere equation. Given such a solution, we show that one can add momentum waves without modifying the $\frac{1}{4}$-BPS M2-M5 background. Remarkably, these excitations are fully determined by a layered set of $\textit{linear}$ equations. The fields responsible for carrying the momentum are parameterized by arbitrary functions of a null direction, and have exactly the same structure as in brane world-volume constructions. The fact that the momentum and flux excitations of the M2-M5-P system are governed by a linear structure brings us one step closer to using supergravity solutions to capture the entropy of supersymmetric black-holes.</description>

      <title>From area metric backgrounds to cosmological constant and corrections to the Polyakov action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Area metrics and area metric backgrounds provide a unified framework for quantum gravity. They encode physical degrees of freedom beyond those of a metric. These non-metric degrees of freedom must be suppressed by a potential at sufficiently high energy scales to ensure that in the infrared regime classical gravity is recovered. On this basis, we first study necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions for an area metric to be induced by a metric. Second, we consider candidate potentials for the area metric and point out a possible connection between the reduction of area metric geometry to metric geometry on the one hand, and the smallness of the cosmological constant on the other. Finally, we consider modifications of the Nambu-Goto action for a string, from a metric background to an area metric background. We demonstrate that area metric perturbations introduce an interaction corresponding to a singular vertex operator in the classically equivalent Polyakov action. The implications of these types of vertex operators for the quantum theory remain to be understood.</description>

      <title>Non-saturation of Bootstrap Bounds by Hyperbolic Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years the conformal bootstrap has produced surprisingly tight bounds on many non-perturbative CFTs. It is an open question whether such bounds are indeed saturated by these CFTs. A toy version of this question appears in a recent application of the conformal bootstrap to hyperbolic orbifolds, where one finds bounds on Laplace eigenvalues that are exceptionally close to saturation by explicit orbifolds. In some instances, the bounds agree with the actual values to 11 significant digits. In this work we show, under reasonable assumptions about the convergence of numerics, that these bounds are not in fact saturated. In doing so, we find formulas for the OPE coefficients of hyperbolic orbifolds, using links between them and the Rankin-Cohen brackets of modular forms.</description>

      <title>Symmetry fractionalization and duality defects in Maxwell theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Maxwell theory on a non-spin manifold. Depending on the choice of statistics for line operators, there are three non-anomalous theories and one anomalous theory with different symmetry fractionalizations. We establish the gauging maps that connect the non-anomalous theories by coupling them to a discrete gauge theory. We also construct topological interfaces associated with $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ duality and gauging of electric and magnetic one-form symmetries. Finally, by stacking the topological interfaces, we compose various kinds of duality defects, which lead to non-invertible symmetries of non-spin Maxwell theories.</description>

      <title>End of The World brane networks for infinite distance limits in CY moduli space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical Cobordism provides a powerful method to probe infinite distance limits in moduli/field spaces parameterized by scalars constrained by generic potentials, employing configurations of codimension-1 end of the world (ETW) branes. These branes, characterized in terms of critical exponents, mark codimension-1 boundaries in the spacetime in correspondence of finite spacetime distance singularities at which the scalars diverge. Using these tools, we explore the network of infinite distance singularities in the complex structure moduli space of Calabi-Yau fourfolds compactifications in M-theory with a four-form flux turned on, which is described in terms of normal intersecting divisors classified by asymptotic Hodge theory. We provide spacetime realizations for these loci in terms of networks of intersecting codimension-1 ETW branes classified by specific critical exponents which encapsulate the relevant information of the asymptotic Hodge structure characterizing the corresponding divisors.</description>

      <title>Wormholes in the axiverse, and the species scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a large class of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ low-energy realizations of the axiverse satisfying various quantum gravity constraints. We propose a novel upper bound on the ultimate UV cutoff of the effective theory, namely the species scale, which only depends on data available at the two-derivative level. Its dependence on the moduli fields and the number $N$ of axions matches expectations from other independent considerations. After an assessment of the regime of validity of the effective field theory, we investigate the non-perturbative gravitational effects therein. We identify a set of axionic charges supported by extremal and non-extremal wormhole configurations. We present a universal class of analytic wormhole solutions, explore their deformations, and analyze the relation between wormhole energy scales and species scale. The connection between these wormholes and a special subclass of BPS fundamental instantons is discussed, and an argument in favor of the genericity of certain axion-dependent effective superpotentials is provided. We find a lower bound increasing with $N\gg 1$ on the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient, resulting in an exponential suppression of non-extremal wormhole effects. Our claims are illustrated and tested in concrete string theory models.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory for Spontaneously Broken Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a preprint of an open-access book published by Springer Cham. The book gives an up-to-date overview of the physics of spontaneously broken continuous symmetry from the point of view of effective field theory. Upon building up the necessary foundations, the text reviews the classification of Nambu-Goldstone bosons and then focuses on the construction of the effective-field-theoretic description of their dynamics. Both internal and spacetime broken symmetries are covered, including numerous illustrative examples and a few selected applications, worked out in greater detail.</description>

      <title>Learning S-Matrix Phases with Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) to study the relation between the modulus and phase of amplitudes in $2\to 2$ elastic scattering at fixed energies. Unlike previous approaches, we do not employ the integral relation imposed by unitarity, but instead train FNOs to discover it from many samples of amplitudes with finite partial wave expansions. When trained only on true samples, the FNO correctly predicts (unique or ambiguous) phases of amplitudes with infinite partial wave expansions. When also trained on false samples, it can rate the quality of its prediction by producing a true/false classifying index. We observe that the value of this index is strongly correlated with the violation of the unitarity constraint for the predicted phase, and present examples where it delineates the boundary between allowed and disallowed profiles of the modulus. Our application of FNOs is unconventional: it involves a simultaneous regression-classification task and emphasizes the role of statistics in ensembles of NOs. We comment on the merits and limitations of the approach and its potential as a new methodology in Theoretical Physics.</description>

      <title>Thermal chaos of charged-flat black hole via R\'enyi formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged-flat black holes in the R\'enyi extended phase space demonstrate phase structures akin to those of a van der Waals fluid in four-dimensional spacetime and mirror the behaviors of Reissner-Nordstrom-Anti-de-Sitter black holes within the standard Gibbs-Boltzmann extended phase space. This study delves into the dynamics of states initially positioned within the unstable spinodal region of the phase space associated with the charged-flat black hole when subjected to time-periodic thermal perturbations. Our analysis based on the Mel'nikov method reveals that chaos emerges when the $\delta$ parameter surpasses a critical threshold, $\delta_c$. This critical quantity is dependent on the black hole charge; notably, a larger value of $Q$ impedes the onset of chaos.
  Furthermore, we examine the effects of space-periodic thermal perturbations on its equilibrium state and find that chaos invariably occurs, irrespective of the perturbation amplitude. Hence, the chaotic dynamics observed in the analysis of charged-flat black holes under R\'enyi statistics exhibit resemblances to those of asymptotically AdS-charged black holes investigated via the Gibbs-Boltzmann formalism. This serves as yet another example of a potential and significant connection between the cosmological constant and the nonextensivity R\'enyi parameter.</description>

      <title>B-type D-branes in hybrid models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hybrid model is a fibration of a Landau-Ginzburg orbifold over a geometric base. We study B-type D-branes in hybrid models. Imposing B-type supersymmetry on the boundary action, we show that D-branes are specified by matrix factorisations in the fibre direction, together with some geometric data associated to the base. We also deduce conditions for the compatibility of these branes with the bulk orbifold actions and R-symmetry. We construct examples of hybrid B-branes which are generalisations of well-studied branes in geometric and Landau-Ginzburg models. Hybrid models can arise at limiting points of the stringy Kahler moduli space of Calabi-Yaus, and can be realised as phases of the corresponding gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs). Using GLSM techniques, we establish connections between geometric branes and hybrid branes. As explicit examples, we consider one- and two-parameter Calabi-Yau hybrids with a $\mathbb{P}^1$-base.</description>

Abstract: But if you treat it as a two-form, you get three nontrivial renormalization group fixed points! Which becomes the Heisenberg fixed point in three dimensions? Motivated by this question, we study the conformal bootstrap constraint in the $O(d)$ anti-symmetric matrix model in $d$ dimensions, varying $d$ as a continuous parameter. Besides the one that is naturally connected to the Heisenberg fixed point in three dimensions, we find ``evanescent" kinks whose origin is yet to be identified. We also bootstrap $O(4), O(5), O(6)$ anti-symmetric matrix model in $d=3$, aiming at physical applications.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of the properties of a holographic superconductor from an anti-de Sitter-Einstein-Born-Infeld black hole with backreaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study numerically an $s$-wave holographic superconductor from an anti-de Sitter-Einstein-Born-Infeld black hole with backreaction in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. By introducing a parameter $G$ to tune the effects of the backreaction, we can study non-perturbatively how the condensation properties and conductivity of the superconductor change as the backreaction increases. We find that for small values of $G$, increasing the nonlinearity of the Born-Infeld model makes the formation of the condensate harder -- consistent with previous results reported in the literature -- while for values of $G$ close to one, the opposite effect occurs; increasing the nonlinearity slightly facilitates its formation. We also determine how the ratio $\omega_g/T_c$ varies for different intensities of nonlinearity and backreaction, showing in particular that large deviations from the so-called universal value arise as backreaction becomes stronger.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of defining an invariant notion of tension in gravity. For spacetimes whose asymptotics are those of a Defect CFT we propose two independent definitions : Gravitational tension given by the one-point function of the dilatation current, and inertial tension, or stiffness, given by the norm of the displacement operator. We show that both reduce to the tension of the Nambu-Goto action in the limit of classical thin probe branes. Subtle normalisations of the relevant Witten diagrams are fixed by the Weyl and diffeomorphism Ward identities of the boundary DCFT. The gravitational tension is not defined for domain walls, whereas stiffness is not defined for point particles. When they both exist these two tensions are in general different, but the examples of line and surface BPS defects in $d=4$ show that superconformal invariance can identify them.</description>

      <title>A new derivation of the amplitude of asymptotic oscillatory tails of weakly delocalized solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computation of the amplitude, $\alpha$, of asymptotic standing wave tails of weakly delocalized, stationary solutions in a fifth-order Korteweg-de Vries equation is revisited. Assuming the coefficient of the fifth order derivative term, $\epsilon^2\ll1$, a new derivation of the ``beyond all orders in $\epsilon$'' amplitude, $\alpha$, is presented. It is shown by asymptotic matching techniques, extended to higher orders in $\epsilon$, that the value of $\alpha$ can be obtained from the asymmetry at the center of the unique solution exponentially decaying in one direction. This observation, complemented by some fundamental results of Hammersley and Mazzarino [Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 424, 19 (1989)], not only sheds new light on the computation of $\alpha$, but also greatly facilitates its numerical determination to a remarkable precision for so small values of $\epsilon$, which are beyond the capabilities of standard numerical methods.</description>

      <title>T-dualities in gauged linear sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe non-Abelian T-dualities for $\mathcal{N} = 2$ two dimensional gauged linear sigma model (GLSM). We start with the case of left and right $(2, 2)$ supersymmetry (SUSY), $U(1)$ gauge group, and global non-Abelian symmetries. Our analysis applies to the specialization of the GLSM with the global group $SU(2)\times SU(2)$, whose original model is the resolved conifold. We analyze the dual model and compute the periods on the dual geometry, matching the effective potential for the $U(1)$ gauge field, and discuss the coincident singularity at the conifold point. We further present the non-Abelian T-dualization of models with $(0,2)$ SUSY, analyzing the case of global symmetry $SU(2)$. In this case the full non-Abelian duality can be solved. The dual geometries with and without non-perturbative corrections to the superpotential coincide. The structure of the dual non-perturbative corrections employed are determined based on symmetry arguments. The non-Abelian T-dualities reviewed here lead to potential new symmetries between physical theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy correlations characterize the energy flux through detectors at infinity produced in a collision event. Remarkably, in holographic conformal field theories, they probe high-energy gravitational scattering in the dual anti-de Sitter geometry. We use known properties of high-energy gravitational scattering and its unitarization to explore the leading quantum-gravity correction to the energy-energy correlator at strong coupling. We find that it includes a part originating from large impact parameter scattering that is non-analytic in the angle between detectors and is $\log N_c$ enhanced compared to the standard $1/N_c$ perturbative expansion. It is sensitive to the full bulk geometry, including the internal manifold, providing a refined probe of the emergent holographic spacetime. Similarly, scattering at small impact parameters leads to contributions that are further enhanced by extra powers of the 't Hooft coupling assuming it is corrected by stringy effects. We conclude that energy correlations are sensitive to the UV properties of the dual gravitational theory and thus provide a promising target for the conformal bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Explicit Entropic Proofs of Irreversibility Theorems for Holographic RG Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the existence of monotonic quantities along renormalization group flows using only the Null Energy Condition and the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for the entanglement entropy of field theories with anti-de Sitter gravity duals. In particular, we consider flows within the same dimension and holographically reprove the $c$-, $F$-, and $a$-theorems in dimensions two, three, and four. We focus on the family of maximally spherical entangling surfaces, define a quasi-constant of motion corresponding to the breaking of conformal invariance, and use a properly defined distance between minimal surfaces to construct a holographic $c$-function that is monotonic along the flow. We then apply our method to the case of flows across dimensions: There, we reprove the monotonicity of flows from $\mathrm{AdS}_{D+1}$ to $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ and prove the novel case of flows from $\mathrm{AdS}_5$ to $\mathrm{AdS}_4$.</description>

      <title>Chemical Potential and Charge in Quantum Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study systems in $2+1$ dimensions consisting of defects that source an electric charge, or a magnetic flux, of a $U(1)$ field, and we use holography to compute their effects on quantum conformal fields. We can also hide the defects inside the horizon of a black hole, where they continue to affect the quantum fields outside. By extending the solutions to braneworld holography, we find the non-linear backreaction of the quantum fields on the defect and black hole backgrounds. This gives quantum charged point particles and black holes. The charged quantum black holes markedly differ from classically charged BTZ black holes, since the quantum-induced electromagnetic field in $2+1$ dimensions has a better asymptotic behavior than its classical counterpart. The construction also gives a new class of (near-)extremal charged quantum black holes with AdS$_2$ throats.</description>

      <title>Statistics of three-dimensional black holes from Liouville line defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes and wormholes in the gravitational path integral can be used to calculate the statistics of heavy operators. An explicit example in higher dimensions is provided by thin shells of matter. We study these solutions in 3D gravity, and reproduce the behavior of black holes and wormholes from the dual CFT using the large-$c$ conformal bootstrap. The CFT operator that creates a thin shell black hole is a line defect, so we begin by using the bootstrap to study the statistics of line defects, both at finite $c$ and in the holographic large-$c$ limit. The crossing equation leads to a universal formula for the average high-energy matrix elements of the line defect in any compact, unitary 2d CFT with $c&gt;1$. The asymptotics are controlled by a line defect in Liouville CFT at the same value of the central charge. At large $c$, three distinct quantities are related: The statistics of line defects in holographic CFTs, the individual matrix elements of a line defect in Liouville CFT, and the on-shell action of black holes and wormholes in 3D gravity. The three calculations match for black holes, and if the statistics of the line defects are assumed to be approximately Gaussian, then a class of wormholes is also reproduced by the dual CFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently we have constructed a completely supersymmetric nonlinear action possessing the properties expected from multiple D0-brane system. Its quantization should result in an interesting supersymmetric field theory in the (super)space with additional matrix coordinates which can provide an important insights in the study of String Theory. As a first stage toward this aim, in this paper we construct the Hamiltonian mechanics and perform covariant quantization of the simplest three dimensional counterpart of the ten dimensional multiple D0-brane model. We obtain a supersymmetric system of equations in super-spacetime enlarged by bosonic and fermionic matrix coordinates which appears as a result of such quantization and discuss some of its properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to compute Compton amplitudes involving a fermion pair inspired by Hopf algebra amplitude constructions. This approach features a recursive relation employing quasi-shuffle sets, directly verifiable by massive factorization properties. We derive results for minimal gauge invariant color-kinematic numerators with physical massive poles using this method. We have also deduced a graphical method for deriving numerators that simplifies the numerator generation and eliminates redundancies, thus providing several computational advantages.</description>

      <title>Optimally scrambling chiral spin-chain with effective black hole geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is currently significant interest in emulating the essential characteristics of black holes, such as their Hawking radiation or their optimal scrambling behavior, using condensed matter models. In this article, we investigate a chiral spin-chain, whose mean field theory effectively captures the behavior of Dirac fermions in the curved spacetime geometry of a black hole. We find that within the region of the chain that describe the interior of the black hole, strong correlations prevail giving rise to many-body chaotic dynamics. Employing out-of-time-order correlations as a diagnostic tool, we numerically compute the associated Lyapunov exponent. Intriguingly, we observe a linear increase in the Lyapunov exponent with temperature within the black hole's interior at low temperatures, indicative of optimal scrambling behavior. This contrasts with the quadratic temperature dependence exhibited by the spin-chain on the region outside the black hole. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between black hole geometry and quantum chaos, offering insights into fundamental aspects of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Holography for Sp(2$N_c$) Gauge Dynamics: from Composite Higgs to Technicolour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Sp(2$N_c$) gauge dynamics with two Dirac fermion flavours in the fundamental representation. These strongly coupled systems underlie some composite Higgs models with a global symmetry breaking pattern SU(4)$\rightarrow$Sp(4), leading to a light quartet of pseudo-Goldstone bosons that can play the role of the Higgs. Including four-fermion interactions can rotate the vacuum to a technicolour breaking pattern. Using gauge/gravity duality, we study the underlying gauge dynamics. Our model incorporates the $N_c$-specific running of the fermion anomalous dimension and can thus distinguish between specific gauge groups. We determine the bound-state spectrum of the UV SU(4)$\rightarrow$Sp(4) symmetry breaking model, also including fermion masses and mass splitting, and display the $N_c$ dependence. The inclusion of a four-fermion interaction shows the emergence of three Goldstone bosons on the path to technicolour dynamics.</description>

      <title>Haag-Kastler stacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an alternative implementation of the principle of general local covariance for algebraic quantum field theories (AQFTs) which is more flexible and powerful than the original one by Brunetti, Fredenhagen and Verch. This is realized by considering the $2$-functor $\mathsf{HK} : \mathbf{Loc}^\mathrm{op} \to \mathbf{CAT}$ which assigns to each Lorentzian manifold $M$ the category $\mathsf{HK}(M)$ of Haag-Kastler-style AQFTs over $M$ and to each embedding $f:M\to N$ a pullback functor $f^\ast = \mathsf{HK}(f) : \mathsf{HK}(N) \to \mathsf{HK}(M)$ restricting theories from $N$ to $M$. Locally covariant AQFTs are recovered as the points of the $2$-functor $\mathsf{HK}$. The main advantages of this new perspective are: 1.) It leads to technical simplifications, in particular with regard to the time-slice axiom, since global problems on $\mathbf{Loc}$ become families of simpler local problems on individual Lorentzian manifolds. 2.) Some aspects of the Haag-Kastler framework which previously got lost in locally covariant AQFT, such as a relative compactness condition on the open subsets in a Lorentzian manifold $M$, are reintroduced. 3.) It provides a successful and radically new perspective on descent conditions in AQFT, i.e. local-to-global conditions which allow one to recover a global AQFT on a Lorentzian manifold $M$ from its local data in an open cover $\{U_i \subseteq M\}$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic amplification in pre-merger neutron stars through resonance-induced magnetorotational instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal resonances in the final seconds of a binary neutron-star inspiral can excite oscillation modes in one or both of the constituents to large amplitudes. Under favorable circumstances, resonant pulsations can overstrain the stellar crust and unleash a torrent of magnetoelastic energy that manifests as a gamma-ray `precursor flare'. We show that for realistic, stratified stars rotating with a spin frequency of $\gtrsim 30\,$Hz, the fundamental $g$-mode or its first overtone can also execute a differential rotation in the crust such that a magnetic field of strength $\gtrsim 10^{13}\,$G is generated via magnetorotational instabilities. This may help to explain observed precursor rates and their luminosities. Pre-merger magnetic growth would also provide seed magnetic energy for the post-merger remnant.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear treatment of a black hole mimicker ringdown</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the first nonlinear and self-consistent study of the merger and ringdown of a black hole mimicking object with stable light rings. To that end, we numerically solve the full Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations governing the head-on collisions of a series of binary boson stars in the large-mass-ratio regime resulting in spinning horizonless remnants with stable light rings. We broadly confirm the appearance of features in the extracted gravitational waveforms expected based on perturbative methods: the signal from the prompt response of the remnants approaches that of a Kerr black hole in the large-compactness limit, and the subsequent emissions contain periodically appearing bursts akin to so-called gravitational wave echoes. However, these bursts occur at high frequencies and are sourced by perturbations of the remnant's internal degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the emitted waveforms also contain a large-amplitude and long-lived component comparable in frequency to black hole quasi-normal modes. We further characterize the emissions, obtain basic scaling relations of relevant timescales, and compute the energy emitted in gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Inflaton decay in No-Scale Supergravity and Starobinsky-like models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the decay of the inflaton in Starobinsky-like models arising from either an $R+R^2$ theory of gravity or $N=1$ no-scale supergravity models. If Standard Model matter is simply introduced to the $R + R^2$ theory, the inflaton (which appears when the theory is conformally transformed to the Einstein frame) couples to matter predominantly in Standard Model Higgs kinetic terms. This will typically lead to a reheating temperature of $\sim 3 \times 10^9$~GeV. However, if the Standard Model Higgs is conformally coupled to curvature, the decay rate may be suppressed and vanishes for a conformal coupling $\xi = 1/6$. Nevertheless, inflaton decays through the conformal anomaly leading to a reheating temperature of order $10^8$~GeV. The Starobinsky potential may also arise in no-scale supergravity. In this case, the inflaton decays if there is a direct coupling of the inflaton to matter in the superpotential or to gauge fields through the gauge kinetic function. We also discuss the relation between the theories and demonstrate the correspondence between the no-scale models and the conformally coupled $R+R^2$ theory (with $\xi = 1/6$).</description>

      <title>Bring the Heat: Tidal Heating Constraints for Black Holes and Exotic Compact Objects from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first constraints on tidal heating for the binary systems detected in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational wave data. Tidal heating, also known as tidal dissipation, characterizes the viscous nature of an astrophysical body and provides a channel for exchanging energy and angular momentum with the tidal environment. Using the worldline effective field theory formalism, we introduce a physically motivated and easily interpretable parametrization of tidal heating valid for an arbitrary compact astrophysical object. We then derive the imprints of the spin-independent and linear-in-spin tidal heating effects of generic binary components on the waveform phases and amplitudes of quasi-circular orbits. Notably, the mass-weighted spin-independent tidal heating coefficient derived in this work, $\mathcal{H}_0$, is the dissipative analog of the tidal Love number. We constrain the tidal heating coefficients using the public LVK O1-O3 data. Our parameter estimation study includes two separate analyses: the first treats the catalog of binary events as binary black holes (BBH), while the second makes no assumption about the nature of the binary constituents and can therefore be interpreted as constraints for exotic compact objects. In the former case, we combine the posterior distributions of the individual BBH events and obtain a joint constraint of $-13 &lt; \mathcal{H}_0 &lt; 20$ at the $90\%$ credible interval for the BBH population. This translates into a bound on the fraction of the emitted gravitational wave energy lost due to tidal heating (or gained due to radiation enhancement effects) at $|\Delta E_H/\Delta E_{\infty}|\lesssim 3\cdot 10^{-3}$. Our work provides the first robust framework for deriving and measuring tidal heating effects in merging binary systems, demonstrating its potential as a powerful probe of the nature of binary constituents and tests of new physics.</description>

Abstract: The circuit complexity for Hamiltonian simulation of the sparsified SYK model with $N$ Majorana fermions and quartic interactions which retains holographic features (referred to as `minimal holographic sparsified SYK') with $k = 8.7 \ll N^{3}/24$ (where $k$ is the total number of interaction terms per $N$) using second-order Trotter method and Jordan-Wigner encoding is found to be $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(k^{p}N^{2} \log N (\mathcal{J}t)^{3/2}\varepsilon^{-1/2})$ where $t$ is the simulation time, $\varepsilon$ is the desired error in the implementation of the unitary $U = \exp(-iHt)$, $\mathcal{J}$ is the disorder strength, and $p &lt; 1$. This complexity implies that with less than a hundred logical qubits and about $10^{5}$ two-qubit or Clifford+$T$-gates, it will be possible to achieve an advantage in this model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note discusses a method for computing the energy spectra of quantum field theory utilizing digital quantum simulation. A quantum algorithm, called coherent imaging spectroscopy, quenches the vacuum with a time-oscillating perturbation and then reads off the excited energy levels from the loss in the vacuum-to-vacuum probability following the quench. As a practical demonstration, we apply this algorithm to the (1+1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics with a topological term known as the Schwinger model, where the conventional Monte Carlo approach is practically inaccessible. In particular, on a classical simulator, we prepare the vacuum of the Schwinger model on a lattice by adiabatic state preparation and then apply various types of quenches to the approximate vacuum through Suzuki-Trotter time evolution. We discuss the dependence of the simulation results on the specific types of quenches and introduce various consistency checks, including the exact diagonalization and the continuum limit extrapolation. The estimation of the computational complexity required to obtain physically reasonable results implies that the method is likely efficient in the coming era of early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Renormalization Group (RG) fixed-point theory associated with a fermionic $\psi^4_d$ model in $d=1,2,3$ with fractional kinetic term, whose scaling dimension is fixed so that the quartic interaction is weakly relevant in the RG sense. The model is defined in terms of a Grassmann functional integral with interaction $V^*$, solving a fixed-point RG equation in the presence of external fields, and a fixed ultraviolet cutoff. We define and construct the field and density scale-invariant response functions, and prove that the critical exponent of the former is the naive one, while that of the latter is anomalous and analytic. We construct the corresponding (almost-)scaling operators, whose two point correlations are scale-invariant up to a remainder term, which decays like a stretched exponential at distances larger than the inverse of the ultraviolet cutoff. Our proof is based on constructive RG methods and, specifically, on a convergent tree expansion for the generating function of correlations, which generalizes the approach developed by three of the authors in a previous publication [A. Giuliani, V. Mastropietro, S. Rychkov, JHEP 01 (2021) 026].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop MultiSTOP, a Reinforcement Learning framework for solving functional equations in physics. This new methodology produces actual numerical solutions instead of bounds on them. We extend the original BootSTOP algorithm by adding multiple constraints derived from domain-specific knowledge, even in integral form, to improve the accuracy of the solution. We investigate a particular equation in a one-dimensional Conformal Field Theory.</description>

Abstract: Quantum states of a spin $1/2$ (a qubit) are parametrized by the space $CP^1 \sim S^2$, the Bloch sphere. A spin j (a 2j+1 -state system) for generic j is represented instead by a point of a larger space, $CP^{2j}$. Here we study the angular momentum/spin in the limit, $j \to \infty$. The state, $(J \cdot n) | j, n\rangle = j |j, n \rangle $, where $J$ is the angular momentum operator and $n$ stands for a generic unit vector in $R^3$, is found to behave as a classical angular momentum, $ j n $. We discuss this phenomenon, by analysing the Stern-Gerlach experiments, the angular-momentum composition rule, and the rotation matrix. This problem arose from the consideration of a macroscopic body under an inhomogeneous magnetic field. Our observations help to explain how classical mechanics (with unique particle trajectories) emerges naturally from quantum mechanics in this context, and at the same time, make the widespread idea that large spins somehow become classical, a more precise one.</description>

      <title>Discontinuities in the Evolution of Properties of Kerr Black Holes in the Extremal Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ever since its discovery by Roy Kerr in 1963, the geometry around rotating, electrostatically-neutral black holes, otherwise known as Kerr black holes, has significantly contributed to theoretical developments in the fields of general relativity, thermodynamics and beyond. Extremal Kerr black holes, in which the spin parameter of the rotating black hole is at a maximum without breaching certain postulates, has especially been of interest to the research community due to its sensitivity to higher order corrections to Einstein's theory of relativity. In this paper, we review some unresolved open questions regarding the discontinuity of certain properties of the Kerr black hole as it approaches the extreme limit. These include the form of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), the nature of vanishing entropy, and the disappearance of the trapped surface as a Kerr black hole approaches extremality. We conclude that current theories are likely not suitable for studies of extremal black holes, and we posit that further development in theory may likely require a quantum approach to gravity. G=c=1 and Einstein summation convention are assumed throughout this paper.</description>

      <title>Vanilla Inflation Predicts Negative Running</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the simplest, and currently favoured, theoretical realizations of cosmic inflation yield a sharp prediction for the running of the spectral index $\alpha_\mathrm{S}$. Using latest cosmological data, we compute its marginalized posterior probability distribution over the space of nearly 300 models of single-field slow-roll inflation. The most probable value is $\alpha_\mathrm{S}=-6.3 \times 10^{-4}$, lying within the $98\%$ credible interval $-1.8 \times 10^{-3}&lt; \alpha_\mathrm{S}&lt; -9.1 \times 10^{-5}$. Within the landscape of all the proposed slow-roll inflationary models, positive values for the running are therefore disfavoured at more than three-sigma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) play a pivotal role in hadron collider phenomenology. They are non-perturbative quantities extracted from fits to available data, and their scale dependence is dictated by the DGLAP evolution equations. In this article, we discuss machine learning (ML) strategies to efficiently compute PDFs by bypassing the scale evolution. Analytical approximations to the PDFs as a function of $x$ and $Q^2$, including up to next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD effects, are obtained. The methodology is tested by reproducing the HERAPDF2.0 set and implementing the analytical expressions in benchmarking codes. It is found that the computational cost is reduced while the precision of the simulations stays well under control.</description>

      <title>Scalar probes on wormholes in Lovelock theories with unique vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:1812.02089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new family of wormhole geometries in Lovelock theories with a unique vacuum, and study their stability under scalar field perturbations. As the solutions already known in the literature for Chern-Simons gravity on AdS, the new wormholes are characterized by a single integration constant $\rho_{0}$, that parameterizes the contribution to the mass coming from each boundary, which cancel each other, leading to a new example of "mass without mass". The stability of these new configurations, as well as other previously constructed in the literature is explored under scalar field perturbations. The stability is ensured provided the mass of the scalar perturbation is above a deformed Breitenlohner-Freedman bound which is sensitive to the value of $\rho_{0}$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the coupled set of spectral Dyson-Schwinger equations in Yang-Mills theory for ghost and gluon propagators, which gives us access to the ghost and gluon spectral functions. The set-up is used for a systematic analytic evaluation of the constraints on generalised spectral representations in Yang-Mills theory that are most relevant for informed spectral reconstructions. We also provide numerical results for the coupled set of spectral functions for a large range of potential mass gaps of the gluon, and discuss the limitations and extensions of the present work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalising the chiral boundary conditions of $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$ gravity for AdS$_4$ gravity, we derive chiral locally AdS$_4$ solutions in the Newman-Unti gauge consistent with a variational principle whose asymptotic symmetry algebra we show, to be an infinite-dimensional chiral extension of $\mathfrak{so}(2,3)$. This symmetry algebra coincides with the chiral $\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra in the flat space limit. We posit this symmetry algebra as the chiral version of recently discovered $\Lambda$-$\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra. We postulate line integral charges from the bulk AdS$_4$ gravity corresponding to this chiral symmetry algebra and show that the charges obey the semi-classical limit of a $\mathcal{W}$-algebra that includes a level $\kappa$ Kac-Moody $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$ current algebra. Furthermore, using the standard tools of $2d$ CFT, we derive the quantum version of this $\mathcal{W}$-algebra which may be denoted by $\mathcal{W}(2;(3/2)^2,1^3)$.</description>

      <title>4D Weyl Anomaly and Diversity of the Interior Structure of Quantum Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interior metric of 4D spherically symmetric static black holes by using the semi-classical Einstein equation and find a consistent class of geometries with large curvatures. We approximate the matter fields by conformal fields and consider the contribution of the 4D Weyl anomaly, giving a state-independent constraint. Combining this with an equation of state yields an equation that determines the interior geometry completely. We explore the solution space of the equation in a non-perturbative manner for $\hbar$. First, we find four types of asymptotic behaviors and examine the general features of the solutions. Then, by imposing physical conditions, we obtain approximately a general class of interior geometries: various combinations of dilute and dense structures without a horizon or singularity. This represents the diversity of the interior structure. Finally, we show that the number of possible patterns of such interior geometries corresponds to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.</description>

Abstract: Recent work has given a systematic way for studying the kinetics of classical weakly interacting waves beyond leading order, having analogies with renormalization in quantum field theory. An important context is weak wave turbulence, occurring for waves which are small in magnitude and weakly interacting, such as those on the surface of the ocean. Here we continue the work of perturbatively computing correlation functions and the kinetic equation in this far-from-equilibrium state. In particular, we obtain the two-loop kinetic equation for waves with a cubic interaction. Our main result is a simple graphical prescription for the terms in the kinetic equation, at any order in the nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Beyond $N=\infty$ in Large $N$ Conformal Vector Models at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate finite-temperature observables in three-dimensional large $N$ critical vector models taking into account the effects suppressed by $1\over N$. Such subleading contributions are captured by the fluctuations of the Hubbard-Stratonovich auxiliary field which need to be handled with care due to a subtle divergence structure which we clarify. The examples we consider include the scalar $O(N)$ model, the Gross-Neveu model, the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model and the massless Chern-Simons Quantum Electrodynamics. We present explicit results for the free energy density to the subleading order in $1\over N$, which captures the thermal one-point function of the stress-energy tensor to this order. We also include the dependence on a chemical potential. We determine the Wilson coefficient in the thermal effective action that is sensitive to global symmetry for the first time directly in interacting CFTs, which produces a symmetry-resolved asymptotic density of states. We further provide a formula from diagrammatics for the one-point functions of general single-trace higher-spin currents. We observe that in most cases considered, these subleading effects lift the apparent degeneracies between observables in different models at infinite $N$, while in special cases the discrepancies only start to appear at the next-to-subleading order.</description>

      <title>Parity-Violating CFT and the Gravitational Chiral Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We illustrate how the Conformal Ward Identities (CWI) and the gravitational chiral anomaly completely determine the structure of the $\langle TTJ_{5}\rangle$ (graviton-graviton-chiral gauge current) correlator in momentum space. This analysis extends our previous results on the anomaly vertices $\langle AVV\rangle$ and $\langle AAA\rangle$, as well as the $\langle TJJ\rangle$ parity-odd conformal anomaly vertex in general CFTs. The $\langle TTJ_{5}\rangle$ plays a fundamental role in the analysis of the conformal backreaction in early universe cosmology, affecting the particle content and the evolution of the primordial plasma. Our approach is nonperturbative and not Lagrangian-based, requiring the inclusion of a single anomaly pole in the solution of the anomaly constraint. The pole and its residue, along with the CWIs, determine the entire correlator in all of its sectors (longitudinal/transverse), all of which are proportional to the same anomaly coefficient. The method does not rely on a specific expression of the CP-odd anomalous current, which in free field theory can be represented either by a bilinear fermion current or by a gauge-dependent Chern-Simons current; it relies solely on the symmetry constraints. We compute the correlator perturbatively at one-loop in free field theory and verify its exact agreement with the non-perturbative result. A comparison with the perturbative analysis confirms the presence of a sum rule satisfied by the correlator, similar to the parity-even $\langle TJJ\rangle$ and the chiral $\langle AVV\rangle$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Skyrmion of the $SO(2)$ gauged $O(3)$ sigma model in $2+1$ dimensions in the presence of a Skyrme--Chern-Simons (SCS) term, and compare its properties with the corresponding properties of the Skyrmion in the presence of the usual Chern-Simons (CS) term. We find that these properties are qualitatively largely similar in both cases, meaning that the SCS density can be employed as an alternative to the CS term also in higher dimensions, most importantly in even dimensions where no CS term is defined, $e.g.,$ in $3+1$ dimensions.The SCS density employed here is defined in terms of the pair of $SO(2)\times SO(2)$ gauge fields and an auxiliary $O(5)$ Skyrme scalar, which is contracted to an effective $O(3)$ Skyrme scalar. Technically, this study maps the methods to be applied in higher dimensional examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study QCD vacuum structure with the topological $\theta$ angle using a recently proposed semiclassical approach on $\mathbb{R}^2 \times T^2$ with the 't Hooft and baryon magnetic fluxes. Under the assumption of adiabatic continuity in this setup, the confining vacuum can be described by the dilute gas of center vortices. With this semiclassical approach, we derive the 2d effective description at small $T^2$ and successfully explain the reasonable theta dependence of the QCD vacuum: In the one-flavor QCD at $\theta = \pi$, the $CP$ symmetry is spontaneously broken for quark mass above a critical value and restored for a subcritical mass, while the $CP$ symmetry is always spontaneously broken in the multi-flavor QCD at $\theta = \pi$. From our semiclassical description, we discuss implications to the $4$d chiral Lagrangian and propose how the $\eta'$ meson should be incorporated in consistent with known global structures: The periodicity of the $\eta'$ should be extended from the naive one $2\pi$ to $2\pi N$. Additionally, we revisit the phase diagram of $N_f = 1+1$ and $N_f = 1+1+1$ QCD on the up and down quark mass plane, confirming and refining the existence of the $CP$-broken Dashen phase.</description>

      <title>A Non-Abelian Gauge Theory for Surface Excitations of $~^3$He-B</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $~^3$He-B, two atoms pair in an orbital angular momentum $1$ spin triplet state above the phase transition temperature with $SO(3) \times SO(3)$ symmetry. Below the transition temperature, this symmetry is spontaneously broken to the diagonal $SO(3)$ due to spin-orbit coupling. Considerations based on effective potentials and solitons show that $SO(3)$'s gets enhanced to $SU(3)$'s and the symmetry breaking is that of $G= SU(3) \times SU(3)\times U(1)$ to $H= SU(3)$. The theory of the resultant Goldtsone modes can be naturally formulated as a gauge theory of $H$. Its Gauss law is treated here and shown to lead to surface states in a container with a dynamics governed by large gauge transformations.
  Observable consequences are pointed. The transference of the analysis to the chiral model of QCD is pointed out where $SU(3)$ are the left and right chiral groups, $U(1)$ is the axial $U(1)$ , the surviving symmetry is flavour $SU(3)$ and the Goldstone modes are the pions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel indicator for chaotic quantum scattering processes, the scattering form factor (ScFF). It is based on mapping the locations of peaks in the scattering amplitude to random matrix eigenvalues, and computing the analog of the spectral form factor (SFF). We compute the spectral and scattering form factors of several non-chaotic systems. We determine the ScFF associated with the phase shifts of the leaky torus, closely related to the distribution of the zeros of Riemann zeta function. We compute the ScFF for the decay amplitude of a highly excited string states into two tachyons. We show that it displays the universal features expected from random matrix theory - a decline, a ramp and a plateau - and is in general agreement with the Gaussian unitary ensemble. It also shows some new features, owning to the special structure of the string amplitude, including a "bump" before the ramp associated with gaps in the average eigenvalue density. The "bump" is removed for highly excited string states with an appropriate state dependent unfolding. We also discuss the SFF for the Gaussian $\beta$- ensemble, writing an interpolation between the known results of the Gaussian orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic ensembles.</description>

Abstract: In [arXiv:2105.06455, arXiv:2206.04538], the authors have been able to argue for an ultra-local version of the second law of black hole mechanics, for arbitrary diffeomorphism invariant theories of gravity non-minimally coupled to matter fields, by constructing an entropy current on the dynamical horizon with manifestly positive divergence. This has been achieved by working in the horizon-adapted coordinate system. In this work, we show that the local entropy production through the divergence of the entropy current is covariant under affine reparametrizations that leave the gauge of horizon-adapted coordinates invariant. We explicitly derive a formula for how the entropy current transforms under such coordinate transformations. This extends the analysis of [arXiv:2204.08447] for arbitrary diffeomorphism invariant theories of gravity non-minimally coupled to matter fields. We also study the Iyer-Wald ambiguities of the covariant phase formalism that generically plague the components of the entropy current.</description>

      <title>The off-shell expansion relation of the Yang-Mills scalar theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the off-shell expansion relation of the Yang-Mills scalar theory. We have shown explicitly that the single-trace Berends-Giele currents in the Yang-Mills scalar theory can be decomposed into a term expressed by a linear combination of bi-adjoint scalar Berends-Giele currents and one that vanishes under the on-shell limit. We proved that the bi-adjoint scalar currents, as well as the corresponding coefficients, can be characterized by a graphic approach that was originally studied in Einstein-Yang-Mills expansion. Furthermore, we generalized the decomposition to the multi-trace case through unifying relations and established the connection both in single-trace and multi-trace graphic descriptions. Finally, we established the relations between the Yang-Mills currents and the single-trace Yang-Mills scalar currents choosing special reference orders of the Yang-Mills graphs.</description>

      <title>Unconstrained Lagrangian Formulation for Bosonic Continuous Spin Theory in Flat Spacetime of Arbitrary Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have discovered two unconstrained forms of free Lagrangian for continuous spin(CS) theory in arbitrary flat spacetime dimension for bosonic case. These Lagrangians, unlike that by Schuster and Toro, do not include delta functions and are conventional. The first form consists of five kinds of totally symmetric helicity fields and one kind of gauge parameter. By introducing auxiliary creation and annihilation operators, each is combined into a state vector in Fock space, including all ranks one by one. The Lagrangian imposes no constraints, such as trace conditions, on these fields or the gauge parameter field. Additionally, the Lagrangian does not contain higher-order derivative terms. In the limit as CS parameter $\mu$ approaches zero, it naturally reproduces a Lagrangian for helicity fields in higher spin(HS) theory, known as unconstrained quartet formulation. Permitting third-order derivatives, we also obtain the second unconstrained form of Lagrangian that can be written in terms of three kinds of fields, including $\mu$, similar to the formulation by Francia and Sagnotti. Partial gauge fixing and partial use of equation of motion(EOM) on this Lagrangian yield a Fronsdal-like Lagrangian with a single double-traceless field, including $\mu$. By imposing further gauge fixing on the field in the EOM with respect to divergence and trace, we confirm the reproduction of the modified Wigner equations already known in literature.</description>

      <title>Density Matrix Formalism for PT-Symmetric Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with the Lindblad Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.02445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of Lindblad decoherence, i.e. dissipative effects in an open quantum system due to interaction with an environment, we examine the transition probabilities between the eigenstates in the two-level quantum system described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with the Lindblad equation, for which the parity-time-reversal (PT) symmetry is conserved. First, the density matrix formalism for PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonian systems is developed. It is shown that the Lindblad operators $L^{}_j$ are pseudo-Hermitian, namely, $\eta L^{}_j \eta^{-1} = L^\dagger_j$ with $\eta$ being a linear and positive-definite metric, and respect the PT symmetry as well. We demonstrate that the generalized density matrix $\rho^{}_{\rm G}(t) \equiv \rho(t) \eta$, instead of the normalized density matrix $\rho^{}_{\rm N}(t) \equiv \rho(t)/{\rm tr}\left[\rho(t)\right]$, should be implemented for the calculation of the transition probabilities in accordance with the linearity requirement. Second, the density matrix formalism is used to derive the transition probabilities in general cases of PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. In some concrete examples, we calculate compact analytical formulas for the transition probabilities and explore their main features with numerical illustrations. We also make a comparison between our present results and our previous ones using state vectors in the absence of Lindblad decoherence.</description>

      <title>Raman response and shear viscosity in the non-Fermi liquid phase of Luttinger semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.04045v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Luttinger semimetals represent materials with strong spin-orbit coupling, harbouring doubly-degenerate quadratic band touchings at the Brillouin zone center. In the presence of Coulomb interactions, such a system exhibits a non-Fermi liquid phase [dubbed as the Luttinger-Abrikosov-Beneslavskii (LAB) phase], at low temperatures and zero doping. However, a clear experimental evidence of this emergent state remains elusive to this date. Hence, we focus on extracting the Raman response as a complementary experimental signature. At frequencies much larger than the temperature, the Raman response exhibits a power-law behavior, which can be verified experimentally. On the other hand, at lower frequencies, the Raman response displays a quasi-elastic peak. We also compute the ratio of the shear viscosity and the entropy density, and the value obtained is a consequence of the hyperscaling violation that emerges in the LAB phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00544v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision kernel is employed in the Boltzmann equation to formulate relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics. In this formulation, we find that there remains freedom of choosing a matching condition that affects the scalar transport in the system. We also propose a new collision kernel which, unlike BGK collision kernel, is valid in the limit of zero chemical potential and derive relativistic first-order dissipative hydrodynamics using it. We study the effects of this new formulation on the coefficient of bulk viscosity.</description>

      <title>Dually weighted multi-matrix models as a path to causal gravity-matter systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dually-weighted multi-matrix model that for a suitable choice of weights reproduce two-dimensional Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) coupled to the Ising model. When Ising degrees of freedom are removed, this model corresponds to the CDT-matrix model introduced by Benedetti and Henson [Phys. Lett. B 678, 222 (2009)]. We present exact as well as approximate results for the Gaussian averages of characters of a Hermitian matrix $A$ and $A^2$ for a given representation and establish the present limitations that prevent us to solve the model analytically. This sets the stage for the formulation of more sophisticated matter models coupled to two-dimensional CDT as dually weighted multi-matrix models providing a complementary view to the standard simplicial formulation of CDT-matter models.</description>

      <title>The Hamiltonian constraint in the symmetric teleparallel equivalent of general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General relativity (GR) admits two alternative formulations with the same dynamics attributing the gravitational phenomena to torsion or nonmetricity of the manifold's connection. They lead, respectively, to the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) and the symmetric teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (STEGR). In this work, we focus on STEGR and present its differences with the conventional, curvature-based GR. We exhibit the 3+1 decomposition of the STEGR Lagrangian in the coincident gauge and present the Hamiltonian, and the Hamiltonian and momenta constraints. For a particular case of spherical symmetry, we explicitly show the differences in the Hamiltonian between GR and STEGR, one of the few genuinely different features of both formulations of gravity, and the repercussions it might encompass to numerical relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct knot invariants from solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation associated to appropriately generalized left/right Yetter--Drinfel'd modules over a braided Hopf algebra with an automorphism. When applied to Nichols algebras, our method reproduces known knot polynomials and naturally produces multivariable polynomial invariants of knots. We discuss in detail Nichols algebras of rank $1$ which recover the ADO and the colored Jones polynomials of a knot and two sequences of examples of rank $2$ Nichols algebras, one of which starts with the product of two Alexander polynomials, and then conjecturally the Harper polynomial. The second sequence starts with the Links--Gould invariant (conjecturally), and then with a new 2-variable knot polynomial that detects chirality and mutation, and whose degree gives sharp bounds for the genus for a sample of 30 computed knots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenological consequences of breaking discrete global symmetries in quantum gravity (QG). We extend a previous scenario where discrete global symmetries are responsible for scalar dark matter (DM) and domain walls (DWs), to the case of fermionic DM, considered as a feebly interacting massive particle, which achieves the correct DM relic density via the freeze-in mechanism. Due to the mixing between DM and the standard model neutrinos, various indirect DM detection methods can be employed to constrain the QG scale, the scale of freeze-in, and the reheating temperature simultaneously. Since such QG symmetry breaking leads to DW annihilation, this may generate the characteristic gravitational wave background, and hence explain the recent observations of the gravitational wave spectrum by pulsar timing arrays. This work therefore highlights a tantalizing possibility of probing the effective scale of QG from observations.</description>

      <title>QCD with an Infrared Fixed Point and a Dilaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following previous work we further explore the possibility that the chirally broken phase of gauge theories admits an infrared fixed point interpretation. The slope of the $\beta$ function, $\beta'_*$, is found to vanish at the infrared fixed point which has several attractive features such as logarithmic running. We provide a more in-depth analysis of our previous result that the mass anomalous assumes $\gamma_* = 1$ at the fixed point. The results are found to be consistent with ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories. In a second part the specific properties of a dilaton, the (pseudo) Goldstone, due to spontaneous symmetry breaking are investigated. Dilaton soft theorems indicate that a soft dilaton mass can only originate from an operator of scaling dimension two. In the gauge theory this role is taken on by the $\bar qq$-operator. The QCD dilaton candidate, the $\sigma = f_0(500)$ meson is investigated. Singlet-octet mixing is found to be important. We briefly discuss the dilaton as a candidate for the Higgs boson, which relies on the ratio of dilaton to pion decay constant being close to unity. In QCD this is approximately satisfied but it is remains unclear if this is accidental or whether there is unknown reason behind it.</description>

      <title>The Hawking temperature of dynamical black holes via conformal transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this second part of our two-series on extracting the Hawking temperature of dynamical black holes, we focus into spacetimes that are conformal transformations of static spacetimes. Our previous investigation builds upon the Unruh-Hawking analogy, which relates the spacetime of a uniformly accelerating observer to the near-horizon region of a black hole, to obtain the Hawking temperature. However, in this work, we explicitly compute the Bogoliubov coefficients associated with incoming and outgoing modes, which not only yields the temperature but also thermal spectrum of particles emitted by a black hole. For illustration, we take the simplest nontrivial example of the linear Vaidya spacetime, which is conformal to the static metric and using this property, we analytically solve the massless scalar field in its background. This allows the explicit computations of the Bogoliubov coefficients to study the particle production in this spacetime. We also derive an expression for the total mass of such dynamical spacetimes using the conformal Killing vector. We then perform differential variations of the mass formula to determine whether the laws of dynamical black hole mechanics correspond to the laws of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>The fermion self-energy and damping rate in a hot magnetized plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04307v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a general expression for the fermion self-energy in a hot magnetized plasma by using the Landau-level representation. In the one-loop approximation, the Dirac structure of the self-energy is characterized by five different functions that depend on the Landau-level index $n$ and the longitudinal momentum $p_z$. We derive general expressions for all five functions and obtain closed-form expressions for their imaginary parts. The latter receive contributions from three types of on-shell processes, which are interpreted in terms of Landau-level transitions, accompanied by a single photon (gluon) emission or absorption. By making use of the imaginary parts of the self-energy functions, we also derive the Landau-level dependent fermion damping rates $\Gamma_{n}(p_z)$ and study them numerically in a wide range of model parameters. We also demonstrate that the two-spin degeneracy of the Landau levels is lifted by the one-loop self-energy corrections. While the spin splitting of the damping rates is small, it may be important for some spin and chiral effects. We argue that the general method and the numerical results for the rates can have interesting applications in heavy-ion physics, astrophysics, and cosmology, where strongly magnetized QED or QCD plasmas are ubiquitous.</description>

The interplay with recent lattice simulations will be employed to deduce the size of $1/N^2$ corrections. Through the meson-meson scattering analysis I will honor Steven Weinberg's memory by showing how two-index extrapolations naturally accommodate the appearance of tetraquarks states crucial to unitarize meson-meson scattering at low energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11300v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we offer the dynamical system analysis of the DBI (Dirac-Born-Infeld) scalar field in a modified $f(Q)$ gravity context. We have taken a polynomial form of modified gravity and used two different kinds of scalar potential, i.e., polynomial and exponential, and found a closed autonomous dynamical system of equations. We have analyzed the fixed points of such a system and commented on the conditions under which deceleration to late-time acceleration happens in this model. We have noted the similarity of the two models and have also shown that our result is indeed consistent with the previous work done on Einstein's gravity. We have also investigated the phenomenological implications of our models by plotting the EoS ($\omega$), Energy density ($\Omega$), and deceleration parameter ($q$) w.r.t. to e-fold time and comparing with the present value. Finally, we conclude the paper by observing how the dynamical system analysis differs in modified $f(Q)$ gravity, and we also provide some of the future scope of our work.</description>

      <title>Stable non-Fermi liquid fixed point at the onset of incommensurate $2k_F$ charge density wave order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid fixed point in two-dimensional metals at the onset of a quantum phase transition from a Fermi liquid state to an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) ordered phase. The momentum of the CDW boson is centred at the wavevector $ \boldsymbol{ \mathcal Q} $, which connects a single pair of antipodal points on the Fermi surface with antiparallel tangent vectors. We employ the dimensional regularization technique in which the co-dimension of the Fermi surface is extended to a generic value, while keeping the dimension of Fermi surface itself fixed at one. Although the system is strongly coupled at dimension $d=2$, the interactions become marginal at the upper critical dimension $d=d_c$, whose value is found to be $ 5/2$. Using a controlled perturbative expansion in the parameter $\epsilon = d_c - d $, we compute the critical exponents of the stable infrared fixed point characterizing the quantum critical point. The scalings of the original theory are determined by setting $\epsilon =1/2$, where the fermion self-energy is seen to scale with the frequency with a fractional power law of $2/3$, which is the undisputed signature of a typical non-Fermi liquid phase.</description>

Abstract: We give a full classification of general affine connections on Galilei manifolds in terms of independently specifiable tensor fields. This generalises the well-known case of (torsional) Galilei connections, i.e. connections compatible with the metric structure of the Galilei manifold. Similarly to the well-known pseudo-Riemannian case, the additional freedom for connections that are not metric-compatible lies in the covariant derivatives of the two tensors defining the metric structure (the clock form and the space metric), which however are not fully independent of each other.</description>

Abstract: This paper combines the post-Minkowskian expansion of general relativity with the language of intersection theory. Due to the nature of the soft limit inherent to the post-Minkowskian expansion, the intersection-based approach is of enhanced utility in that theory compared to a generic QFT. In the language of intersection theory, Feynman integrals are rephrased in terms of twisted cocycles. The intersection number is a pairing between two such cocycles and its existence allows for the direct projection onto a basis of master integrals. In this paper we use this approach to compute the 2PM contribution to the scattering of two compact astronomical objects, getting results in agreement with previous findings.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$ polarization in very high energy heavy ion collisions as a probe of the Quark-Gluon Plasma formation and properties</title>

Abstract: We have studied the spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in heavy ion collisions at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV and $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV carried out at RHIC and LHC colliders. We have calculated the mean spin vector at local thermodynamic equilibrium, including all known first-order terms in the gradients of the thermo-hydrodynamic fields, assuming that the hadronization hypersurface has a uniform temperature. We have also included the feed-down contributions to the polarization of $\Lambda$ stemming from the decays of polarized $\Sigma^*$ and $\Sigma^0$ hyperons. The obtained results are in good agreement with the data. In general, the component of the spin vector along the global angular momentum, orthogonal to the reaction plane, shows strong sensitivity to the initial longitudinal flow velocity. Furthermore, the longitudinal component of the spin vector turns out to be very sensitive to the bulk viscosity of the plasma at the highest LHC energy. Therefore, the azimuthal dependence of spin polarization can effectively constrain the initial hydrodynamic conditions and the transport coefficients of the Quark Gluon Plasma.</description>
