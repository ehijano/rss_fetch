      <title>Vector meson production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review model calculations of exclusive vector meson production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions. We highlight differences and similarities between different dipole models and leading twist shadowing calculations. Recent color glass condensate calculations are presented with focus on effects from nuclear structure and azimuthal anisotropies driven by interference effects.</description>

      <title>Sizes of the Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidences are updated and strengthened for the two-scales picture of low-energy nucleon structure as a compact `hard' valence quark core surrounded by a `soft' cloud of quark-antiquark pairs (the meson cloud). These considerations are quantified by a spectral analysis of the mean-squared radii associated with the isoscalar and isovector electric form factors of the nucleon. Further supporting arguments come from corresponding studies of the axial and mass form factors and their inferred radii. Separating low-mass (mesonic) and high-mass (short-range) contributions in the spectral representations of each of these form factors, we conclude that a central core with an r.m.s. radius of about 1/2 fm results consistently as the common feature in all cases. Implications are discussed for baryonic matter at densities beyond that of equilibrium nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Momentum dependent nucleon-nucleon contact interactions and their effect on p-d scattering observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a complete set of relativistic nucleon-nucleon contact operators up to order $O(p^4)$ of the expansion in the soft (relative or nucleon) momentum $p$, we show that non-relativistic expansions of relativistic operators involve twenty-six independent combinations, two starting at $O(p^0)$, seven at order $O(p^2)$ and seventeen at order $O(p^4)$. This demonstrates the existence of two low-energy free constants that parameterize interactions dependent on the total momentum of the pair of nucleons $P$. The latter, through the use of a unitary transformation, can be removed in the two-nucleon fourth-order contact interaction of the Chiral Effective Field Theory, generating a three-nucleon interaction at the same order. Within a hybrid approach in which this interaction is considered together with the phenomenological potential AV18, we show that the LECs involved can be used to fit very accurate data on the polarization observables of the low-energy $p-d$ scattering, in particular the $A_y$ asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Discovering Nuclear Models from Symbolic Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous phenomenological nuclear models have been proposed to describe specific observables within different regions of the nuclear chart. However, developing a unified model that describes the complex behavior of all nuclei remains an open challenge. Here, we explore whether novel symbolic Machine Learning (ML) can rediscover traditional nuclear physics models or identify alternatives with improved simplicity, fidelity, and predictive power. To address this challenge, we developed a Multi-objective Iterated Symbolic Regression approach that handles symbolic regressions over multiple target observables, accounts for experimental uncertainties and is robust against high-dimensional problems. As a proof of principle, we applied this method to describe the nuclear binding energies and charge radii of light and medium mass nuclei. Our approach identified simple analytical relationships based on the number of protons and neutrons, providing interpretable models with precision comparable to state-of-the-art nuclear models. Additionally, we integrated this ML-discovered model with an existing complementary model to estimate the limits of nuclear stability. These results highlight the potential of symbolic ML to develop accurate nuclear models and guide our description of complex many-body problems.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty estimation and anomaly detection in chiral effective field theory studies of key nuclear electroweak processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) is a powerful tool for studying electroweak processes in nuclei. I discuss $\chi$EFT calculations of three key nuclear electroweak processes: primordial deuterium production, proton-proton fusion, and magnetic dipole excitations of $^{48}\mathrm{Ca}$. This article showcases $\chi$EFT's ability to quantify theory uncertainties at the appropriate level of rigor for addressing the different precision demands of these three processes.</description>

      <title>Emulators for scarce and noisy data: application to auxiliary field diffusion Monte Carlo for the deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The validation, verification, and uncertainty quantification of computationally expensive theoretical models of quantum many-body systems require the construction of fast and accurate emulators. In this work, we develop emulators for auxiliary field diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC), a powerful many-body method for nuclear systems. We introduce a reduced-basis method (RBM) emulator for AFDMC and study it in the simple case of the deuteron. Furthermore, we compare our RBM emulator with the recently proposed parametric matrix model (PMM) that combines elements of RBMs with machine learning. We contrast these two approaches with a traditional Gaussian Process emulator. All three emulators constructed here are based on a very limited set of 5 training points, as expected for realistic AFDMC calculations, but validated against $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ exact solutions. We find that the PMM, with emulator errors of only $\approx 0.1 \%$ and speed-up factors of $\approx 10^7$, outperforms the other two emulators when applied to AFDMC.</description>

      <title>Polarization phenomenon in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strongly interacting system created in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions behaves almost as an ideal fluid with rich patterns of the velocity field exhibiting strong vortical structure. Vorticity of the fluid, via spin-orbit coupling, leads to particle spin polarization. Due to the finite orbital momentum of the system, the polarization on average is not zero; it depends on the particle momenta reflecting the spatial variation of the local vorticity. In the last few years, this field experienced a rapid growth due to experimental discoveries of the global and local polarizations. Recent measurements triggered further development of the theoretical description of the spin dynamics and suggestions of several new mechanisms for particle polarization.
  In this review, we focus mostly on the experimental results. We compare the measurements with the existing theoretical calculations but try to keep the discussion of possible underlying physics at the qualitative level. Future measurements and how they can help to answer open theoretical questions are also discussed. We pay a special attention to the employed experimental methods, as well as to the detector effects and associated corrections to the measurements.</description>

      <title>Photoproduction of QED bound states in future electron-ion colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we perform an exploratory study of the photoproduction of singlet QED bound states $(l^-l^+)_S$ in electron - ion collisions at the EicC, EIC and LHeC energies. The total cross - sections, event rates per year and rapidity distributions associated with the parapositronium, paramuonium and paratauonium production are estimated. Moreover, we consider the decay of these states in a two - photon system and implement kinematical cuts on the rapidities and energies of the photons in the final state. We demonstrate the paramuonium can, in principle, be observed for the first time in all these colliders and that the EIC is a potential collider to discover the paratauonium state.</description>

      <title>Machine learning the deuteron: new architectures and uncertainty quantification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.12795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the ground state of the deuteron using a variational neural network ansatz for the wave function in momentum space. This ansatz provides a flexible representation of both the $S$ and the $D$ states, with relative errors in the energy which are within fractions of a percent of a full diagonalisation benchmark. We extend the previous work on this area in two directions. First, we study new architectures by adding more layers to the network and by exploring different connections between the states. Second, we provide a better estimate of the numerical uncertainty by taking into account the final oscillations at the end of the minimisation process. Overall, we find that the best performing architecture is the simple one-layer, state-independent network. Two-layer networks show indications of overfitting, in regions that are not probed by the fixed momentum basis where calculations are performed. In all cases, the error associated to the model oscillations around the real minimum is larger than the stochastic initialisation uncertainties. The conclusions that we draw can be generalised to other quantum mechanics settings.</description>

      <title>Insights into neutron star equation of state by machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to its powerful capability and high efficiency in big data analysis, machine learning has been applied in various fields. We construct a neural network platform to constrain the behaviors of the equation of state of nuclear matter with respect to the properties of nuclear matter at saturation density and the properties of neutron stars. It is found that the neural network is able to give reasonable predictions of parameter space and provide new hints into the constraints of hadron interactions. As a specific example, we take the relativistic mean field approximation in a widely accepted Walecka-type model to illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the platform. The results show that the neural network can indeed estimate the parameters of the model at a certain precision such that both the properties of nuclear matter around saturation density and global properties of neutron stars can be saturated. The optimization of the present modularly designed neural network and extension to other effective models are straightforward.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of light nuclei: Impulse approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational form factors of light nuclei are evaluated up to momenta of the order of the nucleon mass, using the impulse approximation. The nucleon gravitational form factors are reduced non-relativistically, and used to derive the gravitational form factors of light nuclei. The deuteron gravitational form factors are analysed using the Reid soft core potential. The helium-4 gravitational form factors are assessed using the K-harmonics method, and compared to those following from a mean-field approximation with a Woods-Saxon potential. The importance of removing the center of mass motion for the ensuing form factors is emphasized. The mass radii of these light nuclei are extracted and compared to their charge radii counterparts. The details of their pressure and shear distributions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Baryon density dependence of viscosities of the quark-gluon plasma at hadronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\phi$ meson and $\Omega$ baryon provide unique probes of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at hadronization in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Using the quark recombination model with the quark phase-space information parameterized in a viscous blastwave, we perform Bayesian inference of the shear and bulk viscosities of the QGP at hadronization with a temperature of $T\sim 160$ MeV by analyzing the $\phi$ and $\Omega$ data in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 19.6-200 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 2.76 TeV, corresponding to a baryon chemical potential variation from $\mu_B\approx 0$ (at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 2.76$ TeV) to $200$ MeV (at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 19.6$ GeV). We find that the shear viscosity to enthalpy ratio $\eta T/(\epsilon +P)$ of the QGP at hadronization decreases as $\mu_B$ increases, with $\eta T/(\epsilon +P)\approx 0.18$ at $\mu_B=0$ and $\eta T/(\epsilon +P)\approx 0.08$ at $\mu_B=200$ MeV, while the corresponding specific bulk viscosity is essentially constant with $\zeta T/(\epsilon + P)=0.02\sim 0.04$ for $\mu_B&lt;200$ MeV. Our results suggest that the QGP at hadronization ($T\sim 160$ MeV) with finite baryon density is more close to perfect fluid than that with zero baryon density.</description>

      <title>Quark structure of isoscalar- and isovector-scalar mesons and nuclear matter property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was found that the isoscalar-scalar and isovector-scalar mesons play significant roles in nuclear matter physics. However, the underlying structures of these resonances are not yet well understood. We construct a three-flavor baryonic extended linear sigma model including both the two- and four-quark constitutes of scalar mesons with respect to the axial transformation and study the nuclear matter properties with relativistic mean field method. The nuclear matter properties at saturation density and hadron spectrums are well reproduced with this model simultaneously and, only the two-quark component of the scalar mesons couple to baryon fields and dominates the nuclear force. A plateau-like structure is found in the symmetry energy of nuclear matter due to the multi-meson couplings, and it's crucial for understanding the neutron skin thickness of $^{208}\rm Pb$ and the tidal deformation of neutron star from GW170817. At high density regions, the vector mesons are found to be rather crucial, especially the ones coupling with four-quark configurations. This model can be easily extended to study neutron stars, even with hyperons in their interior.</description>

Abstract: In this lecture we discuss the properties of dense hadronic matter inside neutron stars. In particular, we pay attention to the role of strangeness in the core of neutron stars, by analysing the presence of baryons and mesons with strangeness. We consider two interesting possible scenarios in their interior, that is, the existence of hyperons leading to the so-called hyperon puzzle and the presence of a kaon condensed phase inside neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to define a timelike future-directed information current within relativistic first-order hydrodynamics. This constitutes the first step toward a covariantly stable and causal formulation of first-order fluctuating hydrodynamics based on thermodynamic principles. We provide several explicit examples of first-order theories with an information current, covering many physical phenomena, ranging from electric conduction to viscosity and elasticity. We use these information currents to compute the corresponding equal-time correlation functions, and we find that the physically relevant (equal-time) correlators do not depend on the choice of the hydrodynamic frame as long as the frame leads to causal and stable dynamics. In the example of chiral hydrodynamics, we find that circularly polarized shear waves have different probabilities of being excited depending on their handedness, generating net helicity in chiral fluids.</description>

      <title>A direct probe of $\Lambda$ potential in nuclear medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Li\`{e}ge intranuclear-cascade model together with the ablation model ABLA, an investigation is conducted into the effects of $\Lambda$ potential in $\Lambda$-nucleus and $\Lambda$-hypernucleus-nucleus collisions across various beam energies. The findings show that the angle and transverse-momentum distributions of scattered $\Lambda$ hyperon, the scattering cross section of the $\Lambda$ hyperon in $\Lambda$-nucleus collisions as well as the rapidity distribution of $\Lambda$ hyperon in $\Lambda$-hypernucleus-nucleus collisions are significantly influenced by the strength of the $\Lambda$ potential in these scattering reactions across various beam energies. These demonstrations, unhindered by the uncertainties of $\Lambda$ and hypernuclei productions in nuclear medium, allow for a direct investigation of the $\Lambda$ potential, especially its momentum dependence. The criticality of probing the $\Lambda$ potential is closely associated with the resolution of the "hyperon puzzle" in neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For well over half a century, precision studies of neutron and nuclear $\beta$ decays have been at the forefront of searches for exotic electroweak physics. Recent advances in nuclear ab initio theory and the widespread use of effective field theories means that its modern understanding is going through a transitional phase. This has been propelled by current tensions in the global data set leading to renewed scrutiny of its theoretical ingredients. In parallel, a host of novel techniques and methods are being investigated that are able to sidestep many traditional systematic uncertainties and require a diverse palette of skills and collaboration with material science and condensed matter physics. We highlight the current opportunities and open questions with the aim of facilitating the transition to a more modern understanding of $\beta$ decay.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relations alone cannot guarantee causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that linear superpositions of plane waves involving a single-valued, covariantly stable dispersion relation $\omega(k)$ always propagate outside the lightcone, unless $\omega(k) =a+b k$. This implies that there is no notion of causality for individual dispersion relations, since no mathematical condition on the function $\omega(k)$ (such as the front velocity or the asymptotic group velocity conditions) can serve as a sufficient condition for subluminal propagation in dispersive media. Instead, causality can only emerge from a careful cancellation that occurs when one superimposes all the excitation branches of a physical model. This is shown to happen automatically in local theories of matter that are covariantly stable. Hence, we find that the need for nonhydrodynamic modes in relativistic fluid mechanics is analogous to the need for antiparticles in relativistic quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>New method for the solution of the two-body Dirac equation: Estimation of the weights of $C$, $P$ and $CP$ symmetry violating terms in positronium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new theoretical method is developed for the solution of the two-body bound-state Dirac equation for positronium. Only Coulomb potential was included in the Dirac Hamiltonian. It is shown that the two-body Dirac Hamiltonian can be written in the Hermitian matrix form of the $4\times 4$ size and contains terms, responsible for the violation of the $P$, $C$, and $CP$ symmetries. Numerical results for the energy spectrum of the para- and ortho-positronium ground states performed within the variational method using the harmonic oscillator basis functions are in good agreement with a high-precision finite-element method of T.C. Scott et al. The weights of the $P$ and $CP$ symmetry-violating components in the para-positronium ground state are identical to the weight of the $P$ symmetry-violating component of the ortho-Ps and are estimated to be 6.6E-6. The weights of the $C$ and $CP$ symmetry-violating components of the ortho-Ps are equal to the 2/3 and 1/3 parts of this value, respectively. These numbers are less by two orders of magnitude than the precision limit of current experimental facilities.</description>
