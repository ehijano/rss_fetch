      <title>Estimated electric conductivities of thermal plasma for air-fuel combustion and oxy-fuel combustion with potassium or cesium seeding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete model for estimating the electric conductivity of combustion product gases, with added cesium (Cs) or potassium (K) vapor for ionization, is presented. Neutral carrier gases serve as the bulk fluid that carries the seed material, as well as the electrons generated by the partial thermal (equilibrium) ionization of the seed alkali metal. The model accounts for electron-neutral scattering, as well as electron-ion and electron-electron scattering. The model is tested through comparison with published data. The model is aimed at being utilized for the plasma within magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) channels, where direct power extraction from passing electrically conducting plasma gas enables electric power generation. The thermal ionization model is then used to estimate the electric conductivity of seeded combustion gases under complete combustion of three selected fuels, namely: hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), and carbon (C). For each of these three fuels, two options for the oxidizer were applied, namely: air (21 % molecular oxygen, 79 % molecular nitrogen by mole), and pure oxygen (oxy-combustion). Two types of seeds (with 1 % mole fraction, based on the composition before ionization) were also applied for each of the six combinations of (fuel-oxidizer), leading to a total of 12 different MHD plasma cases. For each of these cases, the electric conductivity was computed for a range of temperatures from 2000 K to 3000 K. The smallest estimated electric conductivity was 0.35 S/m for oxy-hydrogen combustion at 2000 K, with potassium seeding. The largest estimated electric conductivity was 180.30 S/m for oxy-carbon combustion at 3000 K, with cesium seeding. At 2000 K, replacing potassium with cesium causes a gain in the electric conductivity by a multiplicative gain factor of about 3.6 regardless of the fuel and oxidizer. This gain factor declines to between 1.77 and 2.07 at 3000 K.</description>

      <title>Flowing plasma rearrangement in the presence of static perturbing fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged particles interacting with electromagnetic waves have a portion of their energy tied up in wave-driven oscillations. When these waves are localized to the exhaust of linear magnetic confinement systems this ponderomotive effect can be utilized to enhance particle confinement. The same effect can be derived for particles moving via an $\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}$ drift into a region of a static perturbation to the electromagnetic fields which has a large wave vector component in the direction of the motion. In this work we use a simplified slab model to self-consistently solve for the electromagnetic fields within the fluid flowing plasma of a static flute-like ($k_\parallel = 0)$ perturbation, and evaluate the resulting ponderomotive potential. We find that two types of perturbations can exist within the flowing plasma, which are an O wave and an X wave in the frame moving with the fluid. In the case of tenuous plasma, these perturbations are magnetostatic or electrostatic multipole-analog perpendicular to the guiding magnetic field in the lab frame, respectfully. For denser plasmas, the O wave-like perturbation is screened at the electron skin depth scale, and the X wave-like perturbation is a combination of a similar perpendicular electric perturbation and parallel magnetic perturbation. The ponderomotive potential generated in the X wave-like case is gyrofrequency-dependent, and can be used as either potential barriers or potential wells, depending on the direction of the flow velocity.</description>

      <title>Direct optimization of neoclassical ion transport in stellarator reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We directly optimize stellarator neoclassical ion transport while holding neoclassical electron transport at a moderate level, creating a scenario favorable for impurity expulsion and retaining good ion confinement. Traditional neoclassical stellarator optimization has focused on minimizing $\epsilon_\mathrm{eff}$, the geometric factor that characterizes the amount of radial transport due to particles in the $1/\nu$ regime. Under expected reactor-relevant conditions, core electrons will be in the $1/\nu$ regime and core fuel ions will be in the $\sqrt{\nu}$ regime. Traditional optimizations thus minimize electron transport and rely on the radial electric field $\left(E_r\right)$ that develops to confine the ions. This often results in an inward-pointing $E_r$ that drives high-$Z$ impurities into the core, which may be troublesome in future reactors. In our optimizations, we increase the ratio of the thermal transport coefficients $L_{1 1}^{e}/L_{1 1}^{i}$, which previous work has shown can create an outward-pointing $E_r$. This effect is very beneficial for impurity expulsion. We obtain self-consistent density, temperature, and $E_r$ profiles at reactor-relevant conditions for optimized equilibria. These equilibria are expected to enjoy significantly improved impurity transport properties. We conclude by providing several directions of future research that may help further improve the presented optimization algorithm.</description>

      <title>Identification of highly-forbidden optical transitions in highly charged ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical clocks represent the most precise experimental devices, finding application in fields spanning from frequency metrology to fundamental physics. Recently, the first highly charged ions (HCI) based optical clock was demonstrated using Ar$^{13+}$, opening up a plethora of novel systems with advantageous atomic properties for high accuracy clocks. While numerous candidate systems have been explored theoretically, the considerable uncertainty of the clock transition frequency for most species poses experimental challenges. Here, we close this gap by exploring quantum logic-inspired experimental search techniques for sub-Hertz clock transitions in HCI confined to a linear Paul trap. These techniques encompass Rabi excitation, an optical dipole force (ODF) approach, and linear continuous sweeping (LCS) and their applicability for different types of HCI. Through our investigation, we provide tools to pave the way for the development of exceptionally precise HCI-based optical clocks.</description>

      <title>Regarding the extension of metaplectic geometrical optics to modelling evanescent waves in ray-tracing codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metaplectic geometrical optics (MGO) is a recently developed ray-tracing framework to accurately compute the wavefield behavior near a caustic (turning point or focal point), where traditional ray-tracing breaks down. However, MGO has thus far been restricted to having real-valued wavevectors. This is disadvantageous because often upon crossing a caustic from the `illuminated' region to the `shadow' region, two real-valued rays coalesce into one complex-valued ray corresponding to the transition from propagating to evanescent behavior. One can distinguish caustics as having either `illuminated shadows' or `proper shadows' -- the former corresponds to when the shadow still contains real-valued rays (albeit in a fewer quantity than in the illuminated region), while the latter corresponds to when the shadow contains no real-valued rays. Here, by means of examples, we show how MGO can be used to model both types of shadows. First, for illuminated shadows we show that MGO can actually be used `as is', provided a corrected quadrature-angle bias is used compared to that proposed in the original references. This is then implemented and demonstrated in a recently developed MGO ray-tracing code. Second, we show that for proper shadows, the MGO formalism can still be used if the symplectic rotation matrix that removes caustics along rays is allowed to be complex-valued. In both cases, strong agreement is seen between the MGO and the exact solution, demonstrating the potential of MGO for improving the predictive capability of ray-tracing codes and laying the foundations for modeling more complicated evanescent phenomena such as tunnelling with MGO.</description>
