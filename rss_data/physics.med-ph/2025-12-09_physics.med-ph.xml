      <title>Fast and Robust T1 Mapping Based on a 3D Dual-Echo UTE Sequence (PETALUTE) for SPION Biodistribution Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) such as ferumoxytol are promising theranostic agents detectable with MRI. Relaxation time mapping offers reproducible, quantitative biomarkers of SPION distribution, but conventional methods suffer from susceptibility artifacts, long echo times, and extended scan durations, limiting accurate quantification. This study developed a fast, B1-corrected T1-mapping protocol using PETALUTE, a 3D dual-echo ultrashort-echo MRI sequence with a rosette k-space trajectory and variable flip-angle acquisition for quantitative ferumoxytol imaging. Agarose phantoms containing 0-5000 ppm ferumoxytol were scanned at 7T with PETALUTE and vendor-supplied RARE-VTR. PETALUTE T1 maps were derived from two flip angles (4 deg and 20 deg), and mean R1 values were correlated with ferumoxytol concentration. For in vivo feasibility, mice bearing 4T1 mammary and flank tumors were scanned 24 h post-injection (ferumoxytol: n=2, 40 mg/kg; control: n=1). Regions of interest in muscle and tumors were analyzed to compare T1 and R1 values obtained with both methods. PETALUTE produced positive contrast for all phantom concentrations except 5000 ppm, whereas RARE-VTR did not. PETALUTE demonstrated a significant linear correlation between R1 and ferumoxytol concentration (R=0.975, p&lt;0.01), in contrast to RARE-VTR (R=0.672, p=0.144). In vivo, PETALUTE enabled high-resolution, whole-abdominal imaging in 4 min 19 s. Ferumoxytol-injected mice showed T1 shortening in flank tumors, consistent with iron uptake, and PETALUTE revealed elevated T1 value with preserved T2*-weighted signal in one mammary tumor. PETALUTE-based T1 mapping provides fast, quantitative, positive-contrast ferumoxytol imaging with greater spatial coverage and a wider usable concentration range than conventional RARE-VTR.</description>

      <title>Alterations of brain tissue structural complexity and disorder in Parkinson disease (PD): Fractal, multifractal, fractal transformation, and disorder strength analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinson disease (PD) is marked by progressive neurodegeneration, yet early and subtle structural alterations in brain tissue remain difficult to detect with conventional imaging and analytical methods. Fractal and multifractal frameworks offer a principled way to quantify complex biological architecture, but their diagnostic utility in PD has been largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the fractal and multifractal characteristics of human brain tissues to identify structural alterations associated with PD. Alongside conventional fractal and multifractal analysis, we employed a recently developed fractal functional distribution method that transforms distributions into a Gaussian form, thereby enhancing quantification. Using this combined approach, we found notable deviations across multiple distribution metrics in PD samples, offering potential for quantitative staging and diagnostic applications. The multifractal analysis revealed threshold-dependent variations in intensity-based measures, which are linked to the sparsity and heterogeneity of neural tissue and suggestive of potential biomarker value. Additionally, we applied inverse participation ratio (IPR) analysis to assess structural disorder, demonstrating that larger IPR pixel sizes correlate with increased structural complexity during disease progression. These complementary analyses outline a multi-layered quantitative profile of PD-related tissue disruption, offering a foundation for earlier, objective assessment of disease-associated microstructural change.</description>

      <title>Optimal experimental design with k-space data: application to inverse hemodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subject-specific cardiovascular models rely on parameter estimation using measurements such as 4D Flow MRI data. However, acquiring high-resolution, high-fidelity functional flow data is costly and taxing for the patient. As a result, there is growing interest in using highly undersampled MRI data to reduce acquisition time and thus the cost, while maximizing the information gain from the data. Examples of such recent work include inverse problems to estimate boundary conditions of aortic blood flow from highly undersampled k-space data. The undersampled data is selected based on a predefined sampling mask which can significantly influences the performance and the quality of the solution of the inverse problem. While there are many established sampling patterns to collect undersampled data, it remains unclear how to select the best sampling pattern for a given set of inference parameters. In this paper we propose an Optimal Experimental Design (OED) framework for MRI measurements in k-space, aiming to find optimal masks for estimating specific parameters directly from k-space. As OED is typically applied to sensor placement problems in spatial locations, this is, to our knowledge, the first time the technique is used in this context. We demonstrate that the masks optimized by employing OED consistently outperform conventional sampling patterns in terms of parameter estimation accuracy and variance, facilitating a speed-up of 10x of the acquisition time while maintaining accuracy.</description>

      <title>Alterations of brain tissue structural complexity and disorder in Alzheimer's disease (AD): Fractal, multifractal, fractal transformation, and disorder strength analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive microstructural deterioration in brain tissue, yet conventional imaging and histopathology often lack the sensitivity needed to detect subtle early-stage changes. Here, we present a multiparametric framework combining fractal and multifractal analysis and their distributions to quantify structural alterations in human brain tissue affected by AD. Moreover, from the fractal and multifractal formalism, we introduced an innovative fractal functional distribution method, a novel technique that transforms fractal distribution into a Gaussian form. Statistically, these distribution parameters are easy to interpret and can distinguish between control and diseased tissues. Across samples, we identify pronounced threshold-dependent behavior of fractal and multifractal parameters, reflecting the intrinsic sparsity and heterogeneous intensity landscape of brain tissue. These threshold-sensitive signatures provide a framework for quantitative stage detection and may serve as biomarkers for early pathological transitions. In addition, we studied structural disorder and complexity using our established light localization technique, inverse participation ratio (IPR) analysis. IPR-based analysis demonstrates that increasing IPR pixel size highlights the elevation of structural alterations with disease progression. Together, these integrative analyses establish a robust, multi-scale quantitative framework for detecting microstructural alterations in AD, providing a promising foundation for early diagnosis and improved pathological assessment.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Characterization of Brain Tissue Alterations in Brain Cancer Using Fractal, Multifractal, and IPR Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the structural alterations between healthy and diseased brain tissues using a multiparametric framework combining fractal analysis, fractal functional transformation, multifractal analysis, and the Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR) analysis. Accurate characterization of brain tissue microstructure is crucial for early detection and diagnosis of cancer. By applying box-counting methods on brightfield microscopy images, we estimated the fractal dimension (Df) and its logarithmic (ln(Df)) and functional (ln(Dtf)) forms to highlight spatial irregularities in the tissue architecture. While Df and ln(Df) exhibited long-tailed distributions distinguishing healthy from cancer tissues, ln(Dtf) provided significantly improved differentiation by emphasizing local structural variations. Additionally, multifractal analysis revealed broader f({\alpha}) vs {\alpha} curves in cancerous samples, reflecting higher heterogeneity. IPR analysis based on light localization further demonstrated increased nanoscale variations in mass density, reflecting higher structural disorder in cancer tissues. Combining these complementary approaches creates a robust framework for measuring tissue complexity and holds great potential to improve microscopic diagnostic methods for brain cancer detection.</description>

      <title>Single-cell identification with quantum-enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identification of individual cells within heterogeneous populations is essential for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Conventional labeling-based sorting methods, such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting and magnetic-activated cell sorting, enable precise sorting when reliable markers are available. However, their applicability is limited in cells lacking defined markers or sensitive to labeling, as labeling can compromise cellular viability and function. We present a single-cell identification approach using quantum-enhanced NMR with diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers for label-free detection of intracellular proton ($^1$H) signals. Using this method, we distinguish two human tumor cell lines by their proton spin-lattice ($T_1$) relaxation times, which serve as a cell-intrinsic physicochemical signature. It lays the groundwork for label-free sorting applications in rare cell analysis, personalized medicine, and single-cell diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Microfluidic gratings for X-ray Phase Contrast Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fabrication of X-ray gratings has surged in the last two decades thanks to their vast employment in X-ray Phase Contrast Imaging, an imaging technique able to boost X-ray sensitivity to detect otherwise invisible details. These high aspect ratio devices are usually fabricated by complex, costly, multi-step processes that limit their size and volume scaling. These steps commonly involve UV or X-ray lithography, semiconductor selective etching and high-Z metal plating, usually Au, which require expensive tools and materials. Here we present a proof-of-concept fabrication via soft lithography and Hg infusion of microfluidic X-ray absorption gratings and their performance in biomedical imaging. Such fabrication technique requires fewer, less expensive, and more scalable processes using alternative and more sustainable materials, while showing comparable visibility with their conventional Au-based, solid equivalent. Our results constitute a promising shift in X-ray optics fabrication that could significantly lower barriers to commercialization and accelerate the practical deployment of X-ray Phase Contrast Imaging.</description>

      <title>Anatomical basis of sex differences in the electrocardiogram identified by three-dimensional torso-heart imaging reconstruction pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13976v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is used for diagnosis and risk stratification in myocardial infarction (MI). Women have a higher incidence of missed MI diagnosis and complications following infarction, and to address this we aim to provide quantitative information on sex-differences in ECG and torso-ventricular anatomical features and their interdependence. A novel computational automated pipeline is presented enabling the three-dimensional reconstruction of torso-ventricular anatomies for 425 post-MI subjects and 1051 healthy controls from UK Biobank clinical images. Regression models were created relating torso-ventricular and ECG parameters. We found that female hearts were positioned more posteriorly and superiorly than male, and in MI hearts were oriented more horizontally, especially for women. Post-MI women exhibited less QRS prolongation, requiring 27% more prolongation than men to exceed 120ms. Only half of the sex difference in QRS duration was associated with smaller female cavities. Lower STj amplitude in women was striking, associated with smaller ventricles, but also more superior and posterior cardiac position. Post-MI, T wave amplitude and R axis deviations were more strongly associated with posterior and horizontal cardiac positioning in women than in men. Our study highlights the need to quantify sex differences in anatomical features, their implications in ECG interpretation, and the application of clinical ECG thresholds in post-MI.</description>

      <title>Structural Stress as a Predictor of the Rate and Spatial Location of Aortic Growth in Uncomplicated Type B Aortic Dissection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of aortic expansion in uncomplicated type B aortic dissection (TBAD) can help identify patients who may benefit from timely thoracic endovascular aortic repair. This study investigates associations between biomechanical predictors derived from reduced-order fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis and aortic growth outcomes. Baseline and follow-up CT images from 30 patients with uncomplicated TBAD were obtained. For each patient, a reduced-order FSI analysis using the forward penalty stress computation method was performed on the baseline geometry. Aortic growth was quantified by registering baseline and follow-up surfaces using nonrigid registration. Mixed-effects linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to assess relationships between structural stress, wall shear stress (WSS), pressure and growth rate while accounting for inter-patient variability. Group comparison analyses were performed to evaluate spatial distributions of these biomechanical variables along the dissected aorta between patient groups categorized by optimal medical therapy (OMT) and aortic growth outcomes. Linear regression revealed a positive association between structural stress and aortic growth rate (p = 0.0003) and a negative association for WSS (p = 0.0227). Logistic regression yielded area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.7414, 0.5953, 0.4991, and 0.6845 for structural stress, WSS, pressure, and aortic diameter, respectively. Group comparisons showed significant regional differences in structural stress, but not in diameter, WSS, or pressure, between groups defined by aortic growth and OMT outcomes. These results indicate that structural stress is a promising predictor of both the rate and location of aortic growth in uncomplicated TBAD, which supports its use in risk stratification models to identify patients at higher risk of TBAD progression.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning Based Super-Resolution Functional Ultrasound Imaging of Transient Brain-Wide Neurovascular Activity on a Microscopic Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transient brain-wide neuroimaging on a microscopic scale is pivotal for brain research, yet current modalities face challenges in meeting such spatiotemporal requirements. Functional ultrasound (fUS) enables transient neurovascular imaging through red blood cell backscattering, but suffers from diffraction-limited spatial resolution. We hypothesize that deep learning-based super-resolution reconstruction can break through this limitation, introducing super-resolution functional ultrasound (SR-fUS) which leverages ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) data to achieve super-resolution reconstruction of red blood cell dynamics. By incorporating red blood cell radial fluctuations with uncertainty-driven loss, SR-fUS enables mapping ultrasound Doppler frames to super-resolution blood flow images, achieving 25-{\mu}m spatial and 0.2-s temporal resolution. SR-fUS was applied to image transient hemodynamic responses induced by pain stimulation in rat brains. SR-fUS accuracy in cortical microvasculature during whisker stimulation was further validated by a comparative study with two-photon microscopy.</description>
