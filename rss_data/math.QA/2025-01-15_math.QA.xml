      <title>Soft symmetries of topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</description>

      <title>Infinite-level Fock spaces, crystal bases, and tensor product of extremal weight modules of type $A_{+\infty}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the category $\mathcal{C}$ generated by extremal weight modules over $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_{&gt;0})$. We show that $\mathcal{C}$ is a tensor category, and give an explicit description of the socle filtration of tensor product of any two extremal weight modules. This follows from the study of Fock space $\mathcal{F}^\infty \otimes \mathcal{M}$ of infinite level, which has commuting actions of a parabolic $q$-boson algebra and $U_p(\mathfrak{gl}_{&gt;0})$ with $p=-q^{-1}$. It contains a (semisimple) limit of the fermionic Fock space $\mathcal{F}^n$ of level $n$, which has a $q$-analogue of Howe duality often called level-rank duality. To describe the socle filtration of $\mathcal{F}^\infty \otimes \mathcal{M}$, we introduce the notion of a saturated crystal valuation, whose existence was observed for example in the embedding of an extremal weight module into a tensor product of fundamental weight modules of affine type due to Kashiwara and Beck-Nakajima.</description>

      <title>Categorical quantum symmetries and ribbon tensor 2-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a companion work on the combinatorial quantization of 4d 2-Chern-Simons theory, the author has constructed the Hopf category of quantum 2-gauge transformations $\tilde{\mathcal{C}}=\mathbb{U}_q\frak G$ acting on the discrete 2-holonomy configurations on a lattice. Guided by the 2-tangle hypothesis of Baez-Langford, we prove in this article that the 2-$\mathsf{Hilb}$-enriched 2-representation 2-category $\operatorname{2Rep}(\mathbb{U}_q\mathfrak{G};\tilde R)$ of finite semisimple $\mathbb{C}$-linear $\mathbb{U}_q\frak G$-module categories is braided, planar-pivotal, rigid and dagger, hence $\operatorname{2Rep}(\mathbb{U}_q\mathfrak{G};\tilde R)$ provides an example of a {\it ribbon tensor 2-category}. We explicitly construct the ribbon balancing functors, and show that it is compatible with the rigid dagger structures. This allows one to refine the various notions of {\it framing} in a 2-category with duals that have been previously studied in the literature. Framed 2-tangles can then be decorated by 2-representations of categorical quantum groups with a ribbon 2-functor into $\operatorname{2Rep}(\mathbb{U}_q\mathfrak{G};\tilde R)$, completely analogous to the construction of decorated ribbon graphs in the Reshetikhin-Turaev construction. We will also prove that, in the classical limit $q=(q_\mathrm{h},q_\mathrm{v})\rightarrow 1$, the 2-category $\operatorname{2Rep}(\mathbb{U}_{q=1}\mathfrak{G};\text{id}\otimes\text{\id})$ become pivotal in the sense of Douglas-Reutter.</description>

      <title>Higher condensation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified mathematical theory of defect condensations for topological orders in all dimensions based on higher categories, higher algebras and higher representations. A k-codimensional topological defect $A$ in an n+1D (potentially anomalous) topological order $C^{n+1}$ is condensable if it is equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_k$-algebra. Condensing such a defect $A$ amounts to a k-step process. In the first step, we condense the defect $A$ along one of its transversal directions, thus obtaining a (k-1)-codimensional defect $\Sigma A$, which is naturally equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_{k-1}$-algebra. In the second step, we condense the defect $\Sigma A$ in one of the remaining transversal directions, thus obtaining a (k-2)-codimensional defect $\Sigma^2 A$, so on and so forth. In the k-th step, we condense the 1-codimensional defect $\Sigma^{k-1}A$ along the only transversal direction, thus defining a phase transition from $C^{n+1}$ to a new n+1D topological order $D^{n+1}$. We give precise mathematical descriptions of each step in above process, including the precise mathematical characterization of the condensed phase $D^{n+1}$. When $C^{n+1}$ is anomaly-free, the same phase transition can be alternatively defined by replacing the last two steps by a single step of condensing the $E_2$-algebra $\Sigma^{k-2}A$ directly along the remaining two transversal directions. When n=2, this modified last step is precisely a usual anyon condensation in a 2+1D topological order. We derive many new mathematical results physically along the way. Some of them will be proved in a mathematical companion of this paper. We also briefly discuss questions, generalizations and applications that naturally arise from our theory, including higher Morita theory, a theory of integrals and the condensations of liquid-like gapless defects in topological orders.</description>

      <title>Tetrahedron Instantons on Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a homomorphism $\tau$ from a suitable finite group $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ to $\mathsf{SU}(4)$ with image $\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$, we construct a cohomological gauge theory on a noncommutative resolution of the quotient singularity $\mathbb{C}^4/\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$ whose BRST fixed points are $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-invariant tetrahedron instantons on a generally non-effective orbifold. The partition function computes the expectation values of complex codimension one defect operators in rank $r$ cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory on a flat gerbe over the quotient stack $[\mathbb{C}^4/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau]$. We describe the generalized ADHM parametrization of the tetrahedron instanton moduli space, and evaluate the orbifold partition functions through virtual torus localization. If $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is an abelian group the partition function is expressed as a combinatorial series over arrays of $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-coloured plane partitions, while if $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is non-abelian the partition function localizes onto a sum over torus-invariant connected components of the moduli space labelled by lower-dimensional partitions. When $\mathsf{\Gamma}=\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a finite abelian subgroup of $\mathsf{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, we exhibit the reduction of Donaldson-Thomas theory on the toric Calabi-Yau four-orbifold $\mathbb{C}^2/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}\times\mathbb{C}^2$ to the cohomological field theory of tetrahedron instantons, from which we express the partition function as a closed infinite product formula. We also use the crepant resolution correpondence to derive a closed formula for the partition function on any polyhedral singularity.</description>
