      <title>On the ordinary and symbolic powers of fiber products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We completely determine the depth and regularity of symbolic powers of the fiber product of two homogeneous ideals in disjoint sets of variables, given knowledge of the symbolic powers of each factor. Generalizing previous joint work with Vu, we provide exact, characteristic-independent formulas for the depth and regularity of ordinary powers of such fiber products.</description>

      <title>Stability of annihilators of cohomology and closed subsets defined by Jacobian ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative Noetherian ring of dimension $d$. In this paper, we first show that some power of the cohomology annihilator annihilates the $(d+1)$-th Ext modules for all finitely generated modules when either $R$ admits a dualizing complex or $R$ is local. Next, we study the Jacobian ideal of affine algebras over a field and equicharacteristic complete local rings, and characterize the equidimensionality of the ring in terms of the singular locus and the closed subsets defined by the cohomology annihilator and the Jacobian ideal.</description>

      <title>On factorisations of Left dead ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Losing a game is difficult. Recent work of Larsson, Nowakowski, and Santos, as well as that of Siegel, has opened up enticing lines of research into partizan mis\`ere theory. The algebraic structure of mis\`ere monoids is not yet well understood. A natural object to study is a universe of games, which is a set of games satisfying various closure properties. We prove that a universe is determined by its Left ends, thus motivating a study of such games, which was also noted by Siegel for dead ending universes in particular. We initiate this study by investigating the atomic structure of the monoid of Left dead ends, showing that it is reduced, pocancellative, and an FF-monoid. We give sharp bounds on the lengths of factorisations, and also build tools to find atoms. Some results require the introduction of a new concept called flexibility, which is a measure of the distance from a game to integers. We also discover large families of games admitting unique factorisations; this includes the uncovering of a prime element: $\overline{1}$.</description>

      <title>Perfectoid pure singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fix a prime number $p$. Inspired by the notion of $F$-pure or $F$-split singularities, we study the condition that a Noetherian ring with $p$ in its Jacobson radical is pure inside some perfectoid (classical) ring, a condition we call \emph{perfectoid pure}. We also study a related a priori weaker condition which asks that $R$ is pure in its absolute perfectoidization, a condition we call \emph{lim-perfectoid pure}. We show that both these notions coincide when $R$ is LCI. Mixed characteristic analogs of $F$-injective and Du Bois singularities are also explored. We study these notions of singularity, proving that they are weakly normal and that they are Du Bois after inverting $p$. We also explore the behavior of perfectoid singularities under finite covers and their relation to log canonical singularities. Finally, we prove an inversion of adjunction result in the LCI setting, and use it to prove that many common examples are perfectoid pure.</description>

      <title>SAT Solving Using XOR-OR-AND Normal Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the XOR-OR-AND normal form (XNF) for logical formulas. It is a generalization of the well-known Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) where literals are replaced by XORs of literals. As a first theoretic result, we show that every CNF formula is equisatisfiable to a formula in 2-XNF, i.e., a formula in XNF where each clause involves at most two XORs of literals. Subsequently, we present an algorithm which converts Boolean polynomials efficiently from their Algebraic Normal Form (ANF) to formulas in 2-XNF. Experiments with the cipher ASCON-128 show that cryptographic problems, which by design are based strongly on XOR-operations, can be represented using far fewer variables and clauses in 2-XNF than in CNF. In order to take advantage of this compact representation, new SAT solvers based on input formulas in 2-XNF need to be designed. By taking inspiration from graph-based 2-CNF SAT solving, we devise a new DPLL-based SAT solver for formulas in 2-XNF. Among others, we present advanced pre- and in-processing techniques. Finally, we give timings for random 2-XNF instances and instances related to key recovery attacks on round reduced ASCON-128, where our solver outperforms state-of-the-art alternative solving approaches.</description>

      <title>Approximation properties of torsion classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We strengthen a result of Bagaria and Magidor~\cite{MR3152715} about the relationship between large cardinals and torsion classes of abelian groups, and prove that (1) the \emph{Maximum Deconstructibility} principle introduced in \cite{Cox_MaxDecon} requires large cardinals; it sits, implication-wise, between Vop\v{e}nka's Principle and the existence of an $\omega_1$-strongly compact cardinal. (2) While deconstructibility of a class of modules always implies the precovering property by \cite{MR2822215}, the concepts are (consistently) non-equivalent, even for classes of abelian groups closed under extensions, homomorphic images, and colimits.</description>
