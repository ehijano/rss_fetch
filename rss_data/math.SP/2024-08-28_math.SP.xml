      <title>The restricted discrete Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the restriction of the discrete Fourier transform $F_N : L^2(\mathbb{Z}/N \mathbb{Z}) \to L^2(\mathbb{Z}/N \mathbb{Z})$ to the space $\mathcal C_a$ of functions with support on the discrete interval $[-a,a]$, whose transforms are supported inside the same interval. A periodically tridiagonal matrix $J$ on $L^2(\mathbb{Z}/N \mathbb{Z})$ is constructed having the three properties that it commutes with $F_N$, has eigenspaces of dimensions 1 and 2 only, and the span of its eigenspaces of dimension 1 is precisely $\mathcal C_a$. The simple eigenspaces of $J$ provide an orthonormal eigenbasis of the restriction of $F_N$ to $\mathcal C_a$. The dimension 2 eigenspaces of $J$ have canonical basis elements supported on $[-a,a]$ and its complement. These bases give an interpolation formula for reconstructing $f(x)\in L^2(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})$ from the values of $f(x)$ and $\widehat f(x)$ on $[-a,a]$, i.e., an explicit Fourier uniqueness pair interpolation formula. The coefficients of the interpolation formula are expressed in terms of theta functions. Lastly, we construct an explicit basis of $\mathcal C_a$ having extremal support and leverage it to obtain explicit formulas for eigenfunctions of $F_N$ in $C_a$ when $\dim \mathcal C_a \leq 4$.</description>

      <title>Accuracy Controlled Schemes for the Eigenvalue Problem of the Radiative Transfer Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The criticality problem in nuclear engineering asks for the principal eigen-pair of a Boltzmann operator describing neutron transport in a reactor core. Being able to reliably design, and control such reactors requires assessing these quantities within quantifiable accuracy tolerances. In this paper we propose a paradigm that deviates from the common practice of approximately solving the corresponding spectral problem with a fixed, presumably sufficiently fine discretization. Instead, the present approach is based on first contriving iterative schemes, formulated in function space, that are shown to converge at a quantitative rate without assuming any a priori excess regularity properties, and that exploit only properties of the optical parameters in the underlying radiative transfer model. We develop the analytical and numerical tools for approximately realizing each iteration step withing judiciously chosen accuracy tolerances, verified by a posteriori estimates, so as to still warrant quantifiable convergence to the exact eigen-pair. This is carried out in full first for a Newton scheme. Since this is only locally convergent we analyze in addition the convergence of a power iteration in function space to produce sufficiently accurate initial guesses. Here we have to deal with intrinsic difficulties posed by compact but unsymmetric operators preventing standard arguments used in the finite dimensional case. Our main point is that we can avoid any condition on an initial guess to be already in a small neighborhood of the exact solution. We close with a discussion of remaining intrinsic obstructions to a certifiable numerical implementation, mainly related to not knowing the gap between the principal eigenvalue and the next smaller one in modulus.</description>

      <title>Beyond directed hypergraphs: heterogeneous hypergraphs and spectral centralities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of hypergraphs has received a lot of attention over the past few years, however up until recently there has been no interest in systems where higher order interactions are not undirected. In this article we introduce the notion of heterogeneous hypergraphs from an algebraic point of view, which have traditional directed hypergraphs as a particular case. We furthermore analytically study the spectral centralities associated to some types of heterogeneous hypergraphs, extending previously defined eigenvector-like centrality measures to this new realm. We supplement the analytical arguments with some numerical comparisons of pairwise and higher order rankings, and we construct directed higher order networks from real data.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Spectral Clustering on Quantum and Analog Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel hybrid quantum-analog algorithm to perform graph clustering that exploits connections between the evolution of dynamical systems on graphs and the underlying graph spectra. This approach constitutes a new class of algorithms that combine emerging quantum and analog platforms to accelerate computations. Our hybrid algorithm is equivalent to spectral clustering and has a computational complexity of $O(N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the graph, compared to $O(N^3)$ scaling on classical computing platforms. The proposed method employs the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) framework on the data generated by Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics that evolves on the manifold induced by the graph Laplacian. In particular, we prove and demonstrate that one can extract the eigenvalues and scaled eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian by evolving Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics on quantum computers followed by DMD computations on analog devices.</description>
