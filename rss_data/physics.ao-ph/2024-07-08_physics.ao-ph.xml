      <title>Dynamics of inertial particles on the ocean surface with unrestricted reserve buoyancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to present an enhancement to a Maxey-Riley theory proposed in recent years for the dynamics of inertial particles on the ocean surface. This model upgrade removes constraints on the reserve buoyancy, defined as the fraction of the particle volume above the ocean surface. The refinement results in an equation that correctly describes both the neutrally buoyant and fully buoyant particle scenarios.</description>

      <title>What if? Numerical weather prediction at the crossroads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an outlook on the future of operational weather prediction given the recent evolution in science, computing and machine learning. In many parts, this evolution strongly deviates from the strategy operational centres have formulated only several years ago. New opportunities in digital technology have greatly accelerated progress, and the full integration of computational science in numerical weather prediction centres is common knowledge now. Within the last few years, a vast machine learning research community has emerged for creating new and tailor-made products, accelerating processing and - most of all - creating emulators for the entire production of global forecasts that outperform traditional systems. In this context, the role of both numerical models and observations is changing from being equation to data driven. Analyses and reanalyses are becoming the new currency for training machine learning, and operational centres are in a powerful position as they generate these datasets based on decades worth of experience. This environment creates incredible opportunities to progress much faster than in the past but also uncertainties about what the strategic implications on defining cost-effective and sustainable research and operations are, and how to achieve sufficient high-performance computing and data handling capacities. It will take individual national public services a while to understand what to focus on and how to coordinate their substantial investments in staff and infrastructure at institutional, national and international level. This paper addresses this new situation operational weather prediction finds itself in through formulating the most likely "what if?" scenarios for the near future and provides an outline for how weather centres could adapt.</description>

      <title>High-Frequency Radar observation of strong and contrasted currents: the Alderney race paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Alderney Race has been identified as a future site for the development of tidal energy, due to its bidirectional strong current reaching 5 m/s during spring tides. This hydrodynamics is very difficult to measure by in situ or remote sensing means. High-frequency coastal radars can provide a synoptic and near-real-time view of such a complex circulation, but the classical processing algorithms are not adapted to the extreme situation of strongly sheared currents. We propose an improved high-resolution direction-finding technique for the azimuthal processing of such radar data. It uses phased-array systems and combines the advantages of the usual beam-forming technique to eliminate many problems related to the distortion of Doppler spectra by extreme currents. The method is evaluated with a unique data set of radar measurements at two radar frequencies (13 and 24.5 MHz) and three spatial resolutions (200, 750, and 1500 m). The radar-based surface currents are analyzed in the light of a high-resolution numerical model and also compared with in situ measurements. While high azimuthal resolution can be achieved in this way, it is shown that the typical range resolutions of 750 and 1500 m are insufficient to account for the strong spatial variations of the surface current at some specific times and locations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Heatwave Intensification over the Indian Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a warming world, heatwaves over India have become intense and are causing severe health impacts. Studies have identified the presence of amplified Rossby waves and their association with the intensification of heatwaves. Earlier studies have identified two dominant modes of temperature variability in India and their possible role in the development of dry (mode 1) and moist (mode 2) heatwaves. These modes are associated with midlatitude Rossby waves intruding over the Indian region. However the role of regional forcing and the teleconnection behind the intensification of the heatwaves over India is missing. The present study has analyzed the dynamical mechanisms for the regional intensification of the circulation features associated with the dominant moist heatwave mode (mode 2). Considering the predominant barotropic nature of the observed circulation features of the mode, a simple barotropic vorticity equation model forced with extratropical and regional vorticity sources is used to understand the intensification of the heat waves. It was found that a wave response initiated by a cyclonic vorticity over the Bay of Bengal superimposes with the mid-latitude anticyclonic vorticity generated Rossby waves intruding over India. This superimposition results in the amplification and persistence of the anticyclonic vorticity phase over the Northwest Indian region, leading to the intensification of circulation. It was also found that the barotropically forced intensified circulation leads to the intensification of the heat stress. Under a climate change scenario, different circulation regimes, characterized by zonal stationary wave number and jet speed, which can favor the intensification are also identified.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Approach utilizing Multiband Satellite Data for Solar Irradiance Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar irradiance is fundamental data crucial for analyses related to weather and climate. High-precision estimation models are necessary to create areal data for solar irradiance. In this study, we developed a novel estimation model by utilizing machine learning and multiband data from meteorological satellite observations. Particularly under clear-sky and thin clouds, satellite observations can be influenced by surface reflections, which may lead to overfitting to ground observations. To make the model applicable at any location, we constructed the model incorporating prior information such as radiative transfer models and clear-sky probability, based on physical and meteorological knowledge. As a result, the estimation accuracy significantly improved at validation sites.</description>

      <title>Impact of an Ensemble of Ocean Data Assimilations in ECMWF's next generation ocean reanalysis system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An Ensemble of Data Assimilations (EDA) can provide valuable information on the analysis and short-range forecast uncertainties. The present ECMWF operational ocean analysis and reanalysis system, called ORAS5, produces an ensemble but does not exploit it for the specification of the background-error covariance matrix $\mathbf{B}$, a key component of the data assimilation system. In this article, we describe EDA developments for the ocean, which take advantage of the short-range forecast ensemble for specifying, in two distinct ways, parameters of a covariance model representation of $\mathbf{B}$. First, we generate a climatological ensemble over an extended period to produce seasonally varying climatological estimates of background-error variances and horizontal correlation length-scales. Second, on each assimilation cycle, we diagnose flow-dependent variances from the ensemble and blend them with the climatological estimates to form hybrid variances. We also use the ensemble to diagnose flow-dependent vertical correlation length-scales. We demonstrate for the Argo-rich period that this new, hybrid formulation of $\mathbf{B}$ results in a significant reduction of background errors compared to the parameterized formulation of $\mathbf{B}$ used in ORAS5. The new ocean EDA system will be employed in ORAS6, ECMWF's next generation ocean reanalysis system.</description>

      <title>A Method for Calculating Attenuation in Creeping Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase lag between an applied forcing and a response to that forcing is a fundamen tal parameter in geophysical signal processing. For solid deforming materials, the phase lag between an oscillatory applied stress and the resulting strain response encapsulates information about the dynamical behavior of materials and attenuation. The phase lag is not directly measured and must be extracted through multiple steps by carefully comparing two time-series signals. The extracted value of the phase lag is highly sensitive to the analysis method, and often there are no comparable values to increase confidence in the calculated results. In this study, we propose a method for extracting the phase lag between two signals when either one or both include an underlying nonlinear trend, which is very common when measuring attenuation in creeping materials. We demonstrate the robustness of the method by analyzing artificial signals with known phases and quantifying their absolute and relative errors. We apply the method to two experimental datasets and compare our results with those of previous studies</description>

      <title>Sampling Hybrid Climate Simulation at Scale to Reliably Improve Machine Learning Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) parameterizations of subgrid processes (here of turbulence, convection, and radiation) may one day replace conventional parameterizations by emulating high-resolution physics without the cost of explicit simulation. However, their development has been stymied by uncertainty surrounding whether or not improved offline performance translates to improved online performance (i.e., when coupled to a large-scale general circulation model (GCM)). A key barrier has been the limited sampling of the online effects of the ML design decisions and tuning due to the complexity of performing large ensembles of hybrid physics-ML climate simulations. Our work examines the coupled behavior of full-physics ML parameterizations using large ensembles of hybrid simulations, totalling 2,970 in our case. With extensive sampling, we statistically confirm that lowering offline error lowers online error (given certain constraints). However, we also reveal that decisions decreasing online error, like removing dropout, can trade off against hybrid model stability and vice versa. Nevertheless, we are able to identify design decisions that yield unambiguous improvements to offline and online performance, namely incorporating memory and training on multiple climates. We also find that converting moisture input from specific to relative humidity enhances online stability and that using a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss breaks the aforementioned offline/online error relationship. By enabling rapid online experimentation at scale, we empirically answer previously unresolved questions regarding subgrid ML parameterization design.</description>

      <title>FuXi-S2S: A machine learning model that outperforms conventional global subseasonal forecast models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skillful subseasonal forecasts are crucial for various sectors of society but pose a grand scientific challenge. Recently, machine learning based weather forecasting models outperform the most successful numerical weather predictions generated by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), but have not yet surpassed conventional models at subseasonal timescales. This paper introduces FuXi Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (FuXi-S2S), a machine learning model that provides global daily mean forecasts up to 42 days, encompassing five upper-air atmospheric variables at 13 pressure levels and 11 surface variables. FuXi-S2S, trained on 72 years of daily statistics from ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis data, outperforms the ECMWF's state-of-the-art Subseasonal-to-Seasonal model in ensemble mean and ensemble forecasts for total precipitation and outgoing longwave radiation, notably enhancing global precipitation forecast. The improved performance of FuXi-S2S can be primarily attributed to its superior capability to capture forecast uncertainty and accurately predict the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), extending the skillful MJO prediction from 30 days to 36 days. Moreover, FuXi-S2S not only captures realistic teleconnections associated with the MJO, but also emerges as a valuable tool for discovering precursor signals, offering researchers insights and potentially establishing a new paradigm in Earth system science research.</description>

      <title>Influence of temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity on the stability of atmospheric stratified fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of atmospheric stratified fluids is revisited to study the influence of the temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity due to thermal expansion in the Earth's lower atmosphere (with heights $0$ to $50$ km) under the action of gravity. Previous theory in the literature [Phys. Lett. A 480 (2023) 128990] is modified and advanced. It is found that the Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency associated with internal gravity waves is modified, leading to new instability conditions of vertically stratified fluids. The possibility of the onset of Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convective instability is also discussed, and the influences of the modified Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency and the density and temperature gradients on the instability growth rates are studied.</description>

      <title>Earth ECS Upper Limit using Modified Energy Budget Methods and Trend Analyses v.3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth global and regional effective thermal "conductance" G(eff) (in (W/m^2)/C and often labeled lambda in climate research) and the related Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) are evaluated by applying a modified version of the Energy Budget method, and using data only after 1970. By removing Periodic Interfering temperature components (using a novel PIR process) and applying high frequency filtering, an extraordinarily near linear temperature response is revealed, enhancing accurate G(eff) calculation and avoiding the pre-1970 aerosol forcing and ocean energy per area (E*) absorption uncertainties. A formal/empirical method is used to determine more reliable values of Q(t)=d[E*(Ocean.energy)]/dt . Using NOAA data, and after PIR, it is shown that: 1) The Energy Budget Method can be realistically applied to the Ocean and Land regions independently, 2) the effective volcanic forcing is &lt;= 1/5 the IPCC AR5 estimate, 3) the "historical" 1980-2020 ECS(eff) values for Global, global Ocean, and global Land regions values are &lt;= 2.16, 1.69, 2.96 C/2xCO2 respectively; where the updated IPCC AR5 orthodox independent global Forcing value of 0.4 (W/m^2)/Decade and F/2xCO2= 3.7 W/m^2 were used. Uncertainty is about 10%. The Global average ECS(true) value of &lt;= 2.10 C is 70% of the IPCC AR6 ECS estimate of 3.0 C, but 127% of the ECS(eff) value reported by Lewis (1.66 C). The estimated oceans average TCR/ECS ratio = 0.71 and the global average TCR/ECS ratio = 0.83, and ECS(land)/ECS(Ocean) = 1.78 . [Results using HADCRUT temperature data instead are similar, but 6% "cooler" over land, and 8% "warmer" over oceans.] A simplified physically realistic formal/empirical Coarse 2-D Global Climate Model is derived wherein variation of Geff(t) until equilibrium (i.e. "pattern effects") are proven to be negligible or "cooling", using these Methods. And so it is likely ECS(true)&lt;= ECS(eff).</description>

      <title>FuXi-ENS: A machine learning model for medium-range ensemble weather forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensemble forecasting is crucial for improving weather predictions, especially for forecasts of extreme events. Constructing an ensemble prediction system (EPS) based on conventional NWP models is highly computationally expensive. ML models have emerged as valuable tools for deterministic weather forecasts, providing forecasts with significantly reduced computational requirements and even surpassing the forecast performance of traditional NWP models. However, challenges arise when applying ML models to ensemble forecasting. Recent ML models, such as GenCast and SEEDS model, rely on the ERA5 EDA or operational NWP ensemble members for forecast generation. Their spatial resolution is also considered too coarse for many applications. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FuXi-ENS, an advanced ML model designed to deliver 6-hourly global ensemble weather forecasts up to 15 days. This model runs at a significantly increased spatial resolution of 0.25\textdegree, incorporating 5 atmospheric variables at 13 pressure levels, along with 13 surface variables. By leveraging the inherent probabilistic nature of Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), FuXi-ENS optimizes a loss function that combines the CRPS and the KL divergence between the predicted and target distribution, facilitating the incorporation of flow-dependent perturbations in both initial conditions and forecast. This innovative approach makes FuXi-ENS an advancement over the traditional ones that use L1 loss combined with the KL loss in standard VAE models for ensemble weather forecasting. Results demonstrate that FuXi-ENS outperforms ensemble forecasts from the ECMWF, a world leading NWP model, in the CRPS of 98.1% of 360 variable and forecast lead time combinations. This achievement underscores the potential of the FuXi-ENS model to enhance ensemble weather forecasts, offering a promising direction for further development in this field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the turbulent energy spectrum of weakly interacting 2D internal gravity waves without relying on the hydrostatic approximation. This spectrum is an exact solution of the kinetic equation after the shear modes are removed, and it agrees with the oceanic Garrett-Munk spectrum for frequencies large compared to the Coriolis frequency and vertical scales small compared to the depth of the ocean. Among a continuous family of solutions to the kinetic equation, we show that the turbulent solution is the special solution with non zero angular dependent radial flux. Our solution provides an interesting insight of how turbulent energy cascade proceeds in anisotropic systems - similarly to isotropic turbulence it is self-similar in scale, but its angular part is peaked along the curve of vanishing frequency.</description>

      <title>Latent Diffusion Model for Generating Ensembles of Climate Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Obtaining accurate estimates of uncertainty in climate scenarios often requires generating large ensembles of high-resolution climate simulations, a computationally expensive and memory intensive process. To address this challenge, we train a novel generative deep learning approach on extensive sets of climate simulations. The model consists of two components: a variational autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model that generates multiple ensemble members. We validate our model on the Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble and show that it achieves good agreement with the original ensemble in terms of variability. By leveraging the latent space representation, our model can rapidly generate large ensembles on-the-fly with minimal memory requirements, which can significantly improve the efficiency of uncertainty quantification in climate simulations.</description>
